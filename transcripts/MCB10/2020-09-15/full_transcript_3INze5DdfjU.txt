So, mr rivers, I want to welcome you and thank you for joining us this evening and wanted to turn the floor over to you just so. You can kind of fill the committee in as well as our other board members and attendees hi good evening. First and foremost, I'd like to thank community board 10 and a community board ken's arts and culture committee through your chairperson. He was very instrumental in making hollow week virtue this year. I'm the executive witness of harlem week, and this is our 46th year producing harlem weekend. For the very first time we had to go virtual and virtue meant that we had to bring in a lot of new players to get virtual materials through your cheer george herrera. He was very instrumental in getting mary j blige, charlie wilson, jodeci leticia, anthony hamilton. All of these artists graciously gave us content that we could post on our virtual harlem week this year. We also had from another person who lives in district and community board. 10 dougie fresh had a very intimate conversation with stevie, wonder that was again a very special because stevie talked about his his first experience with the apollo theater at 12 years of age and to have that kind of information come out from stevie wonder to connect harlem the apollo theater community board. 10 right in your catchment area, I think, is just another testament to the important role that you guys play. We also did something that I want to again. Thank you chairman for, because not only was he generous with coordinating us getting certain artists for harlem week, but he also said our sister community board is community board nine, and perhaps you should have conversations with them and through that relationship we were able to showcase two very fine artists from community board nine so that they could also be a part of what we were doing this year we celebrated harlem week with a with a few new things. We celebrated the 100th anniversary of the honorable person sutton, another resident of community board 10 honorable charlie rangel, another resident of community board 10. and the list just goes on and on harlem. We traditionally we are for the last several years for the whole month of august. We do a hundred and ten plus events. Harlem virtue was actually eight days of activities. Normally, we attract the media impression in the range of about 400 million people who look at what we're doing locally nationally this year. For the virtual platform we reached over 3 billion people around the world. One of the things that we also did is we normally would have the holland, the percy sutton harlem 5k, run through harlem one run through central harlem, where we would have about six to seven thousand runners running through harlem this year, because it was a virtue for percy, sudden run and walk. We had the same number of 6 000 people registered, but we had representatives from 48 states and 105 countries all participating so again. Something that we're very proud of is that central harlem plays a major role in all of our activity. Our goal was to highlight the arts and culture coming out of this community and we were able to bring in the downtown community to partner with the uptown. So as an example, we had dance theater of harlem participating with the alvin ailey dance company, meaning we showcased both dance companies. When we look at jazz, we had jazz mobile and we had jazz at lincoln center. We also had wynton marcellus, give a special shout out to harlem and the apollo theater in particular, celebrating the 200th anniversary of abyssinian baptist church in harlem. It was those kind of special moments that we're so proud of, and again, oh and let just. Lastly, let me just say that we've extended select activities of halloween through the 20th of september. So, if any of you missed harlem week, I would like to see some of the things that we say that were special. You can go to harlemweek.com and look up a number of activities. Paula music festival will also stay up through the end of I mean through september 20th and again, just in closing. I just want to thank all of you guys for the continued partnership. The hall of arts alliance, which I am the chairman of, we are partnering with new heritage. Theater group. We are also getting ready for november to do an international day of celebration of the different cultures internationally, so we will be having a virtual festival, one day, festival with artists from japan, artists from cuber artists from south africa, artists from johannesburg, I'm sorry, artists from zimbabwe and also artists from harlem all. We are solidifying the date in november, but it will be very special and I would like to invite again the arts and culture committee to be a part of that presentation to give you more visibility in terms of some of the bigger activities that we're doing. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Mr rivers. Incredible work with harlem week, and I think you know it's incredible. I guess you know during Covid-19 to see the type of engagement and the incredible work. You're doing continue and again. I'd just like to echo your sentiments of our chairman, george harrell, has been super supportive of the community and, I know, has been very supportive of harlem week, and so we are just happy to have him lead us and just thankful george to you for all the work you are doing in our community to lift uplift arts and culture here in harlem, mr rivers, that we definitely would love to partner with you on the virtual festival in november. So please keep us posted on the date. I will do that and you know let us know how we can support whether it's spreading the word using our social media channels. We are happy to really be a partner to you in any way that we can. Thank you and I'm glad that you're on the call with us today, because our next item of the agenda is really brainstorming for 2020, the remainder of 2020 and into 2021., and so I would like to open the floor to everyone in attendance tonight. Just to hear from you all about what types of engagement, what type of engagement you want to see, the arts and culture and the community board 10 as a whole, really have with the community and with the arts community over the next few months and into the early part of the year. I know we all recognize that Covid-19 19 is a challenge, but I have been excited to see so much creativity from the arts community and being able to use these virtual mediums and platforms to continue to highlight harlem and just diverse communities as a whole in new york city. So I'm gonna open the floor up and you know feel free to unmute yourselves and just share ideas that you have. I will I'm taking minutes and I'll be taking notes, but I'd just like us to have a conversation as we try to plan out our calendar for this year and early next year, just to hear directly from folks hi jericho, it's marie moss! I oh can you hear me. I can hear you now, okay, so I was on a few calls over the summer with harlem one. Stop yuen chin is the executive director of harlem one stop and there is a consortium of arts organizations that have been on the call with her. Regarding the harlem renaissance, as you know, it's a centennial for the harlem renaissance, which began in 1919 or really officially kicked off in 1920, so they're planning some things I feel like it would be very advantageous for the arts and culture committee to have them come on and discuss. You know some of the things that they're already planning that we might also be able to partner with and be able to provide insight or promotion or any kind of support to for those efforts. It's a major part of harlem history and it's something that is a sense of pride of black excellence from langston hughes to zora, nil, hurston. The list goes on and on. We can be proud of the legacy that harlem has and the fact that organizations in our community are planning in that regard. Thank you. Mari. That's a great suggestion I'll make sure that george and I connect with you offline so that we can reach out to harlem one stop and give them a proper invitation to our next meeting. Any other thoughts, yep there's something so I have a friend who has a company who, basically she does she's, been doing this since before kovid she does virtual museum tours, so she actually provides the like the special glasses and all that stuff for school age. Children and her focus has been on. You know. Some of these under-resourced areas across the country have don't have access to go on these great field trips, even to like washington right to see the obama portraits and things like that, so she films all of these different museums around the country and then has that content and gives it over to schools, and all of that, so that got me thinking about. I don't know if there's a way to do that with harlem museums, obviously the one like schomburg and city studio museum that are here in harlem, but even one just like right outside our district, like the jazz museum of harlem, or I don't know any other museum city museum of new york right on 125th. I think so. There could be a way that we partner with some of those museums and if they have existing programs or infrastructure in place to be able to have students, still participate and engage in the museum happenings without physically being there because of Covid-19. That could be something interesting that we explore maybe around black history month too right when there's something like that roots us into the actual museum piece. I love that idea again. We should we should chat offline about the best way to execute and can you know, can george and I tap you to work on that with us. I have a relationship with the met as well and they've been doing some virtual showing so that might be one of the museums that we can we can fold into, but it might be helpful for us to maybe put together if either we're being able to share the content ourselves or have a calendar that we can share. Also that kind of highlights month by month. We know there tend to be different groups and constituency groups that are featured. You mentioned black history month being one of them, I'm sure we have women's month coming up. There's I just think they're. I think it's right for us to be able to kind of drill down on who's. Doing what and you know have it kind of in line with what ever space we may be in from month to month. I think that's a great idea, awesome! Okay! I have a quick I'll go ahead. George sorry, I think that I'm very excited right now to hear the input from the team and each of you guys. I would love for y'all to be the lead person on it and we would assist in bringing added value to your ideas, and I have a couple of relationships that I can add to that awesome yeah and I just wanted to add to you what was being said about the museums. I think I was wondering do we know what the schedule is for the studio museum of harlem construction? Do we know what the time frame is when that will be opened up at all? We met with them earlier, I believe, was it in the? Was it this time last year, george, or was it at the top of it was around this time last year, and so we met with them. They did talk to us about their construction calendar. I think it would make sense for george and I to check back in with them, because you know with construction. Sometimes it's the moving target to get a better sense of you know when it's expected to be completed, but we can also get an update from them about what they've been doing during this time to see, if there's other things that we can share through the arts and culture committee- hey jericho, this is cecily, so they are coming to the land use meeting to give an update on thursday. So, if anyone's interested in hearing where they are, they we haven't got, they haven't reinstated the community advisory board yet, but they are still looking to do that. We don't have a rep for cb10 right now because say two was our rep and, as you all know, he moved to l.a. So we will probably put someone else in that spot when it opens up, but for a quick update, they'll, be there thursday at land use great well I'll, be at the land use meeting on thursday as well. So, okay notes for our committee as well. Thank you, sicily. I have a comment yeah. I think that the museum tour would be it's great for kids, but it also would be great for seniors, because a lot of us are still sitting at home and we do have you know, computers and stuff like that. So I think that would be great to have some type of virtual something with the museums for seniors. A lot of the senior centers are looking for additional programs for the seniors, because the centers are closed. So any additional thing we can show because a lot of seniors you know we're still isolated in place at home. So any type of programming you know would be a plus and it'll, be something great. You know for seniors for us. Thank you thanks debra. I think that makes a lot of sense and we need to make sure we're engaging the entire community. So as we pull together content we'll make sure that you and tiffany connect, so that you can make sure and go through the content we're getting from the different museums to see what might be interest for of interest that we can pitch to the seniors yeah. Can I jump in for a second deborah? I would love to talk with you offline all right. We would love to talk with you offline to come up with something creative, because I know how involved you are with the seniors and we might come up with something new and interesting, so I would definitely love it because I know how involved you are, and we've done amazing work in the past. Okay ready! Thank you. Thank you. Hello greetings, hi, yes, roosevelt taylor with the next-gen arts and culture chairman just a quick proposal, I'm listening! All the ideas are wonderful. I'm thinking a community night out a call for all artists here in harlem, possibly for social distancing, maybe like a block party, something closer to the end of september, early October, due to the weather, still being kind of decent a call and show off all of the different styles of artists that we have here in harlem and actually highlight them and bring awareness. You know to these artists that are not on the map or not being promoted, but are working very hard and diligently trying to get their art. You know noticed within the community. I think it would help to put art in harlem back on the map and you know just make it more accessible to the kids who don't actually get to see it. Thank you. Roosevelt has next gen been working on anything similar to that already that we could maybe partner with you on yes. As of right now we have just started with the planning we're going to start with a few gallery. Exhibits we've partnered up with bill's place where the late great was discovered, billie holiday, so we're gonna do a themed event there based off of jazz photos to kind of kick it off. You know we're going to do like a jazz tribute along with you know, different instruments, different musicians, singers. You know things like that to first start and bring awareness to what we're trying to do within the community to generate partnerships with a lot of different entities here in harlem that want to get involved. That's great, would you mind sharing your contact information in the chat you can either send it to everyone or exactly? Yes. I sure will and also I understand about the seniors situation. I also own an art company here in harlem. We actually created a curriculum that is actually something that could be used for young kids and also seniors adults doesn't quite matter their age. There are things from intermediate level, drawing all the way to the highest level. Oil painting, the start of graphic design, fashion, illustration lettering, anything that a person could possibly want to spend their time on. It's a 17 module program that I created. You know it's just something you know especially dealing with the seniors is something that can actually keep their brain functioning and eye. Coordination is the main thing as you get older, so you know with the techniques from the program you know it could actually help. You know a lot with that. Okay sounds good. Thank you. I love your ideas. Is it possible that you can maybe sell us a one sheet on the individual projects that you want to work on with us? Oh sure, no problem. Thank you crystal. I think muted, we crystal we hear you, it's a little go ahead crystal your sound is going in and out crystal your sound is going in and out do you want to try? Are you able it may be the headphones? Are you able to lose the headphones crystal fresco? Yeah crystal I'm sorry, we are not hearing you clearly and we want to make sure that we do. Did we just lose crystal. I think we may have lost krista, we'll see if she logs back in does anybody else, have any thoughts or ideas for engagement this year, jericho. I just wanted to make a reminder that we will be working on the holiday lights project again this year, so we should have a think tank and reference to that. Okay, I know we have our our chair on and our district director shatik our sicily. Do you do we have a date for the holiday lights or is there any information that you can just share with the group on logistics hi? This is sisley, so no, we don't have a date. So I'll circle back with barbara just said to get those details. I just know that there is going to be one. She hasn't really released any like specific things, but I do want to invite you at least jerica and george to the next conversation and then you'll be able to bring back information to the committee, great thanks, cecily and then george, depending on how that conversation goes, we may also consider asking barbara to come to our meeting as well great idea. All folks can hear directly from her. I have one more thing: anybody have if any of us have any artists that would like to be a part of the program, the international program that rosa was talking about. Please let us know a hundred percent george. How do we get on those content? Should we just email, you, the people that would like to be involved in that sure all right we'll do please email me and jericho? Please! Okay, excuse me, george, could you put your email in the chat so that I could reach out? I put all my information inside her chat, telephone number and email as well sure. Thank you thanks roosevelt. This is jerica I'll drop in my info as well. Thank you so much any other thoughts from folks. Last but not least, I would definitely like to have a conversation with crystal as well to see what the libraries are doing. That might be an opportunity as well. I think that's great crystal, I see you're back on. I know you were having some audio issues earlier. You know we have you can if you want to try using the chat box if or try your audio again, if that doesn't work, maybe dropping what you wanted to communicate to folks in the chat box, because we don't want to miss out on any of your ideas. What's going on with the african-american day parade as well guys. Is there any information on that? I know it's virtual this year, but what else is going on around that? I have been reaching out to them for a period of time to not really get any response. You know that's something I would definitely love to be involved with, but they only have a phone and nobody's ever picked up the phone. I believe everybody else has some input that they could share. Please, let me know george, this is sicily. I believe, of course, it's the 20th it's next sunday on the parade is when I did reach out well. First of all, I don't think we received any information about it. This year we usually do, and I asked I think, if we received anything in the mail about it, so I think, by the time we saw it like randomly on facebook or saw yasmine comment about it was too late to register for it, but it is this sunday right. So I don't know it is virtual. They, if you go to their facebook page, they have the ways you can watch it there, but we are not a part of it. We didn't receive the information in a timely fashion, so we could participate. I think it would be great to have some preliminary conversations for next year. Yeah we did. We have a good connection with, but with our board member deneen brown blackman and usually you know she's over the breakfast. They didn't have the breakfast this year, so I think there was kind of maybe a little break down there in communication that we normally would have had so, but we definitely will circle back with mean and make sure that we are, you know, get a little bit more information for next year. Thank you so much, madam chair, yeah yusuf is really usually very communicative, so I that's interesting, but okay, hopefully we'll get ahead of it next year. Any oh chanel has chanel go ahead. I see you have your hand raised hello good evening. Everyone I just wanted to ask. Is there any way we can possibly do something that focuses on teaching artists about the legal aspects and the financial aspects of art and how to be compensated properly for their art? We have a lot of art. I'm sorry for my background, because you know I live in the 40s, where things is crazy, so you're going to hear music so excuse that, however, is there any way we can add. It doesn't have to happen like no time but before June. If we can have something that focuses on teaching folks, you know where to go copyrights, trademarks. You know these type of things. I know that hall of martial language used to do stuff. Like that, you know I could have a conversation with boza and see if he got any kind of leads on it, but I think it's an amazing idea and if you have any input or find out anything, please let us know as well. Excuse me: okay, you need a one-pager right. Yes, hello, hi, yes, roosevelt the information of that chanel. I think that was chanel. The funny thing my program has the beginning steps to that for the artist to help them to understand how to set up a price guide dealing with whatever type of art, they're selling or sculptures. It has links to read about copyright trademark company. You know llc things like that. You know the program I created I created like five years ago, so you know I've just been shopping and trying to get it in, but I would definitely love to break it up if we could break it up and utilize it within harlem. At all costs, that would be great roosevelt. Thank you for offering that chanel. Is it possible for you and roosevelt to connect on this? I know george is going to reach out to voza to see what resources he may have, but I think it's a great idea. Would you have the capacity to take the lead on? You know at least brainstorming and coming up with a proposal for that type of event. Yes, ma'am great and you mentioned June chanel. Is there something? Is there something happening in June? Why do you think or before June? Is there because we'll we're in session till June, so we have from now to June where we're actually meeting so I probably around, I would say, definitely after the holidays, so we can get an idea of you know where things are going. Okay, that's helpful, we'll know where we are yeah. I can still send a one pager yeah. That would be great awesome. Any other ideas, thoughts, chair, harrell, we're approaching 7 15. did you have any parting words or any marching orders for the rest of us on this call or all the folks on this call? No, I'm good. Thank you. Do you want to join the meeting or, yes, anybody else have anything else before we adjourn well. The meeting is adjourned. Thank you guys for your participation. Great. Thank you. Everyone. Thank you. Bye.
