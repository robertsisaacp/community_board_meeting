So if you guys can fill that out and should take if you can make sure that you can send the e- blast to the community, when we do rectify that technical problem that we have not, that will be great so that they'll have an option to fill it out. Also, I am looking to have public committee members. That is an option that we have. I have to basically talk it over with the chair in terms of how that will happen and who gets chosen to be public committee members. So I have not hashed that out with her yet so, if you can just fill out the forms, though so we the information, so we can figure out how that can happen. Tonight we have presentations on the agenda. We have small business services presenting first I'm, not sure if they are on the call yet should teeth. Are they on a call? President? Okay? So if you can just please present your agenda or the agenda that this community will be able to utilize, it is to my understanding that many are filling out applications for loans and they are being denied. So if you can just give a brief presentation on how folks can you know get access to some resources? Okay, sure you want to start now. Yes, oh okay, so good evening, everyone thank you for inviting me to your committee, Economic Development, Committee meeting. My name is Eric Walker and I am an outreach liaison with the department of small business services. I belong to the out each team, we're responsible for promoting and helping small businesses to start operating grow in the city of New York. Since the onset of the Corona Covid-19 outbreak, we've been working remotely to help small businesses, access loans, grants and other services that they are needing in order to help them survive this pandemic. We know that businesses that have been having some issues with the round 1 and round 2 of the PPP program administered by the SBA. Just to make a clarification. We are SBS, not SBA were a city agency, not a federal agency, but we were helping to promote the SBA PPP and the economic injury disaster loan programs. We do know that a lot of communities were not getting access to those loans and, of course, second round came out of the PPP loan program. Still, there were many small businesses that were not able to access those funds. As of late Dafoe, New York loan program funding program is has launched as well, which is a state- administered program, and one of the criteria is that those businesses would be eligible who did not receive any other loan assistance. That would be the SBA or the SBS program that we had at the beginning of the onset. We have folks in our satellite centers the NYC business solution centers, who are offering technical assistance. One of the issues were finding small businesses are facing is accessing and navigating the application itself I'm, not sure why your constituents were being denied at this point, but technical assistance is available to small T. Last Friday we launched a hotline and SBS hotline to offer assistance to businesses in need of technical support. That number is eight seven. Twenty seven, four, six, nine two eight SBS for NYC I'll add that phone number into the chat. If assistance, my team has been hosting daily webinars on Eventbrite for businesses that were impacted by Corbett 19, there's a wealth of information. That's out there. A lot of it is on the foot on a first-. Come first- served basis. We also have compliance advisors that are helping small businesses sort of navigate the regulatory process as well. We have a commercial lease assistance for businesses who, having issues with their landlords, so any kinds of assistance that small businesses are in need of our es is providing that Club to the best of our ability, as we are still providing that service remotely. Most of you know and back anyone knows, but this time that we have a new commissioner, Jarnell doris, and he has a five- point plan to sort of help. Each community in the city of New York he's each community has their own specific issues and challenges, and so and his goal is to help identify those specific challenges in each community and really kind of get to the heart of what the matter is and to provide assistance to those small businesses. I will make my information available to your constituents if they're having issues I'm, not sure, specifically, why they will being denied, but we can certainly check each case on a case- by- case basis to find out exactly why they did not receive assistance. Aside from the emergency loan programs that became available post Kovac 19, we also have ongoing partnerships with the micro lenders. My Clemente is throughout NYC business solution, centers, who can offer small businesses financing assistance, those that may not meet the general criteria who may know who may have not having credit rating in order to secure a loan? How micro lenders can certainly help them in those areas? So, specifically, if you have customers who are having issues or challenges with their business, they can certainly reach out to us. They can reach out to me and I can refer them to the right source where they can get assistance. Tomorrow, we are hosting a phase. One business reopening workshop, we're going to have six different regulatory agencies onboard with us talking about just specific guidelines for businesses, safety guidelines, as well as best practices to preventing the spread of coronavirus. Again, you can get that on our then fight page I'll share the link to Eventbrite and you can register and tune in to that event, which is taking place tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. at this time. I'll take any specific questions you may have, because it's just a wealth of information out there and there are multiple points of contact to reaching one of our folks. You can reach them throughout outreach team. You can reach us through our one 888 number NYC for help or you can reach us through the NRC business solutions, financing assistance. So, depending on what the small businesses issue is or challenges, we can certainly make the proper referrals for them at the time Thank You, Mr. Parker. Is it possible that you can send over an email with just like a blurb of that information that you just love provided and if folks, who are on the call, if you can just send a private email to the district manager, Mr. Mitchell, so that he'll be able to get that information over to you guys, and he can put you on our mailing list if you're not on the mailing lists. So I'm now going to first ask board members if they have questions that they would like to ask Mr. Parker I, have a question are Mr. Parker being that arm? New York City is now in phase one, our small businesses, who did not receive all PPP loans eligible for the to get all relief loan through the state's program that they just started. Yes, exactly in fact, that's one of the eligibility criteria that they did not receive any prior financing assistance through the SBA or any of the other loan programs that were out there, so that would leave that kind of leaves out the options, a little more open for those who did not receive funds. The first time around anyone else, Nadine Pinkett here I had a question for Mr. Parker as I understand it. There were a few visit revisions made to the PPP in regards to forgiveness. Would you be able to go over a few of the provisions that were made? I know a little bit about the revisions, but I'm going to refer you to our hotline. Now folks have these specific details, but what I do know is that they've extended the period from eight weeks to 24 weeks and I believe the threshold of forgiveness for using it for payroll is drop down from seventy five to sixty percent. Does it sort of the broad strokes of what I know any more detail than that I'd specifically do not have details on it through our hotline they can give more detail information on how to apply those new the new criteria. Under the PPP loan program, there has been an extension and I believe they load the threshold to forgiveness for the for using the funds for payroll Miss pink. It is that, are you? Are you good? Yes, thank you. Anyone else, okay, so I'm now going to open the floor up to public members to ask questions to Mr. Parker, you I just called the link I, just posted the link for Eventbrite, where you can find all the online trainings. You know lots of small businesses were not prepared to transition to this online platform, so we do have trainings for businesses that are not on online services and E- Commerce. So we do provide support services to help visitors make that transition they so choose. Tim. Okay, I want to thank you very much Mr. Parker for coming to give us that update. It is definitely appreciated. I just wanted to make sure that we got you guys here, so that people can hear from you guys. What is that exactly happening? So thank you very much. I want to move on to our open data. Miss tasty Gartner from Department of I, believe it is intelligence and technology. I'm, not sure I, just found out from Shafiq that she was not from open data and she was from another department. No do it deals with open data? Okay got you! So is she on Nicole? Yes, hi welcome, Stacy Donna. Are you ready, I'll? Let you know[ Applause] 12. Also, not only do they eat if these have to put up data, but they have to keep doing it as they use more data, so they are adding or more and more all the time it's 2800 yeah. They ask they mean a data set which a spreadsheet of information or a table or a man. So each city agency is responsible for identifying they're, also required to every submitted inventory of the assets on the damn I'm getting public. So the tests that we take on this kind of shepherding one that you were to go for compliance plan, that's due every September, so you have someone at each agency and make a lot of automated routines that spreadsheet every time. There's, for example, there is a data set from here in one that's refreshed automatically every 24 hours, I need to imagine, there's a ton of service so at high demand and there's a lot of on the technology side. Thank you. So much miss Turner I'm, just going to say that one yes I do believe we are interested and, if possible, maybe we can put something together as a committee and send it over to you with those requests in regards to what type of data we are actually looking for. That would be great I'm. Also. We are interested in having that webinar or training scheduled to happen. I can just take the information and will pretty much disseminate it to the community so that they can attend so I just wanted to say that I am interested, I and I hope that the rest of the committee is interested in that. So first I'm going to open the floor to board members to ask you questions. Okay, so we're going to move along the agenda. The next person is from the neighborhood Advisory Board Mr. Ian, Griffith she's, the chair of that board and I have invited her to give a presentation on what this board is, what the board does and what is actually coming up in the near future some opportunities and also how to apply for the court so miss Griffith. Is she on the call? Yes I'm here, Thank You, Madame, chair, hello, everyone good afternoon to the board members and community members. My name is Lorraine Rufus and I'd. Had a dy see the neighborhood advisory board for Manhattan's him, so I just want to share quickly what the neighbourhood Advisory board is it's a it's a board made up of appointees by elected officials and public members through D by C D. We assist the city. We assist dy CD with allocating funding to community- based organizations. There are 41 neighbourhood advisory boards throughout the city and they're, primarily in there in title one and funded community. The community service, Block Grant title one funding communities, there's 41 throughout the city. How can we apply for it come out put it in a chat. How one is a public? Anyone can apply, so I'll put it in a chat afterwards, so the city do I see. The name of the variety board is very crucial. It plays a very crucial role in building our community community- based organizations. They have the opportunity to apply for funding through New York, City Department of Youth and Community Development. They have to fit a criteria. They have to meet the criteria. They have to be a 501 C 3. They have to have received funding from the city for the last five years. They will have to apply through the New York City Health and Human Services the system HHS. They will have to submit an RFP and they will- and they have to have already have available a hundred thousand already to put up because Dy CD actually does a reimburse me, and they were far too they will have to follow through the deliverables. Scuse me on the RFP, which comes out every three year so this year, we're in the process of it right now. It's supposed to be slated for the end of June, but as pandemic has taken over at the forefront, things of the dates are pushed back. The neighborhood of our seaboard Manhattan ten is right. Now we have allocated four hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars. Four hundred fifty seven hundred and fifty three thousand dollars to community- based organizations in Harlem, based on the community needs assessment. So every three years the Nav members go into the community and ask the community directly. What is it that you need, whether its financial literacy, small business, small business information, how to start a small business health of holding nutrition after school programs? So through that, through the data from that we arrived at the number of four hundred and fifty seven thousand hundred and fifty three thousand dollars, and we allocated one hundred and fifty seven thousand seven hundred and thirty- five dollars to healthy families, which include, which includes housing, eviction, prevention, so right now I'm a hat and legal services on 125Th Street. They provide free pro bono assistance in housing court to prevent them housing eviction. We also that what also falls in that category, food and nutrition, child care and head and Head Start we be allocated a hundred thousand to after- school programs right now. Ymca is a recipient of the neighborhood variety board. Funding Children's Aid Society PA. Oh, there are some of the recipients of the neighborhood Varzi board. So let me just go back and just say that DYC the funds they do a lot of different funding, but this particular funding that were that we're speaking about is the funding that comes to the neighborhoods report and we allocated a hundred thousand assistants with starting small businesses and a hundred thousand for financial literacy and again, this is all based on the community needs assessment, and these numbers are fairly low in comparison to other communities around the city and I will say it starts from the census. We are sto direct recipients of the community service, Block Grants, which is federally funded through the census data. So I encourage you all to go to my 2020 Census Gov and complete the census, Dyc D. As you know, they fund Summer, Youth, Employment, Program SYEP, which you know is now put on hold, and that is part of the DOI CDs. That's part of the main budget that they receive, so that's taken until Dy CD is taking a bit with that and then right and I encourage you that when we're doing these community needs assessment that the community really participates. When you see the table I know, you probably can't see my t- shirt but I have on my t- shirt. Today we were throughout the city was throughout the district, from one temp to the back of Charlie Rangel houses, and it was very hard to get response from the community. So we can better assist the community on the needs we have to hear from the community. So when you see you know, dy cd- rising for tables, please do not walk past them when they do it. When we're doing surveys, we're surveying in the community to hear directly from the community. What is needed so I just wanted to add that, because it was very hard for us to get the community's input for us to adequately allocate in these specific groups. I believe that is it and again the pushback for the RFP is pushed back because of the pandemic. So we're not sure when that's going to start Madam, Chair and I would like to say that Madam Chair is the fight she's. The former vice chair of the name of the Weiser board and the vice chair, Jennifer Prince, is also a member as well as Mari Ma, so I just want to say thank you to them because they have been. They have played a role and making sure that Harlem community based organizations is getting the elephant funding for based on our needs in the community and I will leave it at that. Thank you so much. Thank you. Miss Griffith, okay, so I just want to say thank you for that information. A lot of people do not know about that opportunity and that's the opportunity to apply for those grants and the opportunity to actually sit on that board. So, thank you very much, I'm going to open the floor for any board members to ask her any questions. Okay, I'm going to now open the floor for any public community members to ax her any questions. Okay, thank you very much. Miss Griffith for that presentation. We're going to move on to the next item on the agenda that is Harlem advocates for seniors is Mr. Hema on the call hello is Mr. Hema on the call. I'm sorry did I go out okay, so if Mr. Hamer is not on the call, it is 708. So just so you guys know, 7 p.m. will be the designated time slot for elected officials and elected official representatives, so I do see Nina Saxon from the New York City comptroller's office here. So if she can just give a brief update from the comptroller's office in terms of what's going on with the economic development and technology and communications at the moment, hello, everyone I will be brief. Hope everyone is doing well. Thank you, Madam Chair, really quickly. I just want to let everyone know that the New York City controller is very involved with mwbes and making sure that, through this pandemic, that all mwbes has a fair share and has the opportunities to do business with the city. So we are doing. We just started up again. Our MWBE University workshops with different dates and I will put in the chat our actual flier and how folks in Harlem can get involved. You are having any problems, any problem with registering for MWBE University workshops, please in email me or call me I, will in the check of my email address and my telephone number and that is it Madam chair. Thank you so much. Thank you. So much miss Saxon is any other elected official representatives on the call at this time. Lamont Mays is here good evening, Mr. Mays. So thank you. Thank you. Yes. I would like to thank you for helping us before you present. Thank you for helping us get some agencies. We really appreciate it. So, on behalf of New York State Assembly Member, Inez Dickens, we are happy to say that we have concluded our legislative session for the 2020 season. We closed out the day before yesterday, very successfully by finally repealing 50- a which is a state code that protected state employees, particularly law enforcement officers and their professional record, which made it very difficult for defendants or any other agencies to be able to go back in a record of certain individuals within law enforcement to find out what their professionalism is. If any, and now that has been repealed were able to inquire more about the type of officers that are on law enforcement and with that being a case, I know that a lot of people in our and in our community will be looking to have their records clear or be able to defend themselves more adequately as they go into court. Regarding particular situations, particularly in this, in the light of what we're having what we're dealing with right now, many areas of economic development I'm proud to say that the E assembly member was able to get past legislative number a three to four to which provides that proceedings to review real property assessments in New, York City, especially with their assesing method and capitalization rate, must be disclosed. It's been very difficult for a number of property owners to be able to get a proper assessment in terms of how their property is assessed. So now that information should be made public, we're looking to get more support on the Senate side in order to secure a passage and then hopefully have that on the governor's desk sometime this summer. Another one that she was able to get passed was a 8 to 8:5, which relates to the disclosure of certain employment statistics of state assisted construction projects. We know that it's very difficult for many people in our community who have construction backgrounds to be able to get to secure employment on many of the construction projects within our community and within the city and state in general. So now we're hoping to have more enforcement powers on the state side to be able to get some of the employment statistics of so many people who actually work on many of these projects, particularly when there was agreement between the construction project managers and developers and a community and securing a number of local hires. So we're hoping to get that also on the governor's desk sometime this upcoming summer and hopefully have that in place as we're looking to have the city reopen particularly now that construction projects are starting to reopen now and we're hoping to get that sooner rather than later. Anyone has any questions about the past legislative session, particularly in regards to either economic development or technology. We're always happy to answer any questions. Anyone may have I do I. Have some questions are in terms of Haarlem? Are we going to be seeing more like facilities that allow young people to experiment outside of their biology, chemistry and physics requirements in school? Is there some way like how we were able to get if we can sort of like get some sort of technology facilities that they can come and pretty much experiment I'm glad you brought that up tomorrow evening or we are looking to have a web forum with Department of Education, and those are some of the questions that were brought up, particularly from many of the parents who have shared with us that there is no access or opportunities for their kids in regards to education or science and technology or development skills, and we're hoping to have a partnership with Department of Education and some of their nonprofit organizations that go into many of these schools and actually engage with our students with science and technology and we're hoping to have a greater discussion in terms of how that may be access this upcoming summer. Although we know that the city is looking to provide more opportunities in terms of some of youth, there are a lot of parents who are looking for greater opportunities in terms of Education. So that's definitely one of the subject matters that it will be coming up, so we're looking at find out from the Department of Education and their partners, how that can be accessed by our community residents, and is that something that we can? Possibly, as we see, we continue to see the development in our community happen. If these community spaces can be allocated to those purposes to allow for growth in that area, I would say so. A number of nonprofits in our community have great access to resources and space and I think it's a matter of just being able to connect the dots with which nonprofits or other entities in our community might have the available space and resources and connecting our young people with those resources. One of the things that tends to bother us sometimes is no matter the number of different programs. We support it's a matter of getting people into those doors, so I think the more we promote these organizations and these programs I think we can get more people to connect to a type of talents and resources that this community actually provides. I mean we do in this community thanks to a lot of community partners thanks the Community Board in terms of maintaining a listing of many of them open dialogue with many of them that were able to provide some assistance, many of our residents, so it's just a matter of us being, but to connect the dots between which groups have which programs and getting them in touch with the parents and students who need them. Thank you. So much is there any board members that have any questions for Mr. Mane's? Yes, this is Maureen walls. How are you doing there mind's eye Mary? How are you long time mostly hear from you? Yes, my question is in regards to the legislation that was passed concerning the construction. How is that able to be? Is there any kind of consideration to look into how that might be able to be connected to MWBE opportunities? Well, that's one of the things that were looking at. It was a partnership between her and a number of different MWBE employment agencies who are involved in construction who may end up is sitting down together with the Assemblymember to try to kind of to construct what the language would sound like and which agencies would be responsible in terms of enforcing it. So we're hoping greatly that, with some more communication with our senior part with our Senate partners and the governor that we can finalize how that would actually look in terms of physical and enforcement ability, we're glad that we're seeing a lot of push toward getting this legislation done so I think it's just a matter of time before it actually is finalized and then the discussion of what it would look like in terms of enforcement and ensuring that many people in our community get to work in the construction field is something that was a conversation. We're really looking forward to having okay looking forward to seeing that come to fruition. Well, thank you. Anyone else, I'm on the board, have a question. Yeah I have a question. Is there any Robin? First I'd like to know, maybe in my novel, so many moments position on this and just general inquiry? Is there any discussion regarding all commercial and stabilization in Albany, cuz I see it's going to be a big problem for businesses who are coming back now in terms of a lot of them over and they're, going to be there facing eviction from their spot or they're not having their leases renewed and we've already had an issue with all my making Siri in New York City in general, in terms of more commercial spaces and I can only think that this defendant will exacerbate the situation when the assembly member was in City was in the City Council there's actually a bill that was introduced to possibly reinstate you know. Commercial rent stabilization, but it was, and became apparent as the state government would need to arm would not need to intervene to get something like that done. I'm glad you asked that question the assembly member is a big supporter of our small businesses and she has been holding a number of different webinars and zoom conferences with many of our small businesses and nonprofits, who are also facing the same situation. We understand that me that, in the beginning of this crisis, the coulvet crisis that there was some preference given to small businesses in regards to their rent payments, but many landlords are expecting payment in full for those who did receive such benefits. The other issue to that is because of the Covid-19 crisis. New York State has had a significant shortfall in regards to funding. So if there's going to be any funding, it's any particular program that supports our small businesses, any financial support it will be mill and most so that's going to be an ongoing conversation with Boethius with both the legislature, the governor's office, in terms of how small businesses will be supported, we're looking to find out how that can actually be framework and regards to the other financial obligations that the state has particularly regards to housing, particularly in guards to transportation and many other qualities. As well and more importantly, health, so we're not sure what that financial burden would be to either the state or the city in terms of supporting small business, but they need the help. Absolutely so we're just trying to find out where this conversations going to go. It'll be ongoing. Although session is over discussion that will be moving forward from this day on so we'll be finding out over the summer and will hopefully be reporting back to your committee soon in terms of what programs might be available if any that might be developed. Thank you. Any other board members I'm going to open up the floor to community members with questions. Okay, so we're going to move on. Thank you very much Mr. Maze for stopping by thank you, miss Saxon, for stopping by our meetings to give updates. Is there any other elected official representatives on the call? Okay? Thank you. So is Mr. Hamer on the call yet actually Chenault can give a brief update from the mayor's office. Yes, good evening, everybody not really much to report I. Think SPS did a great job talking about the city's recent economic initiatives. All I wanted to highlight was that this week is phase one of reopening and just for clarity. The four sectors that were allowed to reopen this week for phase one are wholesale construction, retail, curbside retail as well as wholesale. So there's been a lot of confusion around the curbside retail. Thank you again, SPS for mentioning the program that does allow small businesses to build their e- commerce, because we have seen that our small businesses have been disproportionately affected by this, and last thing is social distancing is still in effect. The current limit is gatherings of 10 people or more are not allowed. The agencies are still enforcing the rule. Those agencies, including the Sheriff's Office parks, may you may have seen parks enforcement going around parks, feeling out, face, masks and just educating folks in social distancing. So that's all that I have to report for now. Thank you very much. Isaiah has also helped was getting agencies. He helped us get SBS and open data to the meeting. So thank you very much for helping us with that, and thank you for your presentation. We look forward to continuing to work with you guys. There are a lot of agencies that we're trying to get to come and present so that we know that they are there so that the community knows that they're there and those resources are available. So thank you very much for that. Does anyone have any questions for Isaiah either on the board or off the board? Okay. Thank you very much. So is Mr. Hamer on the call cuz there's no more like. Is there any other representatives I just figured out how to scroll this thing down. I do not see anyone else, okay, so we can move on and the agenda is Mr. Hamer on the call from Harlem advocates for seniors. Okay is Mr. Watson from Jamaican and seafood plumbing and heating. On a call. Okay, we're going to move on to Verizon. It's Verizon just took a Vanya Davis on the call. Yes, thank you, okay, thank you very much for attending. Is there any way you can give a brief presentation? I, preferably want to hear about what is this 5 g business about? But if you can just give an update about how communication will be operating, internet service is an issue in our district, especially now in a Colvin. A lot of students may not have access to Internet and trying to do remote work from home. Some people may have may not have had access to internet at home and only at work. So if you can just give us some sort of information about how you guys are dealing with that issue and trying to help alleviate some of those burdens and the Colvin definitely thank you. So my name is Stefani Davis and I work handle community affairs for New York City Region, happy to report that you know throughout this more than three- month period with the koban response that you know. Verizon's networks have maintained reliability levels happy to address any individual questions. You have I'm in particular with having students being connected. A lot of that ended up going through the Department of Education and the sense of getting students connected with tablets. But if there's any particular Verizon issues happy to receive those and kind of put them through the necessary channels definitely want to highlight the services that we've been providing since Covid-19 has dropped. So we extended our commitment through June 30th to not terminate any services or charge late fees for customers that notify us that you know Judah Co, but they're not going to be able to pay their bills. We've also introduced Touchless retail in our stores to reduce physical contact, and you know our efforts directly impacting New York City, given koban so far has been partnerships with GrubHub, as well as the FDNY to feed first responders, as well as medical technicians and paramedics. We provided free, New, York time subscription to all Us high school students and that's going to be going through service I believe through July, but I can double check to see if that access is going to be extended. We donated to various food banks throughout New York City. One thing that I did want to highlight is that Verizon invested seven and a half million dollars with the local initiative, Support Corporation Li SC, and they are providing small businesses with grants to aid in economic recovery and so highlighting. You know those grants in particular. So far. Thirteen percent of those grants that we have awarded have been in the New York City area in Harlem in particular. That's including twelve businesses that have received a little bit over 110 thousand, but these things are still open. So I definitely want to include the link here in the chat. So you can spread the news, because the next round of applications are due next Wednesday June 17th. So this is going to be. You know, rolling admissions. If you have applied for one of these grants, you have to apply for every single application cycle, so your application does not roll over, and at this point it looks as though every round of applications is occurring about every three to four weeks. So in terms of checking back to the website, which I'll include in the chat as well and then for additional updates, obviously going to Verizon comm, because we have a banner there, that's giving the most up- to- date in terms of what we're doing in terms of our club in response but happy to answer any questions or take any issues. Thank you very much. Miss Davis, okay. First I'm going to open up the floor for board members to ask any questions. Miss Davis. Would you be able to? Please provide your grant absolutely I'm, putting that in right now to the child, Thank You Mari, any other board members have any questions. I do you may have mentioned this already, but you work for Verizon, correct, that's correct yeah so has Verizon considered doing any kind of discount lowering of the cost pool or, for example, your cable service, or anything like that? Yes, yeah, absolutely in terms of a lower. So it's interesting there were customers that were already a part of lifeline had like their service extended and billing cycle. I think was for two billing cycles that there was just forgiveness with their bills in terms a little lower price. I believe that packaging is going to be released fairly soon, but I do not have any specific details tonight, miss Dawson you how you doing I was trying to actually I was referring to discount what discounts for people who are not already in that program, because a lot of people have lost their jobs. So how are you I mean? How can people who are in need of lower- cost but want to retain their internet access and television? How can you support those people? Well, at this point, the programs are rolling out like I. Do not have specific details on, but I did put my contact info. You can send me a direct email. I can hopefully navigate through the customer service side to hopefully get a package that would work, but I do not have anything to release or provide details for tonight. Okay, thank you. Sorry, it was a little bit mumbled, but I think you were asking about like specific data for corporate responsibility within Harlem. That's a great question and we've actually been working on trying to tabulate, like our data, more specific, because we have various different groups, whether it's government affairs, Community affairs, corporate responsibility, corporate social responsibility Department. So the question that you're asking no, we do not have granular data in terms of like what Verizon as an entire corporation, is doing within Harlem, because there's so many different ways in which we involve and engage with the community, but I'm happy to try to get as much information from our corporate social responsibility in terms of the data that they do. Have it that's helpful to you, Ari Marvy, something's, wrong with your mic. I do not know if we should fix it or not, but something is wrong. Okay am I, not coming acrosss clear. You know it might just be the service, so yeah I will be following up with you, an email, yeah. Absolutely anyone else have any questions. Any board. Members I have a question. Can you hear me? Yes, okay has not been working for the last, maybe three years home service and that's still, the customers are still being built for the service and Verizon says that there's a problem with the lines and they can't really fix it. But yet still every month we have to cobble eyes in to let them know that you're still experiencing a problem when they in fact know that their lines are not working and that's 112, Street I, think between Saint Nicholas and Adam, Clayton, Powell and I feel I feel like if they know that there's a problem. Why is it that the residents are still I'm not getting something out of this? Okay, so I took it down. So you said this is between this 112 Street between Saint Nick and Adam Clayton Powell, yes, so I will reach out to me if you're saying that it's three years, certainly that could be. Who knows what issue but I know that from year to year the issue may end up changing. So, if you could do you have my contact info? Do you see it in the chat? I? Do your particular information via email that so that I can be able to escalate it appropriately, but I have the general neighborhood which I'll try to you know knock on some doors to get an explanation as to why that's the case? Thank you. Absolutely I have a question with this whole remote access- and you know, there's a lot of people that may not go back to the office long term. Is there conversation with either city government or federal government in terms of who pays for all this service? That's happening on remote access right, because now we have homeschooling remote access happening, things are slowing down and but then you still have to pay. So is there some conversation around that component? There absolutely I mean. Certainly COBIT has been a game changer in reimagining how everyone's been living and working so State, city federal. These are all conversations you know, I'm. One thing that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks is the actual levels have obviously been a huge surge like given this time, but it has not been anything that has affected the network in terms of its capability right. The issue is that it's been a shift in terms of where the stress has been placed right. So it's before in your apartment, you only need to worry about. You know having you know a tablet and your laptop working or your phone and your laptop working and now you're trying to operate off of the same service, but using five different. You know, phones, tablets, laptops and so on and so forth. People are seeing that there's a slowdown just given the amount of capacity that they have. So these are all conversations that are being discussed because we're kind of living in a new world. Okay, is there any way that you can keep us updated and in terms of because when we get that information from open data about how many remote access workers we have in the district, then we can sort of try to figure out how that works for us here in Harlem. So we can keep that line of communication open. That would be great. Is there any other board members that have any questions shanell on the point of open data? Do you know how updated are you all? Yes, I have it's not updated that often, but I believe in the training they go over? All of that, so when they provide us with that, we'll all find out. You know how often it's updated and everything about that. Yes, this Willie and I attended veteran about over a year ago now, but I do think that it should be more no for whenever they present I think he needs to be updated regularly. It does not seem to be like real time, so maybe we can go through that training and after we go through that training. If we're not satisfied with the data they possibly put in a resolution together and sending it and seeing if we can get them to make those changes, because they just said that we can recommend some changes, so we can see if that can happen. Thank you, Mari. Does anyone have any questions for horizon at the moment on the board? Anyone else, okay, I'm, going to open the floor to the community? Does anyone from the community have any questions? Okay, thank you very much, miss Davis for coming to our meeting and giving us that update and that presentation. We look forward to seeing you again I'm going to go ahead and move on and Prep in the agenda is Harlem advocates for seniors on the call, yet it's Mr. Watson on the call okay. So the idea is to try to invite two organizations to agencies and to small businesses in the district. Each meeting we can't make people come, we can only send invites and take confirmation, so the DM does have some confirmation, so I'm not sure why some people are not on the call. However, it's fine folks can come and see us another time if they for that. At this time, I would like to open up the floor for any community comments and concerns from board members at the moment are the immunity? Okay? Yes, so, according to the portal presentation that you provided last week, is that life is you know, information and all the buttons are live all the buttons and the newsletters are live all the buttons and the fly is alive. If you touch the screen of the topic, if it says 5 g it'll pop up a video on 5 g, if you touch the screen of the wealth gap, it'll pop up, you can watch the video before the discussion. The idea is that we do not have the time all the time in these meetings right now. We do not have any liquor license on the table, but soon you'll have a few, and so we do not want to take up time with a lot of discussions that deserve a little bit more time. So the idea is to create a zoom. Even when we do go back, you know to meeting in person. I still would like to connect or bloom, so people are already home and we can have those discussions and then I will create a resolution. Every discussion that we can vote on as a committee, so I'm not only looking for complaints or you know you know, what's wrong, I'm looking for what's wrong and some ideas or resolutions on how we can fix it. So that's pretty much how that works, but yeah everything is live on it. You can schedule you can put it on your calendar. You should be able to get to our newsletter. You should be able to get to the zoom meeting I'm, not the zoom meeting that Google those are going to be held on Google and yeah. That's pretty much that! Okay, that's you out the portal for the SLA had that been tested yet like have you tried to submit something to make sure they got the SLA and then what is the time frame and turnaround yeah? So we do not. We do not turn anything into SLA. We. He receives the information for us. The question there are questions that were already there from prior chairs to myself. It is just now in a form that we will be able to collect data, so we will now be able to say hey. These are all the liquor licenses that were applied below on 10th Street or if we can pull data from each question now, so that's pretty much. What happened? I did not create those questions. I just put it in a different format, so that we'll be able to see at the end of each session or year what actually happened in terms of the liquor license so yeah, that's how that works and it is tested. It does work all of the forms work, including the committee member form. That form is important, because that's how you let me know what you think we should be doing if there's an event that you want to put together, because it's going to have to go on writing at some point. So you might as well fill out that form. Then that gets over to the staff attached with an event form that you have to submit, and then that's how we can. You know make sure that our stuff is together when we do things as a committee and that's pretty much all the forms alive, okay and who is so busy. So there was an email that was created that email is provided on the newsletter so that email I have access to that email staff have access to that email, and so that's keeping all the data that email was created specifically for the board. This committee, okay, so when a business owner fills out in 30 days for SLA, and they upload it on to that portal or on to those on to that particular interface. It goes to staff from CB tech. That's where it goes. Yes, they will have access to that email, but they usually get the document first. The 30-day application is what they get first and they usually refer the person to the questionnaire and that's when that person come before us. We do not see their SLA application. There's too much information on that that's personal, so we do not see that okay I think people figured out it it'll. Okay, thanks know. If you confuse I mean you should you know, we can make sure that you're clear. This is what the meetings are for so when they fill out a 30-day application that is to us community boards. That is not their application to the SLA. That is two separate documents. Okay, we'll talk, one Shoetique is there any way you can step in and clarify further from what the SLA processes and what they told you, what has been communicated? I think it was pretty cool. Is there such? Is there any other information that we do not have? Is there something else that should be going on that we do not know about all of our information about the isolate processes on our website and if anyone once they can go on to the state authorities website, but nothing's changed from the way we do liquor licenses. You I can hear you Nina hello. Can you hear me now? Okay, here you okay? Where did where did you guys stop hearing me? Well speaking? Actually Chanel Petit was speaking, and then we heard nothing after expose. Oh okay, so I asked. Is there any more community concerns or comments from the board members miss I have heard, has written some information in the chat about a plant that Columbia University is no microloan. That Columbia University is offering, and I also have information for other monies that are being offered as well for small businesses. She's put that information in the chat and I'll go ahead, and the information that she put in the chat is basically from the Columbia Harlem Small Business, Development, Center they're, offering micro loans for 500 to 5,000 and larger amounts, and the deadline for submission is June 22nd and then, in addition to that, the Harlem entrepreneurial micro- grant initiative lunch by the Apollo Theater they're, also offering a micro grant. So I can put that information in the chat and, let's see I, also have another Oh mayor, De Blasio announced a small business emergency grant program and that specifically for stores that suffered vandalism during the protests for black lives matter and George in the death of George Floyd. So I can also put that information in the chat, and there are another two grants that I know of 401 other that I know of for small businesses, and that specifically has to do with Loza's was offering also a contribution of PE for small businesses. So I can put all of that information. In the chat- or we could also include perhaps that information in our and the information that me that we send out to the community I do not know how you would prefer to do it. Thank you much take it so yeah. If you go so we do have a community concerns section and the newsletter where you would be able to put that right, because you probably could some of the information comes in between meetings right. So, if you want me to know something or want me to get something out to meet committee members- and you want it to be blasted out- you would send me that either via email or best bet would be those forms that have been created for folks to upload. Pretty much do whatever you want to say, or whatever information you have. We can pull it from that and we'll add it to the agenda. If you look at the end of this agenda, we try to provide all the information that came in and between last meeting and now from committee members, and just you know, community members that want us to know that this exists and basically to get that information out. So yeah Mari sent them some information. Charles sentence, it's Charles Johnson sent them some information. Deacon Powell sent them some information. Lots of people sent them information in between last meeting and now so I provided that information on the last sheet of the agenda, so I can also do that. You know at the end of you know, you know at the end of the minutes, so the meetings I can possibly add those links when I put the minutes together. So that's pretty much how you can. Let me know about that in for me. Thank you very much. That's very useful information and also you can fill out a committee members form also. Okay, thanks una. Yes, anyone else have any concerns or I do not have a concern. I just have a question: oh yes, hi Chanel. Thank you for your leadership. I saw the beautiful newsletter. What is the process for putting the newsletter together? Do you? Is there a newsletter committee or something? How does that work? No, that's something I put together once they told me that I would be chair. I tried to figure out how to collect data, not really put pressure on folks on the committee right because I know a lot of people have. You know some strenuous positions outside of being committed. The community board members, and so I did not want to say, oh well, this person, how about you collect all this data when we are in the age of technology, and that can be done without having to have someone do that work. So it's pretty much collecting its own data. It's pretty much operating I will be updating like if you did an event or it's something that she was a part of, or something like that. I would just add those pages and that's pretty much how that started, because there was no process really in place so yeah there was no committee I just put it together. I gather all the data I've been sitting on this board for a few years, so I took all the concerns and complaints that I've heard over the few years and tried to provide something that we all can use, and that would be easy enough for us to. You know, be able to provide. You know some accurate reports for those that participate in the district. Okay, great does that does the committee does exempt see it before it goes live if you know, but that can be a process that could definitely be a process. It's just that it was just something dude that I did so I mean if you would like, if you're saying that you would like to see the newsletter, because you would like to either add something or you would like to you know correct something: that's definitely something that I would be willing to work with you on it's, not a problem. Yeah I, actually I actually have some experience with that, but I think that the it should go. I think that the folk could not adapt committee should see it before it goes, live in any event. Okay, that's fine! So we'll do one round with the committee members before it goes, live sure that sounds right. Anyone else have any questions. Yes, I should now. This is Debra Gilyard, so I also want to say it. Your newsletter is very informative and it's like people friendly, so I was able to. You know, look at the different pages and stuff I, like it I think it's great! That's what brought me to your meeting so I'm, basically interested in improving technology for seniors. So as we move forward, you know, I guess: I would bring that subject up move forward a lot of the seniors. Now we new face book now we are not zoom for the first time, so we're getting there and stuff so I just want to keep up words with the technology, so I can show to seniors. So that's the reason why we had invited Mr. Hamer right from Harlem seniors for advocates right to talk about that transition in terms of technology, and you know how they're being affected economically with this whole new technological world. So hopefully we can get Mr. Hamer to come, see us another time, but that's why we had him right he's. Also a member of icing, a task force at community Button, awesome, ok, cool! Maybe we can team up and do sorry yeah all right cool anyone else Chanel. This is Sicily. How are you I'm doing? Well, good I'm, hello, everyone I just wanted to I put it in the chat, but I did not want to hijack your meeting, but I did want to just put on the table, so everyone can start thinking about the conversation around open streets and restaurants. So that is going to be a hot topic for the next couple of weeks and it's a conversation that seems to be moving fast, so we talks about it. In with transportation meeting, we received a letter from Ron Frederick, Douglass, Boulevard, Alliance, chanel I, believe you did receive that all the board members should have yep okay, so we are reaching out to FDA to get more information, I believe we're going to invite them to the public safety meeting. But we do want you to be aware that we are that we are we're, basically, that this is a conversation it needs to be brought to the community. We want the community's input as these streets reopen and the restaurants reopen. So please be thoughtful about that. If you have any questions or concerns, I know it's a lot to think about right. Now, please contact me or Chanel with your questions. We will be hoping to hear from FDA at public safety and again had our executive committee meetings. Okay, if you, madam Chair, hmm, okay, so in terms of that, we can definitely do a watch and discuss. That was something I was going to discuss once we get out this meeting, because I mean- and oh excuse me so I can definitely create some sort of discussion zoom to talk about that. I know that we will be meeting in person, but after going through this process, some people are, you know, comfortable being in their homes I'm having certain discussions that may go on long. When we're in the office. You want to go home, but they're already home, so they're more comfortable having it there. So that's definitely something he can do I guess we can talk offline to make sure that happens. But, yes, we received that letter. I just received it two days before this meeting. So that's the reason why it's not on the agenda, but yes, I, am keeping that in mind. Oh there's, a question from Donna Gill I could touch on that really quickly. She do not know you're chairing the meeting. So if you will allow me to touch on her question or Lis quickly, I could not try to answer. Oh yes, I can't! Oh okay, now I can see her question. Okay, she must be. She probably is not able to unmute. Okay I'm her question just so. Everyone, if they did not see in the chat, is phase. Two opening speaks to outdoor dining. Where are the regulatory and enforcement details, the restaurants that have not applied for some permits? What will be the procedure for a legal sidewalk cafes, so Donna that'd? That is the question and the I guess the dilemma so how they would basically kind of quote unquote get around the sidewalk cafe situation is that they would use this open streets designation to apply for that type of permit, which would totally just shut down the streets so think of the open streets concept. Now that we have a recreation- and it's just restaurants in the middle of the street, seeing so their outdoor seating would be in the street that to expand their footprint. That is what they're looking at specifically the FT Ba Alliance is looking at 112 to 120. Second, so that, of course, I know everybody's mind is turning. That brings a lot of questions about transportation, ten social, distancing, public safety. All of these things are questions that we have for these organizations. But just so you know the recreation, the open streets and its original form for recreation was one of the caveats was. It was not allowed to be in an area that had a major transportation hub like the m10 so that it was supposed to be on side streets. So when we're talking about moving its Main streets and avenues, this is a different type of open streets that they're proposing. So that's the conversation that's what's going on with, that is that and then it did not specify the letter whether it was a temporary. Well, there was a temporary ask or a permanent and for this open street and we're starting out as temporary but I believe and, as everybody is probably thinking. What does that look like? We probably will not be going to inside dining for a while, and they will these restaurants we even when we go to inside dining, they will still need to expand their footprint beyond, probably the curbside to even be able to break, even especially with social distancing inside of the restaurants, so it'll, probably what we're thinking what they'll probably want to do is start out temporary and let it become a permanent thing throughout the summer and fall and it would be like on the weekends or these designated hours. I believe she now I can't remember, but in the in the FT be a proposal, it was like a Thursday to Sunday specified the day and time, but not whether it was temporary at night right so I'm thinking they're trying to do temporary and expanse a permit. But this is you know just the beginning: fpb a is the only official thing that we've seen, but you know if they do it there, it will expand some Malcolm, X, Boulevard and AC and I do not quite know a little part. So we have to be very vigilant about this and we have to think of you know not just that one area, but what does it look like for Harlem overall to be a part of this program so that that's the big question? Okay, so Madam chair? That sounds like something we probably need to address fast. So if we can talk Offline and if those who would like to help with the process can fill out that form- and let us know that you are interested in helping with this discussion and possibly I- guess providing what we would like to see happen is that what's supposed to happen, they want our input manager, hello. Yes, so if we can go ahead and just organize that and folks could just let us know who would like to participate in that- and we can go ahead and start that not tonight, but you know tomorrow: Thank You, Chanel, yes, I see that I'm Barbara asking from 125Th Street big, has gone on record with the Department of Transportation. That 125Th Street is not at the location for the open Street program. She said we have too many transportation needs with buses and emergency vehicles, but hold on there's something else. I wanted to say. She also said that the in Harlem Commonwealth Council are contributing funds to the Apollo micro- grant fund. The recipients will receive one thousand and we're making urgent funds to businesses that are independent owners. The other thing I wanted to say is that, in terms of the newsletter Barbara Askins, they are also doing some initiatives that I know about that. I would like to put inside the newsletter to say that those things are happening. So, if you can send me the information on that I know, you sent me the information saying that thing was going to happen and also when you have, when you have these grants and this information this stuff, if you can send that to me and then I can actually add it to the agenda or the minutes, and that is how I can get that out. Anyone else have any questions or concerns. Okay, so I'm going to move on to there is no question is for submitted. I already stated that that's not my rules, they were here before I got here, I'm just pretty much following them, so old business, new business, so new business is that I created these watch and discuss sessions. So, as I stated before, we do not have the time to really get into depth or talk about these issues when we have these meetings so that people are not on a phone call for three hours, so these will be a space they're, usually going to take place on a Sunday at 8:00, so that we can have those discussions and people could just log off and from all those. Whenever we have a discussion, I will create a document that has the resolution that has a resolution. So that is another way that we can talk about this open street topic. So again, I already stated that I'll speak to the chair or Fline about that. So those are the topics that I'm looking to do those W and D sessions. I welcome you all-, please participate I'm I want to know how you feel about these topics. What do you think you should be talking about what we should be concerned about? You know what we think should be in place as we deal with these issues and so I'm asking definitely committee members to please participate if you would like to help or like to help facilitate. Let me know again in that form the committee members Form and that's pretty much all I have on that. Does anyone else have any old business on new business they want to discuss or bring to the table? Yes, I do just be in light of the times that were employed. Everything that's been going on acrosss, the nation I think we should be reflective of that, even in our community and every single committee on this board as a community of Haarlem of community or a historical urban community of color, and so I think that we need to definitely be cognizant of that and to think of ways that we can contribute to the positive outcomes. In regards to that also, and on that same light, we continuously need to be vigilant and aware of this placement. As we know, during this pandemic, a lot of people's not been able to pay their rent. A lot of people have been jobs at work. So look at those economic issues as they affect our community and try to find ways to be proactive, and one of the ways of being proactive is all of the grant opportunities that people are sharing through this forum, but also we need to look at ways of doing. You know really look more deeply into how we can ensure that people, our community, are not it's placed because of economic issues, especially in regards to dependent Thank, You Mari. For that so yeah again, there is a form that committee members can fill out if they are looking to see anything discussed or anything dealt with or anything done on this committee. That form has yet to be filled out, so I do not know and I'm not able to communicate that to the leadership of this board. In order to make anything happen. If folks do not communicate to me, what exactly they want to see happen, how they want to see it happen. We are a committee. We are not just a committee of one, so if you guys see that there is something we should address, I have provided an outlet to receive that information, and so that information can be easily translated to the leadership of this board so that it can easily be turned into something, and it happened so I agree with all the topics that you spoke about. However, I think that if that is something you think, you should address that you should go ahead and let us know in that forum how we should address it. What are your ideas on that and that'll be great, and then we probably can see if some committee members are available to help with that initiative. Previous to all of this is just something that I'm bringing back up again. I will look at the forms, and you know and see what those forms are about, but I think that is also important to vocalize it and means, as well as space, actually not be that already thing action has already been placed on. Oh, yes, I definitely agree that it should be definitely vocalized. Also, however, nothing will be able to be done if it is not in some form of writing that can be transported to leadership or whomever it has to go to make it happen. So that is the reason why I created the forms so as I understand it should be voiced. There was some concerns last meeting, but I asked for folks to let me know so that we can possibly get that up to leadership, and that can happen, but that did not happen so I am trying to do my part. I just need you guys to if you see something going on or you see something you want to address, let me know so that can be brought to the attention of the chair of the board or whomever I need to go to see if it can happen or if it's just me presenting it to the committee on the vote to see. If we want to do this, but I can't present something, that's not tangible. So that's why we had created that process so that things will be tangible. Does anyone have any questions or concerns? Ok, so that means that this meeting it will be adjourned at 8:13 p.m. again. Those of you who receive the agenda, if you have it, please let you take know and a private message, just text him your email so that he can send you a private. He can send you an agenda and at the end of that agenda it has the link to our flyer for the up and coming events. It also has the link to the newsletter. It has just a blurb about the two p.m. and when you should turn things in for it to be seen or heard, underneath it has, if you're interested in leading any event the event forum that committee members can fill out even public members, if you fill it out- and the committee agrees- that's a good idea and they want to do it- that we can do it so that forum is there in terms of resources, are listed at the end, so miss Atkins. You can see that section is. We I would just put all that I received in between months on the agenda I'm. Sometimes you guys send me things that the due date will expire prior to us getting to the next meeting that stuff I can send out or ask the staff if they can blast that out before we get to the meeting. So I want to. Thank you guys for attending my meeting tonight. This is my first meeting cheering as this as the chair last meeting. I was still vice- chair, so I want to thank you all for participating tonight and I look forward to working with you guys have a good night. Your night, like you, should not. Thank you good night. Thank you.
