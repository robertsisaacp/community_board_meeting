I mean we do in this community thanks to a lot of community partners, Thanks the Community Board in terms of maintaining a listing of many of them open dialogue with many of them that were able to provide some assistance, many of our residents My question is in regards to the legislation that was passed concerning the construction.
And, then the discussion of what it would look like in terms of enforcement and ensuring that many people in our community get to work in the construction field is something that was a conversation.
Any discussion regarding all commercial and stabilization in Albany, cuz And they're, going to be there facing eviction from their spot And we've already had an issue with all my making Siri in New York City in general, in terms of more commercial spaces, And I can only think that this defendant will exacerbate the situation when the assembly member was in City was in the City Council Actually, a bill that was introduced to possibly reinstate you, know.
So that's going to be an ongoing conversation with Boethius, with both the legislature, the governor's office, In terms of how small businesses will be supported, we're looking to find out how that can actually be framework and regards to the other financial obligations that the state has particularly regards to housing, particularly in guards to transportation and many other qualities.

We do not have granular data in terms of like what Verizon as an entire corporation, is doing within Harlem, because there's so many different ways in which we involve and engage with the community, but I'm happy to try to get as much information from our corporate social responsibility in terms of the data that they do.
Do your particular information via email that so that I can be able to escalate it appropriately, but I have the general neighborhood which I'll try to you know knock on some doors to get an explanation as to Absolutely I have a question with this whole remote access- And, you know, there's a lot of people that may not go back to the office.
Is there any way that you can keep us updated and in terms of because when we get that information from open data about how many remote access workers we have in the district, then we can sort of try to figure out how that works.
