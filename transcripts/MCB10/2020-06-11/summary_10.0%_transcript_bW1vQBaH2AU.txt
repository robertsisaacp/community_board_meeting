We've been working remotely to help small businesses, access loans, grants and other services that they are needing in order to help them survive this pandemic We do know that a lot of communities were not getting access to those loans and, of course, second round came out of the PPP loan program.
So I'm now going to first ask board members if they have questions that they would like to ask mr Parker I Have, a question are New. Our small businesses who didn't receive all PPP loans eligible for the to get all relief loan through the state's program that they just started So that would leave that kind of leaves out the options, a little more open for those who didn't receive funds The first time around anyone else, Nadine Pinkett here Under the PPP loan program.
I can just take the information and will pretty much disseminate it to the community so that they can attend I and I hope that the rest of the committee is interested in that First I'm going to open the floor to board members to ask you questions Okay, so we're gonna move along the agenda.
We're gonna move on to the next item on the agenda that is Harlem advocates for seniors 7 pm will be the designated time slot for elected officials and elected official representatives, so I do see Nina Saxon from the New York City comptroller's office, here If she can just give a brief update from the comptroller's office in terms of what's going on with the economic development and technology and communications at the moment, hello, everyone I will be brief.
If any and now that has been repealed were able to inquire more about the type of officers that are on law enforcement and, with that being a case, I know that a lot of people in our and in our community will be looking to have their records clear or be able to defend themselves more adequately as they go into court Now that information should be made public, we're looking to get more support on the Senate side in order to secure a passage and then hopefully have that on the governor's desk sometime this summer, one that she was able to get passed was a 8 to 8 5, which relates to the disclosure of certain employment statistics of state assisted construction projects.
Now we're hoping to have more enforcement powers on the state side to be able to get some of the employment statistics of so many people who actually work on many of these projects, particularly when there was agreement between the construction project managers and developers and a community and securing a number of local hires We're hoping to get that also on the governor's desk sometime this upcoming summer and hopefully have that in place as we're looking to have the city reopen particularly now that construction projects are starting to reopen now and we're hoping to get that sooner rather than later , Anyone may have I do I Are we going to be seeing more like facilities that allow young people to experiment outside of their biology, chemistry and physics requirements in school?.
I mean we do in this community thanks to a lot of community partners thanks the community board In terms of maintaining a listing of many of them open dialogue with many of them that were able to provide some assistance, many of our residents, so it's just a matter of us being, but to connect the dots between which groups have which programs and getting them in touch with the parents and students who need them.
Any discussion regarding all commercial and stabilization in Albany, cuz I, see it's gonna, be a big problem for businesses who are coming back now in terms of a lot of them over and we've already had an issue with all my making Siri in New York City in general, in terms of more commercial spaces and I can only think that this defendant will exacerbate the situation when the assembly member was in City was in the City Council there's actually a bill that was introduced to possibly reinstate you know, commercial rent stabilization, but it was and became apparent, as the state government would need to arm, wouldn't need to intervene to get something like that done.
New York State has had a significant shortfall in regards to funding If there's gonna be any funding, it's any particular program that supports our small businesses, any financial support it will be mill and, most so that's going to be an ongoing conversation with boethius with both the legislature, the governor's office, in terms of how small businesses will be supported, we're looking to find out how that can actually be framework and regards to the other financial obligations that the state has particularly regards to housing, particularly in guards to transportation and many other qualities as well and, more importantly, health We're not sure what that financial burden would be to either the state or the city in terms of supporting small business, but they need the help.
I'm gonna open up the floor to community members with questions actually Chenault can give a brief update from the mayor's office Everybody not really much to report I Think SPS did a great job talking about the city's recent economic initiatives , The four sectors that were allowed to reopen this week for phase one are wholesale construction, retail, curbside retail, as well as wholesale Current limit is gatherings of 10 people or more are not allowed.
One thing that I did want to highlight is that Verizon invested seven and a half million dollars with the local initiative support corporation li SC and they are providing small businesses with grants to aid in economic recovery and so highlighting Thirteen percent of those grants that we have awarded have been in the New York City area in Harlem in particular, But these things are still open.
Absolutely I have a question with this whole remote access- and you know, there's a lot of people that may not go back to the office long term There conversation with either city government or federal government in terms of who pays for all this service?
so state city, federal One thing that I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks the actual levels have obviously been a huge surge like given this time, but it hasn't been anything that has affected the network in terms of its capability right, your laptop working or your phone and your laptop working and now you're trying to operate off of the same service, but using five different People are seeing that there's a slowdown just given the amount of capacity that they have Is there any way that you can keep us updated and in terms of because when we get that information from open data about how many remote access workers we have in the district, then we can sort of try to figure out how that works.
I'm gonna go ahead and move on and prep in the agenda So. The idea is to try to invite two organizations to agencies and to small businesses in the district Each meeting we can't make people come, we can only send invites and take confirmation, so the DM does have some confirmation, so I'm not sure why some people are not on the call At. This time, I would like to open up the floor for any community comments and concerns from board.
If you go so we do have a community concerns section and the newsletter where you would be able to put that right, because you probably could some of the information comes in between meetings right If you want me to know something or want me to get something out to meet committee members- and we'll add it to the agenda.
We will be hoping to hear from FDA at public safety and again had our executive committee meetings Some people are, you know, comfortable being in their homes, I'm having certain discussions that may go on long When we're in the office You want to go home, but they're already home, so they're more comfortable having it there Yes, we received that letter That's the reason why it's not on the agenda.
If you see something going on or you see something you want to address, let me know so that can be brought to the attention of the chair of the board or whomever I need to go to see if it can happen or if it's just me presenting it to the committee on the vote to see Those of you who receive the agenda.
