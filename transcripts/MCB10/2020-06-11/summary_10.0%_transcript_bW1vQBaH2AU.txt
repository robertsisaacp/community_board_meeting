We've been working remotely to help small businesses, access, loans, grants and other services that they are needing in order to help them survive.
One of the issues were finding small businesses are facing, is accessing and navigating the application itself We launched a hotline and SBS hotline to offer assistance to businesses in need of technical support.
Each community in the city of new york, Each community has their own specific issues and challenges, and So, and his goal is to help identify those specific challenges in each community and really kind of get to the heart of what the matter is and to provide assistance to those small businesses.

They have the opportunity to apply for funding through New York, City Department of Youth and Community Development.
Let me just go back and just say that DYC the funds they do a lot of different funding, but this particular funding that were that we're speaking about is the funding that comes to the neighborhoods report and we allocated a hundred thousand assistants with starting small businesses and a hundred thousand for financial literacy.

Now we're hoping to have more enforcement powers on the state side to be able to get some of the employment statistics of so many people who actually work on many of these projects, particularly when there was agreement between the construction project managers and developers and a community and securing a number of local hires.
So, we're hoping greatly that, with some more communication with our senior part with our Senate partners and the governor that we can finalize how that would actually look in terms of physical and enforcement.
And, then the discussion of what it would look like in terms of enforcement and ensuring that many people in our community get to work in the construction field is something that was a conversation.
It will be mill and, most so that's going to be an ongoing conversation with boethius, with both the legislature, the governor's office, in terms of how small businesses will be supported, we're looking to find out how that can actually be framework and regards to the other financial obligations that the state has particularly regards to housing, particularly in guards to transportation and many other qualities as well.
So, we're not sure what that financial burden would be to either the state or the city in terms of supporting small business, but they need the help.
