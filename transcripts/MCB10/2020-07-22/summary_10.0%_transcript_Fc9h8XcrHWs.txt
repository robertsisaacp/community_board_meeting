She is with the justice for the wrongful wrongfully incarcerated and we have Isaiah, who is the borough director from Manhattan with the mayor's office, and we have Reuben our technician: who's fun, so we'd like to first open up with, and the objective of this evenings discussion is on around development and funding for the exhibit or permanent, whatever that the permanency of the of the commemoration develops into so we're going to be talking about how we can direct that development and how we can do fundraising for that project You could just explain to us the process that the monumental women organization went through for the women's suffrage, monument which is opening I'm, really glad to be meeting with this group, because when we started our process or really wasn't anyone around to give us a whole lot of guidance for our project because they, the last time a statue was put into Central Park prior to the approval of our monument was 40 years ago.
You know we're asking communities to reimagine their public spaces We were received approval from the parks department when we first started this process seven years ago, kind of by happenstance one of the women who is now that one of the early board, members of our organization, colleen jenkins, ran into mitchell silver.
Competition now Karen had sent me some questions about the design I'll bring those up later, we've been working with the parks and the Central Park Conservancy, but they're, not the only group within the city that you're going to be working with to gain approval for your project and a lot of how you gain approval for your project, which groups you have to gain that approval from Karen's, where a lot of the stuff working with Community, Board 10 depends on what you end up, defining your project As. So you know, if you have a monument you're going to have one set of city agencies that you're going to have to deal with if you're putting up like Cynthia Copeland talked last week about the Seneca Village educational temporary exhibit that's in the park right now and that that's a different set of agencies that you might have to approach.
How many community boards you have to go before is going to depend a lot on where in the park you know you play you want to place your statue, monument educational project , However, you define the project so we're on literary walk and I.
We didn't want it Central, Park's, very picky, about what kinds of signs you can put up, and so we wanted to use technology to educate the public about the lives of these three women and the suffrage movement in general were unveiling it on 100th anniversary of women, winning the right to vote with the night, and tomorrow we're going to just do a tease, a snippet of the talking statues, app where we have our actors, our actresses reading, from the script, the words of these three women in dialogue with each other talking about their lives talking about their work, talking about their work together, it has to be short because the people are only going to stand there with a device for so long.
You may have the wind at your back right now and it's just impossible to predict really what kinds of things the park will be interested in I , don't know if you any of you are old enough to remember the gates, those orange pieces of cloth that were an art project that we're throughout the park that took that artist, a really long time to get approval for that and if I have difficulty Reuben I may need to ask you to share the video I mean you may have to do this sharing?
Her brothers and father didn't like that in order to pay for sending women to school at the University of Rochester, but to get back to Heather, she had an enormous amount of knowledge about fundraising and what foundations and corporations and how to approach them and she's able to put together with what's called a deck which it you know explains your project explains the needs explains in a way that is going to draw people into wanting to support your you know.
One is to on to put the first statue of real women into Central Park and then the second thing is to do this education campaign around women's history, and the third thing is to you within the city of New York and then also to challenge municipalities to honor, more women and people of color in their public spaces.
We were going to be across the street from the New York Historical Society, really, with these women facing Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln, the statues that are over there, but that site had a lot of problems structurally and the park came up with this alternative site on literary walk So. The advantage of that was had a lot fewer problems with the actual construction that we would have to have done, but it had a lot more restrictions because of where it was in the park in terms of what kind of a look they wanted for the monument we you know, we've evolved as an organization also along with every along with a lot of people in terms of what do we do to not only take statues down but to try and have discussions around the history behind these people, and so we've been You know.
Another question is the first task to identify the arts object prior to approaching the agency for approvals I watched your zoom from last week that you have a discussion with the community about what ideas you know percolate to the surface and then also when you're having this discussion you're going to find out, find the people that are highly motivated to support your project to everybody.
Commission I go back to what I said earlier, and that is the who you have to gain approval from is going to depend a lot on what your project looks like and because we were donating public art to the city.
Like I said the process changes depending on what the project is defined, as I just wanted to say in terms of incorporation, Another organization, which is excellent, is the New York lawyers for the Public Interest, so they're great at albi, incorporation and legal assistance, there's a bunch of different groups and some of them run workshops for nonprofits that help you learn about how to get organized and then there's some other things.
You know, because people can't meet in person a lot of organizations offering free stuff, yay We like free another question, just popped: What does the Conservatives conservancy being open What I can say that this project initiated at a community board meeting where we were voting on a resolution to support the renovate reconstruction of the new Alaska and the pole there?
Yet you know, We, didn't want to have to wait till we died to have our service recognized, and so you know, I think you could use that as an analogy that there's a lot of teaching that goes on, even when the project is related to people who are still alive, I mean that they firmly to the poem is requirement, but one thing: I did see that maybe worth exploring more I'm looking through some of their guidelines from parks and the public design Commission and trying to find where it said.
I have to ask: When was the Central Park five incident originally, if the monument was to be if the monument was or whatever was erected, if it was to if it was to be linked to the event and not the people that maybe a way that you can get around the posthumous apartment, because you know the exonerated five or so living I think there may be a way to go about it if the, if, whatever the item is going to be, is more so linked to the event and not so much to the people.
