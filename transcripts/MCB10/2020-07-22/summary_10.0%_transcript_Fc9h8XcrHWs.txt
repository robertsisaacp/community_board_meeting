She is with the justice for the wrongful wrongfully incarcerated and we have Isaiah, who is the borough director from Manhattan with the mayor's office, and we have Reuben our technician, who's, fun, So we'd like to first open up with, and the objective of this evenings discussion is on around development and funding for the exhibit or permanent, whatever that the permanency of the of the commemoration develops into So. If you could just explain to us the process that the monumental women organization went through for the women's suffrage, monument, which is opening I'm, really glad to be meeting with this group, because when we started our process or really was not anyone around to give us a whole lot of guidance for our project because they, the last time a statue was put into Central Park prior to the approval of our monument was 40 years, ago.
If I can do this next thing here, so our key objectives were to pay tribute to truth, Stanton and Anthony, as women's rights pioneers break, and we are breaking the bronze ceiling here by putting the first statue of real women in Central Park's 167 year, history into the park, and we will be dedicating it.
Our ceremony is going to be largely for virtual, and then you go down to the next part in it, and we talk about our ongoing educational campaign about women's rights that we are sharing in New, York, City and acrosss.
We were received approval from the parks Department when we first started this process, seven years, ago, kind of by happenstance one of the women who is now that one of the early board, members of our organization, Colleen jenkins, ran into Mitchell silver at a event and said you realize that there are no statues of real women in Central Park and he said what Now we had to raise entirely private funds and one of the things that we had to assure Central Park.
Later, we've been working with the parks and the Central Park Conservancy, but they're, not the only group within the city that you're going to be working with to gain approval for your project and a lot of how you gain approval for your project, which groups you have to gain that approval from Karen's, where a lot of the stuff working with Community, Board 10 depends on what you end.
If you have a monument you're going to have one set of city agencies that you're going to have to deal with, if you're putting up like Cynthia Copeland talked last week about the Seneca Village educational temporary, exhibit that's in the park right now and that that's a different set of agencies that you might have to approach.
This is just a list of some of the ways that both all three truths, Stanton and Anthony- were all connected to New, York City, and then we had to show that they were connected to the park as well, and this is our budget funds for all these different things.
Central Park is the hardest place, I believe in New York City to put up any kind of a monument or exhibit you know, even an exhibit, and that's our board of directors.
Central, Park's, very picky, about what kinds of signs you can put up, and so we wanted to use technology to educate the public about the lives of these three women and the suffrage movement in general were unveiling it on 100th anniversary of women, winning the right to vote with the night.
You know for the monument, so that's part of our education, campaign York City schoolchildren are going to be able to access us How long.
We have no paid staff and you need people that are passionate about this project and they are going to persist no matter what I do not think that you're going to have trouble finding those people for your group You may have the wind at your back right now, And, it's just impossible to predict really what kinds of things the park will be interested.
I'm being told that people can't hear the video is that correct, What would be needed to organize and implement an artist selection process, so the best way is to find an arts organization or a firm, Monument stuff and historical preservation In terms of you know the process and how to walk it through the various city.
I am the sculptor of the women's rights pioneers monument for Central, Park, today, I'm, working on hands This began over six years ago with a group called monumental women that formed to shame English, the lack of representation of women in public statuary and monuments, and they petitioned the city to give them a site.
In Central Park for statues of women's rights pioneers the women depicted in the monument are Sojourner Truth Susan B Anthony, an Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
It actually became law that women could vote and it'll be right in the park on the site on the Central Park Mall, where the statue will go But I've lived in New York City for over 40 years, I love.
When you have a concept, and now you go before city agencies and their ideas may not align completely with you with your with yours, Artists I speak as somebody who makes art myself, not sculpture, but other things, and you know, artists really do not like people telling them what to do.
Even things in Central Park, like tree roots I mean if you want to pick the hardest place in the city, to put up a monument or a display of any kind.
Your project explains the needs explains in a way that is going to draw people into wanting to support your you know.
You know we wanted to have a very diverse group of people who were involved in this project to get different.
One is to on to put the first statue of real women into Central Park and then the second thing is to do this education campaign around women's history, and the third thing is to you within the city of New York and then also to challenge municipalities to honor, more women and people of color in their public spaces.
The advantage of that was had a lot fewer problems with the actual construction that we would have to have done, but it had a lot more restrictions because of where it was in the park in terms of what kind of a look they wanted for the monument we you know, we've evolved as an organization, also along with every along with a lot of people in terms of what do we do to not only take statues down but to try and have discussions around the history behind these people, and so we've been.
We've been working on our education campaign to be more to address those issues of the time that we are in now, We're at very different times as statute people than we were seven years ago, and so you know, we've had to evolve with the rest of the country on trying to address all the issues that are being raised in terms of honoring people in public spaces.
Are we going to have to deal with beyond Central Park Conservancy for our project, Did they approve Karen?
Commission I go back to what I said earlier, and that is the who you have to gain approval from is going to depend a lot on what your project looks like and because we were donating public art to the city.
I've been seeing a lot of stuff online You know, because people can't meet in person a lot of organizations offering free stuff, Yay. We like free another question, just popped: What does the Conservatives conservancy being open What I can say that this project initiated at a community board meeting where we were voting on a resolution to support the renovate reconstruction of the new Alaska and the pole, there, and so we?
I have to ask: When was the Central Park five incident originally, if the monument was to be if the monument was or whatever was erected, if it was to if it was to be linked to the event and not the people that maybe a way that you can get around the posthumous apartment, because you know the exonerated five or so living I think there may be a way to go about it if the, if, whatever the item is going to be, is more so linked to the event and not so much to the people.
I know I'm very much interested in having people of color brought to the table as well, but Who fulfills the concept, because when you look at this situation in terms of the Central Park five to the exonerated five, it's a piece of history that can be traced through the history of the United States of America.
