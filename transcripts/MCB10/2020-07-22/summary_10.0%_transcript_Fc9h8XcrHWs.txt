She is with the justice for the wrongful wrongfully incarcerated and we have Isaiah, who is the borough director from Manhattan with the mayor's office, and we have Reuben our technician, who's, fun, So we'd like to first open up with, and the objective of this evenings discussion is on around development and funding for the exhibit or permanent, whatever that the permanency of the of the commemoration develops into So. We're going to be talking about how we can direct that development and how we can do fundraising for that project.
You could just explain to us the process that the monumental women organization went through for the women's suffrage, monument, which is opening I'm, really glad to be meeting with this group, because when we started our process or really wasn't anyone around to give us a whole lot of guidance for our project because they, the last time a statue was put into Central Park prior to the approval of our monument was 40 years.
If I can do this next thing here, so our key objectives were to pay tribute to truth, Stanton and Anthony, as women's rights pioneers break, and we are breaking the bronze ceiling here by putting the first statue of real women in Central Park's 167 year, history into the park, and we will be dedicating it.
Our ceremony is going to be largely for virtual, and then you go down to the next part in it, and we talk about our ongoing educational campaign about women's rights that we are sharing in New, York, City and across the country.
Later, we've been working with the parks and the Central Park Conservancy, but they're, not the only group within the city that you're going to be working with to gain approval for your project and a lot of how you gain approval for your project, which groups you have to gain that approval from Karen's, where a lot of the stuff working with Community, Board 10 depends on what you end.
If you have a monument you're going to have one set of city agencies that you're going to have to deal with if you're putting up like Cynthia Copeland talked last week about the Seneca Village educational temporary, exhibit that's in the park right now and that that's a different set of agencies that you might have to approach.
How many community boards you have to go before is going to depend a lot on where in the park You want to place your statue, monument, educational, project.
We didn't want it, Central, Park's, very picky, about what kinds of signs you can put up, and so we wanted to use technology to educate the public about the lives of these three women and the suffrage movement in general were unveiling it on 100th anniversary of women, winning the right to vote with the night.
You may have the wind at your back right now: And, it's just impossible to predict really what kinds of things the park will be interested in I, Don't know if you any of you are old enough to remember the gates, those orange pieces of cloth that were an art project that we're throughout the park that took that artist a really long time to get approval for that.
I'm being told that people can't hear the video is that correct, So is the parks department asking community board tents tended to do that?, What would be needed to organize and implement an artist selection process,?
So the best way is to find an arts organization or a firm- You need to know exactly what you're aiming to create hang on a second If you define exactly what the goal of the artwork is and the purpose of the project, You pick a diverse jury and you members on that jury from different artistic backgrounds.
In Central Park for statues of women's rights pioneers the women depicted in the monument are Sojourner Truth susan b anthony an Elizabeth Cady Stanton.
It actually became law that women could vote and it'll be right in the park on the site on the Central Park Mall, where the statue will go I spent a great deal of time in Central Park, with my son as a baby as a child, it's been a refuge and an inspiration to see the statuary there So, it's quite a wonderful thing to be doing this project You sent me a second video, but I'm, assuming you want to wait to show that later.
Even things in Central, Park, like tree roots, I mean if you want to pick the hardest place in the city, to put up a monument or a display of any kind.
And she's able to put together with what's called a deck which it you know explains your project explains the needs explains in a way that is going to draw people into wanting to support your you know.
You know we wanted to have a very diverse group of people who were involved in this project to get different.
One is to on to put the first statue of real women into Central Park and then the second thing is to do this education campaign around women's history, and the third thing is to you within the city of New York and then also to challenge municipalities to honor, more women and people of color in their public spaces.
The advantage of that was had a lot fewer problems with the actual construction that we would have to have done, but it had a lot more restrictions because of where it was in the park in terms of what kind of a look they wanted for the monument we you know, we've evolved as an organization also along with every along with a lot of people in terms of what do we do to not only take statues down but to try and have discussions around the history behind these people, and so we've been.
Are we going to have to deal with beyond Central Park Conservancy for our project, Did they approve Karen?
Commission I go back to what I said earlier, and that is the who you have to gain approval from is going to depend a lot on what your project looks like and because we were donating public art to the city.
Once you can define what your you want, your project to look like, then, even the help that you can get from other people, who've been involved in public art projects will vary because of the process.
I have to ask: When was the Central Park five incident originally, if the monument was to be if the monument was or whatever was erected, if it was to if it was to be linked to the event and not the people that maybe a way that you can get around the posthumous apartment, because you know the exonerated five or so living I think there may be a way to go about it if the, if, whatever the item is going to be, is more so linked to the event and not so much to the people.
Sorry to me to start with people, but I think that we need to impress upon the decision makers how serious this is and how deeply it cuts into the community and How there's just a need for the social reform, the criminal justice reform, and we need it now You know we need to use this opportunity to move this project.
I know I'm very much interested in having people of color brought to the table as well, but When you look at this situation in terms of the Central Park five to the exonerated five, it's a piece of history that can be traced through the history of the United States of America.
