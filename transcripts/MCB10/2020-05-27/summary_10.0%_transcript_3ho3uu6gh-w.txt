You are if you're a committee, So, with that I think to the next item on the agenda We just would like to discuss further how we can bring the people that we need to have to this discussion, and it was it's a very multifaceted discussion, Is the community board to facilitate the bringing this exhibit to fruition in Central Park, so I sent out the minutes So with that I'm going to open up the discussion to committee members , We need to bring be as inclusive as possible and as diverse as possible, because there's so many opinions out there and we want to have a consensus, but at the same time we want to respect the family.
And then we need to take a look at how the city perceives this situation and what and what the content would look like from the city's perspective as well and I'm from particularly a rent folk, a focus on social criminal justice and how that is so important and so integral to our community and how we need to be able to use this as an opportunity to educate people on what their rights are and and we're just trying to get people to think together?
For the community at large, something that the community itself can benefit from and not just a top-down type thing, but something that can be lasting, something: that's, educational, inspiring, Not only the situation in terms of the exonerated five and their families, but also moving forward understanding, All the issues related to justice and other types of situations that occur in our community by a collaboration of different types of events that would go on within that community space I know we had talked before regarding the space across the street, from Central Park the prison and that space, possibly being a house for some of the educational processes that would go on.
Regarding this in the park itself We are looking at other kind of ways to bring all of this together, because we really want the community to be aware and be involved and feel that this is kind of an open area where they can come in and get information and participate fully in the discovery of what's happening and what has happened going forward as we move toward the you know, things that are happening It would be a very important thing: I.
So I, don't know if the families you know if the some family is up for this with others from The Exonerated five would want to have kind of a mapping of the history of basically police brutality against communities of color and the fact that something like just calling it a complaint saying that person, because they're black So. It should be a really all inclusive, powerful kind of very just blunt type of exhibit that forces people to address the truth in reality of what's going on in our city, because, even in decades later, from the exonerated five, it's still happening front and center and much more stronger as well Honey.
I know there are a lot of people who are looking towards phantoms, in the future, I'm sure they will, because they are very interested in this situation, and they are also very interested in the space to turn it into a Justice Center for Education and social You, know prototypal healings as well, and to have programs and various things that are really needed in this community, because the community is changing and as the community changes other things start to happen like right, Now we are experiencing Kovach 19 and, as the mayor, the governor has stated that there are going to be people who businesses will not be coming back there going to be people who will be jobless and unable to fill the jobs that are being able and there going to be other things that we in our community may experience that other people may not experience, because one of the main things for us is going to be when they open up Would.
I know that space over across the boat area, the Discovery Center I, know that is placing in use already, and a lot of people seem to love that space and that's a in that space, and this is why one of the one of the reasons why we had thought that the Lincoln correctional facility would be a good space, because that you know that space has been many things to this community It's been a school and it probably would be big enough to house whatever needed to be done within the space and still, you know, maintain itself as a historic piece that is within this community that has moved on to stay within the educational forefront of justice and when you look at the input of the Harry Bellefonte group coming in and you look at his background and his relationship on the side of working on many of these movements that have gone through that have affected people of color and other people as well.
I'm, a member of the public on a member of the community and Li, say that you know it may take a long time to get something permanent in the park, but I think it's that's an essential part of this project.
We have the Seneca Village exhibit, which is temporary, but it's also in place to generate conversation and discussion around something permanent and I do agree that we do need to make a permanent record of transgressions when they are when they, when we incur them and I, think that the issue with the woman in Central Park yesterday should even come before our public safety committee You know, I'll make that recommendation at the executive committee and I think that wine we need to get those lists of stakeholders together, so that we can send out an invitational letter and so that we can solidify the subcommittee for this project.
I also just wanted to mention that on the agenda, I have a listing for a voting item for a resolution and I'm just wondering how the committee members feel about this Do. You think that we need a res lucien at this point from the community board, stating that we want to see this project come to fruition?
Members and I probably could get it out by tomorrow, and then we could take it to the executive committee, which is tomorrow, okay, all right, so we'll work on a resolution I'm stating that we want to see this exhibit in Central Park, and let me see what other items other action items we have just as we I, don't think I've heard about this specific project or subcommittee before, but as I hear more just a few ideas would be at first and it seems like there was an artist awarded that site like come up with a replacement statue already, but I thought like something like that might be an idea where it was like an open space and it was specifically taken down because of racism and I'm, especially towards black women but then this other image I had of maybe some other permanent structure or some statue is if people are familiar with the fearless girl statue in wall street I just had this idea of like five young boys as a statue at the entrance of Central Park, maybe like at fifth in 110th, and maybe some permanent structure where it doesn't block entrances or paths, but something that is like right in your face and I feel like that, would definitely attract people for years on.
There should be the thought right now, not that Conservancy is telling us about the historical part of the park, and you know it's going to take time and I think that that's critical , you know a space where we can get education and all those things, but there has to be something in that part: That should be part of the conversation or something like this, especially when people are doing it today.
This is something impact The, whole community, and I think it will be fine if people want to send their emails to me that you know your recommendations- Was any committee members, any community board members who would like to be on the task force.
