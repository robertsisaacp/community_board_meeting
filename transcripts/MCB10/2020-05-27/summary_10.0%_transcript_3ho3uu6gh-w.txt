I know that we have an open park situation, which is on the Colonel young playground, which is on one 43rd Street between Lenox and 5th And I'm, wondering if you've experienced that, since you are, you might be over in that area?
We just would like to discuss further how we can bring the people that we need to have to this discussion, and it was it's a very multifaceted discussion, Is the community board to facilitate the bringing this exhibit to fruition in Central Park, so I sent out the minutes.
With that I'm going to open up the discussion to committee members, We need to bring be as inclusive as possible and as diverse as possible, because there's so many opinions out there And we want to have a consensus, but at the same time we want to respect the family.
And I'm from particularly a rent, folk, a focus on social criminal justice and how that is so important and so integral to our community How we need to be able to use this as an opportunity to educate people on what their rights are And And we're just trying to get people to think together?
All, the issues related to justice and other types of situations that occur in our community by a collaboration of different types of events that would go on within that community space I know we had talked before regarding the space acrosss, the street, from Central Park the prison and that space, possibly being a house for some of the educational processes that would go on.
We are looking at other kind of ways to bring all of this together, because we really want the community to be aware and be involved and feel that this is kind of an open area where they can come in and get information and participate fully.
The experience in America that we have is that when they cry we die that's right and so trying to figure out how it's not like this We're using this as our piece to add to the true freedom, justice and equality of us as a people, as opposed to you know, just saying hey, it happened.
Dr. John, Henry Clarke said that you know if you, if you begin a people's history with slavery and everything else looks like progress.
So I do not know if the families you know if the some family is up for this with others from The Exonerated five would want to have kind of a mapping of the history of basically police brutality against communities of color and the fact that something like just calling it a complaint saying that person, because they're black And I think that if there is opposition to it that the opposition should be documented from where it's coming from to also establish the deep- rooted mindset of not only what has kept our communities down of what is acceptable in which we should anticipate I just being either a rite of passage or a signifier of adulthood, but also the powers that are keeping that status quo in place.
It should be a really all inclusive, powerful kind of very just blunt type of exhibit that forces people to address the truth in reality of what's going on in our city, because, even in decades later, from the exonerated five, it's still happening front and center and much more stronger as well.
There are a lot of people who are looking towards phantoms, Sorry that the Bellefonte route was not able to join the call today and In the future, I'm sure they will, because they are very interested in this situation, and they are also very interested in the space to turn it into a Justice Center for Education and Social.
So that's what the community board is facilitating at this point, the formation of what we call the subcommittee or chance for- This is our third meeting Anyone, who has names that they're suggesting to please forward them to the Community Board office Then we can develop a letter of invitation and send that out and then try to solidify what the subcommittee who the subcommittee is and who is on that subcommittee and then start to move forward and then also Then, once we do that, then we can start to have the broader discussion with more stakeholders and more and more of a diverse group of people.
Is, you know, extremely important, but we want us from focus right now on the Central Park component and how that subcommittee can begin to develop the content of what would go into Central Park, and then we and then we can also look at the social justice Center aspect of it as well.
That is meant to kind of be the countryside for people who do not have a chance to go to the countryside So, I, know, there's interest in the Lincoln facility, so I think in terms of time frame really going to depend first, as Karen said, on a coming together.
I think the most important thing first is to kind of really start broadening the dialogue, as Karen said, bringing more people into the discussion to figure out who, on the city, side needs to come in for partner to partner who needs to be involved.
You know, maintain itself as a historic piece that is within this community that has moved on to stay within the educational forefront of justice and when you look at the input of the Harry Bellefonte group coming in, and you look at his background and his relationship on the side of working on many of these movements that have gone through that have affected people of color and other people.
What should I say dirty: I'm, a member of the public on a member of the community and Li , say that you know it may take a long time to get something permanent in the park, but I think it's that's an essential part of this project.
Okay, so I just wanted to just let you know that this is intended to be a permanent exhibit right now in Central, Park We have the Seneca Village exhibit, which is temporary, but it's also in place to generate conversation and discussion around something permanent.
And I do agree that we do need to make a permanent record of transgressions when they are when they, when we incur them and I, think that the issue with the woman in Central Park yesterday should even come before our public safety committee.
You think that we need a res lucien at this point from the Community board, stating that we want to see this project come to fruition?
You know because I started to work on, it would be very rough Then we could take it to the executive committee, which is tomorrow, okay, all right, so we'll work on a resolution I'm stating that we want to see this exhibit in Central Park, and let me see what other items other action items we have Just as we I do not think I've heard about this specific project or subcommittee before.
I just wanted to also address what was said, and the first thought that came to me was Seneca village, but I think that the park may have a lot of bureaucracy and it may take time And it's a historical place, but we need to be included in the history.
There should be the thought right, now, not that Conservancy is telling us about the historical part of the park, and you know it's going to take time.
There's many statues in the park that nobody even knows who those people are.
The whole community, And I think it will be fine if people want to send their emails to me that you know Was any committee members, any community board members who would like to be on the task?
You know in developing over the summer months until the fall, I think that if we can get people to do because we've just been talking about who should be at the table, actually get the contact information to send out to do a letter of invitation.
