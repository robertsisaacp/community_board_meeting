But as of right now, really a lot of it due to the financial crisis, the city we're hearing this from seniors from Harlem Queens all across the city and they keep calling us back us at the senior centers That's a good idea, leaving the contractors contact info with the seniors for follow-up because yeah we don't want to patent Mountaineer Debbie I'm, very troubled by some of the conversation that I'm hearing, because basically it seems like everything is targeted to nature my seniors and there are a lot of seniors in our community who are not living in NYCHA who still qualifies, who are not being reached, and the fact is that it just seems and I mean I Think that the certainly night you folks need services and support.
You know if there is a commitment to really see to it that you know we can reach more of our senior population, so I'm just wondering if that's something that community boards and others might want to take a look at and Isaiah you on the call to see if that could be a conversation, because I, don't think anybody's really talking about it down there at that table.
Just want to quickly totally in agreement with what William said, because I receive a lot of calls from the seniors about the a condition and the tablet, and they are not in NYCHA residents and have no idea what to tell them, because, based on the fact that it's bit towards the nature, residence I cannot tell them all the seniors from the building came and spoke with me and said that only a certain percentage of the people in their building have received either air conditioners or laptops.
We do need to target folks who, in our view, are the most in need, and that's always going to boil down to the lower-income folks and granted You know I've heard a lot of reports of particular seniors and buildings who didn't get a call or nobody reached out to while the neighbor was offered the tablet and the air conditioners- I think the people doing these jobs and I wanted to say the exclusive focus on Knights or residents Your rights who nicer residents I've been talking with them about expanding the tablets outside of NYCHA folks.
and it seems that there are a lot of seniors that are not being addressed in the situation, so I think we need to know where are these discussions and when can we join because, obviously they're not enough people in the room or any your representation in the room that goes beyond NYCHA residents and it doesn't speak to the senior at large I have been asked several weeks ago to be an advisor to New York, City, Task Force on racism and healthcare disparities.
Those contracts were sculpted before the situation, and now we have to kind of retool to figure out how we're going to serve and provide services to seniors At. The same time, you know, spend the money appropriately that we have been contracted to provide these services and some of the Senior Center folks might be in the same situation in terms of just contracts, we're getting ready to do a dance class online and we're also looking at as an organization, because we have a little bit of flexibility, we're trying to take a look at even trying to do some online stuff in the evening so that you know we can kind of just come in and one evening and just kind of do an entertainment program for seniors.
On a Friday or a Saturday night You know something different, then you know what we do sometimes during the day, but again I mean the box is wide open in terms of just what we can and cannot do, and how do we actually do that A big concern, because so many seniors don't have tablets, and many of them will call and I know that there are a number of people on the call, and you want people engaged, then those who don't have that technology class mm-hmm that tablet it kind of leaves them in the lurch right The other thing is just that internet access I mean you know how many seniors have internet access Even if you get a tablet, you know who's gonna pay for the internet, access You, know and pretty nicely for people living in nature.
You know in the senior centers The get food program actually is run by the mayor's office and not the Department for the aging I just want to clarify that, because I know people senior still do call because people are telling them to call us, but the food is literally out of our hands and I know what the center is most of the center's had computer classes and some people took them, and some people said nah I'm still helping people it's time, gonna be for the first time because they didn't know their new phone could do.
One date is for the members to pick up their supplies and the second date is for the actual zoom class, where you could follow along with the instructor online, because you already have all your materials right, but you just want to make sure that the day the members pick up their supplies is also the same day as the pantry box or any food that you're giving away I think they're going to be trying to wrap up over the summer and September You know I mean we've got an election next week, I mean I, don't know how many people, even you know, I'll, go to participate in that I'm sure that's gonna be really dal, but the census is still an important issue and the question is you know:?
We have no control over who is selected, I, don't I, don't know how they come up with, who is selected, but they send us a list and they access to make these cold calls to the seniors and that's how we're doing in Central, Harlem I'm working with the private organization to get donated slightly use, iPads and tablets for seniors who do not qualify under the dista in the nature program, so I hope to not hearing something by July 15th from this organization, in terms of when the arm distribution of these iPads will start and with that, the determination will be up to basically me or the new executive director a question for the senior centers in terms of the programs that you will doing these programs just open exclusively to people who are registered in your centers or the programs potentially open for anybody in the community who sees a flyer and who wants to click in Can they get into that kind of class or how is that?
To is that you know the more of these types of programs if they are not exclusive to the senior centers because of contractual obligations or things of that nature, then more marketing and opening up to the community might just get more people engaged I mean, so we could be doing a service to more and more seniors, who might just want to click in and join a class, even though they are not a member of the Senior Center or even my organization Just in time that will come because I know some of my exercise class or one in particular that we have a couple of times a week.
We are looking to move some of our classes that we usually had in our site that were in person virtually or you know, we're just trying to figure out how to still keep the community engaged So. For instance, if anyone has anyone that is in need of snap is in need of any kind of state-sponsored programs has any food insecurity needs any kind of mental health services or social worker We do have a social worker, on-site and they're, not exclusive, emblem health members If someone does not have emblem health, we can still refer them over to our social workers and anyone that does have emblem house if they still are in need of any kind of customer service issue, Customer service assistance or to speak with anyone : we're, maintaining and hoping to be back on site soon and working with people, which is you know, I have a piece of information that I think everyone should be aware of, which is the dista has designated the senior centers that have more than 10,000 square feet to become cooling centers This summer, the City Department of Emergency Management has said that they will open if it's over 95 degree heat index three days in a row.
