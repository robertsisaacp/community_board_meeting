I, don't know how to operate this one as efficiently as the one at Kennedy Monica water outside director for sent to Harlem senior citizen, centers, pink, Thank, You, Monica, okay, I'm on the page, So I said you are our first guest.
Income, Those are the easy season that would identify the seniors who need the eligibility and then eligibility of those some criteria based on things like income, and so those agencies who already have those folks on their list because they interact with them, see programs.
They are reaching out proactively to set appointments with folks so that people can come in and install the air conditioners tablets work in pretty much the same way.
It's, always you know the low-income senior or the low-income, older, adult And I'm, just wondering whether or not this is an issue that we might want to try to raise to another level, because so many folks are being excluded and I understand the financial crisis with the pandemic.
Just want to quickly totally in agreement with what William said, because I receive a lot of calls from the seniors about the a condition and the tablet, and they are not in NYCHA residents and have no idea what to tell them, because, based on the fact that it's bit towards the nature, residence I cannot tell them.
The seniors from the building came and spoke with me and said that only a certain percentage of the people in their building have received either air conditioners or laptops.
I. Think the people doing these jobs do are overlooked folks at certain times, and that's why I want to offer myself if you have knowledge of seniors who live especially to the United facilities, who have it can offer the resources.
I actually called and complained about it, and you know there seem to be some chagrin on their part to the fact that you know they really didn't single out seniors Can you house possibly have a report like that in this pan, climate, with the vulnerable nature and susceptibility of older adults to all of these issues which all intersect with racism and healthcare disparities?
As far as we already had this conversation me and him during the week about senior issues when I invited him to come to because I want everybody to hear.
I cannot even imagine why anybody in America would ever again go hungry because there just seems to be so much food available, but the key is getting the food to the people who need it, and you know one of the things that we've been able to do at the sites where we are currently providing supports.
You know, get our seniors and the people that we work with in the community tied into one of those distribution, resources and coordinate that so that they are getting those foods at the respective sites and I would imagine.
You know, spend the money appropriately that we have been contracted to provide these services and Some of the Senior Center folks Might be in the same situation in terms of just contracts.
We want to do some crocheting online, we're actually trying to put together with a couple of partners, a virtual dance, party, okay, online And, we're also looking at as an organization, because we have a little bit of flexibility, we're trying to take a look at even trying to do some online stuff in the evening so that you know we can kind of just come in and one evening And just kind of do an entertainment program for seniors on a Friday or a Saturday.
That's, a big concern, because so many seniors don't have tablets, and many of them will call I know that there are a number of people on the call.
Okay, some of us, we might have had it, we might contact it and we might be able to get through, but some people is going it'll, be one and done We have to obviously put some things in place that would isolate that group comfortably so that they can at least feel the sunshine and finally, I would just say you know we worked on the food we were working.
You know in the senior centers I think they still.
They hook this up with different other places to get food, delivered, mm-hmm, so I think that's just wonderful , Mm-hmm, I'm, sorry I just want to quickly say something with regard to the get food fabulous, presentation, William I, the get food program actually is run by the mayor's office and not the Department for the aging Because I know, people senior still do call because people are telling them to call us, but the food is literally out of our hands.
I just wanted to say that I think there are some of the food problems that still has dictor name on it, but this is what we were: told: Text, that's I'm, still a major problem that I know: I've talked about with other seniors.
What they do have is a phone and the majority of our low-income seniors have the free-foam the limited minutes, limited, use, phones, and if they don't use them, then they have to reapply So. What we're finding is the only thing we've been able to do technologically so far is conference calling because, since they do have phones and do know how to use the phones, we're linking together between two and five seniors to have conversations with each other, but I think it's a serious issue that I really wanted I, say and Verna to hear in terms of how extremely limited knowledge is and the actual technology resources of the seniors that we serve.
So when the seniors complain about it, all I can say, is So I think it's really important to identify that we're using resources poorly and that we need to be more careful and more thoughtful about what we're doing, because there are people who are on the list to get food who don't get it, and there are people like me who are not on the list.
If we want to share two different things, because I know some of the senior centers they have physical fitness every three days.
One date is for the members to pick up their supplies, and the second date is for the actual zoom class, where you could follow along with the instructor online, because you already have all your materials right, but you just want to make sure that the day the members pick up their supplies is also the same day as the pantry box or any food that you're giving away just so they don't.
Can you know, grab food there Ok , I'm, going to for training next week for the census, seniors in particular in Harlem, make sure that they fill out the forms and give them any success, as we can And I, don't know when we're actually gonna be out there in the field, but it should be sometime in July help people out, It may be a half hour, If not go back, there's, never any very many people there at the place on 118th Street.
I'm gonna be reaching out to several people for access like the art class and all of that okay heard about it as seniors would love that right.
A question for the senior centers in terms of the programs that you will doing these programs just open exclusively to people who are registered in your centers or the programs potentially open for anybody in the community who sees a flyer and who wants to click in.
To is that you know the more of these types of programs if they are not exclusive to the senior centers because of contractual obligations or things of that nature.
Customer service assistance or to speak with anyone : we're, maintaining and hoping to be back on site soon and working with people, which is you know, The things that we like to do was just you.
We need to keep in mind that some of that that's currently being provided to seniors is going to run out, and if some of these programs, you know terminate which many of them are planning to do or expect it to do.
