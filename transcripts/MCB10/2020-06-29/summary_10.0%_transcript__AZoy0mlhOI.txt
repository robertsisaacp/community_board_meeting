I do not see her on, but if she does get our world I heard it to speak about that I'm, probably going to be doing a few shiftings when it comes to the agenda since I'm singing one on here , I wanted to get some follow up on some of the community shootings.
So I want to go ahead and move over to the Frederick Douglass Business Alliance request very good streets letter of support for support, John, Lynch.
There were various aspects that open streets can take and that's a program , We understand that they'll be announcing the Cote d'or dining program that will come into effect when York City goes into Phase.
True court Kimberly at Department of Transportation about that application, and also she filled us in a where things look like they go in with the outdoor dining program.
It's not necessarily going to be under the auspices or control of the FD Ba. You know in a day or two any restaurant in New, York, City, I assume, is going to be able to go online and make that application.
As far as what the open street would look, like, that will again depend on what Theo T decides to grant, and you know it could.
At this point, it's not really clear what it would look like, or what would there would be to enforce, but F TBA is prepared to you know, take on the you know the role of the of the organization with the application who would/ see whenever DoD designates in terms of the terms of an open street.
There was a letter that was included from Gale Brewer, so I did not know if you wanted to just kind of add on what the what the perspective and even Sicily may be able to jump into just what Al Brewer and our borough president's offices are viewpoints are when it comes to the designated feet.
Because you know we may have this week a lot of restaurants, all over New York City applying for outdoor dining permits.
We put the open streets, application in, but the individual restaurant, open, dining permits in you know in reality, It's not be under FDA's control, Just, assuming that.
Yes, the open, dining permits that are going to start soon and the open streets application, which are you know, technically, have an open, do not formally require community board.
I know that we can't physically go to homes and things of that nature, but just even from an email subscriber list from the various people who go to the restaurants that are attached to Frederick Douglas Boulevard Alliance, to see what their sentiments are.
So, even if they supersede the process of who can have out the seating, we still would like to know who the participants are, and if the community basically supports this dis progress on this process, actually apologize.
Oh: What's the restaurant acrosss the street or down the block, and Then next time you know they may consider coming up to dine with us at Melba's.
Ensure that there are certain parameters or certain things that are that are in a liner or planning to be in line, because one thing that I do not want to see happen is that you know Community Board gives the support letter for this and then a few weeks down the road.
Some incident with you know with a kid walking through that area, So I just want to make sure that their parameters set and that the communities involved with it as well, and they have the supporting, because I think that is a symbiotic relationship here in Harlem.
You know the impetus for doing this really harkens back to the fact that FD Ba as part of a historic rezoning was designated not only the Gateway to Harlem, but the restaurant row and one of the unique benefits that FDB has is extremely large sidewalks, as well as adjacent streets that also serve as transportation.
So, if you recall for I, know the community board marches in the African American Day Parade that is shut down both uptown in downtown, where there is a bus, route, D, O- T, does sign off on that and many times those bus routes are rerouted to either St. Nicholas or Manhattan Avenue, because we both so many restaurants like Chocolat, Zuma, row, house, Harlem, tavern, levain, bakery Harlem, hop, house, Lido, and so many other businesses that have been directly impacted that we also benefit from wide sidewalks, which could address some of the concerns about pedestrian walkways.
We know that in communities like Hell's Kitchen and in Brooklyn, there are streets that are shut down in areas where there are a number of restaurants, and there have been challenges with that.
That is a incorporates perspectives of the community, because we envision this organization very much like the downtown Alliance, which is an organization not only of merchants, but is an organization of community residents that we can do something that can be a way to come back out into the community that respects guidelines that have been set up by the city and state, but also is a way that I know that all of us are committed to in terms of showing support for small business organizations that helped to transform boulevards like Melba Mike 67 orange, like Chocolat, like Mocha, like Bennett area, that invested and also live in the community.
I first feel like I I just want to say that our businesses, our restaurants, are vital to the community And we can to support them.
When we see what the mayor comes out yesterday or tomorrow or Friday and says in terms of the restrictions And like I said before you know, the restaurants are going to go online and apply for these outdoor seating.
