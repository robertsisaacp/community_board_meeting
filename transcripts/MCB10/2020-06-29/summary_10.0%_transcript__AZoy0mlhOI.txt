So I want to go ahead and move over to the Frederick Douglass Business Alliance request very good streets letter of support for support, john lynch.
Somewhere I, keep miss stating her name, true court Kimberly at Department of Transportation about that application, and also she filled us in a where things look like they go in with the outdoor dining program.
We should just see how that plays out, see what restaurants apply for that, what is permitted and how that works out and that program, apparently and again the details will come in a day or two, but apparently it would allow outdoor dining and a combination of perhaps sidewalks and parking lanes in addition to existing sidewalk cafes.
It's not necessarily going to be under the auspices or control of the FD ba you know in a day or two any restaurant in New, York, City , I assume, is going to be able to go online and make that application.
But again we want to speak to the community board and find out what concerns you have our sources, though, as far as just the deserts, the designated areas that they that they identify.
As far as what the open street would look, like, that will again depend on what Theo T decides to grant, and you know it could.
It's a little bit confusing this interplay between open streets and the outdoor dining program, because you know we may have this week a lot of restaurants, all over New York City applying for outdoor dining permits.
We put the open streets, application in, but the individual restaurant, open, dining permits in you know in reality, It's not be under FDA's control, Just, assuming that.
Yes, the open, dining permits that are going to start soon and the open streets application, which are you know, technically, have an open, do not formally require community board.
We sent it to everyone else and obviously wants you to have this dialogue with the community board, but I think you know fortunately or unfortunately.
I know that we can't physically go to homes and things of that nature, but just even from an email subscriber list from the various people who go to the restaurants that are attached to Frederick Douglas Boulevard Alliance, to see what their sentiments are.
So even if they supersede the process of who can have out the seating, we still would like to know who the participants are, and if the community basically supports this dis progress on this process, actually apologize.
We definitely hear their concerns, but I also want to speak from the other side as a small business owner who's born bread and butter, and right here in the community, and also someone who saved up money literally to open up my business in this community that I'm born and raised in that I live in and that I love.
What's the restaurant across the street or down the block And, then next time you know they may consider coming up to dine with us at Melba's.
Ensure that there are certain parameters or certain things that are that are in a liner or planning to be in line, because one thing that I don't want to see happen is that you know community board gives the support letter for this Some incident with you know with a kid walking through that area, So, like you, know, Harlem can thrive without that without the community residents, but it also can't drive without the businesses.
We know that in communities like Hell's Kitchen and in Brooklyn, there are streets that are shut down in areas where there are a number of restaurants, and there have been challenges with that.
That can be a way to come back out into the community that respects guidelines that have been set up by the city and state, but also is a way that I know that all of us are committed to in terms of showing support for small business organizations that helped to transform boulevards like Melba Mike 67 orange, like Chocolat, like mocha, like Bennett area, that invested and also live in the community.
Am I just want to say that our businesses, our restaurants, are vital to the community And we can to support them.
When we see what the mayor comes out yesterday or tomorrow or Friday and says in terms of the restrictions And like I said before you know, the restaurants are gonna, go online and apply for these outdoor seating.
That will be an opportunity to showcase what we have to offer uptown and that will allow us to begin to strategically think about how we do this across our community, so that the small businesses, particularly restaurants, that will not really be able to open until phase three.
