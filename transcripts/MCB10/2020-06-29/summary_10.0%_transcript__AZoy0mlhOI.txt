Any representatives from the city agencies or, for instance, from naturally interest bids that want to speak regarding any anything or any concerns that they have no This will really not be shipped over some of the stuff from Cobra community updates and community shooting So I want to go ahead and move over to the Frederick Douglass Business Alliance request very good streets letter of support for support john lynch We you have seen the a letter that we had written regarding a pending application, that the Frederick Douglass Boulevard has in connection with an application to for an O participate in the open Street program, and people are trying to get information and find out.
As far as the our open streets request, the one concern that Kimberly expressed on behalf of D of T was regarding any kind of closure of bus routes, and she expressed- and you know that was just a statement on her part, but we discussed other aspects whether there would be potential closure of traffic lanes or parking lanes in one direction or either direction whether there could be closure of side streets, and we spoke about perhaps having closures of side streets on 114th and a hundred n170 919, but again overlaying All of this will be the outdoor dining permits.
We should just see how that plays out, see what restaurants apply for that, what is permitted and how that works out and that program, apparently and again, the details will come in a day or two, but apparently it would allow outdoor dining and a combination of perhaps sidewalks and parking lanes in addition to existing sidewalk cafes As long as there are no bus stops block no fire hydrants blocked and as long as it doesn't interfere with intersections so Kimberly from DoD, and then we could take a snapshot of in this case, Frederick Douglass Boulevard and see them if there are options to sort of expand to something more like it like an open street You know what we're hearing from the department transportation we're here today, of course, to listen to the community board and to see how we can sort of partner in this effort to you know to welcome you back You, be the community Has. The community welcome the businesses back, restaurants on Frederick, Douglas, Boulevard and just one other point.
So, it's not necessarily going to be under the auspices or control of the FD ba you know in a day or two any restaurant in New, York, City I assume, is going to be able to go online and make that application In any event, that's my understanding of where things seem to stand, but again we want to speak to the community board and find out what concerns you have our sources, though, as far as just the deserts, the designated areas that they that they identify as far as the town, that's going to be blocked off.
If that's, if that's what they going to be called outdoor dining permits to individual restaurants, That may well have been before there's any designation one way or the other as to whether they'll be also an open, Street area, and that, as far as what the open street would look like, that will again depend on what Theo T decides to grant, and you know it could be.
There was a letter that was included from Gale Brewer, so I didn't know if you wanted to just kind of add on what the what the perspective and even Sicily may be able to jump into just what al Brewer and our borough president's offices are viewpoints are when it comes to the designated feet area, but she's been expressing support in the open Street concept in general and supportive and open to have some aspect of it take place in Harlem and again, I It's a little bit confusing this interplay between open streets and the outdoor dining program, because you know we may have this week a lot of restaurants, all over New York City applying for outdoor dining permits.
We put the open streets application in, but the individual restaurant open, dining permits in you know in reality it's not be under FDA's control, Just, assuming that, if something happens, there's going to be restaurants, and if you look at you know, you guys forgot in Cerritos, Oh sugar court, You know if necessary and whatever information the guys that we have just put , there's a couple of other people here from Frederick Oaks Boulevard lines that Lieber bueno the owner of Vinatieri she's, our the vice president of the organization I'm co-president along with Suzanna contine, who could not be here this evening because she had a conflict I see we have Melvin Wilson, who was a member of F DBA and also the current president of the New York City hospitality alliance, the first female and first person of color to hold that row and I see Rosario Louie, the from NYU's Mac, silver Institute, former deputy borough president and a founding member of ft ba You know at any point they may have some definitely wanna I want to turn them in after I.
I think we all have to be mindful of those factors too we're looking at just the collective public safety piece, but just know too that, from the community standpoint we just have to make sure ensure that there are certain parameters or certain things that are that are in a liner or planning to be in line, because one thing that I don't want to see happen is that you know community board gives the support letter for this Some incident with you know with a kid walking through that area, So like you know, Harlem can thrive without that without the community residents, but it also can't drive without the businesses Are there, any other restaurant owner?
That would greatly benefit from the injection of support into those businesses, because we are very fearful, as with the rest of the catchment of CB 10, then we're gonna lose a lot of historic businesses We think this is a great opportunity to showcase not only restaurant row, but the gateway into Harlem in a way that it's safe That is a incorporates perspectives of the community, because we envision this organization very much like the downtown Alliance, which is an organization not only of merchants, but is an organization of community residents that we can do something that can be a way to come back out into the community that respects guidelines that have been set up by the city and state, but also is a way that I know that all of us are committed to in terms of showing support for small business organizations that helped to transform boulevards like Melba Mike 67 orange, like Chocolat, like mocha, like Bennett area, that invested and also live in the community.
First of all, I just like to say thank you all for coming today for week now, as I have always believed before I definitely do support our small businesses see if I need to put a head and I've also raised them to Manhattan borough Messaging is very outreach, is very important program, so so I appreciate that so I'm encouraged by the participation who's involved in this effort that they are familiar with our community, that they have always supported our community So with that some of the things that I are sorry talk to John about our concerns were, of course, the transportation and I know that the subway runs up and down that corridor So when you the subway as being a real alternative to the enemy and if you've actually had to take that bus down.
