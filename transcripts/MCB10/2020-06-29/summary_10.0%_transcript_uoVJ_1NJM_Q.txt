I, know a couple of folks said they were going to be late, but I wanted to give enough people to get on here.
Let's try taking All for agreeing to continue to meet over the summer Know how important it is for us to still come together and be still be a sounding board for the community.
All, the leadership and a community board can because I did call the priests in 32nd, $0.03 You know they have to do something about boating up that people can't get to rooftops in the housing and Nina Saxon, most certain.
If we could maybe get an attendance or a general amount of folks that might be out there, we will let them know, because we do wanted them to be able to social distance.
We got to ask questions that were actually posed by our community board and the general public.
Two things we signed on was several other community boards to support the extension of spectrum Wi-Fi, so they were giving free Wi-Fi that was supposed to end June 30th.
I know we always talk about conflict of interest, so it is a free training by the borough president's office.
Don't know if he sent it to all the community board members.
We were able to finalize our budget on some of the things that we purchased were an HD livestream camera that we received to support our meetings in the future and external hard drive so that the staff can work our remotely and have all their information stored on there.
Most of these are for the board members, but certain the book, bags etc, and the face mask will also be all distributed to residents in the community.
I know that the budget deadline is July 1st and the city is still trying to figure out arm What, where they're, going to cut different services so that they can make up the budget deficit, because the budget deficit that they project it for 2021 was originally seven point.
You did, you know, solicit that input arm, but we did not receive it from everybody, but that's okay, because you know understanding that there's not a lot go to the events, etc that we would have in the committee have in the community.
Hey we're gonna go ahead to the district manager, report, Thank I'm, everyone up thanks for your report, Cicely and Josh Alma I just want to start talking about on the test and trace core problem.
We haven't got word yet from the borough president's office when any of the community boards are allowed to go.
You know there was some information, then you receive with respect to persons who are bringing fireworks into the community.
There investigate you know, even if it becomes federal, where they're going from state to state to find out the actual source, because I guarantee you they're not just coming from one place, they're coming from different states, Thank You Charles.
I. Think, that before you report it I would say to you that you should say that they should If. They know these are the guys they should report it, because this is a serious thing in the community.
There's someone knowing that people are coming in our community.
It's just like with the with the drug thing, when people took over the community took over and start painting doors that they knew I'm, saying I would refer them Well.
But at the end of the day, I think we need to be able to ask the police to say here's the intelligence, here's the information, stop these things from coming into Brock, mewn, Josh, shadow, question, I, agree with you all by also think the police need to do their job and really investigate.
I would think that you need to talk to our people of safety committee on this, and that should not be a wide discussion.
We shouldn't be getting out of their car with young people What I think it need to be without the chair of our committee and with the leadership who is on the call today, I think they're closed meetings on because they're gonna be practicing social distance.
All of our EC meeting, have happened since the covent pandemic began and we have worked very hard with our community partners to make sure that we are there and that we know what is going on in our community.
And how it's going to affect our community I will be producing a resolution out of that and presenting it at the next Economic Development Committee meeting And We also had some liquor.
There was a committee vote that was done by email, Thank, You Chanel, for coming up with a process to still get these liquor licenses done for these businesses.
We have a little bit more information on them to present easy committee meeting If it's a renewal and the committee votes to have them before us, then they come before us We're trying to see new liquor license come before us so where we have already reached out to our neighborhood boule for them to present to us, So, I'm, not sure if they've reached back out or how that's gonna work, but we have reached out.
We are still in conversation to see if that's a feasible thing or even a needed thing, especially since these businesses are able to put out their own sidewalk cafes without going through an efficient process without submitting a plan or anything like that.
So in our minds with open, streets, Frederick Douglass Boulevard is not an option, however, because they are, you know making and because they are supporting their businesses, and we do want to support the small businesses.
He is preparing a letter of support for the exonerated five project so and that he said that he would able to be on a committee and did you ever get in touch with Daniel Patterson about the opportunity he wanted to talk?
Lower group butchers became the owner of the facilities, and so we've come up with an advisory, committee, aboah not all being from community bullet in, but we are proposing that we family members, as you know, from the meeting we had dealt us, have been working there for many years, and I was thinking.
If there's any questions, I will answer them, but it's very thoughtful and is taken in what we would like to see for our community to be involved and to report back and make sure that this never happened.
You know during this time, but I'm, assuming that by fall, things are going to pick up, as this is the new way of presenting proposals and Also.
You mentioned housing specialist, you mean housing specialist, like you, know, people who are professional and the industry, our housing specialists, the occupation, because I think it would be good to have housing specialists, the occupation there to give their experiences of trying to house folks and shelter with developer there, or and also management.
I, know that many lawyers and legal service organizations are preparing themselves for that pandemic, which is going to be the pandemic of people being brought before the housing.
We were able to speak to some of the new board members that could make it they are currently making their committee choices.
If you submit a committee, choices, new board members and you're all here, I did we see them, I'm, sorry, In that conversation, we were able to really talk to them, find out little bits and pieces about them.
