Let's try taking All for agreeing to continue to meet over the summer know how important it is for us to still come together and be still be a sounding board for the community Thank you so much first for doing that and agreeing to it.
All, the leadership and a community board can because I did call the priests in 32nd, $0.03 You know they have to do something about boating up that people can't get to rooftops in the housing and Nina Saxon, most certain and I couldn't remember when we do block parties when they come before the community board for block parties Did, they ever cut back on times for block parties and then there's been block parties who've been operating Why should we be penalized because there were a few blocks who are unable to control I'm the constituents on the block?
If we could maybe get an attendance or a general amount of folks that might be out there, we will let them know because we do wanted them to be able to social distance Recently we had a town hall with the borough president on all the Uptown boards.
We were responsible for small business services, so we talked to make a mini Lane mega Lena are with C and D ot, and we got to ask questions that were actually posed by our community board and the general public Also.
Yes, legal services We had a really good showing for that great conversation, I'm, not sure if that was taped, but Charles Johnson represented CB 10 as well as Jacob Richardson Two things we signed on was several other community boards to support the extension of spectrum Wi-Fi, so they were giving free Wi-Fi that was supposed to end June 30th.
Committee chairs, who reached out to me on one of those, was the book bags from the Education Committee You know, solicit that input arm, but we did not receive it from everybody, but that's okay, because you know understanding that there's not a lot go to the events, etc that we would have in the committee have in the community Could we do to just improve our operations and support the staff if they have to work remotely for an extended amount of time?
Next I'll, move on to transportation matters, the Harlem bike network expansion, I just received plans today that they're gonna have protected bike lanes all along the east side of Fifth Avenue from 110 Street to a hundred and twentieth Street Conversation has been going on before I even got on the community board, but dating back to 2017 has been ongoing.
Don't know, if you seen the protected bike lanes in midtown Manhattan, they have parking in the middle of the road I'll, send you the plans that I got today, so you can take a look at the UM design, New York City, we're now in Phase, two of reopening our businesses that may start to expand operations, include offices and store retail outdoor, dining, hair, salons and barbershops real estate, commercial building management, retail repair and cleaning vehicle sales.
The black lives matter will be on both sides of Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard from one hundred and twenty-fifth 427 Street Also, with the protest that's been going on, there's been a call to the fund on the police by the New York City Council has, since endorsed a plan to trim a 1 billion dollars from the department's budget, or currently the department spends 6 billion dollars annually and mayor de Blasio He said that he would shift funds from the police department to youth in social services, but he has rejected the 1 billion dollar number We don't know how much it is as of yet, but he did say that he wanted to give the money to youth for social services, such as the cure of violence, movement and I Think, two other things I have for any small businesses who have been affected by looting.
A God pulled up on my block and I asked one of the fellows on the black set home know who's those guys Those are some guys from Philly they're selling fireworks and then people come and buy what the fireworks in May left People on the street was saying: You know: people drive to Virginia They drive on Pennsylvania to get fireworks because they're illegal here They have to be coming from somewhere else, but I think the mayor's task force their job even if it becomes federal, where they're going from state to state to find out the actual source, because I guarantee you they're not just coming from one place: they're coming from different states, Thank You, Charles, I Think.
I know it's a difficult message, but the police is saying they can't get in the intelligence I think we need to be able to ask the police to say here's the intelligence, here's the information, stop these things from coming into Brock, mewn, Josh shadow question.
I was on my 16th Street yesterday and there were kids shooting off roman candles in the middle of the block between 101 16, between armed, a thousand and seven thousand They rolled behind these big giant like emergency service trucks , The car didn't talk to anybody in the community or actually running anything they just drove by I would think that you need to talk to our people of safety committee on this, and that should not be a wide discussion here.
We're not gonna, be doing their work, but we have to do our work as a community to do I just wanted to bring out one quick thing that I forgot to mention that on Thursdays, usually the third Thursday's I attend the borough, President meeting borough board meeting that includes the councilman and all the board chairs maybe some committee meetings but not have happened, but our Oliver Genoa meetings- all of our EC meeting, have happened since the covent pandemic began and we have worked very hard with our community partners to make sure that we are there and that we know what is going on in our community The bid one choice: tryst rebid street corner resources, warm all of those organizations working together and if you haven't had a chance to see the artwork on the 125th Street buildings that the bid has put up the black chalk words, , May , for positive messages.
You'll be surprised, that's your own implicit bias, but we're looking at maybe coordinating with them, and you a session for community boards to talk about our own implicit biases, because we need to deal with the things that are going on and then we will be able to going on inside of us with us, and then we will be able to influence the community I'm gonna, move on to attendance and quorum Kevin door, so we'll jump right in I'll start with the running down the list of the names of officers and committee chairs and afterwards, if there are any vice chairs present in place of chairs, you can give me your names afterwards, So we'll start the roll call.
The chair mentioned the FT, the Frederick Douglass Boulevard association proposal or open streets from one twelve to one twenty second Barbara askins also provided grant opportunities and how it's going to affect our community I will be producing a resolution out of that and presenting it at the next Economic Development Committee meeting and There was a committee vote that was done by email Shanell devised a way for her committee to vote, even though it's not an official vote, but it is a chance for them to give an opinion before they come to EC, and then the EC will have to vote on those liquor licenses and in these cases, I believe in potty bistros case it will be a waiver and it just gives them additional time to submit their official liquor license application Is that a new one or is that because I know it's a coffee, shop?
But we're also worried about the security of this We. Don't want to say policing that, as in making sure that it's safe for everyone to be out there, we know with sidewalk cafes, there have been incidents where people's perceive and stolen and things like that.
There was a unanimous vote, yes and also for hold on Let me just try to bring this up okay and also for whether they would like to present to the committee only for people like for them to come before.
The lower group butchers became the owner of the facilities, and so we've come up with an advisory committee, aboah not all being from community bullet in, but we are proposing that we family members, as you know, from the meeting we had dealt us- have been working there for many years That was provided from the members that you would approve us going forward with that I will answer them, but it's very thoughtful and is taken in what we would like to see for our community to be involved and to report back and make sure that this never happened again.
You know during this time, but I'm assuming that by fall, things are going to pick up as this is the new way of presenting proposals and also the advanced land-use training sponsored by the borough president's office is next Monday from 6 to 8, because that's the information, if you remember from Lennox terrorists, we really need to understand zoning and all the implications around that That's.
If you submit a committee choices, new board members and you're all here In that conversation, we were able to really talk to them, find out little bits and pieces about them.
