She are also a member of community for 10 and civil rights attorney here in New, York City, Thank, You, Powell I am the second vice- chair of Community, Board, Tan and also the chair of the Housing Committee, and grateful to be able to join this conversation regarding our beloved exonerated thought : Would, you introduce yourself yes, housing and Health and Human Services, Committee?
Can you go to the all right and on to seek the 10th of June at the outcome of our meeting in terms of next steps was first to find out what the status of the RFP, the Lincoln Correctional Facility, located at 31- 33, West, 110 Street, and to find out who was on the Community Advisory Board for the RFP process?
The land Use Committee was going to offer support in terms of an amendment to our current Parks and Recreation resolution, and we discussed launching a massive media campaign and gathering letters of support.
There was a point in time as they send in a Brian Benjamin, along with representatives from Empire State Development Corporation was seeking to gather information from our community with respect to what would happen with Lincoln Correctional Facility following its closure.
You know, as indicated, that members of the alcohol them the Harry Belafonte group, you know, has been meeting you know and the gentlemen in Karen I have not gotten around to sending you the contact information which I'll do his name Marian syllabus Marian Phillips has been communicating with Curtis Archer, who was our local representative of Empire State through the Heartland Community Development Corporation about what's contemplated or plan, but I think over 19 has really impacted.
You know to weigh in I've, asked him to give me an update and schedule something with this group where Mr. Phillips or a senior representative from Empire State Development can come on and tell us what you we should be doing to try to connect the dots between the exonerated five exhibit and what's contemplated for Lincoln correctional, as I said to Karen, the other day.
I am prayerful and hopeful that this tremendous you know initiative for The, Exonerated, Phibes, permanent, interactive, exhibit in Central Park does not get waylaid or dragged down by whatever is going to happen with Lincoln I'd hate to see anything be delay on the basis of what will happen, then, with Lincoln correctional, so Karen.
We also asked Echo Dev to become involved, because this may become an issue that echo Dev would have to deal which side That, Charles was saying in regards to the plans, so I just want to make sure I'm hearing correctly this the project for The Exonerated, five that is going to happen in Central Park separate from the Lincoln project.
I, will just want to make sure what I'm hearing is that the Central Park exonerated project once they include some sort of thing happening with Lincoln right, would like, for whatever exhibit that takes place in Central Park to be interactive.
I think the whole situation with Lincoln correctional is very convoluted and it does not reflect how we at community boards and like to approach things Others, you know on our executive, committee, you're, absolutely correct.
What I'm, simply saying is that with New York State in Covid-19, nineteen and budget considerations, I do not know what's being planned or contemplated for Lincoln correctional, but I do know that the great work that's already been done and what will continue to be done on this?
You know for us to move forward with the exonerated fire project and in my understanding, in the last meeting If we are there, we had some discussion about putting out, in fact that we wanted the Lincoln facility to be the Justice Center to the community.
We have not taken any sort of position on that other than a number of organizations, and you know even the borough president has presented things before us, but there's not been a firm resolution or decision by the community board as to the overall picture of linking Correctional.
We do not even know what our ask is going to be I, just like to say also I, just like see also in terms of continuity with exhibits in the park.
But, okay, Thank, You, Terry I, just like to say that the focus of this subcommittee is the exhibit in Central Park, And. If you just read the notes, the minutes, we this just came as an outgrowth of the computation, but our focus and that's why we're saying we're looking to move that aspect to Echo dev, because that's not within this Committee's purview.
Cp, for a letter of support, and these letters of support will go to the Central Park Conservancy in the New York City Parks Department, stating that this community would like to see this project in the park.
We actually worked with him on a panel recently around criminal justice reform in New York, and he just is wonderful, Well I think for a lay audience at a recent event that we did He could speak to because our discussion would be about what this exhibit would not the contents of this exhibit and what message we trying to convey and what education were trying to put out there.
A racial justice expert There are many great people Imagine when we're doing something like this we're going to open it up as well to the community to get some sort of community involvement, and, in this conversation regarding you know.
What's going to be happening, Not, necessarily, what's going to be happening to invite them in to participate with in the conversation once everything is set, up, and you know, in working towards getting a time of visibility and all that kind of stuff, cuz I would imagine it would take what a few weeks to a month or so to kind of pull all of this kind of stuff together and to have one on board.
We all have ideas in terms of how we see this type of any of an exhibit being something maybe not necessarily like strawberry fields, but something around that type of issue where people are drawn into the space and there are different things as happening within the space that are that people can go for once comment to another and, let's say, grow within the space and come back and experience different things at different times as they interact with a space and its surroundings.
In terms of you, know, people who are able to do these types of works and pull these types of things together against structurally and trying to figure out even a site for it to be within the park, becomes kind of I.
If that statues are low, are they able are the children or people coming through able to touch these statues, because sometimes the size makes it more humane, as you're looking at a space and if you're interacting within the space, you know all those types of things in terms of how the space would work within a specific area within the park.
It now makes perfect sense in terms of she just gave us an insight as to some limitations of Central Park, you know, and that now you know, I mean a light, went off in my head to be able to say that's the extension to the possibility of a place like Lincoln correction, because if you've been in my gun, if you know Brian Steve's, there's equal justice, you know, there's a tremendous.
A technology component to it in terms of interactive right part of what happened in Central Park Families might not have been informed of the laws and things like that and what came out of Central Park five was a lot of Lords, so I think those should definitely be highlighted and somehow incorporated in some type of technological experience where young people learn about what laws came out of that experience and what happened and what's in place now from that experience.
We need to speak to everyone, but we also need to figure out where it is that we want this exhibit to be because we have to think of a space, because you know that space would close to the Harlem is going to change dramatically.
We can begin to have those discussions as to where things can go and what we, what we can do within the park and Karen I, just had a couple of just tiny ideas that I just wanted to make sure I did not forget just because I love the idea of having an artist I do not know how people feel about maybe Kara Walker, but You, know she's done really.
I think just kind of around a lot of these issues and sort of confronting stereotypes which also like brings me to possibly a discussion idea, which is why people of color do not have the presumption of innocence in this country and how the until part 5 did not have, or the exonerated five never enjoyed the presumption of innocence.
Words like Wilding came up, and nobody even ever heard of that who was from the community I mean children went to Central Park East, which was right there on 106 and went to school in that building.
, I mean that kind of thing is done all the time, but it seems like one of the initial panels or one of the initial people that has to be on it is the parks Department, because we need to have a part specialist arranger.
If we do something with the parks Department, it's more like a question- and- answer, session, an informational session where there is a discussion of what we're going to do, what we're going to focus on if we split it based on logistics, the requirements the permit at the time, those technicalities that can probably all be accomplished with one panel, and we would hear from the Parks Department in terms of what that's going to require the land- use to for men or anyone else from those respective agencies.
Yes, okay, what he just said, and this is why I was mostly styling up until this point is I, mean I, emphatically support what he just said: But what is taking place right, now, I'm, going to say a few things, one I think it was the young lady, Donna.
You know, in effect, you know, create a gentrification issue in part affect the surrounding community and the speak to what I think it was Chanel Said, because I grew up part of my life, while 113Th Street I'm, said to them that Park was always for forbidding place for people of color up and then into the community, because it never seemed like it was designed in part for us.
Now they were supportive, and this is how the Lincoln conversation came up even prior to this being brought up in the meeting That they were in support of engaging with that, but that Park part I can tell you and that's why I was just going to ask you before everybody gets excited about what we would like to see.
Let's want to just circumvent going through the New York City Parks Department I do not know how you do that to get a project in Central Park, and that is our focus.
They can answer some questions as well, but all of those things can be worked out as soon as we figure out the type of people that we need to have on the panel with in this conversation, and once you have that, then you just start filling our name, giving out the numbers in terms of that cuz.
What do we need to put you know, but there are certainly parts of the park that probably are not available at all because of whatever That is the only reason that we have right now for wanting to talk with New York City parts and Central Park Conservancy, just to identify the space.
So I just like to you know just to get an idea with where this committee wants to go because Some people do not want to work with Central Park Conservancy in New York City Parks Department, but they have to tell us where we can put the exhibit so or give us some ideas where it can go and how we have to adhere to the context of the cart.
But you know in terms of having people to have some sort of walking around space.
Other people can come and you know have a few benches in the space one person could be looking at one part of the exhibit in the park.
Maybe we should have more clarity in terms of what it is we want, so that when we introduce it or talk to them, we have a more concise vision of what needs to be happening to satisfy our community needs within the space in the park.
We would like to see in the space and then do the walkthrough perhaps and identify the space once we know what the concept, okay, I'm thinking, Community board 11, because they had the whole thing about the Sim statue in that area on the West, side.
You know I'm saddened to hear that people are saying that the conservatory is not going to do what we expect them to do, and we know that, But I still believe that we still have to go to them to get the rights to do this or to get permission to do this in the park, because they are, after all, the people that run that space, but I think if we have more community involvement, as far as like community board 11 and maybe 7 or 9 on both sides of the park.
Another group that you're talking with about the fund development plan, know and the structure, but I do not think we're going to do it by committee.
A lot of that will depend on who you are inviting to the table in terms of these conversations, because some people will be able to help publicize that this is going on, that money will be needed and all that kind of stuff will fall into place, and it just is, in my opinion.
We could get together one day and just you know, walk around in the park and look at locations and come up with an idea for what a space might be so granted the space and the size of the space May or may not be acceptable, but at least you're going out with them with a plan and With the plan we're working around the issues that needs to be achieved to get the stuff done.
At least it puts you in the in the process of trying to control some of the conversation and trying to let them know that you want X Y Z amount of space and that space is more than a plaque that says Central Park five.
