There was a point in time as they send in a Brian Benjamin, along with representatives from Empire State Development Corporation was seeking to gather information from our community with respect to what would happen with Lincoln Correctional Facility following its closure As. Everyone knows that is a state facility and therefore the land is owned by New York State, Covid-19, 19 The only thing that I can say you know that you know everyone agrees on is that it should not be some kind of market housing, and you know Rikers Island, the women's Correctional Facility about a re-entry program You know as indicated that members of the alcohol them the Harry Belafonte group, you know, has been meeting you know and the gentlemen in Karen I haven't gotten around to sending you the contact information which I'll do his name.
You know to weigh in I've, asked him to give me an update and schedule something with this group where mr Phillips or a senior representative from Empire State Development, can come on and tell us what you we should be doing to try to connect the dots between the exonerated five exhibit and what's contemplated for Lincoln correctional, as I said to Karen the other day, I'd hate to see anything be delay on the basis of what will happen, then, with Lincoln correctional, so Karen So much Charles and I just like to say that we did who were sending the resolution to Marion Phillips We were able to get some contact information We also asked echo dev to become involved, because this may become an issue that echo dev would have to deal which side Charles was saying in regards to the plans, so I just want to make sure I'm hearing correctly this the project for The Exonerated, five, that is gonna happen in Central Park separate from the Lincoln project.
I will just want to make sure what I'm hearing is that the Central Park exonerated project once they include some sort of thing happening with Lincoln right would like, for whatever exhibit that takes place in Central Park to be interactive with the Social Justice Center right Are. We for sure that it's gonna be a social justice, Center and I heard mr Powell mentioned that all these people, who I'm just gonna, be honest with you Let me go on into the park because what was happening in my neighborhood but to watch all these other people have opinions on what should happen, and you know people like me sit on the board, so I am from I Am a cloth of this community What's your question again, you own the committee's that they're speaking about in terms of state or whatever they are talking about.
You know on our executive committee, you're, absolutely correct, I, don't think that that's anywhere near any point of real, you know and you know, answer some accountability as to what's going to happen with that site and that's why I said that as far as I'm concerned, the exonerated five project is a train that has already left the station and the Lincoln correctional project Yet. That's all keeping it separate right because I agree with Charles that you don't use the exonerated five project trying to run after Lincoln, because negative gonna be a mess and everybody would claim it because we're in that space right now.
None of that has in fact been solidified to the extent where it's ripe enough for us, as a community board, to even weigh in Yes. Of course, I think it makes sense that whatever we do in Central Park, we want an extension to Lincoln correctional or an extension to the Museum of the City of New York or an extension to any of a number of things that are contiguous.
I may have misunderstood everything, but I was thinking that we were trying to get the building and create like a whole surrounding project that had to be exonerated five that had libraries, museums, places Kids that come you know so I may have misunderstood that, I just like to say that the focus of this subcommittee is the exhibit in Central Park.
You know if it'll have be able to contain a seating space or a drawing board, or you know if, let's say, if you're doing statues, if statues are high, if that statues are low, are they able are the children or people coming through able to touch these statues, because sometimes the size makes it more humane, as you're looking at a space and if you're interacting within the space, you know all those types of things in terms of how the space would work within a specific area within the park So. Would you fit into our community's perspective because you'd still want it to be something that speaks to the Harlem community and what our perspective is on these issues?
It now makes perfect sense in terms of she just gave us an insight as to some limitations of Central Park, you know, and that now you know, I mean a light, went off in my head to be able to say that's the extension to the possibility of a place like Lincoln correction, because if you've been in my gun, if you know Brian Steve's, there's equal justice, you know there's a tremendous and so I think she just crystallized the fact that we need to bring together this community board.
You know, but definitely our media, because there's like a black out We had a march last Sunday with 2,000 people that the clergy day You know with drum drumming, and you know the police department on horseback and I think that that's very critical That was a good idea to have them come in, but we know that, even in terms of some of the things that have happened in the selection of different museums, even like the Civil Rights Museum, we need to assure that people of color are involved in this People.
A Families might not have been informed of the laws and things like that and what came out of Central Park five was a lot of Lords, so I think those should definitely be highlighted and somehow incorporated in some type of technological experience where young people learn about what laws came out of that experience and what happened and what's in place.
So you can go and you can stand with someone's fine ones or will want someone business, or you know that sort of things and so I watch my neighbors fight as I grew up for that garden and the only time they decided that they would give up the garden So. We all know there's no African Museum there is that any way that we can get that space for and that's an issue and that's why we're bringing it to your committee facility, but our focus is the exhibit in the our Ohana As mr Lumm, so craftily said, where we're going to have this memorial is something that we're going to have to figure out, and we have to keep in mind that the conservatory already has plans to redo the harlem mayor and the director skating ring We need to speak to everyone, but we also need to figure out where it is that we want this exhibit to be because we have to think of a space, because you know that space would close to the Harlem is going to change dramatically already they've come to the community That's a consideration that we'll have to be thinking about when we're thinking about place where we want to be that missile arm could choose that space Well whatever we can have a discovery, can't have a discussion about the space selection, but whatever goes on has to be sanctioned by the Central Park Conservancy, and we have to have that discussion with them.
We can begin to have those discussions as to where things can go and what we, what we can do within the park and just because I love the idea of having an artist I, don't know how people feel about maybe Kara Walker but I think just kind of around a lot of these issues and sort of confronting stereotypes which also like brings me to possibly a discussion idea, which is why people of color don't have the presumption of innocence in this country and how the until part, 5 didn't have or the exonerated five never enjoyed.
Words like Wilding came up, and nobody even ever heard of that who was from the community I mean children went to Central Park East, which was right there on 106 and went to school in that building, Nobody even heard a Wylie, but that became a media catch were you know, and suddenly people were talking about it.
You might have one on the criminal justice system We might have one on the after-effects of tackling the impact on the community could be like a whole Well I, don't want to say a series, but something similar to a serious type of thing where people could come in and out or even participate in each one where they want run in consecutive days to work Your way through that, as you reach out to the various community players in terms of all of this I mean that kind of thing is done all the time, but it seems like one of the initial panels, or one of the initial people that has to be on This is incredible that we could bring in a lot of different experts, but I think it should be community experts , You, know kind of zoom in here and focus on who we would like to have on an initial panel, maybe four or five or six four to six people on a panel Once.
It's more like a question-and-answer session, an informational session where there is a discussion of what we're gonna, do what we're gonna focus on if we split it based on logistics, the requirements the permit at the time, those technicalities that can probably all be accomplished with one panel, and we would hear from the parks department in terms of what that's gonna require the land-use to for men or anyone else from those respective agencies Then we can dive into the substantive panel about different topics that we would want the exhibit to actually focus on and consider Then we can still prepare for those now in terms of collecting people that are representative of the community and representative of the message that we're trying to accomplish, with the exhibit I, see I Think, that again in terms of logistics and what goes on in the park, we can have Central Park Conservancy as a panelist, someone from New York City Parks Department as a panelist, so that takes care of the park.
You know, in effect, you know, create a gentrification issue in part affect the surrounding community and the speak to what I think it was Chanel said because I grew up part of my life, while 113th Street I'm said to them that Park was always for forbidding place for people of color up and then into the community, because it never seemed like it was designed in part for us Now they were supportive, and this is how the Lincoln conversation came up even prior to this being brought up in the meeting was that they were in support of engaging with that, but that Park part I can tell you and that's why I was just gonna I think you need to have a conversation with CDC to see where they stand and then decide on how we are going to attack this, because I can tell you that they didn't sound.
Don't want to speak to that because that's a decision that you know the board would have to make, but in terms of working in the conference of what they do, that management contract is something that should be looked into, because it should be open to people of color and especially from the community, and they are people that are up there to have those capabilities Here , for instance, they exonerated five Yusuf, has a doctorate, 'no snow Now. He may not have a doctorate in management, but he can partner with our management company in harlem, and you telling me that they can't manage that or at least be in the conversation.
We need them speaking this into existence so that they don't like and prints a just do whatever they want, and that's only gonna happen if we can't get our leaders to support this initiative and really be behind what this committee or body that incorporates the family of the Central Park five would like to see So it's harder to reach people unless you have a better number than what I would have to reach out to some of it We are trying to get support from as many as possible to come on board, if not to send their representatives on board as well, and we've also been reaching out not only to the politicians but to the religious communities who have a large population that goes in the attorney can bring them on board as well.
So I just like to you know just to get an idea with where this committee wants to go because Some people don't want to work with Central Park Conservancy in New York City Parks Department, but they have to tell us where we can put the exhibit so or give us some ideas where it can go and how we have to adhere to the context of the cart.
So different aspects of the movement happened in different spots along the park: okay, but if you're talking about a unified kind of area, my thinking in terms of the location is like you know : Where is a flat space that might be I'm, not really good on sizes, but let's say five hundred square feet, 250 square feet and believe me: I have no idea what these were feats, but you know in terms of having people to have some sort of walking around space.
That's what, in terms of my thinking, that's where the panel discussion would come in to come up with some ideas, some concept we would like to see in the space and then do the walkthrough perhaps and identify the space once we know what the concept, okay, I'm thinking community board 11, because they had the whole thing about the sim statue in that area on the west side.
The parks, your community chip manager that you chair and basically look at maybe segmenting the different pieces of this there's another group that you're talking with about the fund development plan, know and the structure, but I, don't think we're gonna.
How much money we were able to raise is gonna really impact What that design Then we can begin to talk about the technical aspects, like the support of the elected officials, the funding and all that sort of thing, but if we could just get a concept off the ground at this point, I'm thinking that you know that's being progressive and So, that's what the right should we go after public opinion Do. We want to do something that brings the idea forth to the public that this is something that's in progress or in negotiation.
You know what I'm saying so on this day, you might want to talk about the an introduction to the overarching concept of the project would be, let's say, the first piece, then the second piece would be kind of a slimming down that process in and moving forward slimming it down to a point where you kind of crystallizing it, and then the third piece is now We need to introduce, bringing in let's say the parks, department or whoever it is to get involved in terms of moving forward, because we've done our due diligence in terms of figuring out certain things, because preprints was good in terms of when he was saying how people who are down in this area get together Maybe.
At least it puts you in the in the process of trying to control some of the conversation and trying to let them know that you want X Y Z amount of space and that space is more than a plaque that says Central Park five, absolutely you see so we wire up the conversation into a more of an arena, but the main thing that you need to come out with to here tonight is a date and You have some people here.
