She are also a member of community for 10 and civil rights attorney here in New, York City, Thank, You, I am the second vice-chair of community board tan and also the chair of the Housing Committee, and grateful to be able to join this conversation regarding our beloved exonerated thought: Would, you introduce yourself yes, housing and Health and Human Services, Committee?
Can you go to the next slide, all right and on to seek the 10th of June at the outcome of our meeting in terms of next steps was first to find out what the status of the RFP, the Lincoln Correctional Facility, located at 31-33 West 110 Street, and to find out who was on the Community Advisory Board for the RFP process?
The land use committee was going to offer support in terms of an amendment to our current Parks and Recreation resolution, and we discussed launching a massive media campaign and gathering letters of support.
There was a point in time as they send in a Brian Benjamin, along with representatives from Empire State Development Corporation was seeking to gather information from our community with respect to what would happen with Lincoln Correctional Facility following its closure.
Phillips or a senior representative from Empire State Development can come on and tell us what you we should be doing to try to connect the dots between the exonerated five exhibit and what's contemplated for Lincoln correctional, as I said to Karen the other day.
We also asked echo dev to become involved, because this may become an issue that echo dev would have to deal which side That, Charles was saying in regards to the plans, so I just want to make sure I'm hearing correctly this the project for The Exonerated, five, That is gonna happen in Central Park separate from the Lincoln project.
I will just want to make sure what I'm hearing is that the Central Park exonerated project once they include some sort of thing happening with Lincoln right, would like, for whatever exhibit that takes place in Central Park to be interactive with the Social Justice Center right.
I think the whole situation with Lincoln correctional is very convoluted and it does not reflect how we at community boards and like to approach things Others, you know on our executive, committee, you're, absolutely correct, I, don't think that that's anywhere near any point of real, you know planning Don't issue an RFP until you've heard you know from us You know, answer some accountability as to what's going to happen with that site.
That is our community, and we will not, you know, go peacefully, What I'm, simply saying is that with New York State in covert nineteen and budget considerations, I, don't know what's being planned or contemplated for Lincoln correctional, but I do know that the great work that's already been done and what will continue to be done on this?
You know for us to move forward with the exonerated fire project and, in my understanding, in the last meeting If we are there, we had some discussion about putting out, in fact that we wanted the Lincoln facility to be the Justice Center to the community.
We have not taken any sort of position on that other than a number of organizations, and you know even the borough president has presented things before us, but there's not been a firm resolution or decision by the community board as to the overall picture of linking Correctional.
But, okay, Thank, You, Terry I, just like to say that the focus of this subcommittee is the exhibit in Central Park, And. If you just read the notes, the minutes, we this just came as an outgrowth of the computation, but our focus and that's why we're saying we're looking to move that aspect to Echo dev, because that's not within this Committee's purview.
We've also are going to reach out to the n-double-a-cp for a letter of support, and these letters of support will go to the Central Park Conservancy in the New York City Parks Department, stating that this community would like to see this project in the park.
We all have ideas in terms of how we see this type of any of an exhibit being something maybe not necessarily like strawberry fields, but something around that type of issue where people are drawn into the space and there are different things as happening within the space that are that people can go for once comment to another and, let's say, grow within the space and come back and experience different things at different times as they interact with a space and its surroundings.
In terms of you, know, people who are able to do these types of works and pull these types of things together against structurally and trying to figure out even a site for it to be within the park, becomes kind of I.
Guess part of these strategic planning kind of thing, because I know right here: : I get intense street when you enter the park.
If that statues are low, are they able are the children or people coming through able to touch these statues, because sometimes the size makes it more humane, as you're looking at a space and if you're interacting within the space, you know all those types of things in terms of how the space would work within a specific area within the park.
It now makes perfect sense in terms of she just gave us an insight as to some limitations of Central Park, you know, and that now you know, I mean a light, went off in my head to be able to say that's the extension to the possibility of a place like Lincoln correction, because if you've been in my gun, if you know Brian Steve's, there's equal justice, you know, there's a tremendous.
A Families might not have been informed of the laws and things like that and what came out of Central Park five was a lot of Lords, so I think those should definitely be highlighted and somehow incorporated in some type of technological experience where young people learn about what laws came out of that experience and what happened and what's in place now from that experience.
We need to speak to everyone, but we also need to figure out where it is that we want this exhibit to be because we have to think of a space, because you know that space would close to the Harlem is going to change dramatically.
Ask that letters go out from elected officials such as the borough president Gale Brewer, and we're looking at also getting a letter from Senator, Bryan, Benjamin and whoever you know we can get letters from, but and also we're getting we reached out to the DA's office and NYPD community relations and those letters will go to the Central Park Conservancy.
We can begin to have those discussions as to where things can go and what we, what we can do within the park and Just, because I love the idea of having an artist I, don't know how people feel about maybe Kara Walker, but I think just kind of around a lot of these issues and sort of confronting stereotypes which also like brings me to possibly a discussion idea, which is why people of color don't have the presumption of innocence in this country and how the until part, 5 didn't have or the exonerated five never enjoyed.
That means the help, for you is not readily available because as an innocent person, you don't really need any help, because this also speaks to people being able to speak on the impact of this on the community.
I. Don't know if you can talk to that, because that's like a social service, but they think that's definitely talked about its impact on innocent people who go through this process.
The fact that you know these horrible things happen and this country doesn't change or doesn't change substantially right, And I think maybe some current young youth leaders from Harlem to engage the community could be really interesting.
Words like Wilding came up, and nobody even ever heard of that who was from the community I mean children went to Central Park East, which was right there on 106 and went to school in that building.
, I mean that kind of thing is done all the time, but it seems like one of the initial panels or one of the initial people that has to be on.
You know, in effect, you know, create a gentrification issue in part affect the surrounding community and the speak to what I think it was Chanel Said, because I grew up part of my life, while 113th Street I'm said to them that Park was always for forbidding place for people of color up and then into the community, because it never seemed like it was designed in part for us and I.
I think you need to have a conversation with CDC to see where they stand and then decide on how we are going to attack this, because I can tell you that they didn't sound like you know, as he said.
Don't want to speak to that because that's a decision that you know the board would have to make, but in terms of working in the conference of what they do.
They can answer some questions as well, but all of those things can be worked out as soon as we figure out the type of people that we need to have on the panel with in this conversation, and once you have that, then you just start filling our name, giving out the numbers in terms of that cuz.
The only reason that we have right now for wanting to talk with New York City parts and Central Park Conservancy, just to identify the space.
So I just like to you know just to get an idea with where this committee wants to go because Some people don't want to work with Central Park Conservancy in New York City Parks Department, but they have to tell us where we can put the exhibit so or give us some ideas where it can go and how we have to adhere to the context of the cart.
So different aspects of the movement happened in different spots along the park: okay, But if you're talking about a unified kind of area, my thinking in terms of the location is like you.
But you know in terms of having people to have some sort of walking around space.
Other people can come and you know have a few benches in the space one person could be looking at one part of the exhibit in the park.
Maybe we should have more clarity in terms of what it is we want, so that when we introduce it or talk to them, we have a more concise vision of what needs to be happening to satisfy our community needs within the space in the park.
We would like to see in the space and then do the walkthrough perhaps and identify the space once we know what the concept- okay, I'm thinking community board 11, because they had the whole thing about the sim statue in that area on the west, side.
You know, and within this forum that we have for what this panel discussion, which we probably were thinking about a broad one initially, which can I I, think I, don't think you're gonna be able to do to decide that by committee or at least a group, this large- And I think that it might make some sense to go back to the committee, the parks, your community chip manager that you chair and basically look at, maybe segmenting the different pieces of this.
A lot of that will depend on who you are inviting to the table in terms of these conversations, because some people will be able to help publicize that this is going on, that money will be needed and all that kind of stuff will fall into place, and it just is, in my opinion.
Whatever the time is going to be, people need to know when these dates are and then, as we meeting.
You might want to talk about the an introduction to the overarching concept of the project: Would be, let's say, the first piece, then the second piece would be kind of a slimming down that process in and moving forward slimming it down to a point where you kind of crystallizing it, and then the third piece is now We need to introduce, bringing in let's say the parks, department or whoever it is to get involved in terms of moving forward, because we've done our due diligence in terms of figuring out certain things, because preprints was good in terms of when he was saying how people who are down in this area get together.
At least it puts you in the in the process of trying to control some of the conversation and trying to let them know that you want X Y Z amount of space and that space is more than a plaque that says Central Park five.
