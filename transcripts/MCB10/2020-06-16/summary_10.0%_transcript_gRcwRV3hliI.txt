The members of the committee introduced himself I'm hazel Duke, chair of CBT in Health and Human Service Committee pleasure to meet you miss dukes, good evening, Michelle Booker vice chair and Health, and Human Services So I do not know why everyone is if everyone is familiar with the fact that what has come to light with Cove in 19 is the level of health disparities that is affecting people of color, but more specifically, and especially black people, in this community and in the country in general.
We recommend to our Executive Committee, and then we go to our public at our meetings and present, and there is A lot of person still think their rights are being taken away from them by telling them when they smoke and when not to so.
Thank you for your presentation and we will continue to discuss the issue among and see what education I believe during my absence that there was presented that we would have maybe our health forum to further educate our community, and especially our young people, about this cause of death.
But hopefully you can talk about it internally and feel interested, but we just wanted to reach out so quick because of the momentum, because everybody right now he's very triggered and primed, and you know how it is when people are open, the best thing is to do is to enter before they close again.
You know when I said young I mean the millennium age group and that kind of thing- We know the data we know when children start smoking, young people start so You know one thing: Doctor dudes like listening all the feedback You know this constant, dramatic police brutality, but in another way we have a corporation that has robbed so many of us about breath.
I was pushing Michele and John, probably further than they were originally comfortable with in terms of the some of the things we had in the resolution, Maybe, even like something I'm working with for the state, we're actually using a comic book series to get some of our messages out around Covid-19 and some other messaging.
I agreed I had a meeting of Friday night just to go over what had been submitted to me and asked that she teach that all of you have it and what our discussion tonight I think should be around other groups, other people that should be at it.
We were tasked with Dr., Smith and I, with submitting a outline of areas that we would like to address with the various long- term care facilities in the CB 10 on community, and so initially as Dr. Dukes alluded.
The discussion was that we would create an outline for what a Community Advisory Board would look like, and so in our conversations, Dr. Smith and I agreed that we would not just look at Harlem, but we should also look at I believe the other facilities arch care in the community, and we laid out a framework that said that we would.
They have been in the facility for forty years and during that time they work closely with the different leadership in the facility, and so we recognize that each location may have a different of different constituents or community partners, and so we wanted to one of those memberships open to that entity.
We wanted to not just focus the focus of attention right, now, maybe specifically on the Harlem facility, but we do not know what's going on in arch care.
My concern is that nursing homes are regulated by the state and such that you know.
It's a group and they have most of their homes in Brooklyn So we can get as much community involvement and the kind of things we would want.
So I just wanted to listen to see because I know one of my seniors that visit the nursing home all the time.
They may need I mean the good old telephone still works as a point of communication for family members to be able to communicate with loved ones and know about their well- being so somehow.
Okay, I just want to say you guys, really did a good job on this I'm glad that you're bringing the senior citizens into this, but I think that you know just piggybacking on what Mary said.
Other thing I'd like to mention is that the grave in New, York, Hospital Association also has an arm that deals specifically with the nonprofit nursing homes in the area.
And when I was in college, I actually worked out a CCRC that included on Ausmus and a nursing home, How. Some of these facilities often profit over the well- being of senior citizens.
The people who run the nursing home as I said, do not want to play this day out.
