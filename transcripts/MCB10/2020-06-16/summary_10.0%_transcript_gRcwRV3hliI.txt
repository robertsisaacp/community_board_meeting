Let me the members of the committee introduced himself, So I, don't know why everyone is if everyone is familiar with the fact that what has come to light with Cove in 19 is the level of health disparities that is affecting people of color, but more specifically, and especially black people, in this community and in the country in general.
Long I'm gonna go ahead and send it to you all, so you could watch it, but what we would want to do is we can invite community members and do a sort of a room talkback where we talk about the film.
We recommend to our Executive Committee, and then we go to our public at our meetings and present, and there is So. Thank you for your presentation and we will continue to discuss the issue among and see what education I believe during my absence that there was presented that we would have maybe our health forum to further educate our community, and especially our young people, about this cause of death.
Is, you know, the film leaves you to just watch and come to your own conclusion, and the talkback is just another way to raise awareness and have conversations and get people's questions answered.
But hopefully you can talk about it internally and feel interested, but we just wanted to reach out so quick because of the momentum, because everybody right now he's very triggered and primed, and you know how it is when people are open, the best thing is to do is to enter before they close again.
I was pushing Michele and John, probably further than they were originally comfortable with in terms of the some of the things we had in the resolution, Maybe, even like something I'm working with for the state, we're actually using a comic book series to get some of our messages out around kovat and some other messaging.
Smith and I with submitting a outline of areas that we would like to address with the various long-term care facilities in the CB 10 on community, and so initially.
They have been in the facility for forty years and during that time they work closely with the different leadership in the facility, and so we recognize that each location may have a different of different constituents or community partners, and so we wanted to one of those memberships open to that entity.
Maybe specifically on the Harlem facility, but we don't know what's going on in arch care, so we wanted to make sure that this Community Advisory for long-term care was not just focused on one but really protecting our community for all any long-term care.
I. Think that was probably the main thing that we wanted to do, and one of the other thing that you'll find in the document is the fact that we came up with some focus questions that we wanted to one invite any of the long-term care facilities in our district to come to present to us again, but prior to their arrival.
My concern is that nursing homes are regulated by the state and such that you know.
I, don't like to have a meeting, and then people come to the executive committee or come to the membership meeting and start asking questions, and so that's why I did it the way that it has been done?
I, just didn't: see, senior, representation, good point, okay, So I just wanted to listen to see because I know one of my seniors that visit the nursing home.
They may need I mean the good old telephone still works as a point of communication for family members to be able to communicate with loved ones and know about their well-being.
Dukes, the other thing I'd like to mention is that the grave in New, York, Hospital Association also has an arm that deals specifically with the nonprofit nursing homes in the area.
And when I was in college, I actually worked out a CCRC that included on Ausmus and a nursing home, How. Some of these facilities often profit over the well-being of senior citizens.
The people who run the nursing home as I said, do not want to play this day out, so the staff isn't paid properly.
