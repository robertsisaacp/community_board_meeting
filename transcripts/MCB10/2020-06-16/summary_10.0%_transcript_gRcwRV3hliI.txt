Let me, the members of the committee introduced himself, So I, don't know why everyone is if everyone is familiar with the fact that what has come to light with Cove in 19 is the level of health disparities that is affecting people of color, but more specifically, and especially black people in this community and in the country in general.
We, don't take any tobacco money Reverend, but I have demonstrated to take signs down in Harlem with women from kool cigarettes, and all of that and then we go to our public at our meetings and present and there is So. Thank you for your presentation and we will continue to discuss the issue among and see what education I believe during my absence that there was presented that we would have maybe our health forum to further educate our community, and especially our young people, about this cause of death.
The film leaves you to just watch and come to your own conclusion, and the talkback is just another way to raise awareness and have conversations and get people's questions answered, but it's not like resolution or anything of those things that usually requires a little bit more We. Think and just welcome people and not feel judgmental We can even direct it, especially towards young people, because they are the demographic that we especially we're concerned about everyone else, but young people, especially because you know ninety-five percent of those who smoke start before the age of eighteen This is more than that around people before they even start young people, especially so it's my hope that, like you definitely consider doing a zoom or social media like virtual talkback like this, because it's just a very good way to welcome people to come and learn more and not feel like it's anything political or they have to make a decision But hopefully you can talk about it internally and feel interested, but we just wanted to reach out so quick because of the momentum, because everybody right now he's very triggered and primed, and you know how it is when people are open, the best thing is to do is to enter before they close again.
I would understand this, but we did something, and not only did we get pushback at that meeting when I made the first announcement about it, I got pushed back from members of the board our issue tonight is: How do we go because she Teague sent to me something last week that the nursing home honored Keith Wright, with some kind of ceremony- These people know they are in trouble because they lied that their lawyer than the night when dr Smith kept pushing on him You know he was sending everything back to the state.
We were looking at the Harlem nursing home located on one 38th Street They, attended last month's committee meeting I believe the other facilities arch care in the community, and we laid out a framework that said that we would We indicated that we would not have a cab of all community board.
No I got a beautiful job summarizing that I think the more the most important thing is We wanted to not just focus the focus of attention right now, maybe specifically on the Harlem facility, but we don't know what's going on in arch care.
I think that was probably the main thing that we wanted to do, and one of the other thing that you'll find in the document is the fact that we came up with some focus questions that we wanted to one invite any of the long-term care facilities in our district to come to present to us again, but prior to their arrival, we would send them a survey, a quick digital survey that they would complete and at least we'd have that information at the time that they presented I think it's important for us to not waste their time or our time and for us to have real doc data and data and be a little bit data-driven in terms of questions that we're asking so for the committee and participants just to give you an overview of the areas that would be contained in the survey would be patient capacity, the scope of services with a nurse in or rehab or both on staff capacity and the breakdown, nurses, assistants, therapists, physicians, pho cetera patients, a staff ratio at each level of staffing, The process for reconcile and family complaints concerns the number of complaints.
I think that it feels the only way we really can hold them accountable is that these institutions report to the state, and so we have to pressure our elected officials to make sure that they hold these places accountable, that they do they get funding from the state right if they don't do what they're supposed to do and their funding could be at risk That's what people listen to good point , We heard any other member on the committee, his own, if I open it up to the public.
We would hold responsible because it is Medicaid and Medicare money that they get so I would like the other people who are on the call they have something that they have heard or and when I was in college I actually worked out a CCRC that included on Ausmus and a nursing home how some of these facilities often profit over the well-being of senior citizens.
