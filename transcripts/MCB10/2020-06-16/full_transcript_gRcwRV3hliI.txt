Hello good evening, dr. Dukes good evening, thank you guys who all that song, you think everybody hi. This is Karen Dixon, hey mr. Dixon, who else this is Sheba Simpson good evening. How are you I'm? Well, thank you. Good welcome, Donna, Gil, hello, Donna! Welcome you have anyone else. We have five members own. Can you hear me? Yes, I have six anyone else, NYC smoke free, okay! Thank you. Last year book I received a call from mr. Mitchell, our district manager, saying that we had received a call from a group in where I see smoke free and they wanted to present. They had another meeting tonight, and so it's fine with me. We can understand their own. Do I your name. Please yeah! My name is IO our. We will give him an opportunity. We just received a call today we don't usually give people the same day. They call a chance for the meeting, but we will and we don't have any material from you all, so the material was sent in advance, but you know what I could easily do, because we have such a short time and I appreciate you. That's okay: why don't we let you make your presentation and then you can follow up with getting no material. Your to us perfect. We can totally do that. You just let me know if I can go ahead. Oh sure we are ready. Now. Let me the members of the committee introduced himself I'm hazel Duke, chair of CBT in Health and Human Service Committee pleasure to meet you miss dukes good evening, Michelle Booker vice chair and Health and Human Services good evening good evening, - good evening, karen dixon member of the Health and Human Services Committee mmmmh amuse Dixon good evening meet you Donna. It creates a member of the help. Anyone else! Okay! Thank you much now. You can proceed with your presentation. Okay, awesome. So we I spoke to my counterpart and I, had a meeting with Shattuck earlier today, Shattuck, which was really good, and he thought that it might be cool to share this with you. So I don't know why everyone is if everyone is familiar with the fact that what has come to light with Cove in 19 is the level of health disparities that is affecting people of color, but more specifically, and especially black people, in this community and in the country in general. And can everyone still hear me? Yes, okay, I'm, not sure what up and it looked like, okay, but a central part of this is how tobacco companies have targeted the black community for long term with their products, specifically meth all cigarettes. It's one of the reasons why Newports are very popular in the black community. It's not by accident. It's through a systematic, consistent, decade-long of unintentional marketing, sponsoring commercials doing given coupons sponsoring different organizations just really pushing the product, and what it is contributed to doing is that the level of use of smoking among African Americans in America and then specifically the use of menthol cigarettes, has been very dangerous and detrimental and there's a film a very short film. It's about 10 to 15 minutes long. It's called black eyes black lungs, and it really talks about this. And so what we were thinking is especially not a lot of Cove in nineteen, even if there was no Cove in nineteen. This will still be important, but especially in light of Cove in nineteen, our respiratory health is even more important if you smoke or if you're September to smoke in you are putting your respiratory health at risk and a lot of the times. People will pick up smoking. They pick it up at a younger age, not because they wanted to, but because they intentionally marketed towards. So what this film really does is a very short film. Is it bring this to light? So what we've been doing for the past year and a half is working with different organizations in the community boards and to get this information out, and the idea was that we could collaborate and have a talkback which you all so we would encourage everyone to watch the short film ten to fifteen minutes. Long I'm gonna go ahead and send it to you all, so you could watch it, but what we would want to do is we can invite community members and do a sort of a room talkback where we talk about the film. We talk about the health disparities that focuses on metal cigarettes, menthol flavour, and we also can talk about vaping, because that is also something big now that is really affecting the health of many people in our community, but especially young people, and it's not by accident. It's once again the tobacco companies back at it now I want to say something before I yield the mic. During the Obama administration flavors for regular cigarettes were all banned except methyl. There was successful in being able to ban every flavor except methyl, and the reason largely had to do with a lot of lobbying to keep it by tobacco companies, so they could keep a lot of their african-american demographic that uses the product. So it's also another problem is like. Why was it that all the other flavors that most communities use we're bad, but the ones that our community uses the most wasn't? Which continues to put us at a health risk so I'll? Let you all check out this film, it's really life-changing, it's something everyone should see, I, think collaborating and doing a talk back on it and using it. That's the Gateway to all the issues that are affecting us in terms of health disparities. When it comes to tobacco use and vaping, we think it could really be beneficial. We've done this with other organizations like we did with some churches in Harlem, but I think CB 10 is just. We really feel great about CB 10 everybody I've dealt with it's so effective, there's so community oriented there's so community driven, and so it feels like we're behind the fact that we've not even done this with you all. Yet we want to move now because there's a lot of conversations happening about social justice. Honestly, it should already have been happening. We all know how we feel about it, but there's a momentum and there's an openness right now the conversation surrounding how this priorities, so we want to move fast. So we can take advantage of that momentum. The fact that I'm not open, because we feel like they'll, be more receptive to information like this. That really does affect their lives in the community. Thank you very much. We are glad that you came to us. We've been on this issue. We have a resolution that this committee Human Service submitted and it was debated with public interests at meeting of the public, and so we did not get it passed. I hear what you're saying I've been on this for the last two years. That's mean I was quite concerned when I got the call the day about you wanted to come to us. We've been on this project for two years, I brought it before and we have dr. Smith who is a member of this group and miss Dixon and Donna Gill Michele Booker. They all put a great time and emphasis on me, and so we presented twice and didn't go. We are well aware of what the industry has done. We I another hat as president of the N double ACP and we could not get the governor of the state of New York to go with menthol cigarettes. He did the e. We understand that, as let me just set a n-double-a-cp and teen years took a resolution. We don't take any tobacco money Reverend, but I have demonstrated to take signs down in Harlem with women from kool cigarettes, and all of that so we know all the problems, but we have a process that we have to go through. That is, we recommend to our Executive Committee, and then we go to our public at our meetings and present, and there is a lot of person still think their rights are being taken away from them by telling them when they smoke and when not to so. Thank you and I've seen the film. So thank you for your presentation and we will continue to discuss the issue among and see what education I believe during my absence that there was presented that we would have maybe our health forum to further educate our community and especially our young people, about this cause of death. You're right, the foldy we've had more people to die from lung cancer as well as from this virus in our community. So we understand it very well, but we have a process. So thank you and we will be in touch and the appropriate time. Maybe we can show the film I've seen the film several occasion, I'm glad you have on and that's the thing. It's really one of those things where, first of all, thank you for your consideration and we'll send you additional information. So you can, you know, go through the proper channels, but I think one thing that we found to be a effectively these talk box is, you know, the film leaves you to just watch and come to your own conclusion, and the talkback is just another way to raise awareness and have conversations and get people's questions answered, but it's not like resolution or anything of those things that usually requires a little bit more. So this is like a collaborative event. We think and just welcome people and not feel judgmental. We can even direct it, especially towards young people, because they are the demographic that we especially we're concerned about everyone else, but young people, especially because you know ninety-five percent of those who smoke start before the age of eighteen. So this is more than that around people before they even start young people, especially so it's my hope that, like you, definitely consider doing a zoom or social media like virtual talkback like this, because it's just a very good way to welcome people to come and learn more and not feel like it's anything political or they have to make a decision. It's just an event, but hopefully you can talk about it internally and feel interested, but we just wanted to reach out so quick because of the momentum, because everybody right now he's very triggered and primed, and you know how it is when people are open, the best thing is to do is to enter before they close again. You know, but thank you so much for having me thank you dr. Doakes. Maybe she fell off. Yeah she's looks at us, muted, yes, okay, I would have told him what we have done and he wouldn't have to come he's preaching to the choir when you preach to us. But anyway, sorry did you say something because I always before getting off I didn't know. If you were saying something to me. No I'm, talking to dr. Smith now I have thanked you for being on I'm, going to the my committee meeting now. Thank you so much for having me I'll see you all. Thank you. Okay, yes, dr. Smith, yeah, I'm, sorry I'm, just saying I was running late. Sorry about them. Yeah well, I mean I'd, have never heard of this group. There yeah this is New York City they behind the eight ball, I guess with all the bad publicity they're trying to catch up on things, but we've been there on this and I think we thought yes hi. My apologies for interrupting when I spoke to the director today it is the Public Health Solutions, which is a non-profit. Oh they're thrust is New York, City smoke-free, they do receive funding from the state and that's how they have been functioning. Of course, like you have said they did come to us now, but they have been. You know working on this over for the past decade and so I think they originally ran into Charles Johnson according to Shoetique. When he had told me- and so you know he just wanted- they just wanted to introduce themselves and see if we're able so they've been receiving money from the state they because it was the state is there was the governor I testified. I was in Albany four times on the bill and the governor wouldn't go with menthol, so I mean I, don't know where he's been yeah and but anyway, he was here and we heard from him and we know what we are doing and I think one of the things that you said when you was doing the resolution that maybe we would have- and this was before we were shut down- that we was talking about education after we had such pushback from the from some board member former board member. She attacked me that we were gonna put bodegas out of business. You know all this craziness, so we did talk about. We could have a maybe an education forum and we got Debra on our committee, who is chair of the Education Committee. Maybe we can find a way that the Xoom thing people about zoomed out now, people of zoomed out kizomba, zoomed out, you know and I think it's just too much and you're not going to get what we want from a zoom that we're talking about a younger group of people. You know when I said young I mean the millennium age group and that kind of thing- and we know the data we know when children start smoking, young people start so I think we can keep this on the books, but I don't think we ought to try to zeusie. With this. You know one thing doctor dudes like listening all the feedback was: this can be another. Just extension of I can't breathe right. There is, you know, of course there's been be. You know this constant, dramatic police brutality, but in another way we have a corporation that has robbed so many of us about breath. You know, maybe, if we frame it in a certain way, we may be able to attract the population that we want to target. Who you know to listen in so I would just like to keep the conversation open regarding an educational component. Yes, no that's what I was doing. Hi I'm Michele understand what you're saying, but how is it that in uni of women can continue this conversation offline and how to do something like that without dynamic preachy, because these kids they've heard all of this stuff before so about? Why you shouldn't smoke? And them you don't think so, it would have to be presented in a way that it didn't sound preachy and it would have to be presented in a way that the information sounds new and, of course, I agree with you Michelle. We can continue to talk about it, but I also agree with hazel I'm about zoomed out to tonight can I come in as well as you I know. Michelle John and I worked on the resolution. I wasn't there for the significant pushback I understood that we got because you got lost okay, I, you know I was away, unfortunately, but you know we I was pushing Michele and John, probably further than they were originally comfortable with in terms of the some of the things we had in the resolution, I and even I was a little bit surprised at how much pushback we received at the general board meeting can I, say: I, agree with us not trying to do this as a zoom forum of any sort, but I think we should try looking at doing it differently and yes see that we try to do it in a different educational model and it's not zoom it, maybe even like something I'm working with for the state, we're actually using a comic book series to get some of our messages out around kovat and some other messaging. So maybe we can have a conversation, Michelle and Deborah offline about maybe other options we could possibly use in this meeting. I don't want to spend this meeting at I want to tell Shoetique again. Nobody calls the day and I. Let them come. You know this meeting is really for us to get to the meat of what we are talking about, what you all work you have done on this and we had not done anything. I would understand this, but we did something, and not only did we get pushback at that meeting when I made the first announcement about it, I got pushed back from members of the board. Okay, so I mean this is not. This is not urgent right now we can plan this out on the board, but I am my recommendation. Is no zoom on this. Okay, all right, so our issue tonight is: how do we go because she Teague sent to me something last week that the nursing home honored Keith Wright, with some kind of ceremony- I, didn't see it? He found it I didn't think on online or something he sent it to me and I asked him to send it to you guys. These people know they are in trouble because they lied that their lawyer than the night when dr. Smith kept pushing on him. You know he was sending everything back to the state. The state have its own problem here, but they are worse because of their lie and what they did to the community. So I think we got. We said we would be back to them in two weeks. From the time we had the meeting and it's over two weeks now and so I want us tonight. I agreed I had a meeting of Friday night just to go over what had been submitted to me and asked that she teach that all of you have it and what our discussion tonight I think should be around other groups, other people that should be at it as only advisory group. Everything should not be all community brought aired. Of course there is the family there I mean you know that the family have to be apart. We know that the deltas have been there, providing recreational service to them. They've been on the premise II there, but ours is just not providing service. It is to make sure that we are monitoring the service that they are providing and implementing. So we need to discuss this tonight. So when we go to the executive committee, we can get this pass and then get it on over to the to the center there. So the floor is open. I hope you all have read it. Ask your teacher. Send everybody a copy of what dr. Smith and miss Dixon had done, which is great almond, I, think it was fantastic, so maybe Karen can give a quick summary good evening everyone. So we were tasked with dr. Smith and I with submitting a outline of areas that we would like to address with the various long-term care facilities in the CB 10 on community, and so initially, as dr. Dukes alluded to, we were looking at the Harlem nursing home located on one 38th Street. They attended last month's committee meeting. They weren't forthcoming with information related to allegations and concerns going on about the care and the number of fatalities at the facility related to kovat, and so as a follow-up. The discussion was that we would create an outline for what a Community Advisory Board would look like, and so in our conversations, dr. Smith and I agreed that we wouldn't just look at Harlem, but we should also look at I believe the other facilities arch care in the community, and we laid out a framework that said that we would. We recommended the creation of a Community Advisory Board with no more than ten members, and then we provided specificity about what that membership would look like. We indicated that we would not have a cab of all community board ten members. There would be no more than three members on that on that cab. We wanted family members of the facility of residents in the facility to be on that. We also wanted residents of CB 10 to be a part of this community and if the facility had its own cab, we would definitely want one participant to participate in the CV 10 cab related to dr. Dukes comments regarding Delta Sigma Theta. They have been in the facility for forty years and during that time they work closely with the different leadership in the facility, and so we recognize that each location may have a different of different constituents or community partners, and so we wanted to one of those memberships open to that entity in that facility. Cheryl, you want to jump in unmute yourself, I. Think no I got a beautiful job summarizing that I think the more the most important thing is. We wanted to not just focus the focus of attention right now, maybe specifically on the Harlem facility, but we don't know what's going on in arch care, so we wanted to make sure that this Community Advisory for long-term care was not just focused on one but really protecting our community for all any long-term care facilities. That's in our neighborhood, so at least we'd have a framework for that. I think that was probably the main thing that we wanted to do, and one of the other thing that you'll find in the document is the fact that we came up with some focus questions that we wanted to one invite any of the long-term care facilities in our district to come to present to us again, but prior to their arrival, we would send them a survey, a quick digital survey that they would complete and at least we'd have that information at the time that they presented. So we don't have a repeat of what happened last month, where someone comes in and they're just coming in with no information. I think it's important for us to not waste their time or our time and for us to have real doc data and data and be a little bit data-driven in terms of questions that we're asking so for the committee and participants just to give you an overview of the areas that would be contained in the survey would be patient capacity, the scope of services with a nurse in or rehab or both on staff capacity and the breakdown, nurses, assistants, therapists, physicians, pho cetera patients, a staff ratio at each level of staffing. The process for reconcile and family complaints concerns the number of complaints, the resolution and then the overall cleanliness of the facility. The Colvard related specific questions when included the number of patients that tested positive, the number of staff tested positive, the number of patient hospitalization, the number of patient. They tala, tease the number of staff fatalities, staff turnover and the length of time before they actually returned to work if they were out due to coldly related illness. The status of the staff testing protocol that's been being implemented, as well as the cleaning protocol of the facility. Now you've heard from our two persons that did this great work for us and, as I said, I spoke to them on Friday evening and I approved what they had done wanted to. Let you be a part of the process of seeing what you think about recommending who you thought would be outside partners. Besides, the community bartenders, you heard them say so. The floor is open for discussion on any of the proposal that we have before us is everybody on mute, hello know we're there I think that most people are not on mute, but if that literally are their questions. This is this is Michelle right, so I'm gonna take a multi-layered approach and okay, first I am I read through the document and I thought. The IDP ideas are excellent. I do believe, inviting the nursing homes on a constant basis to the community board. With the survey moving forward. You know pre post and you know Cove. It is really important for those who need treatment and to remember that nursing homes have no rehabilitation, so they have their census is diversified. Although most people who are there are those who you know really need long-term help or who are elderly, my concern is that nursing homes are regulated by the state and such that you know. We had caps that our hospitals systems, but the hospital systems are under the umbrella of the city, and so therefore we have that you know we have that tie. These are the our you know the New York City Charter. My only concern is of that record of that regulation right because they are, they are run by these. They are run by the state and state elected officials, as well as the governor's office should I mean a continuous whether its investigation, you know manuals right. So that's this my concern, so Michelle I think there's a couple of things. One is they're actually privately operated and that they are regulated by them, they're regulated by the state, but they are privately operated, which is why they could not in and tell us Oh we've sent everything to the state, but they can literally essentially blind you to the information that's going on in the facility, so they are privately operated and they could provide you that information if they choose to unless you have a public nursing facility and we don't actually have any public long-term care facilities, specifically in our district. All of the long-term care facilities in our district that I can recall. Oh I saw that dr. Samuels is on the call as well. So those are all the ones that I am that I can recall in our district, so the public ones are a little bit different because that is literally operated by H and H or the state. But we don't have that so right as big of an issue and additionally when they were at the meeting last month, they the newly hired director who, on the job since mid or late March indicated that was one of the goals that they wanted to work towards was to reinstate their cab, and so that's how this conversation I'm actually evolved out of the statements of the new site of the new director, absolutely I'm, glad that dr. Smith made it very clear. These are the law. When they came to us, we have I was telling she teeth, there have to be Donna heel, I, think Donna. You was on the board when they came to us right call McCall that there was for them was something he was the one that we got a call from Lord Williams and then comma call called me and he they came with the owner of the law group, it's a group and they have most of their homes in Brooklyn and we research we saw that they were not good. They wasn't in good standing at that time. So what this meeting really is to talk about what we see before us and how we think other groups should be apart, so we can get as much community involvement and the kind of things we would want. I'm, not against them. Coming to our meetings, but I have to agree with dr. Smith, you can see I, don't run meetings all night. Your meetings is to be focused its conversation and then a vote is taken. So that's what I wanted from this meeting tonight. So when we go to the executive committee, we are sure what we're talking about. I, don't like to have a meeting, and then people come to the executive committee or come to the membership meeting and start asking questions, and so that's why I did it the way that it has been done? So all the questions tonight and recommendations I would like for you to put it on the floor now: dr. Dux, yes, I, think I, Cheryl and Karen. You did a wonderful job and I'm really I commend you I think we need to have senior citizen or we need to speak to someone from the senior task force the people from someone from diverse from dip-dip Turk and someone from the Kennedy Center, because the reality of it is, though, the people that are in the facility right now in capacitance, one reason or another at some point the seniors may or may not end up in this facility. So we need to have them there to hear what you know how they feel about what's going on or what would they like to see happen but I see the other people that you appoint. It all suggested the Advisory very clear, and it makes a lot of sense. I just didn't see, senior representation, good point: okay, yeah thanks yeah Donna! Thank you to separate Gilyard. Oh thank you. - missing a task force, yes, so necessary. So I just wanted to listen to see because I know one of my seniors that visit the nursing home all the time. I think you know, dr. Dukes is some County McBain. Oh yes, yeah right she's! At a meeting right now so I'm trying to listen in so I could get some information because she is very much interested. She used to ride a no. She called me by the way right. Her sister was that family she's, one of the persons from the community through Mary, read that I receive write all from right. Thank you very much Donna. Let me hear from other members. Excuse me w8o. Wacc alone, we heard from Donna we heard from Michelle Debra unmute yourself, Debra didn't leave us. Did she I see I still see her on here, but maybe okay I know Mary had a question or had a question: okay with an answer yeah, but let me see from Debra we can get home muted. Then I'll go tomorrow. What just one thing: we're gonna have our singer task force meeting on Thursday at 10 o'clock, so I'm going to bring the information to them, but definitely miss mcvane, and you know Miss good. Yes, so I'll bring that information back to them. Love the task force on the senior task force and Debra is unmuted. I think she might have stepped away. Okay! Well, I: we can hear him mariusz question. Well, it was already answered by dr. Smith and I was basically saying: how could we give recommendations to the state on our findings when they have their meetings on in regards to the nursing homes? But she said that they could choose not to take our recommendations and then my question was: how do we hold them accountable? Because you know people haven't been able to reach out to even during kovat nineteen people have not been able to reach out to loved ones and relatives within the facilities. The gentleman that came on in the last meeting stated that they had iPads to communicate with. We know that many of our seniors, you know, may have difficulties in using iPads. They may need I mean the good old telephone still works as a point of communication for family members to be able to communicate with loved ones and know about their well-being. So somehow, as this task force is formulated, there has to be a way to hold accountability and there has to be a way to incorporate the recommendations and findings of the task force into whatever entity. The state has an oversight: hi I did step away for a minute. Okay, I just want to say you guys, really did a good job on this and I I'm glad that you're bringing the senior citizens into this, but I think that you know just piggybacking on what Mary said. I think that it feels the only way we really can hold them accountable is that these institutions report to the state, and so we have to pressure our elected officials to make sure that they hold these places accountable, that they do they get funding from the state right if they don't do what they're supposed to do and their funding could be at risk. And so you know when it comes to economics. That's what people listen to good point. Okay, completely! We have any other member. We do we've heard from Donna, we heard from Debra. We heard any other member on the committee his own, if I open it up to the public, so dr. Dukes, the other thing I'd like to mention is that the grave in New, York, Hospital Association also has an arm that deals specifically with the nonprofit nursing homes in the area. Okay, like to engage them, that's something that we can also do: okay, because they're private facilities and the nonprofit's you know, there's something really different, also the nonprofit's and two more on Medicaid and Medicare for their funding. Correct me: if I misspoke we're you know, private entities, you know have other forms of funding for themselves, and so nonprofit model is whatever it comes in. They take it and put it. Their mission is to put it back into their page right where the private is more about their stakeholders and their investors right sometimes they're. The ones who have more have been showing more of the problems when they are taking with their senses in taking care of their patients. Absolutely because they're profit-making right well, I wanted to say Michelle. This is Donna most of the money that they get to run. Their facilities comes from Medicaid and Medicare right money, so that is federal funding, because, basically so I mean the accountability aspect of it is actually paramount and we need to have them do that and like Cheryl was saying we need to hold our electives responsible. The advisory board that we are suggesting is not so much as a regulatory board for the state, but more so are the regulatory board for the institution, so that someone is there doing what the state is not doing so we don't have the power to do that. Well me, that's not I mean that's right, that's not our power. Well, we might see it's not our well I think what Don is saying. The advocacy is with our elected officials and they have the power right to do certain things that we don't, but the advocacy role from us would be that our next step would be with our elected officials, then hold them accountable to for what monies, how they work with budgets with we can get complaints and write up our finding. Then our elected officials, we would hold responsible because it is Medicaid and Medicare money that they get so I would like the other people who are on the call they have something that they have heard or they want you bring to our attention or on this matter. If you would introduce yourself when you speak, so we can have minutes of the meeting. Please is anyone from that is not a middle of yes hi. This is Josh. I was just going to say that I think it's a great idea and when I was in college, I actually worked out a CCRC that included on Ausmus and a nursing home, so I kind of a experience firsthand how some of these facilities often profit over the well-being of senior citizens. I think this is very much needed and we also need you know stricter regulations at the state and local level, so I'm going supportive. Okay, thank you board member Timmons, who else any member from the community that song would like to speak good afternoon. We have any members who, on the call, who are not members of the committee, but member of the community. Would you like input, suggestions? Well, I, don't hear anyone yeah I'm good afternoon, good evening, dr. dukes, yes, very wisdom, and how are you I'm really just kind of listening and getting up to speed and pretty much in agreement? You know with everything that everyone has said in terms of moving forward and addressing this, but I am here and taking it all in so one for okay. Thank you for joining us. Thank you open for anyone else to. Let us know that you're here. So our minutes will reflect your concerns or your attending our meeting this evening. This is very important because these are our neighbors, some relatives, friends of ours, and so we've taken this very serious dr. cooks. This is Shiva Simpson, yes, I was knocked off the call and I'm just getting back up. I don't want to take too much time, but I just wanted to know if he brought up to speed on what the gentleman was. Just speaking about that Josh. Yes, yeah. Wasn't me talking just now. Yeah, okay, she want to hear what you had to say again. You want to feel like a director of my experiences exactly or I. What do you want me to talk about? The I believe is the well I. Don't want to use the word green, the profit-making over the quality of care. Okay, so I worked at a CCRC, that was, it was assisted, living for seniors and mom, in addition to a nursing home, and it was also on a hospice. So basically I would say not this facility I worked out, but other they are also into like neighboring facilities and conferences and stuff, and you know, I saw a lot of different things arm, especially like in hospice and nursing home, because, basically, when you're on, when you're in hospices, especially you get paid, you know like say like $600 a day for every person that you have in hospice. So what they do is they basically pack these facilities with basically bodies? It doesn't matter if they have enough nurses or people on staff to care for all these people. Their thing is to just pack them with as many people as possible. So that they can get bodies in there, so they can get that income coming in because it's like you know, $600 a day, just that's just it without treatment without all, without all the treatments and services they charge. I can tell you, in addition, I had a personal experience with Isabella, which is arm, which is in Inwood, where I had a relative who was placed there arm and Isabella, but Isabella had lied to us about the services that they had so I'm. My relative had a specific type of wound: I needed it all a certain arm, certain arm our thing to be basically arm replaced and maintained every day pretty much. They had our dad official wounds, so they basically had an open wound in their stomach. Where you know their bowels, like feces, was coming out of about having to replace anything every day is about allied to us, they didn't have that equipment at all, in fact, to be able to care for that type of wound. They totally lied to her. So after, like coming down finding out that you know they weren't replacing it on a daily basis. We had to basically relocate all my relative and, like you know, ASAP to another facility. You had to take him back to the hospital that had in charge done and then move them into a whole nother facility, which was an incredible ordeal like in the span of 24 hours. So, but that's that just goes to show another example Isabella that was more concerned about getting an individual and a bed so that they can start collecting. You know money from the state each month rather and actually facilitating the care for that person and the special treatment that they needed. Is that an answer? Yes, ma'am? Thank you so much Joshua Yes Doctor. This is dr. Samuel, hello, Steven and dr. Samuel. The main problem is this: the government does not want to pay properly for nursing home care. They don't have the proper number of ourends or associated staff that should really take care of patient they're, not getting the patients up the way that they should so, therefore, the patient's become demented you had to. If you had to lay in bed 24 hours a day for weeks at a time, you would also become demented. So the main problem is that government, because most of these patients don't have the wherewithal they clean out their accounts, essentially once they go into the nursing home and they don't have the financial ability to pay or expensive care or proper care. Let's put it that way. So it's not just an issue with the nursing home which in this case was like the issue also is government funding for elders when they go into nursing home, and that is probably part of the issue. But the other part of the issue is a lot of the times. The people who run the nursing home as I said, do not want to play this day out, so the staff isn't paid properly. You don't have the proper number of hour ends in there percentage-wise to monitor the care of the patient. Meanwhile, a lot of these people are living in multimillion-dollar homes. So this is really a horrid situation all over the country and what happened in Harlem is just a so not that it shouldn't be addressed, but it's a piece of an overall problem. Thank you. Hi I, just like to make a brief point. I visited a member from my church, a woman who's living in Amsterdam. How some months ago and I know Amsterdam house is not part of the Manhattan community boards, hidden district, so I'm not bringing it up for that purpose for more so, just as an example of something that might be happening at other nursing homes that are within the district is during our visit. The care aide woman came into her room with the do not resuscitate paperwork and was quite coercive in the way that she was asking her to sign it and I had to speak on behalf of the woman to make it. You know she was saying no I don't want to sign, and the woman was explaining it to her and it ended up being. You know a simple conversation with the woman just saying she doesn't want it and then we kind of shifted. The conversation to something else, but I think that this is happening in other nursing homes, where someone who is older and I, don't in a weaker standpoint, laying on a bed versus someone who's standing up over them. Saying hi we're coming around with this paperwork is almost like a wolf in sheep's clothing, so I just want to bring that up that. That's something that's happening, I, don't know who brought that up, but I appreciate you bringing that up, because it's very true and a lot of times patients will browbeat you into making that choice, particularly if they don't have any associated family system. In that decision it can get pretty scary. Yes, thank you, dr. Dukes, Michelle Oh, dr. Dukes, yes, okay, can you hear me now? Yes, okay, I would like for the members of the committee. I would like to take a vote that we can always amend what we doing, but I don't want them to think that we were blowing smoke at them. We said we would get this in two weeks, it's longer than two weeks now, but they do have to go before the executive committee and next week and we got the next whatever the data is. So I would like to have any votes tonight of us approving our proposal that we have before us can I get oh so moved by. Karen made the motion: okay, all in favor aye in opposes abstentions. Thank you so much for this, and you know this is not the be-all of the old. This is the beginning. This is the beginning for us, so I'm sure we're gonna have a lot of questions at executive committee, but I think we are well prepared to answer this decision we have, and only from reading on Friday night. We only have two in our area by that. We cover I, know that I think Isabella is in 7:09 Isabella's in 12 it's in 12 to Washington tonight. Even the congressman has been involved in that with the group over there. So let's take care when we can take care of, and we can share this information with other community boards. If that become necessary, but let's get ours approved and get moving on it any other business. We have any old business in a new business. If not, we still have before us how we would do the education on the smoking I think once we get out of this, we can work with the Education Committee and our committee. It could be a joint forum or education series like what dr. Smith put me for us, but that's going to take some planning and some work. I've already sent Michelle and Cheryl Smith a text message and we're going to begin working on that. Okay, thank you so much. Thank you. So much to you and I have some other education matters too. Okay, we need to make a motion to close on our maiden I, so move Michelle, okay, the meeting is a join. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you have a good evening. Great me too. Yes, Terry wisdom.
