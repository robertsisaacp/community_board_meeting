You know we'll do it that way, and this will be a working documented, which would be a proposal to take to central park, conservancy and new york city parks.
We also kept in mind the fact that the park is designed to be an urban oasis within I mean a country oasis within an urban setting and then that whatever we do would have to meld with the countryside, intent, We discuss, fundraising, rate, fundraising strategies to some extent, and we can go into that a little more and we've talked about the art process involved in getting the project getting the art piece developed whatever it is going to be, and we looked at the objectives of the women's suffrage monuments and the fact that you have to have a tie into the to new york, city.
It was brought over to the united states and We understand that we need to speak with new york, city, parks, division of arts and antiquities, and the other agencies that are relevant to the process are the department of cultural affairs, the new york city, design, commission and new york city, landmarks, commission and in terms of impact on the community of the social injustice situation.
Can everyone see that, yes, the drafted mission statement to commission and maintain a statue in central park dedicated to honoring the resiliency of the exonerated five to create an educational campaign around the need for social justice reform, to challenge municipalities, to promote and maintain positive advances towards social and criminal justice?
Oh, okay, I'm gonna ask if if people will raise their hands if they have a question or comment We're going to send out the mission statement for commentary , I just want to say that I think you're doing a wonderful job.
If rebecca has the time the innocence, project, miss copeland and miss salam, that you know, I, think things could should kind of flow from there We're at your service, whatever you want happy to do, anything, and you know, even if you know innocence, project, ultimately, you know we obviously want to center miss alam and the exonerated five, But we'll do any research or any work behind the scenes to do.
So you know that that's something to think about, but I think that getting a statement over to or a proposal or whatever over to central park conservancy at this point will begin.
There are some board members that are working members who really you know, get the grit, going, and I think that there should be a connection between senate the seneca village project and the central park.
I know, I'm being a little long-winded, but I've taken a lot of time to really think, and I feel that people gave us great blueprint.
You know that might be something that could be done, especially during this time when people need to get out and and that And it can be done with social distancing, because it's outdoors , so we could take that up in the parks committee.
Right, like I, said I, think the a very key part, especially with the central park, five or exonerated five, is that something that is un equivocally can't be mistaken.
Like the suffragette statue, nobody's gonna, walk past there and not know what it is where it is and why it is, and the central park exonerated I feel like some kind of a structure, and I like the idea that they had actually like theater stuff that you could hear or go behind, it, and I.
All looking at us, so You know I'm just saying that we have work to do because what is happening on television that the kids see just like how you saw the little girl crying when the cops came.
So I think that would be something that may be helpful , it's kind of hard for her to come, but I know that she would probably we'll raise the money to get in here.
Was you saying that the site of the sometimes it's hard for people to distinguish between the victim of the of the assault and the exonerated five, So I think to kind of stay away from that area?
We were going to do and research a little bit prior to the walk and even go to the site where the suffragette statue is gonna, be installed and just kind of meditate on that, and you know, I, think that would help us to get some clarity.
That's the company that did the work for this woman's suffrage mom When we first started, this- And I, don't know if anybody was aware that or if anybody looked into it, that the management of that area, the alaska rink and the in an area by the harlem meal, where they're doing the reconstruction that was managed by donald trump and his organization and once He raises money from it and he wants to donate the money towards organizations like what we're doing now.
What prince has been saying, and I support all these ideas and echo it, and this may either be getting ahead of the game, or should we take advantage of the moment You know, there's this, this artist organization, that has done the hologram of george floyd and it kind of shows up Then it kind of disappears, and they did this fantastic art project just the other day, really, And I think it would be so great if somehow we could have the hologram of the exonerated five over the lasker space It's common kind of things right to get people going, But I, think that if we could contact that organization that does those holograms and have their images, it would be really something that would be really pretty fantastic.
We know what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is going to be doing.
And I'm, not trying to put more work on you karen, but we can send it in to karen You know in the park so that we can research , It's, important, so What we're gonna do is is I will send out the the statement and the mission statement and people can make comments at that time and just send them back to me.
And I think we need to go and see what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is willing to do.
Miss, orbee, I, think you've done a great job and thank you, but I also want to add my condolences, my personal condolences that you've been doing this unbeknownst to us that you know you had a loss, So Having said that, I think we're underestimating the power, the brain power that we have in existence and sorry has kind of laid a blueprint out for us how to proceed by how she you know arranged this Ms salam just made a valid point, which is first of all malik and those people they're not going anywhere.
This, is why I suggested the most critical people- Then, once we get something solid, then you know you reach out to these people, because I can guarantee you the way to lose them is if you go to them without a job plan, Because they they're not here, to do the work, that's not going to happen.
You know where it is without a whole bunch of people, because the longer you get right into the park.
