I'm always like The meeting is about to begin, so we have some other people who are coming on, so we just want to be they'll join us as they come in I'm, chair of parks and recreation from Manhattan community board 10, and we are here as results of the culmination of the three panel discussions that we had, which were very forthcoming: Wonderful, panelists and excellent information is to develop a project mission and objective statement.
Intent We, discuss, fundraising rate, fundraising strategies to some extent, and we can go into that a little more and we've talked about the art process involved in getting the project getting the art piece developed whatever it is going to be, and we looked at the objectives of the women's suffrage monuments and the fact that you have to have a tie into the to new york city Looking at the northeast and central section of central park northeast and northeast, northeastern section.
So I would say that you should add something about the exonerated five and their families or and in the community, and the community I have to check this people waiting to come in Oh, okay, I'm gonna ask if if people will raise their hands if they have a question or comment, we're going to send out the mission statement for commentary , I just want to say that I think you're doing a wonderful job.
There needs to be a fiscal conduit to begin to raise money, to begin to identify an artist and give them the honor the honorarium, to begin to look at what that that project, what it will come, what it will become, whether it's a bench, whether it's a statute, what it will become that there needs to be a governing body , that's sort of driving that I think that we also looked at whether or not central park.
yes central park, conservancy took the lead on this You know they, after years of trying to get their attention about the significance of the community and what it means to the broader community and certainly the black community, and it only got on board really because there was one person who really decided that she needed to spearhead it, and she had enough sway in the organization to be able to say we need to do this and That would be best of all.
The timing is very possible right, like I said, I think the a very key part, especially with the central park, five or exonerated five- is that something that is un equivocally can't be mistaken.
I just wanted to add that to underscore what prince said that whole path there, the harlem year, where they have raised money and that transfers at 110, which goes across they're, really kind of connected I, was you saying that the site of the sometimes it's hard for people to distinguish between the victim of the of the assault and the exonerated five so I think to kind of stay away from that area would be better Just to have something more towards the entrance to the park where people come in and they can.
You know you get some ideas that may come to you that haven't, and You know have some cross discussion about that, because I do think that as we go to central park conservancy, you know we should have a couple of ideas of okay That's changing the trajectory of the park, but I think we could start with the walk that we said we were going to do and research a little bit prior to the walk and even go to the site where the suffragette statue is gonna, be installed and just kind of meditate on that, and you know, I think that would help us to get some clarity So. One of the statements I would like to make is that we do put something at the actual site, because I agree with miss palmer that those of us who do go by that site a lot My mom still lives right across the street.
Once we know what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is going to be doing Once.
But we are not the fundraising arm of this project and I think we need to go and see what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is willing to do here.
Karen I'm going to continue to sort of work with the borough president's office to see how we can get around that without stepping on anybody's toes, because I absolutely agree with you I think that it's not in the purview of the community board to do the fundraising , I think your passion, that kind of passion needs to fuel fund development and so I, wouldn't want to lose that you guys have become the face of this project and so figuring out how to do it without any conflict of interest is important right.
We did a resolution around that and I think we should have the design plans for that construction project because I know they're moving the pool up against the rock wall, so they're going to join the body of water behind the pool with the lake That's a good idea, and it's probably a good idea too, as you were saying, to set up another meeting with the central park conservancy regarding different things in terms of what their plans are to hammer We stay in contact with them as much as possible.
You know where it is without a whole bunch of people, because the longer you get right into the park more and more people are going to come and whenever the time is that we're ready for that I would love on harlem network news to do a show and then I think the whole idea of reaching out to the people that are already raising funds in creative ways and I.
