You know we'll do it that way, and this will be a working documented, which would be a proposal to take to central Park, Conservancy and New York City Parks Karen.
We, discuss, fundraising, rate, fundraising strategies to some extent, and we can go into that a little more and we've talked about the art process involved in getting the project getting the art piece developed whatever it is going to be, and we looked at the objectives of the women's suffrage monuments and the fact that you have to have a tie into the to New York City.
We understand that we need to speak with New York, City, Parks, division of arts and antiquities, and the other agencies that are relevant to the process are the Department of Cultural Affairs, the New York City, Design Commission and New York, City, Landmarks, Commission and in terms of impact on the community of the social injustice.
If you just give me a minute, out, share my screen, and can everyone see that, yes, the drafted mission statement to Commission and maintain a statue in central park dedicated to honoring the resiliency of the exonerated five to create an educational campaign around the need for social justice reform, to challenge municipalities, to promote and maintain positive advances towards social and criminal justice?
Oh okay, I'm going to ask if if people will raise their hands, if they have a question or comment We're going to send out the mission statement for commentary , I just want to say that I think you're doing a wonderful job.
You know a country getaway, I mean I just took my grandchildren to the park earlier last year and they had taken the fencing around away from around the swing set, and it was just such a beautiful, feel.
There needs to be a fiscal conduit to begin to raise money, to begin to identify an artist and give them the honor the honorarium, to begin to look at what that that project, what it will come, what it will become, whether it's a bench, whether it's a statute, what it will become that there needs to be a governing body.
So you know that that's something to think about, but I think that getting a statement over to or a proposal or whatever over to central park conservancy at this point will begin.
There are some board members that are working members who really you know, get the grit, going, and I think that there should be a connection between Senate, the Seneca village project and the Central Park exonerated project.
And I need to go back to the Seneca village project, but I think that I feel like the Seneca village project can be enhanced, especially if it's going to stay for a long term to maybe even have more physical feely touchy, though you can take your phone and do something, but I feel it should be in enhanced.
But I've, taken a lot of time to really think, and I feel that people gave us great blueprint.
Right, like I, said I think the a very key part, especially with the central park, five or exonerated five, is that something that is Un Equivocally can't be mistaken.
Like the Suffragette Statue nobody's, going to walk past there and not know what it is where it is and why it is, and the Central Park exonerated I feel like some kind of a structure, and I like the idea that they had actually like theater stuff that you could hear or go behind, it, and I.
Think Miss wisdom mentioned the walk through the park thing, which was something that was discussed.
I think she would be somebody phenomenal to get involved with this, because not only of her ancestry but her age, and that speaks to what miss wisdom was just talking about some of the things I'm sure she's, still probably still dealing with some of the same issues that you know your your son- in- law is dealing with, so that can be part of the conversation.
I, was you saying that the site of the sometimes it's hard for people to distinguish between the victim of the of the assault and the exonerated five, so I think to kind of stay away from that area?
You know you get some ideas that may come to you that have not, and it's not like it's a hard thing to do.
We were going to do and research a little bit prior to the walk and even go to the site where the Suffragette Statue is going to be installed and just kind of meditate on that, and you know, I, think that would help us to get some clarity.
What prince has been saying, and I support all these ideas and echo it, and this may either be getting ahead of the game, or should we take advantage of the moment You know, there's this, this artist organization, that has done the Hologram of George Floyd and it kind of shows up Then it kind of disappears, and they did this fantastic art project just the other day, really, And I think it would be so great if somehow we could have the hologram of the exonerated five over the lasker space It's common kind of things right to get people going, But I, think that if we could contact that organization that does those holograms and have their images, it would be really something that would be really pretty fantastic.
We know what central Park, Conservancy and New York City Parks Department is going to be doing.
You know not necessarily for money but At. This point to start to get people involved, And, not necessarily ask for money, I think we could do a black paper on that and basically run it by those folks who are in power to make sure we're not stepping on any toes, but I totally agree with you, I think, looking at the our bylaws But there is this idea of working task, Force group, that we identify in our bylaws that list some activities.
, Miss, Orbee, I, think you've done a great job and thank you, but I also want to add my condolences, my personal condolences that you've been doing this unbeknownst to us that you know you had a loss, So Having said: that, I think we're underestimating the power, the brain power that we have in existence and sorry has kind of laid a blueprint out for us how to proceed by how she you know arranged this And Ms Salam just made a valid point, which is first of all malik and those people they're not going anywhere.
This, is why I suggested the most critical people- Then, once we get something solid, then you know you reach out to these people, because I can guarantee you the way to lose them is if you go to them without a job plan, Because they they're not here, to do the work, that's not going to happen.
That does not say they have to do it, but it's these things have been done, so you look at what did people do and what worked We do have a lot of brain power.
He dictated something to me with you know, but if people have the time and they can really sit down and work on a nice book with rebecca about a piece and cynthia certainly would like to have your input.
You know where it is without a whole bunch of people, because the longer you get right into the park, More and more people are going to come.
And, then I think the whole idea of reaching out to the people that are already raising funds in creative, ways, and I do not know the rules with the Community board and everything, but if.
