If you have any questions or comments and and I'm sending the draft, it's a very rough draft of a statement out to everyone. So what we'll do was just discuss it a little bit and and then we'll work on it online and if everybody can return their comments or revisions online, you know we'll do it that way, and this will be a working documented, which would be a proposal to take to central park, conservancy and new york city parks. Karen will that be the mission statement, or is that something that has already been worked on? No the mission statement I have, I did a draft of that. Also, I don't think I sent that over. No, I didn't I didn't get that right. I can send I'll just read the mission statement. Okay, just to save some time, because I know everybody once has things to do in the evening, and this was like our fifth meeting in a little over a month karen.

Let me see if I can find it I'll be right back hi, stephanie, hi barbara. How are you doing good to see you too? Always everyone always good to see you was anyone able to watch the funeral today? I didn't get to see it was incredible. It was absolutely incredible. Oh my god, it was just. It was a history lesson, oh a great way to honor him. What an incredible man did you know. I wasn't, I wasn't aware of james lawson, oh yeah. He gave the most incredible speech. I I'm a fan, what 91 years old, 91 years old yeah, because sharpness attack? Wasn't he running with martin luther king jr? That was his right. He was incredible. Wow cbs has it on their website the full funeral? Okay, if you want to check it out, it's really worth it just it's worth watching I just glued to my chair wow. I know yusuf's not here yet, but he and I a few years ago, went to the congressional black caucus where yousef spoke and yusuf met him out in the hallway and has a picture with him that we just posted in the innocence project. He was such a sweet man. I mean he really also just like. I saw him in the hallway and didn't bother him myself, but like watched like one child after another, he like stopped. He like talked to every single person. He just was such a good man. I mean, in addition to being an obvious leader that we need more of now than ever. Did you see trump was forced to cancel his press conference? I love that. Oh no okay, he tried to he tried to schedule a press conference truly at the same time that obama was about to speak. What yes and then, obviously someone just got him and was like. Even this is too much for you, but like truly, that was the scheduled meeting disgusting human being. He is filthy animal, as my grandmother would say. Yeah. I think I know you talked about yeah. We do not have to mention his name. You'll stay politically correct. For now he tried to announce that he wanted to delay the election plan. That's the big play, that's kind of crazy, that's not even in his purview. He doesn't even know the right congress does that you know he's just trying to distract. You know he got bad news about the economy today and he was trying to change it around to change the conversation he's so awful read any octavia butler ever because she wrote a book that had a maniac running for president and his cash phrase was make America great again she's. So prophetic, oh my gosh, yep amazing! This is enablers. That's those you know it's him, but he's just riding a wave. He didn't create it. That's right! Gotta get rid of them all, knock them all. Take them all out right. He couldn't get away with this. Without the enablers, and especially without mitch, mcconnell wow trump will come and go, but you know those enablers. They may still be there. You are so right, you're. So right, it's actually prince what I always say to my mother when she complains about the orange one, I'm always like. No, it's the enablers like would be gone, but okay, I'm trying to see trying to get in. I haven't seen her oh she's, trying to figure out how to get on. Okay, I'm gonna. Send you a list of emails. Yes, send you a list of emails! All right: okay, puppy, I'm gonna, mute myself. There we go so: oh okay, sending you all the emails, stand it out. Okay, she think I sent you the emails and all right. So let's just welcome everyone good evening. The meeting is about to begin so we have some other people who are coming on, so we just want to be they'll join us as they come in. So my name is karen nori, I'm chair of parks and recreation from Manhattan community board 10, and we are here as results of the culmination of the three panel discussions that we had, which were very forthcoming: wonderful, panelists and excellent information. So we'll just do a brief recap of those meetings. Let's see if we can do that, share my screen, okay, so so from the beginning, all right. So this is our recap. So all right. So this is our recap and the objective of tonight's meeting is to develop a project mission and objective statement. Okay, so we started with that. We had three panel discussions. One was around design of the exhibit. What that might look like the message to be conveyed, then we went into funding and development, and then we took a look at what would what it would take to implement. So we had some excellent panelists. We had rebecca brown of the innocence project, dr youssef salaam, adamola, oligophola, vincent sutherland and cynthia copeland, then for the second discussion, which was around fundraising development and funding, we had dr youssef of salaam and we were graced by retired captain brenda berkman of the monumental women's project, and she gave us excellent information on that process, and we also have mrs salamon, who spoke to the experience of the exonerated five and isaiah jenkins office of the mayor. We then went on to our third panel discussion, where we had dr russell malik, yoba sarah burns ricardo, goreto and jay larry. They were all so enlightening. We have a commitment from malik yoga and from sarah burns to continue working with us and ricardo. Barretto is also interested in continuing to work with us and I'm sure we can rely on jay larry. If you need to so we we at the outset. We said that the discussion would be prefaced with prioritizing the perspective of the exonerated five and their families and being focused on what matters to them. We designed the just public discussion panels from so that we could produce a diverse dialogue and reach as broad a group of stakeholders as possible. We hope that our panel of discussions were exemplary of a strong community engagement around possible things and the social justice concepts that are involved. We defined how the abstract could be brought to the concrete in the form of a permanent exhibit by taking a look at projects such as seneca, village and and the women's suffrage monument. We also kept in mind the fact that the park is designed to be an urban oasis within I mean a country oasis within an urban setting and then that whatever we do would have to meld with the countryside, intent, and so we try to reach those goals as a result of the panel discussions, and these are our I'm panelists again, so we took at what it takes to become a not-for-profit opportunity. This is an opportunity to educate. So we took a look at that very strong component that we would like to include. We discuss fundraising rate, fundraising strategies to some extent and we can go into that a little more and we've talked about the art process involved in getting the project getting the art piece developed whatever it is going to be, and we looked at the objectives of the women's suffrage monuments and the fact that you have to have a tie into the to new york city. How do we tie that in so we're? Looking at the northeast and central section of central park northeast and northeast, northeastern section, sorry and the site location would be somewhere around in that area. We had some discussion about that. We also talked about the fact that after the central park jogger case in 1989, there was an infusion of funds into the park, and so there were improvements made in the park and before that, youssef very poignantly described how it was going into the park. It was not a friendly place, it was it had danger. I mean it was at the end of the crack epidemic and it was not really inviting to the youth of our community at that end of the park which brought out the disparages between the northern and southern or midsections of the park. We also talked about whatever this project is going to be. It has to endure the elements, there's an example of cleopatra's needle in central park, which is phenomenal. It was it's egyptian, it was brought over to the united states and it's I think, it's almost 3000 years old, so it has endured the elements all that time. We understand that we need to speak with new york, city parks, division of arts and antiquities, and the other agencies that are relevant to the process are the department of cultural affairs, the new york city, design, commission and new york city landmarks, commission and in terms of impact on the community of the social injustice situation. Is that if you're, if you're using a system to try to to, let me see if I can close it an approach that cures one element but creates another even more debilitating one is not a mature at all. Mass incarceration has an impact on crime, yes, but and how could it not? But similarly, a mandatory highway speed limit of 20 miles per hour would have a dramatic effect on car accidents, but still we would never institute such measures. Our respect for liberty is at least in the abstraction great. Why then, haven't been so willing to construct a prison system that denies freedom, destroys families shrinks? Democratic participation, fails to rehabilitate and decreases the life opportunities of our most vulnerable citizens and that's an excerpt from mark lamont hill's nobody. So these are some fundraising ideas if, when we need to get to that and and now we're here, we are at next steps and so and with that I'll just lead into the mission statement. So if you just give me a minute out, share my screen- and can everyone see that, yes, the drafted mission statement to commission and maintain a statue in central park dedicated to honoring the resiliency of the exonerated five to create an educational campaign around the need for social justice reform, to challenge municipalities, to promote and maintain positive advances towards social and criminal justice reform? So this is very broad. Maybe we need to it's got a couple of ideas in it, and maybe we need to reduce it. So I would say that you should add something about the exonerated five and their families or and in the community and the community, maybe okay. What I will do is, I will send this out. Okay and everyone can comment on it and we can come up with some synopsis and send that out great idea. Okay, so I'm just gonna come out of this. Hopefully I can do that. Oh, that was easy. Okay, all right, so we we have. I'm gonna ask you check if he can send out a copy of shatika you on hi, shatik, okay, I have to check this people waiting to come in. Oh okay, I'm gonna ask if if people will raise their hands if they have a question or comment, so I think that basically we're just going to okay we're going to send out the mission statement for commentary and there is a drafted statement that I'm going to ask to send to everyone. So in the meantime, is there anyone who'd like to comment on the process or meetings the discussions? Okay, barbara and you're unmuted? Okay, karen? I just want to say that I think you're doing a wonderful job. I'm impressed with the panelists I'm impressed with the work. The way you've pulled it all together and it's a pleasure. If there's anything else I can do to assist, please don't hesitate. I think this is more than a worthy cause and the way you put it in a recap that kind of was very inclusive of everything that has taken place thus far. So I like the step-by-step process and the ability to let others know, because I missed one session how to even go back. The last email said you can go back and see these sessions that were recorded. So thank you for being so informative and awesome. Thank you so much barbara. I appreciate that so much. Thank you stephanie and cynthia. Thank you thank you. So I think that we'll, oh, let me tell you I was. I got a phone call. Last friday I was on a call with sicily, our chair cecily, harris and isaiah jenkins of the mayor's office, sam biederman, who is assistant commissioner, to the division of arts and antiquities for parks department, and I spoke with lane adenizio of the central park conservancy. So what I was told is that the commissioner silver is very excited about the project, so we have a lot of support. So that's why I think our next stage is to develop this proposal this. Well, I don't know if it's a proposal, but this statement and mission statement and presented to them so that I think that that's the next stage- and I don't think we have a lot to do on this phone call this evening, and I think that if we just get the working copy out to everyone and they make comments, we can get a synopsis together by next week, a center consensus together and have everyone review it and then take the next steps to, and we get malik on the call, but on the call with us and get back to the to the mayor's office and everyone. So our I know some people came in late and we apologize we. The information was not sent out correctly and we have made. We had to make some make some revisions and change the link so that we could have this meeting so, and I want to thank rebecca for getting back to me rebecca I'm, going to need your input on that document and cynthia the educational component that'll be great tahani if you could help out with the the legality, absolutely community. That sort of thing and mrs salam sent us a beautiful piece on how it impacted on the families, and you know so we have some great input absolutely and karen. I do want to also join in everyone and really thanking you for spearheading this and juggling so many different parts, getting it off the road, and this is historic. You know we're going to keep pushing behind you and I think this is going to be. You know. A big legacy to leave behind for the current communities and communities come to know the history of not just our city but the state of our country, and so thank you for staying behind it. Oh you're welcome and I'll just share this. You know I lost my sister in April and this has given me a lot of impetus and, taking my mind off of things, so it was. It was great work, great work that I appreciate. Having had the opportunity to do- and I think my sister would be proud of me very proud, as are we? Yes, thank you. So I don't know if there's a lot more, that we need to say because we I maybe we need to hear from chanel- are you on? Yes, I'm on. I think people are still trying to get on I'm trying to help them hold on. Oh, okay, karen, yes, so I just have a question about you know we're calling this an exhibit. I mean I know we haven't decided, but are we thinking about a combination of panels and a monument like a some kind of a memorial like the the woman's movement memorial? Or what are we thinking about here because we've said exhibition like seneca village, but then we said you know something else. So I'm not I'm it's not really clear in my mind, and maybe it's just because we need to have more conversations, but I was just trying to figure out where we heading with this. I think it's still pretty anomalous at this point. Maybe that's where the artist competition comes in and we can get more of an idea of what it what it would be like. I asked my 16 year old grandson about it and he said that there should be a bench though wow it should be a bench and we should be able to sit and reflect so maybe something where we can reflect. You know yeah. It should include something where there's some reflection so yeah. I there's really nothing solid at this point in terms of what it's going to look like or what the structure would be, but we have to look at what central park conservancy is going to what their parameters are as well. I would this would be something that you see at the beginning of the park, because that part of the park at that time was very uninviting. I know my younger brother was. It was a teenager around that time and he said that it was just a scary place. Sometimes it was a lot of crime in the park. It just wasn't a safe place to be, and for other people they see. You know people see central park as a backyard. You know a country getaway, I mean I just took my grandchildren to the park earlier last year and they had taken the fencing around away from around the swing set, and it was just such a beautiful feel. Just you know, pushing the kids in the swing and there's no barriers, no boundaries. So there are a lot of really great things that are going on in the park and it's getting more and more of a feel of less confinement, and you know like what we feel here in the city in urban area. So to you to that, I really don't just it's still developing. Oh prince, you wanted to say something. Yes, I actually I just you know I just wanted to address what miss copeland was just asking, because on the coil that we had with malik, he expressed something that I asked early on was: would miss copeland be interested in working or speaking with miss salon? And I think I forgot her name, barbara- that dealt with the suffrage. I think, since she was very unperformative yes because I think even before we bring artists in because usually the artist wants a basis of what they're working from, and I just thought that, if miss salaam on miss cooper, I mean I'm sorry miss copeland. At the very least, you know kind of put their heads together, and you know work through that. We can, you know, use that as a foundation, because I, as malik mentioned, there's like a common thread running through. You know what happened with sending a village straight up to the present, even which what happened with the gentleman with the bird thing cooper, mr christopher cooper. So all of these things have a common thread in one way or another, so I just think that would give us a good foundation of which what to work from even with the innocence project. That's why, when I expressed to you before, I think the word innocence, everything can flow from that word innocence in regards to what happened with seneca village. These place people were misplaced and had their life uprooted innocence. In regards to what happened, you know with the exonerated five and ironically, the innocence project. Has that word prominently? You know in their court, you know and what they do so that word innocence to me can be something that we can work around and build on and add all of these different things to. But I think you know that discussion and I don't know if rebecca has the time the innocence project, miss copeland and miss salam, that you know, I think things could should kind of flow from there we're at your service, whatever you want happy to do anything, and you know, even if you know innocence project, ultimately, you know we obviously want to center miss alam and the exonerated five, but we'll do any research or any work behind the scenes to do anything. You want obviously, of course, we're happy to be involved as much as you want us to be by name but just know that we're here to serve even if it's behind the scenes, whatever you want. Oh stephanie, thank you rebecca. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you again, karen, you know, I'm sure your sister's, proud of you and we're proud of you. This has been an awesome experience and opportunity, and so I just want to thank you. I get welled up thinking about who you took this on and what it meant for you and your family. I do want to say that I think at some point I thought we had so much incredible resources, rebecca included. I mean in terms of looking at the exhibit the gentleman who spoke last week. He gave us a blueprint of what it looks like in terms of how you begin to identify an artist. I it was a. It was a master class and it was wonderful. I do think at some point. What I take. What I took away from the panel discussions was that this is a long-term project and that there has to be some sort of a governing body to sort of monitor it throughout the amount of time that it'll take and I did sit on in the chat I had said- I'd be honored to begin to look at a board that consisted of karen and malik yoba and rebecca, and some of the experts who have sat on this panel fundraising becomes a case that fundraising issue came up constantly whether or not there's an establishment of a new not-for-profit. There needs to be a fiscal conduit to begin to raise money, to begin to identify an artist and give them the honor the honorarium, to begin to look at what that that project, what it will come, what it will become, whether it's a bench, whether it's a statute, what it will become that there needs to be a governing body, that's sort of driving that, and I don't think it's a discussion. We need to have right now, but it is something I think we've got to think about and sort of explore at some point. Well, thank you, stephanie. I think that we also looked at whether or not central park. Conservancy would do it, and cynthia can speak to that around seneca village, because I think central park conservancy was funding. That is that correct cynthia, yes central park, conservancy took the lead on this. You know they, after years of trying to get their attention about the significance of the community and what it means to the broader community and certainly the black community. It just took a long time for them to get on board and it only got on board really because there was one person who really decided that she needed to spearhead it, and she had enough sway in the organization to be able to say we need to do this, and so it was you know she got. She came to the institute for the exploration of seneca village. We certainly were involved in guiding and offering and providing materials to her and all, but it really was a conservancy effort that it's there and prince. I like your idea of playing off of innocence. I think that's a great idea, great start, and if you know, if that's where we start and see where we go with it, I think that could be really a pretty fantastic approach. So thank you for the suggestion and yes, I will help. Thank you cynthia. That is fantastic. I yeah I was malik, was saying why reinvent the wheel, so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. That would be best of all, so you know that that's something to think about, but I think that getting a statement over to or a proposal or whatever over to central park conservancy at this point will begin. Give us at least give us some idea of where location you know what a site might look like and then what we can. What can we do with that site? So you know, I think that should be a next step at this point. So I'm sorry somebody wanted to yeah hi. This is terry wisdom. How is everybody had a little bit of a hard time to get in, but I'm in. I think that we should get something over to the central park conservancy, but I think that prior to doing that- and I think that we can do that soon- that we should do some more of our leg work. You know, I know that we talked about doing a walk in the park with ms salam and chanel and whomever, and I think we should do that. I mean I did a walk in the park on my own one evening, really more in the 110th street area. It was dark, so I didn't take pictures, but I was just trying to get a feel for it. You know. I also spent the last meeting that we had at the seneca village project we walked around and then my granddaughter and I sat in the field because I really wanted to get a sense of what we're dealing with. So I think that it doesn't take much for us to do that, but I think if we identify some spaces now, obviously the conservancy knows what spaces we can do. We can't do, but I think if we do it the legwork ourselves and then come to them and say: okay, you know here's a few places and generically it's conceptually what we want to do- and this is our time frame- because I know that you spoke about you know. Obviously our time frame is shorter than the suffrage statute, time frame because we're trying to get it for the anniversary, but pretty much everything does have to be handled like a production. You know this is like a film production or whatever production it is, and you know we have time frames. You know we get board members some of our board. Members are people who are money, people who can attract other money, people and some of our board members. As I don't remember her last name, but you know she was very informative. Barbara you know spoke about. There are some board members that are working members who really you know, get the grit going, and I think that there should be a connection between senate the seneca village project and the central park exonerated project. But I see- and I you know like I said I spent time and I need to go back to the seneca village project, but I think that I feel like the seneca village project can be enhanced, especially if it's going to stay for a long term to maybe even have more physical feely touchy, though you can take your phone and do something, but I feel it should be in enhanced. I feel it warrants that and I feel that the exonerated five really has to make a huge statement whatever it is, whether it's a statue and I love the idea that they had the statue and the statue you know- has like some kind of artist talking and all of that. But this to me the exonerated five project has to make that kind of statement like the suffragette. Nobody can walk by that and not know. This is the exonerated five and not hear possibly the voices. So I feel like that's what we really need to move towards, and this is the last thing I know I'm being a little long-winded, but I've taken a lot of time to really think, and I feel that people gave us great blueprint blueprints. You know from a production standpoint in my mind, things like that. I mean what barbara told us was basically what and how to do what the artist told us, the public art person that was on he gave us a blueprint for it, and I think that with those blueprints, we need to take our energy and search for people, because there are people that this is what they do. We just have to drop people in the slots, even in terms of the education- I don't know if ava duverna dunet is going to be able to be involved, since that film was done oprah. You know what I'm saying I mean this is a huge project and it can be done quickly, but I think we really need to bring our energy. We have the people and the resources and the mental resource. To do this, you know, so we need to use the blueprints, but it needs to be our blueprint, and I think sicily said something in the executive board meeting yesterday. It needs to be with our intention very critical. You know, and stuff can happen. I feel the black lives matter on 125th is a prime example of something that happened remarkable in a short period of time, with a few people with not a lot of money, and there is theirs, knocks it out the park. So that's what I think we can do and what we should do. It warrants that. Thank you. Terry and chanel had her hand up and I'll just come back to address some of the other things that terry had said. I just have a question for century park. Conservatory. Is there any way in light of the fact that we're in covent- and you know we're moving into a different type of world- I do know outside theaters are becoming more popular right, because people don't want to be closed in. Is there any way that we can get some sort of outdoor screen in that section of the park? That would probably run the film and we would name that area after them and it would also show other educational. You know, documentaries that speak to the nature of what happened. I'm not sure, I'm just putting out ideas. I thought you know that's what we were convening for so and that's would be I'm just saying whatever it is. That goes there I feel like. That would be something that should be there in addition to whatever goes there just in life of what is happening, you know and we don't have outside theater. So, oh you mean at this end of the at the northern end of the park. We have shakespeare in the park. I missed it this year right, but we don't have a outside like screen like something a place where it's designated for people to be six feet apart and actually be able to view a documentary. Well, that may be something that could be arranged through parks. I know that the parks department does show movies in they'll, come out with a screen and show movies in the park. So you know that might be something that could be done, especially during this time when people need to get out and and that and it can be done with social distancing, because it's outdoors, so we could take that up in the parks committee sure I just wanted to go back and thank you chanel for that great idea, because we do need to engage people at this time. Terry, you were saying the time the tie-in, with some of the other exhibits, for instance, seneca village central park. Conservancy, is coming back to our committee to talk about plans for a permanent exhibit, so we can address it at that address that at that meeting we also can tie in central seneca village. It's our history, it's african-american history. It's the united history of the united states, there's also a tie-in to the women's suffrage. Monument ida b. Wells was an anti-lynching advocate right and it was really crazy at that time when she was doing her work. You know the lynchings were just really off the hook at that time, and then you have the marion sim statue which was taken down but is being replaced with something. So there are some historical italians which we really need to make and and make that all a part of a curriculum, a learning experience that can be instituted in the school system as well. Yeah, that's just you know. The timing is very possible right, like I said I think the a very key part, especially with the central park, five or exonerated five, is that something that is un equivocally can't be mistaken. Like the suffragette statue, nobody's gonna, walk past there and not know what it is where it is and why it is and the central park exonerated I feel like some kind of a structure, and I like the idea that they had actually like theater stuff that you could hear or go behind it, and I think that's like amazing. You know- and it seems like to me that kind of thing makes a statement nobody's gonna, walk past that and not know what it is, the seneca village. I feel it should be extended forever and it should be enhanced. You know I can't think out loud how it should be enhanced, but it should be more than what it is. So nobody walks by there and doesn't know that they don't have to look and go to the next. You know it it's. It should make vital statements. You know because you're dealing with a public that this is history that has not been told you know and you're, also dealing with circumstances where these kinds of things are still happening, still happening and they're happening on a daily basis and they are impacting our children. You know I had a situation in that happened in southampton. Last week it happened to my son-in-law they're from the shinnecock reservation and he was buying something in the store with the kids and a mixed asian and white woman lost her wallet and came outside and asked him to. Could he empty his pockets? You know what I'm saying and my son-in-law is a wealthy man. You know what I'm saying and runs a lot on the shinnecock reservation and the children were traumatized five, my grandchildren, their cousins. I took them out to montauk point just to kind of walk around and when we got out the car at gusman dock, they all said we're not comfortable. We want to go home. Everybody here is white and they're all looking at us, so you know I'm just saying that we have work to do because what is happening on television that the kids see just like how you saw the little girl crying when the cops came. Children are feeling uncomfortable and it's happening everywhere, and it's still going on. So we really have to do something that says something to change that paradigm, because it's not good well. No. This is definitely a it's a definitely a chain, a step towards social reform. So I think that that's the big picture we have to keep our eye on as well. I mean if our children are frightened- and I was like no we're good. You know what I'm saying, but they didn't feel they were good. They've seen people on television, killing people and they're, seeing you know people thinking that, because you're black and you were in a store, you stole something. You know what I'm saying so this is still going on and the children are traumatized and that has to stop as adults we're traumatized. But if nine year olds are traumatized, we got a problem and it's not. I can't even say I mean in our own communities we're asked to check our packages at the door because it's assumed that we come in to steal so, and this is in our own communities, yeah, so yeah. So this definitely changes long overdue. Yes to go back to, I think miss wisdom mentioned the walk through the park thing, which was something that was discussed before. I just want to expand on that. One thing you can do you know aside from just walking through the park they actually have on their website. I'm talking I'm referring to the cpc central park conservancy they have where they're going to do their renovation. It's up on online and they've, already raised 150 million dollars to do that project. So I'm saying that to say- and this ties into or with ms hori said earlier, that she referenced what malik said about not reinventing the wheel. There is money there for the construction. One number two, I know I recall miss copeland, and actually I keep messing her name, my barbara from the suffrage thing yeah they talked about how one of the main fights was them getting convincing the since cpc to do something that quote: unquote upsets the landscapes, if you will of the park, so in the spirit of not reinventing the wheel. Okay, they're going to do this reconstruction, so that's going to be upset. So, therefore, if we can look right there in that location and that's on the northern meet the harlem mirror, we look within the scope of where that area is that takes away one of their arguments about not quote-unquote, upsetting or rearranging something in the park, and I think that gives us easier path and also since it's been designed, but you can always adjust the design. That's that can always that's a lot easier, because that only exists on paper. What they've done so you know I would employ you everyone to look on that and because it's a wide it's a huge area, and it goes right up to the northern end of the park. So kind of the homework has been done for us. The work has been done for us somewhat already in that regard, and also, if I'm not mistaken, miss copeland can probably speak to this. I think one of the ancestors of from the one of the original landowners in seneca village. Her name is miss williams. If I'm not mistaken, she's like the great granddaughter of the owner, she would be to me and she's young. I think she would be somebody phenomenal to get involved with this, because not only of her ancestry but her age, and that speaks to what miss wisdom was just talking about some of the things I'm sure she's, still probably still dealing with some of the same issues that you know your your son-in-law is dealing with, so that can be part of the conversation and she's directly. Then she has lineage to that location. So I think that would be something that may be helpful yeah. She is about she's in her mid-30s, I think, and she lives in California. Yes, she lives in California, it's kind of hard for her to come, but I know that she would probably we'll raise the money to get in here and there's always zoom right. She can talk to us through that be involved, so there's a lot of ways to bring her in good suggestion yeah. I just wanted to add that to underscore what prince said that whole path there, the harlem year, where they have raised money and that transfers at 110, which goes across they're, really kind of connected. Do you know where that incident actually occurred? You know you when you walk through it, it's almost like logical that you go straight to the mirror, so that connection is a really good idea, just wanted to underscore it. I was you saying that the site of the sometimes it's hard for people to distinguish between the victim of the of the assault and the exonerated five, so I think to kind of stay away from that area would be better. Just to have something more towards the entrance to the park where people come in and they can, they can feel that the park is that they feel welcomed that they have a sense of ownership as to because it's a new york city park. So that's my thinking on that. I would just like to have it more towards the entrance to the somewhere. I don't disagree, but I have to tell you I walk that transverse at least three times a week and I still cannot get away from thinking about those young men and that incident. Whenever I walk there, it's always it's a constant memory. I'm sure others feel that same way. My son was that same age and his friends lived in that building and I always kind of think if he had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, it could have happened. I hear you, but I just think it would be so wonderful to change the debate. You know to change the memory of what happened there, but I don't disagree just something to think about. I mean because it did happen and there was a perpetrator, but it was not these young, these teenagers, it wasn't them well. I think one of the things that we should do is possibly set up if we can a physical, social, distancing meeting to just kind of go and explore the areas. I think what you said. Brother prince, is a good idea that we need to look up exactly what's going to happen or you know what is in the works and then do the research just do some walking. You know, take some pictures, you know, because, when you're on a site, that's how you get inspired, you know you get some ideas that may come to you that haven't, and it's not like it's a hard thing to do. You know what I'm saying and then we could. You know, have some cross discussion about that, because I do think that as we go to central park conservancy, you know we should have a couple of ideas of okay. You know we would like to be here or possibly there. You know have some options and I don't know all of the extent of the seneca village, but I think that you know it should be expanded extended. You know forever and because it's not really it's not like doing anything. That's changing the trajectory of the park. You know what I'm saying. If anything, I think, as it's expanded, more things should happen and it should be. You know like a more visible, stronger thing. You know, but I think we could start with the walk that we said we were going to do and research a little bit prior to the walk and even go to the site where the suffragette statue is gonna, be installed and just kind of meditate on that, and you know, I think that would help us to get some clarity. You know it's action, you know, I'm sorry, I think yes, no, has her hand raised. Yes, I have a question and a statement. So one of the statements I would like to make is that we do put something at the actual site, because I agree with miss palmer that those of us who do go by that site a lot. My mom still lives right across the street, so we still remember like when you walk past that park. It's just like a second nature thought that happens anyway and we need for America to feel that way when they come and they see this site. So I think, instead of staying away from the site because of the controversy, what we can do is tell the story of each victim, including the woman who was assaulted, because that is something that that's the reason why that ava duvet her version of the story was so impactful, because it told the story of several of several different situations that existed at one time and that you know without that. Having without telling that story, you couldn't really wrap your head around the fact that there was one kid that went to private school and there was one kid that went to this school. You understand so I think that we shouldn't run away from that area. We should actually tell their stories their individual stories or somewhat of their individual stories in that space, and then my question is: I was under the impression that the guy- I don't know what his name was, but he gave a presentation on the RFP that there's going to be a RFP that goes out and artists will submit to that, and then we will be a part of that process that chooses what art actually goes there or what goes there. So am I wrong, or is that still going to be the process? But we have some say so in saying: hey this art needs to tell this story or make sure that it. You know you know projects this. I is that what, where we're going with this or are we deciding? You know what you go there? Yes ray barreto, the gentleman's name came on. He just explained the process that you go through for the art, selection and yeah. We would be. We would be involved with that in terms of the jury, selection, juror, selection rather and so yeah. We would be involved with that, so he was just explaining the process. He is not. You know different agencies. In fact, the group that did the work for the art process work selection process worked for the women's suffrage. Monument was with belle isabelle, binder, belle, blender and cynthia want to help me out here, but buyer blender bell. Yes, that's the company that did the work for this woman's suffrage mom, so ricardo barreto is an independent contractor, a consultant yeah there's. Another thing I did want to mention- and this is in regards to capturing the moment I mentioned earlier on when we first started this- and I don't know if anybody was aware that or if anybody looked into it, that the management of that area, the alaska rink and the in an area by the harlem meal, where they're doing the reconstruction that was managed by donald trump and his organization and once yeah, I know right, it's crazy, but you know what it's just good. This is a great thing for this reason that once they once he got wind of the fact that they weren't going to renew the contract they quietly took their name down and the contract is up. Ironically, when the construction is supposed to start, which is 2021.. Now I'm bringing that up because malik mentioned a gentleman named xander schultz, which I looked up, and he has this thing called death by tweet and every time donald trump tweets. He raises money from it and he wants to donate the money towards organizations like what we're doing now. Donald trump, as everybody knows factored prominently in the exonerated fives case. So that is something that we can use right now to raise money for this. But I you know we only have 90 some days in election. I think the most critical time to do it would be in between now and then so you know, I think if we and sarah burns mentioned that she would, you know, she's open to being involved. So you know if there was some kind of campaign created around that. I just think it would. You know right now and also it could also galvanize the community to get behind this as well, so it could be like a two for so I'm just you know, throwing that out there. Okay, so cynthia had her hand raised thanks. I love what prince has been saying, and I support all these ideas and echo it, and this may either be getting ahead of the game, or should we take advantage of the moment and if we are able to do something like that, you know there's this, this artist organization, that has done the hologram of george floyd and it kind of shows up and then it kind of disappears, and they did this fantastic art project just the other day really, and I think it would be so great if somehow we could have the hologram of the exonerated five over the lasker space wow right. That's it you know, and as a as a hey guys, it's coming it's common kind of things right to get people going, but I think that if we could contact that organization that does those holograms and have their images, it would be really something that would be really pretty fantastic. Oh my god, I'm glad I thought of that [Laughter] I am too princess [Laughter] and we need to look into that as well. Nah, that's great! That's! Let's do it! Wow, okay, and just in terms of the fundraising I think you know once we know what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is going to be doing. You know we will know what our next steps are. Once we know what that what they're willing to do, but you know I'm stepping apart, we can raise money for that cynthia, let you know you and mrs let's speak because yeah, let's yeah, let's hit our boy with the tweets. You know I mean maybe he could upgrade send some money right now, but that's something that we could do right away as a sort of save the date. It's coming. It's coming. You know I was going to say with all the ideas that we have. Maybe we can send everything into karen. You know and I'm not trying to put more work on you karen, but we can send it in to karen I'm willing to help and we can go through some of these ideas. You know, like the hologram thing, that's the easy, quick thing which is saying it's coming the idea of looking up exactly exactly what's happening. You know in the park so that we can research and you know, and whatever the other ideas are and to go on a walk together. It's important, so I'm gonna come back to that. Okay, so let's gather it all so we're pro okay. So what we're gonna do is is I will send out the the statement and the mission statement and people can make comments at that time and just send them back to me and I think somebody else had their hand raised chanel. You have your hand raised again, or did we? No you? No, I won already. Oh okay, oh barbara barbie wanted to say something. Well, yes, karen. I think we, along with the mission statement, our vision, should be clear and concise right, because the mission stage statement actually gives light to the vision and our vision has. If I can reference ms salam, she gave a eloquent statement about what division should be. So if we start and I'm hoping she's still online that we go through what her vision is, and I think that was the first panel where we went through different steps. We also talked about digital at that time, so you know. I think this process is also about inclusion of what we've already identified, that we want as part of a vision. So in light of the mission statement, while we're reviewing it, can we also sort of if ms salam doesn't mind sort of give us something in terms of a vision, because she said it- I mean she's, the mother of yousaf, so we're talking about family, the impact innocence, we're talking about the location, we're talking about vision, so our vision should be based on what the families experienced, because those they actually were. The ones impacted. Many of us, as I'm speaking as a mother of a son, we were all impacted, you know, and so chanel was saying you know you can't walk past. This stephanie said you can't walk past it. Well, we all. Maybe if we just put a statement, we talked earlier about benches I kind of put in the chat yeah. Maybe we should have five benches and each bench can actually have a personal statement from each one of the exoner rate of five. You know I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel, but I'm really saying that we together are a magnificent group and everyone has contributed a lot and we need to remain inclusive of that, not exclusive prince. I really like the things that you bring to this, so please hang in there with us. We could use you in a whole lot of practice. [Laughter] barbara, I just like this is one of those kids. Mrs salam did put her a piece in the the statement that statement of a jet of objectives that is going to be sent out so and thank you. I haven't had a chance to read it yet, but I did insert it so it will pour out to everyone. That's she spoke about the impact of the whole experience on the families and the communities, and I think the big picture is that we want to express the I was just in fact, I was just reading the story of george stinney 14 year old, who was executed in south carolina, oh yeah, in 1944, I believe, yeah, and how the exonerated five that their executions were called for, but they survived that and that's another thing. We have to get around the posthumous requirement, but they survived that and it's a testament to their to their fortitude, their strength and that if they, if they didn't maintain their innocence throughout, you know, where would we be today we would be having these discussions today. We will be having the same momentum today. If it hadn't survived then yeah, I think so, is this. The need for social justice reform is so important that you know I have a grandson. I have brothers and you know it's always a concern when you have a black male in your family. You know like endangered species, almost yeah, so very true. So very true, oh I'd like to make a suggestion. Can I be heard? Oh yes, please, okay, now I'm going to suggest this and each time we have these meetings, we seem to have a little difficulty getting everybody in. So I'm going to suggest that we add 30 more minutes onto the meeting simply because it takes it usually takes about 30 minutes or more to get everything straightened out so that we can keep people coming in and hold them on to the meeting, because a lot of people are getting discouraged because they're not able to get in and they can't figure it out. But if we added a little time so a little time to we don't necessarily need to use the little time. So, let's say: if we added 30 more minutes and said well we're going to end it at 8 30., we don't need to use the 8 30. If we don't need it, we can still end at eight o'clock, but at least we have the 30 minutes available. That's all I'm suggesting, and I am, and I am willing to walk around with the park I was on. I can't be seen when I raise my hand. I didn't know how to do visual or something like that. With this new system, you all have so in any event, I'm down to walk it. We just have to set up a time and I'm also ready to meet with the ideas cause. I'm ready for that too. What that was you stephanie with the ideas I'm ready for that too. I'm ready for everything, okay, we're going to keep it moving. Yes, okay, and we apologize for the for the glitch. This is the zoom is a little tenuous at times. You know. Sometimes you know just all kinds of things come up, but we apologize for that and- and I think that you know this is the fifth meeting we've had and it was. It was a lot it was just trying to so. You know we'll do we'll get it right, we're working it. We're working it yeah, uh-huh everything will work out. Fine, yes, so well, we have stayed the course and we haven't canceled. So I think that that's a good thing and we will communicate to everyone. You know I believe I have everyone's emails. Am I seeing wilma? I am I'm on. Oh, I know I'm karen. Thank you and I totally agree with everyone is saying, but the one thing that really sticks out to me, the most is malik. I don't. I don't feel we want to lose him in the source. I know that we want to come to the table with something, but we definitely don't want to lose someone that has vast contacts like he does. So I don't know how we want to pull him in and let him be that voice for us, because he too, I mean he said he doesn't have the money, but he has a money stream that can help us. So I don't know how we want to pull him in, but we definitely want to keep him definitely and we will have him in on one of those calls, but I think right now we need to just develop this statement and let's get, let's have it ready by next week, so it'll go out and everybody can work on it and and get their responses back. Okay, we get that feedback and then we'll put together a working document and I'm going to have to call on some people to help with that. So please be prepared. So is there anything else, any other questions or comments? Karen? I have a question because I don't like the idea that you're that everything is put in your plate right, so a miss alarm and music. I'm sure that at the time there were other influential african-american, I'm gonna say people who made comments of the incident itself. Perhaps I don't have access to the to the literature? Maybe I'm not sure if you kept some of it miss salon, but perhaps we can start some outreach to those that were in support or in or of the situation itself, and make them aware that this is something that we're working on, because we don't want to just put it all on malik as well. We want other people, tyler perry, I believe. What's her name, yes, not just her. There are many. There were many right, and so I'm gonna try and do some research to find out in terms of the articles that were written in magazines. I'll get some people to help me do that, so that we can have at least a list of people that we can say hey. This is what we're doing we need your help. Would you like to help us? Yes, okay. Well, there's a lot of information out there a lot of information, because when this situation started there were articles in the newspaper for what is it every day, every day for two years and longer and then when it started up again, the article started up again, so there's plenty information out there through the articles through the interviews and other types of things that are available. Okay, that is great to have a list of resources, additional resources. You know- and there were some letters that we haven't received this yet chanel. You said we're going to be getting a letter from the naacp, so we need to get those letters coming in the letters from the elected officials and that's right, I was gonna- ask if anyone wanted to help with like campaign stuff, like there's a way to put like a little package together to send the folks that we're trying to get involved. You know to say hello- and I just I just like to say that as a as a subcommittee, we do not do fundraising of the community board does not do fundraising. I know that stephanie, you had reached out to say something. As far as I know you do not do fundraising. We can facilitate certain situations, which is what we are doing at this point, but we are not the fundraising arm of this project so and I think we need to go and see what central park conservancy and new york city parks department is willing to do here. Karen I'm going to continue to sort of work with the borough president's office to see how we can get around that without stepping on anybody's toes, because I absolutely agree with you there's a list of resources that we can solicit so and whatever you I heard you whatever you need. You know we're here, for you just call all right yeah. I think that it's not in the purview of the community board to do the fundraising. I think that there are so many resources exactly have available to us that we wouldn't even need to be involved with that exactly except I don't want to lose because knowing a little bit of something about fundraising, I think malik is wonderful. I think you've set this. I think your passion, that kind of passion needs to fuel fund development, and so I wouldn't want to lose that you guys have become the face of this project and so figuring out how to do it without any conflict of interest is important right. I have a question. Can I can I just clarify something, so I am aware that we're we as a community board we're not able to put something together for fundraising, but is there a way we can put just something together that talks about? You know this committee. You know how it came about what we're trying to do to so when we go to ask you know elected officials to get involved or write letters, or something like that. We ask an organization, you know not necessarily for money but hey. This is what we're doing. Would you like to be involved exactly there's some way? We can at least do that type of campaign. At this point to start to get people involved yeah and not necessarily ask for money yeah. I think we could do a black paper on that and basically run it by those folks who are in power to make sure we're not stepping on any toes, but I totally agree with you, I think, looking at the our bylaws, we it's so interesting- we're silent on the term subcommittee, but there is this idea of working task force group that we identify in our bylaws that list some activities they can get involved in. So I'm sort of looking at those things to see how far we could go, but I love the idea about that package. Putting up together. Our package did, just, as in karen, has done an incredible job. The material is already there to basically identify folks. We want to reach out to make them aware of the project right and what's going on mm-hmm, I think that package is going to do a lot in terms of getting the word out once you have something that you can hand somebody they could look at it. They can see what the mission is. They can see what the idea is. They can see your vision in some form and it helps also the artists who eventually will take on these jobs to express your vision. If your vision is clear, then it's easier for them to make it happen in the way that you have perceived it to be. So it's a very interesting piece and you know we'll move forward with it once that piece has been done. That's what we're working on developing this vision statement that we're going to have done by next week, so we are making steps in that in that direction. If someone had their hand up, I just I just wanted to say this. You know, and this is just a thought you know I want us to manage our expectations and you know and stay focused first before we get off. I want to say I just want to add what everyone else has said: miss orbee, I think you've done a great job and thank you, but I also want to add my condolences, my personal condolences that you've been doing this unbeknownst to us that you know you had a loss, so you know I just wanted to say that before we got off. Thank you. Having said that, I think we're underestimating the power, the brain power that we have in existence and sorry has kind of laid a blueprint out for us how to proceed by how she you know arranged this so and ms salam just made a valid point, which is first of all malik and those people they're not going anywhere. You know trust me, you know if we do what we need to do, we need to, as ms salam said, get a solid thing together. This is why I suggested the most critical people- and you know involved that this emanates from miss copeland, miss shalom. You know and let things flow from there and then once we get something solid, then you know you reach out to these people because I can guarantee you the way to lose them is if you go to them without a job plan, because they they're not here to do the work, that's not going to happen. They usually don't even want to get involved in these early stages. They want you to come with a plan in hand, and actually ms salam did have some people on early on. Just for an example. Reverend butts has, you know committed himself, but he said just said. He can't engage. You know in this, but he has you know given her his full support, so there are others out there like that. We just have to do the work, so you know I just wanted to say that I don't know, excuse me and rebecca. No, I was just gonna add. I totally agree with what prince just said, and I just wanted to offer that we have innocence artist committee at the innocence project, which is a ton of celebrities, and I think when we get to the right time- and I agree with prince- it's got to be like tight and solid and we have to have like the business plan and sort of like this is how much we're fundraising, for I am sure this project will be happy to engage. Those folks or you know, do a kickstarter campaign and you know have them tweet it out, and I'm telling you it'll fundraise a ton quickly. I don't want to like over promise because, but I mean I can't imagine they're gonna say no and we have amazing people like dasha polanco, who's like from new york. You know on oranges and black, but you know like some really incredible folks who I think, and you know obviously through ms salam and innocence project were connected to ava, devarnay and tony goldwyn, and these are all people who I'm sure would love to help financially too, when we get closer but and sarah burns is committed for working with the educational component as well great- and I think I think we're kind of saying the same thing here and I think that you know if we get this piece together by next week, we can take next steps from there. Okay, so quite question karen in order to get the piece together. What do you need us to do? You know? Well, I have a draft and I'm going. I have a draft that I'm going to send out this craft is very rough and I'm just going to ask if you can comment and make any revisions as you see fit and just send them over to me, and I will get gather everything up and and we can, we can determine what the that finished product is going to look like cynthia. Okay, I, with regard to that I was just wondering: can you put it? If you put it in a google doc, then we can just use the google doc and then you don't have to collect all these different emails and everybody sending stuff. We can just look at it and make changes and make comments, and then it's done in one document. You just have to invite us all to be a part of it. I just use google drive for the first time. Oh I'm not I'm not that versed, but I was also I just I'm gonna learn. I was gonna say if you had like certain aspects of it, because we talked about a lot of different things, but if there's some things that are like assignments, you know whatever they may be. Like cynthia spoke about the hologram and I'm not trying to throw that on you. But you know, maybe that's information you could share. That's the good point prince spoke about the you know. Whatever the plan is you know so whatever those assignments are? Maybe each of us can do some of that and then it'll be easier. To put it together and we'll have some more concrete things and I think you're exactly right. You know, brother prince, that you know reverend butts is committed and see. Vernon mason came in, but they're not going to be able to do the work. You know what I'm saying they may be able to help with the fundraise or the fact that they're involved is going to bring in the whole rest of the congregation. But it's going to be some leg work that is going to have to happen to kick it off and we should have as much of a clear plan and, like I said, I think, karen you did a wonderful job by just bringing miss barbara and the other person. That was the art person, because that is the blueprint for it. That doesn't say they have to do it, but it's these things have been done, so you look at what did people do and what worked and you take what worked? And you add your stuff and we do have a lot of brain power here. So, okay, I mean that's what might be good to do the assignments and I did as I spoke. As I said, I spoke with mr salam and she said she sent in a piece I spoke with yusef. He dictated something to me with you know, but if people have the time and they can really sit down and work on a nice book with rebecca about a piece and cynthia certainly would like to have your input. So let's do that and let's just let, let's just think about assignments, I will send the draft out and people can still make comments, but we can ask certain people who have certain expertise to develop certain components. So there are questions on the statement. As I said, it's really rough, it's just a few things filled in and it's a working copy. What's the market still I mean whoever would like to just yes yeah, I'm saying if we still want to do the walk, we could plan a time and I can take some photos. You know of the different. You know places that we saw you know so that people could look at it and get some. You know maybe some visual ideas as well. You know also, if there's a group that would like to I know, chanel had mentioned earlier, to go for a walk with mr salam, maybe that's something that the three of you could do, or whoever else would like to join that group for right now, so that you know we have some idea where we would like to see things I mean when I go to the doctor, I like to do my research in advance. I don't like that. Oh yeah, you tell me, and that can tell me anything so I think that's a good idea to do some research and also you know, find out what parameters they offer to us, but certainly that whole idea of the of taking advantage of the reconstruction of the mir and alaska pool at this time is very much something to be considered and they came to us. We gave them a letter of support for that. We did a resolution around that and we have. I think we should have the design plans for that construction project because I know they're moving the pool up against the rock wall, so they're going to join the body of water behind the pool with the lake. Yes, that's a good idea and it's probably a good idea too, as you were saying, to set up another meeting with the central park conservancy regarding different things in terms of what their plans are to hammer. Well, once we give them once we give them a statement, I think we can begin to talk with them about a location you think cynthia. Did you have a comment on that? I can't hear you you're, muted yeah, just agreeing, I think, you're right. Okay, all right! I think it's what you know. We stay in contact with them as much as possible. I think that's a good thing can't go wrong. I don't think we can go wrong and then I understand what prince said about controlling the narrative, I'm not losing sight of that yeah varian. Well, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put my number and my email in the chat and I'll try to make. I wanna whatever one can go for the walking yeah. Well, I'm not familiar with the chat, so, okay, so help me karen. You can send my number to, and you know you can call and we'll try to. I think if we can do it sometime in daytime that way, I could take some good pictures. You know okay different areas and then we could bring that back to the group to see that'll be great, so that's chanel, you're participating in that. Yes, I mean mom and terry okay, karen I'd like to take that walk as well. Oh who's that wilma yes, oh okay and stephanie. I would like to as well oh okay, great all right so you're in the walk-through team. Okay, yeah. It might be a good idea to think of having to walk early the earlier the better so that there won't be as many people out. Okay, then that way, you'd be able to take better pictures without the crowd. Okay sounds good. Okay, so I'll send an email out so that you can all share. Have your information? Okay! We could try to settle a date and an early time. I think that's a good idea and then it'll be on a sunday morning. May I make a suggestion that you do it in the morning, but I think you need to do it later in the day too, so that you can see how the sun hits things I mean because we don't know, you know what this thing is going to be and we would want to know how is it trafficked or who's going to you know who's around. So if it's possible to do it at sunset or something like that, it might be a good idea to see it. Also. This is like our first walk and I just it won't be the left. It won't be our last and I just wanted to get like some shots, so we could see the clear location and then, if we decide okay, these look good. Then we could look at it at different times, a day. Look at the traffic patterns, and you know, and all of that I think it would be good, oh yeah, because this one is just to get some clear pictures of what it is. You know like how big the space is, what how little it is. You know where it is without a whole bunch of people, because the longer you get right into the park more and more people are going to come. That's true and they're, probably there in the evening too, because it's very cool, but at least, if you have a picture of it, a clear picture, you can say well this is it at, let's say 9 a.m, and this is it at four or whatever. Okay, so I think that's great and whenever the time is that we're ready for that, I would love on harlem network news to do a show. You know where we're talking about what we're doing, and you know what the possibilities are and then I think the whole idea of reaching out to the people that are already raising funds in creative ways, and I don't know the rules with the community board and everything. But if, in fact we can get a non-profit to be the conduit, you know or if we have to create one for this, that's the things once we talk to the conservancy with the package and then they will explain what it is. They do yeah, but I'm saying for the raising of money. I believe that would be on us and you know maybe they match it or something like that, but we probably have to have our own fundraising arm and though- and I just didn't know the rules as it's under the task force of the community board, you know if we can go with a conduit or a completely separate non-profit. That's going to be designated to help us do that. Well, we're going to have to do a lot of that conversation with them as well, because they do raise money and the same conversation and they would know whether or not they can do it or can't do it and then you'll know how to move forward right. They central park conservancy could possibly act as a fiscal conduit. So that's something we would need to look into as well. So just as malik said, why reinvent the wheel we don't need to so I just. I think that this has been a very productive conversation. I'm sorry for the glitches in the beginning, we're going to try to keep trying to do better, and so I'd just like to say that maybe as soon as we have some objectives as to what we're going to be doing that we can end this meeting, and I want to thank everyone for taking the time out. There's been five meetings almost in a row. I think so we all need a break. When is the next meeting? I will get back to you on that. Okay, we have the let's see what happens with parks and with the central park conservancy and getting the the document to them so and then we'll know what next steps would be, because I thought we were gonna, get everything together and meet and then get the document too. No we'll do that over online. We can do that via email. What are you shaking your head about barbara? Well, I was kind of trying to reference terry, because, most recently, the borough president's office put a series of zoom so that you can find out what we actually do as board members and what our guidelines are so that you can find out about the fundraising conflicts of interest. All that stuff would be very helpful so that we're on the right track throughout this process without overstepping or allegations that we're possibly not doing what we need to do. I just I just finished that conflict of interest workshop. It was very interesting. Yes yeah I took it. Thank you. Karen you're welcome, okay, all right! So everybody good night. Thank you! Everybody all right! Good night, good night.
