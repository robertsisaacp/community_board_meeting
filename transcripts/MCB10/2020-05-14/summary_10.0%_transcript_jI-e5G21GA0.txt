Okay, hello, good evening, everyone welcome to the economic development technology and communications Committee meeting.
I used to be economic development, chair for Community, Board 11, some time, ago, and I love the work that you guys consistently.
Much more important Is the data behind that, because much of those contracts are not going to minorities, they're going to white women and That's great that women are getting more and more opportunities, but we have to find a way to study the metrics and provide resources to businesses so that they can benefit, and so what I've done in my capacity as state chair for economic development has brought resources to communities and that's through interfacing with government.
The status quo is broken and we have to ensure that we are having conversations on the community board level in terms of resources to businesses and those resources primarily concern access to capital.
If we can take an inventory of where businesses are in our community, as far as which businesses are going to be able to reopen which businesses have had to are not going to be coming back and what kind of economic impact that's going to have on our local community as far as jobs are concerned, and going back to what you said earlier in your address about the ppp , you know how much money has:?
For you know what that means to urban communities like ours like Harlem, Central, and I'm, not sure that SBS or the city is going to attract that money at all.
What we do know is in the second round, more small businesses, even in the New York 13th district Have been able to get their applications submitted and have had more success in receiving funding.
You were just cast at ten thousand dollars, but more people were on the side of getting the grant money and that has been allocated, but the loan interest was a bit too high and small businesses did not want the debt.
I wanted to know if she had any information in regards to rent freeze it the rent freeze or if there was going to be a rent fees for retail businesses.
For your second question about the challenges with getting loans from the bigger banks, the congressional delegation is specifically, and the leadership in Harlem and in upper Manhattan has really been pushing small businesses to utilize.
You know just a meaning that I've been asked to join a commission for the second Harlem renaissance and Janelle, and everything that the Economic Development Committee is talking about is so in sync with what that particular commission is talking about, and that is connecting the dots.
You know, especially how important technology is today, You know that's a tremendous benefit, but the ability for us to reopen our businesses and the only comment that I want to make, and then I'm going to stop.
That explains what that agency is doing in our community and why it matters in our district And I'm, going to ask the mayor's office to assist us and getting these agencies to have representation.
I would like to see at least three presentations from agencies and not just like the same ones over and over again, but if we can start going through that list to start getting information out to the constituents in the district, I've sent, and I sent letters to the office and Chair Harris in regards to asking elected officials to make sure that we have representation at these meetings and not just the community representative, but someone with actual knowledge and community development and in technology and communication, so that we can have a quality conversation and get something accomplished when they do come and that the community, when they access these questions, that's really We. Also I've also sent the letter to Chairman Harris to review.
You know it's hard to attack an issue without data, and that brings me into the conversation about Mari's project that she has been trying to implement in this community in this committee for about four years.
I'm sure that community committee members can, you know, make themselves available to help, assist and either add in some questions or re.
Can you know, try to contact members before the meeting to see if I can get them to help me answer some of these constituent questions, and with that said, I would If I may.
Is there any way that we can get some assistance from the mayor's office and contacting we have like over, like 50 agencies, that we need to take a look at when people think of Harlem, they think of just a narrow situation, but we have so many different people.
We have so many different businesses that people need a lot of services, and so I took the time to go through all the agencies to see what exactly they do.
I will communicate that to SBS to see if we can get some of that data to understand and see if we can localize to see for Harlem or Cv10 specifically for the businesses that did complete that survey.
Then I think that can be a good step in trying to design a plan to meet specifically the needs of Harlem businesses, and are you guys, working with open data, to possibly provide some way that constituents can access data so that we would be able to see who's here?
If you guys can help us we're going to try to do three presentations committee meeting And, we hope to have a different agencies.
So when I look at that stuff, it's I might as well be looking at chinese arithmetic, but you know, I can definitely work to make that stuff more available and possibly pull in some folks from from open data to kind of break down the numbers and the information that we're looking at.
I know a lot of people received emails about potential grants that the city would be doing for small businesses during Covid-19.
You, know our fulfillment of those that matrix with respect to reopening Well, there's a seven point matrix that governor Cuomo has suggested, and I'm, not sure if it's mandated, but the articles that I'm reading says that the reopening of various communities, and especially relating to small businesses, which is what Chanel is talking about.
However, I think we all know that New York state on pause that has next bricks day of the 15th, which is tomorrow and after that we are going to go into the next phase of reopening.
If you can for the Economic Development committee, we desperately need a representation from the mayor's office, with expertise in development and in technology and communications.
Yes, yes, and we still need you there for the purpose of community relations, because we have the relationship with you, not people with the expertise Are there specific grants that the Mayor Office is providing for media organizations here in Harlem?
If there's emergency task force being created, And he's not being called to the table, then or being able to decide to, you know to send a committee member to the table so that we have some information as to what's going on, then we're losing out, and there should not be a reason why we would not be a part of any racial or equality or any of those type of conversations that are happening.
We asked him to come on and present in terms of telling us what he's experiencing firsthand as a small business owner in Harlem and what is his concerns, and you know what he's experiencing.
The city needs to come up with some sort of specialized support just for seasonal businesses, because there's a lot of people who bank on these summer months on the summer months to make an earning and Now it's like everything's, shut down and definitely for the summer.
Well, I was on the call earlier today with the greater Harlem gym of commerce, and they were speaking about the percentage of small businesses who are not I mean that's crazy, We is there a point where we reach where we say we can't afford to not open up.
I. Think that's a conversation that we need to have in terms of you know the economic impact No longer saving lives, but we're like dooming people, doing entire generations of people, especially in communities of color, who are losing the little bit of wealth that you know they may have been able to build up over the course of several generations.
We can see what they're describing that they are doing and what they're spending their research and development, on, and so I think it's a matter of seeing how Covid-19 affects our current norm right It's, going to be some people probably having to step up in spaces right people like you, You know.
You know it is very clear that the reopening of New York relates to, and I have not heard anything back from anyone regarding to these seven matrix, And And I'll share with you and with the committee and with the board you know, It is essential for us to understand exactly what those matrices are.
Cuomo lays out seven matrices for reopening New. York City currently meets four who, on our community board and who, on this board, and the committee understands what those four are and the three that's remaining.
We have to be able to say that to our small businesses, you're not going to reopen until we meet these remaining matrices.
That is exactly where we need to as an economic development committee as a board of Community, Board 10 Every week, I read through these documents and I try to pull out the you know pieces that we can understand because a lot of this stuff, like this last meal, that come out it's 1800, pages.
You know in the masses like we need to and that is going to impact small business.
Can you just give me one second, while at the board member this question, I wanted to just remind people of the fact that you've made that very strong connection with your chair person position now with economic development and technology, that you're going to be very intentional about the importance and value of technology, not just with respect to businesses, entrepreneurs, but residents, and I just wanted to make sure that everyone heard that I know.
They have a very robust website and what in sales business online out, you know Long before Covid-19 hit and one of the problems that I noticed working with small businesses in Harlem.
We are going to continue the process of the delivery aspect because it is definitely help pivot, whereas we could, you know, get our regular business as well as to take out a delivery.
I could I'm going to fail, but honestly, in terms of regular business, how we were doing before right, now, just on a number , I'm thinking that we, if lucky, might get to like 65 to 70 percent of business, that we did before again We're, not a club, we're not a place that you know holds a hundred some more people Our regulars will still continue to come, but I'm thinking a reduced bit about 30:35, but the pivot is again we're doing more delivery now that we were doing before so that will help and us reaching out to, for example, the doctor officer, And, there's some other stuff that we're working, on.
I said what else as a community board, can we do to assist your businesses, like yourself, write out this pandemic so that you are around once well?
Just saying this to say that you know in terms in terms of like what we do with the small businesses throughout Harlem and what we're doing on the east side.
