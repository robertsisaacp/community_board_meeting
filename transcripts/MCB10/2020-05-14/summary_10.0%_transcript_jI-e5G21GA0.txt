Excuse me from buffalo to utica new york city through eastern long island We are very heavily concentrated in the new york city area, where we have 15 branches In your neck of the woods we give the new york branch or otherwise known as the harlem branch I leveraged the expertise in real estate, development and architecture, To first sit on community board 11 and then utilize that economic development outreach to influence the new york state naacp What we focus on for the most part is small business development, particularly of businesses owned by minorities and women You know both the state and the city have pledged to facilitate increasing amount of contracts for businesses that are owned by people of color What we find is much more important is the data behind that, because much of those contracts are not going to minorities, they're going to white women and that's great that women are getting more and more opportunities, but we have to find a way to study the metrics and provide resources to businesses so that they can benefit, and so what I've done in my capacity as state chair for economic development has brought resources to communities and that's through interfacing with government State government and I've participated similarly on the city level, and so, particularly during this pandemic period, or what I'm going to call the post-pandemic period.
I have a question or two first of all, there's a new commissioner for the department of small business services, they're going to put forth to recognize and address the post pandemic Bishop- is on the recovery committee for Covid-19 through the mayor's office My concern is for harlem We can take an inventory of where businesses are in our community as far as which businesses are going to be able to reopen which businesses have had to are not going to be coming back and what kind of economic impact that's going to have on our local community as far as jobs are concerned, and going back to what you said earlier in your address about the ppp , you know how much money has:?
Think it's an interesting question from the perspective of understanding who owns the businesses right, because, if you're asking about how businesses in general are going to recover or who is going to recover, be impacted, that's a question: If you're asking about businesses owned by people of color and how they're going to recover that's a different question and I think they're both important You know, for example, on the governor's committee for the advancement and reopening of new york.
But what we do know is in the second round, more small businesses, even in the new york 13th district, have been able to get their applications submitted and have had more success in receiving funding As of now, there's about 90 to 100 billion dollars left in the ppp of funding, and that's because more people are applying they're, not asking for as much funding as the first round Is the economic injury disaster mode, which was the ten thousand dollar grant?
You were just cast at ten thousand dollars, but more people were on the side of getting the grant money and that has been allocated, but the loan interest was Other positive thing is that the columbia harlem sbdc, which is a small business development center, has been helping.
Weren't processing their loans, if they weren't a customer, So I just want to understand for those small businesses that aren't able to get any funding what's being done in regards to event and I will follow up with this- for you, rent freezes apply for residential and commercial The governor extended another 60 days until august 20th For your second question about the challenges with getting loans from the bigger banks, the congressional delegation is specifically, and the leadership in harlem and in upper Manhattan has really been pushing small businesses to utilize.
People have been talking about the new normal, but it's the new abnormal You know, especially how important technology is today So, you know, that's a tremendous benefit, but the ability for us to reopen our businesses and the only comment that I want to make You know is that there's these metrics and those metrics have to do with a number of things that regard health.
I would like to see at least three presentations from agencies and not just like the same ones over and over again, but if we can start going through that list to start getting information out to the constituents in the district, I've sent and I sent letters to the office and chair harris in regards to asking elected officials to make sure that we have representation at these meetings and not just the community representative, but someone with actual knowledge and community development and in technology and communication, so that we can have a quality conversation and get something accomplished when they do come and that the community, when they access these questions, that's really We. Also I've also sent the letter to chairman harris to review In regards to scott stringer.
So I personally think that it's necessary information and that we do need to take some initiative to figure out a way to gather that data I reviewed her project and questions I'm sure that community committee members can, you know, make themselves available to help, assist and either add in some questions or re configuring Some of the questions so that we can possibly put that on the website for the community board district that she creates.
Can you know try to contact members before the meeting to see if I can get them to help me answer some of these constituent questions and with that said, I would If I may Official representatives that is isaiah is our other elected official on the line representation from the main office If you can just speak briefly about what the mayor is currently addressing in this moment in time and in relation to the district that we're in and to economics and technology, sure thank you, chanel and thank you.
We have so many different businesses that people need a lot of services, and so I took the time to go through all the agencies to see what exactly they do and we are suffering here in terms of the co-vet because of lack of data and lack of agency transparency You just gave us a report on two agencies and we have how many agencies a lot exactly So I think that somewhere in this there's other agencies that we should be tapping into as the economic, development and technologies and communications committee, because right now, as I mentioned to the chair and the first vice chair-- is that now is not the time for us to leave the technologies and communications part of the title of this committee out Is the mayor's office looking into that?
then I think that can be a good step in trying to design a plan to meet specifically the needs of harlem businesses, and are you guys, working with open data, to possibly provide some way that constituents can access data so that we would be able to see who's here?
Personally I'm, not a data scientist So when I look at that stuff, it's I might as well be looking at chinese arithmetic, but you know, I can definitely work to make that stuff more available and possibly pull in some folks from from open data to kind of break down the numbers and the information that we're looking at, but I'm happy to work with you a lot of people received emails about potential grants that the city would be doing for small businesses during Covid-19 I know from their update that they did launch an employee retention grant and a business continuity loan fund.
I am not entirely familiar with a lot of those processes that come out of the governor's office , However I think we all know that new york state on pause that has next bricks day of the 15th, which is tomorrow and after that we are going to go into the next phase of reopening The mayor.
The governor did release the four stages of reopening and we are going to go into stage two as I understand it after tomorrow, oh no just charleston, Is it possible that the mayor office can send people who are ex who have expertise in these areas to this meeting once a month, so that we can have a real conversation?
What you're saying chanel that there are all these things going on and we need to be informed, I mean that that's just extremely critical Someone told me about a media grant today and that's something I'm interested in with you know home network news and many other things Thank you, terry all right, so would you be able to communicate that to your office that cb10 We have the chair of housing on this call right and he's not being called to the table then or being able to decide to you know to send a committee member to the table so that we have some information as to what's going on , then we're losing out, and there shouldn't be a reason why we wouldn't be a part of any racial or equality or any of those type of conversations that are happening now.
So we're going to move on to community comments and concerns So. Is there any concerns or comments that community members or board members have at this moment that we haven't discussed on this, call that we may should keep in mind or put on our radar or begin to think about addressing that they would like to share with the committee at this moment , yes, we asked him to come on and present in terms of telling us what he's experiencing firsthand as a small business owner in harlem and what is his concerns, and you know what he's experiencing He is still I believe in business and serving so You know as a small business owner.
Think that's a conversation that we need to have in terms of you know the economic impact, but we're like dooming people doing entire generations of people, especially in communities of color, who are losing the little bit of wealth that you know they may have been able to build up over the course of several generations?
Seven matrices for reopening new york city currently meets four who on our community board and who, on this board, and the committee understands what those four are and the three that's remaining We have to be able to say that to our small businesses, you're not going to reopen until we meet these remaining matrices and I'm, not trying to be critical, You know intensive care units, you know testing and if we're not doing that as a community board, then how do we expect?
When we're saying health versus you know, the economics- You know when you're dealing with a health situation, then it's not one or the other We need to be working from both ends, and the fact of the matter is even though, when new york city opens When I looked at those matrix charles, we in harlem he's saying that people who were affected the most are not going to open until they're ready.
It's two people who's, the two people, that's trying to speak One was me tony from tbo, harlem, You just give me one second, while at the board member this question, I wanted to just remind people of the fact that you've made that very strong connection with your chair person position now with economic development and technology.
Think that's a lot of pressure from the community that they're getting and the information that you guys are putting out there Well they passed the bill, but the mayor still has to sign the bill so for it to go into effect, but that's definitely something I saw So these companies, these third-party delivery services have really been taking advantage of the situation, knowing that restaurants right now are dependent on them.
