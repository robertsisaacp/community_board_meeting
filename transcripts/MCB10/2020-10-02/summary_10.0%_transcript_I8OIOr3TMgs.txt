There was kind of like a pact made amongst all of us on that call from Assemblywomanist Dickens office to councilman Perkins, Senator, Brian Benjamin's office, the Manhattan world president's office district leaders were all on that call that we needed to make sure that everyone was in the know.
We want to make sure that you all come out on that Tuesday when John Lynch, representing FDBA, will be there to talk about it, and we will make our you know request to him as a leader of deaf dba of what the community would like to see.
When we were talking about what the Harlem mirror should look like and all the reconstruction there how it you know, came to a project or social justice and restitution and of a re, I, guess a reopening of our community above one tenth into the partly welcoming them back from such from some of those injustices that were injustices that were done.
They did not need a statue in the park of commemoration or remembrance of what had happened, secondly, that they were wilding, and this is what the word that was used in the Burro Board meeting that they were wilding at the time.
They wanted to know if there was any way that, while they support change and social justice and the penal system, they do not think that the exonerated five needs to be the center of our resolution.
I think it requires a city council vote for it to happen, but they're pushing that way, and I just want to speak on certain things that come with the open streets once they decided that they would have the open, streets.
You have mentioned that we've met with the community stakeholders, elected officials as well as district leaders, and they wanted some feedback as far as the processes of specifically the MTA and the department of sanitation.
You know when they come to the district service cabinet about that I think she had a class or something Just I see several non- executive committee.
We have the executive committee considering the electronic voting resolution shantik.
We briefly talked about this at our last executive board meeting the dilemma of our bylaw, stating that we have a election coming up in November, however, that it also requires us to cast ballots in person, paper, ballots and sign them.
Do we continue to vote and have an election in November if we are not able to meet in person?
But if we do so in this meeting, I will go ahead and panel, the election committee and they will take up their job of figuring out the electronic voting system with Shatek and Juanita, and I prepare to have an election in November.
The only reason why I was like, if we, if the board, if it was their pleasure to go forward with the November election, that's why we change it to an election committee that we're no longer nominating anyone.
The Election committee assembled all the materials and distributed all of the materials to all board members in a unified, streamlined communication so that everyone had the materials in advance for review.
We feel like there's on readiness to vote here for this, or do we want to change it to reflect a December election.
So I would not panel the committee tonight and they could already start looking into what they need to do to do the electronic vote, because that's the biggest thing I do not think the lift is getting the announcement out, because you can do that at the next General Board meeting on the third.
If they, if the board votes for this, then you could announce that there's an election and the process at that point And then they would still have the month of October to submit their documents.
The Election committee worked hard with the district office to make sure that all the materials are documented.
Marquis raises a good question, though the fact that you mean our General board meeting is slated for the day after the election day.
And I think it's on us to just remind everyone that the work continues the day after election day, including our work for Community Board, 10.
And I've seen it on Zoom like Kevin said, and it was very public when I saw it And, we will also, as usual, state them during the meeting and have them for review in the office, because we always keep the votes in the office.
Let's see she's present dineen; okay, a movie Karen Dixon; Charles Johnson, Absent, Chanel, Washington Absent, with that it looks like the resolution, carries one two, three four: five : six: seven, eight nine, with nine voting.
With that Dr, Dukes and Committee, I am asking to impanel the election Committee to look into the resolution we will be presenting at the October General Board and to begin the election.
Kevin did raise the point that if it's any member that served on the election committee is running for office, you need to replace them.
Think my logic in December was that I believe the election can be supposed to be voted on right.
What you're saying is the current election committee can't be impaneled because they need to be voted in the October?
If it's not a full slate of election officers, the chair being able to appoint one so for Stephanie's point, you know: Should it be stephanie that we're saying that the Election committee will nominate and another individual to fill that slot, or will that be done by our chair?
The amendment is that an election for the an election at the October General board meeting will take place for the election committee.
You know we give the election committee the ability to appoint, got it so long as it's not someone who is running.
Choosing members, but I do think that if our bylaws state that they should be elected and that if there is a vacancy, I, think it would be, it might be more appropriate to have the board than allow them to choose that open seat or two But this is why my logic is that I just think the perception of that is that the board had a say at least, and if we're empowering already the panel that was already there just so that there's no bias I would say we might want to allow the board to make that choice of if there's any vacancy on the committee.
If we go your route, you know, then we're talking about a an election committee that in fact we'd have to state that they have the ability to function up to that time, because they would be short well.
They want to nominate and vote someone for replacement there next Wednesday, or do they want to allow the election committee to do that?
Should the board not want the election community, something like that and kind of give them that option.
We propose a commemorative permanent art piece cited in the and at this time we we talked about a northeast section of central park, and this exhibit would celebrate the extraordinary diversity and history of our community while pointing to the city's aspirations for the future.
The presentation does not speak to the, why it is necessary, and I think, if we're going out to other boards asking for support.
So I think we may need to do something, and the faq sounds like a great idea on the education of the process, because, though we know the necessity for this in our community, when we go out to other spaces.
We'll make sure that the presentation says that as well you're welcome what the committees ask is to move this forward to the the mayor's office, the President's office, Central, Park, Conservancy and New York City parks to begin to initiate the process If there is not anything, I do not believe we have to vote on this.
I think that you know it's a work in progress and those of us that are on the task committee are in complete agreement that we have to say the.
Parks Committee Awesome work Would we be able to move this on move this forward to the agencies that I mentioned the mayor's Office Central, Park, Conservancy and New York City parks?
I know, there's a letter, but will you be attaching the presentation that you just did with that letter when you send out for folks to get on board , it would be a virtual presentation and any supplemental documentation with respect to letters of support which we're hoping to get by October, the 9th on or before October , Chanel clearly, but I think what may be being said is as we're going out.
I think it's clear you know, but at the same time I think this also needs to go to the board for a vote next Wednesday before anything goes down to any of those respective representatives, elected officials or agencies.
I mean I, see what you're saying, because it is a reflection of the board and we are putting this out like a big letter of support.
Okay, so I will entertain a motion now to support the Parks Committee Presentation and after making those revisions that we will send this to.
Well, I think we do not vote on it and then Maybe denise can get clarity prior to the board meeting next week and we can vote it out of the executive committee.
