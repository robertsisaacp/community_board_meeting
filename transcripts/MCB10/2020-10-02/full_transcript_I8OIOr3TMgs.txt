Okay, I know he's. I spoke to him today and he had not had it as yet, but thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. I sent some materials for the from parks and rec. If you can hear me, oh okay, I just emailed it to you. The committee, oh, I said: do you want this to be emailed to the committee to the Ec? Yes, okay, thank you. So I do not believe we have corn, but we can go ahead and start and then I know folks will be joining us, but I will go ahead and call the meeting to order at 6:36 pm hold on it's pretty loud here hold on really quickly. Hello. Sorry about that. If you heard a lot of background noise, so I had to just close the window, but now that we are called to order, I believe you all should have received in your packet, the October calendar. So please take a look at that and make sure that those are the meetings that you will be able to have. I know the 12th is a holiday, so I believe that affects arts and culture. So we will have to probably reschedule arts and culture, so we'll talk to George and Jerica about rescheduling that okay, so we'll go ahead and move on to the reports. Okay, for my report, so we have a busy September. I believe Deborah will talk about her back to school event. I think she'll be able to join the call, but it was a terrific event. We had sponsorship from Street Corner Resources Emblem Health. We were able to give away thermometers and I believe we gave over 250 backpacks that had thermometers and mask various items for the young people. So I want to thank, I know. Stephanie was out there Donna Gill, I think Denis made it out there Stanley derek Karen, a whole host of people made it out. So just thank you for coming out making it a really big success. The Manhattan bro president was able to join us. She was still talking about all the wonderful things we're doing so. Thank you for that, after that it was a busy day. So after that we went to celebrate Miss Nixon and she celebrated her 100th birthday and yeah. Yes, we were able to present her with a proclamation Senator Brian Benjamin. Was there the lovely Dr Hazel Dukes? Was there the pastor of the church, because it was right outside of mother Amy Zion and I believe it was put together by Miss Montgomery so and a past chair judge, Frank Perry was there, so it was a really big celebration. She enjoyed it. She was in her finest she was looking cute. She was even dancing and she spoke for about 20- 25 minutes. So we were able to hear some well aged words of wisdom there for us, so it was really a good celebration. So thank you all for that and Shatik was there as well. Shatique was at was with me at all these events, so portia T, but then we went to Brian Benjamin's event, hope for Harlem, which was co- sponsored by Fcbc. We saw faithful, Deacon Charles Powell out there as well as Brian, and it was a great event. I got to speak on the Mic very quickly about what we just did and congratulate them on the success of their event. One thing that was very evident is that you know there's a lot of things that a lot of people in need and it was packed with folks. So this time was a you know, crucial time to be out there, but one thing was also certain is that I do not know for not getting the word out there enough, but there were so many left over items that you know it felt that we need to do more to make sure that people are in the know in the community to make sure that they are able to come out so, but it was a really good event. Oh and I see Markeisi joined and he was out there for the book bag Giveaway. So again thanks everyone for that it was a very busy day. So I'm going to just quickly move on to the open streets. Conversation open streets, open restaurant, so that has been a big conversation in our area, especially with the shutdown of Frederick Douglass Boulevard for those eight to 12, restaurants, that are there the 112th to 120Th Street shut down. So it appears that several people were not in the know, including some elected officials, that it was happened that it happened. I when we talked to FDBA, saw a call was requested, so folks got on that call to discuss you know who knew what when, but it became apparent that a lot of folks were left out of those decisions and again, as FDBA, has totally made clear if they do not have to come to anyone, they do not have to get anything it's done by the mayor's office, it's approved by the mayor's office. So it's between that organization, those businesses and the mayor's office about who gets approved. So, in the end, it's about what we as a community want and if they're wanting to get sponsorship and stakeholder buy- in from the residents, it's important that they make that outreach. So there was kind of like a pact made amongst all of us on that call from Assemblywomanist Dickens office to councilman Perkins, Senator, Brian Benjamin's office, the Manhattan world president's office district leaders were all on that call that we needed to make sure that everyone was in the know. So we had that call that day then CB10 sponsored another call just to further talk about what we could do to support FDBA and get the word out to the community also respond to a lot of the issues. If you all remember, we were on top of it from beginning our transportation committee. We had those meetings, we put it out to the general public that we were having those meetings. Fdba, you know, did not contact us when it was actually approved. So we were not able to kind of blast that, but they did not get the word. I guess until the Wednesday before they were approved that Friday before it was supposed to start, and we found out in a press release. Basically, so it is like mini draw, balls were dropped, but the mayor's office does need to make more of an effort, and they promise to do this to include us. D.O.T needs to make more of an effort. I have been in constant contact with our D.O.T reps about, what's going to happen to the m10 bus, and when will people know about it? It's still a mystery, sometimes where the m10 buses Friday through Sunday, and that is totally ridiculous as we're on like the third weekend. Things have not been lined out and if they have been, they have not been officially communicated so, and we were talking about that, we talked about what's going to have to happen to the assessor ride, that's been an issue we talked about. What's going to happen for our seniors, that's been an issue. We talked about. What's going to happen for trash pickup, that's been an issue. We talked about. What's going to happen with the sound, that's been an issue, so Cb 10 was asking these questions from the beginning, and that's what I wanted to make clear to everyone on that call while mdba while we want to be the liaison to the community, sometimes the community does have to respond to us and come to our meetings as well we're trying to get the word out as much as we can. So we have made a commitment to again send emails to all the elected officials so they're on top of that so much so that FDBA is coming back to the transportation meeting to talk about what happened and to talk about next steps because, as it has been extended permanently, so us as a community board, we as a community board need to make that make a plea to Ftba make a request to the fcba that they do not have to do it. It's what they should do as a as a partner in the community they do not have to. They do not have to go. They do not. They have the right to go ahead and continue the open streets and shut down Friday to Sunday. Until you know, God knows when March of 2021. At this point, that's you know it's extended permanently, but what we want them to know is that they should listen to the community as a good community partner. As of what our community needs, so October 31st is already the date on the calendar. That's what we have had in our head to go on into November and December. One does not make sense in a in the cold to make sure that those streets are shut down Friday to Sunday, probably not, but what we want to have is a community agreement with them. So we want to make sure that you all come out on that Tuesday when John Lynch, representing FDBA will be there to talk about it and we will make our you know request to him as a leader of deaf dba of what the community would like to see. So that's a conversation that we'll have then- and I believe one last thing- Burro Board. So if y' all saw what happened at Bro board a little bit Karen's going to talk about it in her parks and Rec report about the exonerated, five Manhattan president has supported our exonerated fire project from the beginning and so much that she has already sent a letter of her support. She also wanted it to be a burl wide initiative, a worldwide resolution that they are in support of our exonerated five project. So it came to the last Bro board. Last Thursday- and I briefly spoke about. You know how it came to be that it was the brainshot of Karen, Orry and Chanel Washington, when we were talking about what the Harlem mirror should look like and all the reconstruction there how it you know, came to a project or social justice and restitution and of a re, I guess a reopening of our community above one tenth into the partly welcoming them back from such from some of those injustices that were injustices that were done. Then it seemed like it was going well until CB4 immediately said they will not be able to support us immediately. They did put some things on the record. I did communicate those things to Karen and we she has a great presentation tonight that she'll show you all that we are going to take to the board. So a boar vote was not taken because CB4 and in their right raised some questions, some of the things that they said why I did not agree with how they said it and again they are open to welcome to their opinion. One of the things that they brought up is that the exonerated five had already been compensated with millions of dollars. Therefore they did not need a statue in the park of commemoration or remembrance of what had happened, secondly, that they were wilding, and this is what the word that was used in the Burro Board meeting that they were wilding at the time, and you know they were there, so something must have happened, not that they did it, but they are not the model citizens that would deserve a statue in the park. So those are the things that they bought up. They wanted to know if there was any way that, while they support change and social justice and the penal system, they do not think that the exonerated five needs to be the center of our resolution. While we can talk about social justice, do we need to include the exonerated five in that conversation, so they asked if we would, you know water down or even take out the exonerated five out of our resolution, so that was a very interesting conversation. I was kind of taken by surprise for those points. I thought there might be a little bit of pushback, but those type of things I was not really. I was very shocked at that, but they did put that out there. So I did communicate that to Karen, and the presentation that Karen has today will reflect some of those answers. But, most importantly, a lot of the boards now want to hear and see our presentation they most of them were in favor of it from the beginning. But now we have to do our due diligence to go to every single board in Manhattan if we would like to get all of their support. So that's what we're going to be doing. We've already got in touch with some of the chairs of the different boards and they've invited us to either their parks, Committee or their Social Justice Committee, to talk about our initiative and why they should sign on. But those are the type of things you know. You think that folks are moving towards an acceptance and a an awakening to social justice issues. But then you hear those kind of comments it kind of takes you back. Are we really in 2020 right now and we are so? These are the things that we have to do. There are other things that happen, but those are the things I wanted to highlight and that is the end of my report. Are there any questions? Okay, we will move on to the trends report. Josh are you on? I do not think he's on, but I'll jump, yeah I'll jump back. I'm sorry! This is terry wisdom. This is terry wisdom and I had a question I wanted to know like how much they weigh in on this, since they had all these comments, what impact do they have on? What we're doing and what's the best way for us to you know, be well prepared for this kind of thing, because I mean this is what it's all about right now. You know we do not think that we're there, but we are- and you know it's sorry- a representation of unbiased unconscious bias. You know so I mean we've got to address that and we've got to address it seriously because, no matter what even though they were exonerated they're looking at them as if well, they must have did something they're black. You know, and I mean we have to be clear- that is the thinking of some people and they do not think they're thinking that. So it's an issue, terry. So really we only need the support of the surrounding boards surrounding central park. That's all! We really need to go forward with the project. However, when it becomes a borough board resolution, we need a majority, so there's 12, so we need seven and I believe we will have that. So nothing right now will stop the project. I believe the boards circling the park are in favor. Karen will be able to talk about that, but to address many of those issues when I spoke to Karen about it, she that's one of the reasons why she kind of put those questions. I know you were in that exonerated five meeting. She posed those questions to the subcommittee so that they can be answered in the presentation and the slides. So it is a part of a bigger conversation and when that happened at Barrel, Board, Bro, President, Gail Brewer did take it very seriously and it's considering doing implicit bias. Training I've already been in touch with cba to talk about those things and not one to just be we're going to frame it in different ways so that it's not just attacking the spirit but actually educating at the same time. So that's what we want to do so cba is on board. I believe the other boards are going to sign on and we're going to do one a internal community board training not open to the public, but just within the 12 boards, because if we are supposed to be representing our community, what does that mean? And what does that look like if we can not speak for them, because we do not understand them? So that's what we're doing. Thank you for that. Okay! Did you did Josh come on, or are you ready to do? Yeah I'm going to do the treasures report so I'll say: since the fiscal year started, we are in what August September going into October. This will be our third month. I'm considering you know that we started off with not as much money to spend this year because we're working remote we're not spending a lot at all. We just have our basic we're paying for our lease payment on our copy machine, as well as our internet service. With that being said, right now we're at our remaining balance for the for the remainder of the year, seventeen thousand seven hundred and twenty two dollars and 48. So we're pretty good on that. I'm also just going to just for an announcement there's going to be some renovations and improvements to the district office at 215, West, 125Th, Street, so I'll be meeting with the property manager and D- Cass on this Friday at the office. I'm just to go. Look at the space they're going to be painting the walls and also I'm giving us new floors new carpet. So that'll be good upgrades. So then, when we go back to the office, hopefully they'll get everything done in a timely fashion. When it's time for us to go back, you know we'll have something new, I'm going to go. You know back to work, and so that's good. So that's all! I have right now for the treasures report, I'll just move into my report. One question on the Treasury report: are those renovations and improvements? Are those budget impacting or are those part of our lease and their just general facility maintenance upgrades and improvements? Well, it's part. This has to be done as part of our lease our renewal, so we're currently on a month- to- month basis. We've been that way. I know, since I've been district manager for at least two years, so this process has been going on and going on, so they have to make these improvements to the space before we can even go into the new lease agreement does not come out of any existing budgets. No. Thank you. Okay. So on to my report, just to talk about two events that I've attended other than the book bag. Giveaway that cicely mentioned earlier was two census and voter registration events. One was held by a neighborhood restaurant called neighborhood brule, that was in collaboration with street corner resources. That was a nice event. They had games, people stopped by was outdoor seating. People came out and signed up for the census as well as voted registration. Another one was given last week by Comptroller Scott Stringer, his census event was held at the Accra restaurant at 2065 Adam Clay Empowered Junior, Boulevard, State, Senator, Brian Benjamin came out as well as assembly member Inez dickens on board members of Janine brown, black men, as well as Tahani Abushi, we're in attendance, and I want to thank Nina Saxon from Comptroller Scott Stringer's office, for extending the invite and for us coming out and assisting with the event they were giving out on PPE and they were giving out free mails to the community, so that was that was a great event there. As far as community assistant hiring just want to announce, we are currently hiring for our community assistant position. The new job was posted on September 25th and the posting will be available for 30 days after the 30 days is that we will stop accepting applications just because of the pure volume. When we originally posted this position, we received many applications and we started our interview process. However, that process was suspended due to Covid-19 and subsequently there was a hiring freeze on city employees due to the pandemic. Since that time, we received notification that we can hire only one person at this time, so we decided to repost the job listing, because we understood that people's situations may have changed over these last few months, so we are still accepting applications up until October. 25Th. Today is the first day of indoor dining citywide. The far as in indoor dining protocols will require temperature checks. One party of each group must leave contact information for contract chase contact, tracers there'll, be no bar services. Masks must be worn unless seated at a table to eat tables must be six feet apart and restaurants must close by midnight the mayor's asking that people call or text the task force. They have a task force set up for this anonymously if they see an establishment breaking the rules and having more than 25 percent occupancy and fyi. Every restaurant is required to post on the 25 occupy occupancy threshold and also you're supposed to have the text number of the task force available to people who are coming into the restaurant. If you notice there's a violation or you want to make a complaint, they urge you to do so just to expand a little bit on what cicely was talking about as far as the outdoor dining season and the open restaurants. It is not permanent at this point, but they're trying to to go permanent. I think it requires a city council vote for it to happen, but they're pushing that way, and I just want to speak on certain things that come with the open streets once they decided that they would have the open streets. You know in our district, it's on Frederick Douglass, on boulevard. There's certain categories that they're going to expand on one of the categories is called adjacent properties and the city will allow restaurants to expand seating to the frontage of adjacent properties. As long as the adjacent property owners formally agree to use the space for a specified period of time and commit not to charge a fee for its use, the city excuse me. The restaurants are also going to be working with state liquor authority because if they want to serve liquor or alcohol on the on the adjacent site, they're going to need another form or application to be filled out, but all of those things are being worked out as we speak. Everything should be all the forms and everything that the business owners would have to fill out should be in. I think, by the end of October. Another thing that they're adding to the open streets is heating. So, as the cool weather arrives, the city will allow restaurants to incorporate heating elements into their outdoor dining setups, which would include electrical heaters, which would be allowed on both the sidewalk and the rope in the roadways, propane and natural gas heaters will be allowed on sidewalks only and they will remain prohibited in roadway seating and the propane will require permit from the Fdi fdny and compliance with fdny regulations. Another thing that they're adding is tents, so the restaurants will also be permitted to use tent enclosures to keep the diners warm and partial tenon closures. At least 50 percent of the tent side or the Wall surface area must remain open and electrical heaters are allowed. So I know that sicily, you have mentioned that we've met with the community stakeholders, elected officials as well as district leaders, and they wanted some feedback as far as the processes of specifically the MTA and the department of sanitation. So I reached out to the MTA and they gave me a little information, not a lot, but basically what they said that as far as the notices that are being posted, you said that notices have been posted regularly. I'm about the rerouting of the bus stops and they said that most of the signs are posted, either late at night before the street closure or early on the morning of the street closure. So that's all they gave me as an answer or response. I do not know if that's sufficient amount of time for the constituents if they would want to know you know a week in advance, or you know a couple of days in advance, but now that it's going to be moving towards permanent, it's something that everyone's going to have to get used to. I guess so, the more frequent it becomes it'll just become more a way of life. I imagine also department of sanitation. They said that the portion of the corridor, where the with open restaurants is the garbage, is serviced from 5 A.M to 1 P.M, and that includes recycling and as far as additional baskets, because people were saying that well, there's there may be no more foot traffic there because of you know the dining experience department of sanitation said that they're not putting additional baskets out there as they believe that the current basket placement is accurate, as per their current basket maps. So that was the answer that was provided to me and I can definitely follow up any time if people have more information that they want to get either from the MTA or department of sanitation. Also, I've been getting a lot of noise complaints, not just from Fd from Frederick Douglass in regards to dining just normal. You know 3- 1-, 1 complaints, whether it's fireworks or a loud neighbor. For that I just want to make an announcement that the Office of Administration Office of administration, trials and hearings. They have a new initiative called Mend NYC and, if you know of any residents complaining about noise coming from a bar or restaurant or an establishment near block by you can refer them to men, NYC and it's a mediation service. Therefore you do not have to get local law enforcement involved. You do not have to contact the police and it's completely anonymous and confidential. So basically, you'll be employing a mediator that works for the city that will contact on the restaurant or the bar. The establishment you can't use it constituent to constituent has to be a business. That's the only way the service works. Also I reached out to the 28th present, as well as the 32nd preset Psa 5 and Psa 6., I'm going to express some of the you know: communities concerns about Lenox Avenue, I'm a Philip Randolph square policing on the Frederick Douglas Boulevard Corridor, and also encourage them to start attending our public Safety committee meetings. I know that some precincts are better than others when it comes to attending district service cabinet meetings, but I just wanted to re-. Engage them again also want to encourage the community, because we get a lot of the constituent complaints that has to deal with community policing. I would just urge them to reach out to the local precinct and try to attend on the present council meetings, because those are the true places that you can go and speak directly to the police. You know I have them. You know hear you out, hear your issues and concerns, so I just wanted to say that, and I think yeah. That's concludes the end of my report. Unless anyone has any questions. Thank you question. If I may, just going back to the open streets and the extended patio service to a lot of restaurants that have historically not gone through the official SLA patio license process, have we heard anything else regarding you know my understanding that some restaurants were offered SLA licenses during this period, but they did not have to go through the formal SLA process, and will they eventually have to go back to that process, or is that kind of opportunity exception in perpetuity? Do we know that? Yet I'm not really sure I would have to speak with the people. That's running the open streets program that I believe her name is kimberly Rancourt. I can reach out to her or I can reach out to SLA to get that answer. But I do not. I do not have that answer off here. No, okay, Terry! I'm sorry! I can't show I'm driving, but the question is: when the restaurants are expanding to the adjacent property, with the adjacent property's permission, will they be serving alcohol on the adjacent properties thing and will their liquor license and their insurances expand to those adjacent properties? Because some of what happens when you have a liquor license like if, like someone over drinks or something and they leave your premises- and you know like get in an accident or anything like that- you end up being responsible. So I just wanted to see how that transfers like. If something happened, you know be it later. Otherwise, on the adjacent people's property, I think that the city is working with the SLA. I mean because that's the city's visions so that this could happen. They're going to be working with the SLA to see it I'm coming to fruition, I mean you have to understand. This is a new on process. This is something that's you know it basically has not been done before at this level. So I think there's going to be a lot of you know, questions or concerns, and you know issues that that'll come up. You know as they come up. They'll be have to. You know, be addressed, and probably what you just mentioned may be one of those issues, so it's not ironed out fully. Yet I think it's idea, but in the coming months I think that you're going to start to see more structure to the program- and you know issues like you just mentioned- I'm pretty sure- are sure to arise. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Chair. Yes, I'm concerned, how can they say that we do not need any extra garbage containers baskets because we were running over before we got to the outdoor? His barbara asked him been advised, or was she in this meeting when they said that no she was not in that meeting. We were running over before there was a problem and now with the carryout and the eating and people still do not understand, they should not be littering. I mean it's a mess up here, and so I would I would. I will reach out to Barbara to see how we can reinforce that. We should have more baskets in here and especially if they're going to go through the winter months of outdoor eating and setting and the we can also maybe talk to department of sanitation. You know when they come to the district service cabinet about that or what's going to be done, yeah. I definitely can thank you and thank you Dr dukes, for that are there any other questions or comments about that? Okay, we're going to go ahead and move on to Karen well attended to Quorum. I believe we do have a quorum. Is that correct Kevin? I I've just said a quick run through and it appears that we do. We need to do an official roll call attendance yeah. We should okay, so I'll go ahead and proceed with that. So if you could, please announce your presence if you are able, as I go through the roll call we'll begin with Cicely Harris President Marquise Harrison President Carlos Powell Charles was here. He said that he had to step off the call for about 20 minutes, but he she said he'll be back because he's still on the call. I do see his face, so Joshua Clennan, Joshua Clennan, is absent excused. I have not received any notification of from Joshua, so I'm not sure okay, Deborah yates, if it's not feeling well Deborah texts to say that she was not feeling well. Okay, she's excused Kevin Bitterman Present Stephanie, palmer, President, Deneen, Brown, Blackmoon, yeah, Paul, Karen, Dixon, Present, Charles Powell. I heard you yeah Hazel dukes Dr dukes present every gilliard present George Corral, okay, Karen and Karen, and Ori President Charles Johnson Charles Jackson, Okay, Chanel Washington. She asked to be excused. She had. I think she had a class or something okay. All right. Just I see several non- executive committee. Members present I'm just curious. If anyone is here from economic development, do you know? Okay, although I otherwise we definitely perform with executive community members. Thank you. Kevin we're going to go ahead and move on to the standing committee and task force reports. First, starting off. We have the executive committee considering the electronic voting resolution shantik, were you able to send that out to the board? Yes, okay, so does everyone have that? Was everyone able to receive it and look at it? So do you have it to share your screen, so we could just take a quick look at it and, while he's sharing- so we briefly talked about this at our last executive board meeting the dilemma of our bylaw, stating that we have a election coming up in November, however, that it also requires us to cast ballots in person, paper ballots and sign them. We're not able to do that right. Now, we're still going to be meeting virtually, so we were asking about. How do we continue to vote and have an election in November if we are not able to meet in person? So there was one community board that had done it successfully and that is community board one. So they sent us the resolution that has been approved by the borough president in order to change our bylaws to permit a electronic vote in November. So it has to be done by a resolution that will be voted on by the full board and if it is passed we will be able to conduct an electronic election also CB1 shared with us, their electronic voting system. I do not you had a chance to look at. It was a little complicated, but I think we could probably figure it out by November, but if we do so in this meeting, I will go ahead and panel, the election committee and they will take up their job of figuring out the electronic voting system with Shatek and Juanita, and I prepare to have an election in November if we pass this at the next October board meeting. But I will handle the election committee tonight just in case, so they can prepare. So are there any questions about this? So what it is just it changes our bylaws just until after that election, and then they immediately return back to how they were it's only a temporary change just for the one election and then it will turn back to paper. Ballots are required in person Sisley. I just wanted to know which paragraph or states that it's temporary go down to the bottom. Could you scroll to the bottom piece? Thank you. Thank you is under therefore be resolved. Community or 10. Hereby temporarily amends its bylaws, so I'm just wondering: should it state the time frame, for it does keep going down? Okay, that last paragraph temporary and shall only have effect on the November 2020 election of officers. I see thank you. Does anyone have any additional questions about it? I guess I had a question about, and I think I spoke with you, but maybe I'm just about perhaps pushing the election back to December only because I felt that it because we did not empower and panel the election committee as of September, which would then provide them the time to provide a criteria. You know put everything out and it seems like it might be rushed a little bit and at the end of the day, our bylaws would still state that the officers start in January and because our also our elections would be the day after election, the presidential election and everything else this year, at least I I'm just. I think that it might be something to consider for at least pushing it to December, allowing then any one allows the committee to form and then put out actual whatever they need to and do so on and so forth, and then do everything and again putting everything back the same. But just I'm thinking about the date of elections, I yeah, so that that's a possibility. We would have changed to that. The only reason why I was like, if we, if the board, if it was their pleasure to go forward with the November election, that's why we change it to an election committee that we're no longer nominating anyone. The criteria is the criteria that is in the bylaws, so it's and I believe, the last time they did it. They just gave people a week to put in that. They were interested in the. I know Kevin's on here that he could tell us, oh, that they were interested in running and then everyone did a two- minute speech, and then that was it. I do not know if there is, but if there is that much. That needs to be done, however, Kevin, if in the election committee, if you all feel that you need that additional time we can look at one. So it'll be two things that we have to change, not only the the voting process but the date, and we have to change the resolution to reflect that. I think Donna Gill is on the line too, and Donna was also a member of the Election Committee and Dr Dukes, but you're right. I think the right I do not have the doc in front of me, but the process yeah. Yes, you did. Thank you. Dr dukes. The process for the last election is that candidates provided Bio resume in advance. The Election committee assembled all the materials and distributed all of the materials to all board members in a unified, streamlined communication so that everyone had the materials in advance for review. Each candidate was then offered up to. I think, two minutes to present at the board meeting where the election took place and then the election took place immediately. Thereafter, yes, that's correct, so thank you for that process. So so this is the resolution on the floor now. Do we feel like there's on readiness to vote here for this, or do we want to change it to reflect a December election date? Sicily? Yes, it's stephanie. The question I had given Kevin's explanation of the process. Do folks think that this is October 1st that we have enough time to do it sure I think the issue was about it sounded like the issue and concern was about tiny right, so I would not panel the committee tonight and they could already start looking into what they need to do to do the electronic vote, because that's the biggest thing I do not think the lift is getting the announcement out, because you can do that at the next General Board meeting on the third. If they, if they, if the board votes for this, then you could announce that there's an election and the process at that point and then they would still have the month of October to submit their documents. What is it a resume and did they have a statement or no? It was just a resume and it was a resume and then we gave them the two minutes to speak right and the only other question that I would have time frame wise is is it if all officers are up for re- election or the positions are up for election, so you know: are there any members of the current election committee that plan to entertain running and if so you'd have to? You know, build in sufficient time to find replacements for a committee? So but I- but I you know, all of the documentation we've worked. The Election committee worked hard with the district office to make sure that all the materials are documented. The system is in place and everything that's really changing is just the way and how we're voting right. So you know I think it. I agree a good solid week of Prep to get other materials ready. Any committee should be able to move forward with that. I do not see any reason. We can't go forward, knowing what we did and it went smoothly. Marquis raises a good question, though the fact that you mean our General board meeting is slated for the day after the election day yeah. But, what's going to happen, I mean we're going to lose, we'll be all still trying to live yeah as long as we're all cognizant of that, and I think it's on us to just remind everyone that the work continues the day after election day, including our work for Community Board 10. right. This is Donna. I feel like we, the election committee. We standardized standardize the process, so the apparatus that we're using is actually we can. We can do that. You know by November. We can get that done. The only thing the only thing that's thrown into the mix is the electronic part of it. And basically I you know once we look at the documents, I think we'll be we'll get a better idea of what we need to do just to streamline it and to get that done. So I do not really see any other thing. That's going to. You know cause us to have to want to delay it until December, and I I've done similar electronic voting processes like this with Google docs and if that's the platform that we're planning on using, we can make it secure, and I you know shatique. I know you're on this, but I think it's it is doable. It's just it's a matter of you know, testing in advance and you know making sure that all board members have access to internet to conduct their votes right and I've actually done it on zoom, yeah and right. I've done it on zoom, with breakout rooms and to put up surveys. So people can vote yeah, and you know the information is there, you can have it it's kept, so it's doable. We just have to figure out, you know see which one best works best for us, just a reminder and just review of our bylaws. I really sort of after looking at it closely that what was really key and important had to do with all votes being public and recorded, and I believe the electronic system that CB1 use did do that and I've seen it on Zoom like Kevin said, and it was very public when I saw it so and we will also, as usual, state them during the meeting and have them for review in the office, because we always keep the votes in the office as well. A record of that okay go ahead. I like to move for the adoption and resolution. Is there a second? I? Second, it's been moved improperly. Second, I believe Kevin. Can you do a voice vote on this? Just because I want to make sure that we yep give me one second: can is that Karen Dixon who seconded yes, okay, give me one second here, sorry all right, we'll proceed with a roll role with a vote and we'll begin with this is for the adoption of the proposed resolution and we'll start with Cicely Harris. Yes, Marquis Harrison, yes, Charles Powell, yes, Joshua Clennan is absent. Deborah Yates absent, Kevin Bitterman, yes, Stephanie palmer, yes mean Brown blackmon, let's see she's present dineen; okay, a movie Karen Dixon; yes, Dr dukes, yes, Deborah gilliard; yes, thank you! George Carrell, Absent, Karen, Horry, Karen Norris. Yes, thank you. Charles Johnson, Absent, Chanel, Washington Absent, with that it looks like the resolution carries one two, three four: five: six: seven, eight nine with nine voting. Yes, okay, thank you for that Kevin. So, with that Dr, Dukes and Committee, I am asking to impanel the election Committee to look into the resolution we will be presenting at the October General Board and to begin the election process. Kevin did raise the point that if it's any member that served on the election committee is running for office, you need to replace them. Yes, ma'am, yes, Ma'am, I believe Marquis. Is it was it? How did we do that? Was it a vote at the? How was the election committee selected? So that's what I'm actually just verifying. I think this is now I'm sorry, but we just voted, but I think my logic in December was that I believe the election can be supposed to be voted on right, so they can vote in October we can. I can put it out that we need to replace the member if needed yeah, so we can vote at the October meeting. Well, no, our bylaws assume that every two years that these so these members who are on the committee are supposed to be voted on, meaning they were supposed to be empowered by the board and not necessarily this committee and or the chair that they are they serve for two years and that they would be re they have to be so. Whoever wanted to be on the election committee would have ran in the September meeting. Do you understand so you're going to see what you're saying yeah? That's what our bylaws assumed, at least that's how I know the intent when we wrote it. I just do not have it in front of me, I'm trying to pull up the bylaws. Actually I was just trying to verify. Let me see, I think, we're going through it. Our keys has been two years because, specifically every two years with the election, so basically they were supposed to be voted on in September in with a new election coming up so because it has been two years, yes got it. I thought I did not know, but they could be voted in at the October meeting and have a truncated. You know period but doable period to facilitate an election for November. So or is there a 60-day? No, that was not. That was not the case. It was just a matter of the timing as in spreading it out September they would be elected that gives them October and you know to get ready for the November election. So what you're saying is the current election committee can't be impaneled because they need to be voted in the October? Let's just verify, but that's how I remember it at this time, I'm, but I'm looking at it, I'm looking for. Oh does he have it right there yeah. He has it right here. Let's see here we go there. It is election good night. Oh there. It is the September board meeting every other year, which is in terms with the election. Basically well, it looks like in a an exception, must be made given in the year of exceptions. The reception is the Kobet 19 yeah and that's been all over the place. Everybody's been making exceptions, so maybe we could go ahead and do it at the October meeting. Do we need to add that to the resolution yeah, I'm not sure, I'm not sure. What's the most effective way to move, I would not. If the resolution, I need to look at in a detail again if it states that word, you know. If the election committee exists and they're being reimpanded, then it probably needs to be. But if it just says the election committee, you know the election committee is to be formed. I would think it'd be sufficient, but if you're, if it states again that the committee exists- and it's currently- you know, staffed or has appointed members, then that would need a correction okay. So we can make an amendment now. So we could make an amendment, because I believe that we will be short anyway, because even if we did make an amendment that the election committee that was elected for the 2018 election will still stand. Yes, we could put that in, but we may be short anyway from one person if they would not want to run or anybody who would not want to run so. Could you just add that to the to the language that the Election committee will stay impaneled with the option of appointing someone? If it's not, if it's not a full slate of election officers, the chair being able to appoint one so for Stephanie's point, you know: should it be stephanie that we're saying that the Election committee will nominate and another individual to fill that slot, or will that be done by our chair? I believe it should be the election committee in case I'm running, so I do not want to be running and putting somebody on the committee right, yes, Charles exactly by the by the by the election committee it would be, and by the election, Committee, absolutely yeah and Cece. I was not suggesting you would be on it. I was just saying: should you appoint someone to it, yeah, that's that was yeah. No, that may be viewed as a conflict yeah I'm following much better myself. So we have the language yeah shati. Did you and Kevin? Did you get that language yeah? I think I'm tracking it, but I may have to listen to the recording to get specificity. Basically, the amendment is that an election for the an election at the October General board meeting will take place for the election committee, who will then proceed with the language and the resolution to hold a virtual election in the month of November 2020 for the next slate of officers to begin the terms in January 2021., I think, but it's Kevin yes, but then we vote on that first portion and all we need to now say Kevin is that we are looking at that section. B1 and we are, you know amending that, as we did earlier to state that the current and existing election committee will remain in place for the purposes of facilitating our you know. Next election of officers is not that what we're saying Stephanie, that's a key point, got it. So the current committee will remain in place for this one election exactly and if any replacements are needed. That will be done at the October meeting and by the Election Committee by the Election Committee. And will the vote be necessary or the committee can simply appoint or identify someone? I say we, you know we give the election committee the ability to appoint, got it so long as it's not someone who is running. Obviously, as cicely was pointing out- and I think that's the motion yeah can we just include the temporary ability again that it's a one right? Yes, I think it's proper to state that, under the special circumstances on a one- time basis, that's what we are proposing so and I just want to enter. I mean Play Devil's advocate, maybe in some sense that I'm not against the Election committee choosing members, but I do think that if our bylaws state that they should be elected and that if there is a vacancy, I think it would be, it might be more appropriate to have the board than allow them to choose that open seat or two whatever. That is only because of- and I am aware of time, but this is why my logic is that I just think the perception of that is that the board had a say at least and if we're empowering already the panel that was already there just so that there's no bias and no one believes that there's nothing wrong. I would say we might want to allow the board to make that choice of if there's any vacancy on the committee. That's just my recommendation, but I, if that fails in this discussion and this executive committee moves to have the committee choose, then I will support so Marquis. I'm following what you said. So you know. Let me just get some clarity from the Election Committee from Hazel and where you know the election committee will be functioning before the October board meeting. Is that correct? Yes, if we send out notice right, you know so marquise. If we, you know if we go your route, you know, then we're talking about a an election committee that in fact we'd have to state that they have the ability to function up to that time, because they would be short well, the so I mean I get. They are going to start working now behind the scenes, but they're really going to be empowered through the resolution which will pass next Wednesday anyway, in my opinion, because that's what's going to charge them with actually still put putting on an election, so anything that they do before is kind of an unofficial, but in preparation for an election in November, I would certainly would not recommend the election committee publishing anything prior to the resolution being passed from next week. But that's why I'm saying then next Wednesday, if when we talk about this, if to allow the board, if there's like- let's say I believe, we're talking about Kevin will if he decided to run for assistant secretary, he would not be obviously allowed to be on the election committee, then that vacancy should then, I think, be filled by I'm recommending that we allow the board members to choose or even allow the board members to choose whether they want to vote on it or allow the board members to choose whether they want the committee to allow the committee. They might just choose to say let the committee decide, but at least I think it's just a little bit of transparency in the sense of let them decide we're. Okay with that and that's fine. So it's no sweat off our back, but I also did not think if some board members say well, maybe we should choose, we should get that choice. Then we've allowed them to do so, but I'm not trying to be too difficult. I just want to put that out there as in this is you know before we bring it to the board that we fully thought out like what the perception might be if we were just to say we're going to impound and panel, the committee that was already in place and they're going to choose the next the board member who's going to come on now on the election Committee 70 year, Old Meal Mike. Do you think it would be feasible to suggest that the executive committee would then appoint any absence in the election committee? Well, no because I would say no only because they may be running, and so, if they're running, then that you know, I think what we try to do at least in this, and the languages too is to separate anyone running from having. As you know, in the past the board, the chair chose the election committee as they were running for re- election, and that was we were trying to distance ourselves from that perception. So I mean, I think, maybe it might be as simple as just simply putting it to the board. Are you okay with allowing the committee to, but you know, replace of the and they might be much going along with it because of time? And you know we just do not that's right yeah, but it also gives them a option somewhat yeah. I like it. So if I'm hearing correctly marquis we're saying that it is going to be, you know, addressed and resolved at next week's meeting. Yes yeah, I mean- and I think you're right so the options can be so. The motion or the action to be taken in next week is that you know there is going to be a vacancy on the election committee and we want the election committee to be able to function under the you know, special circumstances we've created for proceeding with this election and therefore we're putting to them the options. Do they want to nominate and vote someone for replacement there next Wednesday, or do they want to allow the election committee to do that? Does that resolve the issue? Yes, I mean, I think, it's also important to maybe that someone from the board or the even the chairs recommend can recommend if the chair is recommending that the committee be allowed to do so. We can ask for unanimous consent right and if there's no objections, then we can move forward if there is object. Obviously you know if there's objection, then we then we call for then we have to have an election, but I mean it could be just that simple, it's just kind of being transparent about that choice to the board members. So we would like to send this out prior to the meeting like tomorrow, so that people can start looking at it and having comments. So it has to have some language in it can't be either or language in the Brazil. So we have decided what we want, but I believe that, through that conversation that we'll have in October or even on the email that we send out with the reso that we talk about both sides, but here's what we have. However, if you know, if you do not agree with this, we're open to this be prepared to discuss and vote on Wednesday. So what do we want to say? That was my. That was exactly my point that we're offering you know the considerations in essence, we're sharing with the board exactly what we're talking about this evening right. So I think what we have to put in the reso is, we may have to just say the actual, the committee right and then, but then we can have a paragraph. Explanation of this is what we're prepared to talk about, or do you just want to have nothing in there, because you want them to be able to consider a full resolution, because that's what they'll be voting on and then you can vote on the alternative. So I think if the recommendation of this executive committee is to have the committee the Election committee choose, then you put that language in and then you simply explain at the top. However, should the board not want the election community, something like that and kind of give them that option yeah, I think so too yeah I mean. That's where I think we are marquise in Sicily, okay, I agree so Kevin. Do you have that language, and then we can. I can craft that email with you, yeah, okay, recommendation, that the Election committee choose choose your places for any vacancies to be filled at their discretion. However, if it's the consent of the board that an election should take place for new vacancies in the election committee, that we can do that, I can compress that, but that seems to be the language. The recommendation is that the election committee be able to fill any vacancies within its committee. Okay, so that's what's going in there. Are there any other questions or comments? If not, then we can just vote by common consent on that amendment and then move on great, nothing else. Okay, I will entertain a motion to accept the the resolution as amended so move. Second, okay, all in favor any opposed hearing none. The amendment passes. Thank you for that. We're going to move on to Karen ori in her presentation about the exonerated five. Thank you do I have. Can I share my screen. I just like to say that I'd like to just run through the presentation and then have questions at the end, because it's a pretty lengthy presentation and I'll just do a synopsis. Is that okay, yes and I knew you were going to shorten it. So, yes, that's fine! Okay and they can look at it. I mean you can have it available at another time. If somebody wants to see the whole thing, but I knew you were going to short it tonight. So thank you, Karen, okay, all right am I able to share yeah. You are able to share Karen, okay, I'm trying to set it up now, it's going to take just a minute okay. So this is the exonerated five public art commemoration central Park. So this is our opening page. This is a table of contents which is pending, we'll be putting that together. This includes the mission statement, which is to create an exhibit of permanent parts in a permanent exhibit to honor the exonerated five and social justice reform. The objective is to raise awareness and sensitivity to a systemic and institutionalized pattern of racial injustice and the need for reform. We included division, and so we envision a permanent commemoration to the fortitude and resiliency of the five young men known as the exonerated five and to the need for social justice reform. We propose a commemorative permanent art piece cited in the and at this time we we talked about a northeast section of central park, and this exhibit would celebrate the extraordinary diversity and history of our community while pointing to the city's aspirations for the future. So this the this is the background. The events surrounding the exonerated five minutes impact on the community. This is directly from our resolution. There is one change here we found out later that only one of the boys was prosecuted as an adult, so that change is included here and again. This is our resolution. This is also part of the resolution and this as well as a part of the presentation. We have a and a an item on how the families were impacted, and this is a direct quote from Mr Sharon Salam explaining that situation. Our goals for in- part commemoration are to shed one to shed light on the prejudice, hatred and ultimately unnecessary incarcerations that occur due to the inequities inherent in the american justice system. So this is an overreaching initiative to informed and second to inform, engage and activate the public in building a path to healing for black and latinx communities in Harlem, the nation and throughout the world. We also talk about statistics involved with incarceration, as it is as it's related to our community, so african Americans make up 13 of the american population, but roughly 36 of the 2.2 million Americans incarcerated one in nine black men between the ages of 22 and 34 years old are in prison and New York City communities of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration. The U.S has five percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prison population. Youth of color are far more far more at risk than their white counterparts and what these high imprisonment rates due to our communities and the problems that they create with respect to poverty, employment, inability to get employment, education and health, this inequitable disparity has been made even more evident as a result of the ravages of copenhagen. We also talk about the fact that improvements were made to central park at following the 1989 incident of the Central Park of Jogger Case Central, Park conservancy brought in 51 million dollars and was able to do upgrades and in 1993 they restored the bridal trail, bridal trail paths, the mall, the Harlem, mere the North woods and the Dana Discovery Center was constructed, so in part, commemoration would present a forum to raise conscious awareness around the need for social and criminal justice reform, and it would be in a gross miscarriage of justice that forever brutally altered the lives of the young men from the community, who formerly saw the north end of central park as their backyard. So this was a pivotal, extremely pivotal point for them, and so the in- part commemoration would encapsulate a return to the site of origin of the miscarriage of justice and, in a sense, coming full circle, and this would be an added component in the promulgation of an iconic healing of systemic wounds on a more broad societal level. So again, this is overreaching again goals of in part commemoration. We had a great deal of input from Rebecca Brown director of policy at the innocence project, and so this is about. This just speaks to the again why the park is the most natural location for commemoration, since its location is burned into the collective memories of new Yorkers as a major turning point in our city's history: okay, again, objectives- and this would sharing the lived experiences of people who are victimized by the criminal justice system and demonstrating that this is not an isolated injustice, but part of a larger system that produces injustice in daily ways. Again. Our key audiences that we are seeking to engage would be the local area residents, both uptown and downtown, so of the black and brown communities at the northern border of the park that have been generally generationally impacted by mass incarceration and the economic and social disparities that collectively affect them and then also the affluent communities surrounding Central park. We also seek to engage the 42 million visitors that visit central Park on a yearly basis, and so this would be a diverse, local, national and international public that we would be educating the media. Hopefully the media will begin to be more responsible in their reporting. They were not responsible at the time and contributed to the prosecution of the of the these young men. These were young boys at the time and then also to engage our youth in educating them around what wrongful convictions, what their rights are, how racism defeats the presumption of innocence and helping them to be engaged in social change and become advocates themselves and so desired. Takeaways for visitors is to reflect on the human cost of systemic racism and explore the roles and responsibilities of individuals, society and government when confronting racism and justice and institutionalize inequities, and then also to educate the public about what led to the conviction and subsequent exoneration of this central part 5, including the historical context about policing in New, York City. At the time there were also media that were responsible at the time. So we would like to promote more air, more media outlets that are being responsible in their reporting in terms of the art. We're asked often what that's going to be. We do not know at this point, but we do have recommendations and the commemoration is envisioned as physical and permanent and could be encountered at or near threshold into the northern and northern end of central park or inside of the park itself. This is what came out of our discussions, so it should be inviting and pervade a sense of community ownership, and then there are other criteria in terms of appearance and appeal, and this suggests these are just suggestions as to what the art piece would look like. It was also suggested that the presumption of innocence was I'm just reading. The presumption of innocence was totally disregarded in this case, and the imprisonment ordeal and subsequent family suffering should be designed to be powerful but palatable to the viewing experience. The blatant racism should be graphically exemplified with Donald Trump's full page ads in the media, as part of the section of the exhibit and generous use of color should permanate the graphics throughout. So this is just the appeal and some suggestions as to what should be included in the exhibit or the commemoration, and a very strong point is education. This is an exhibit or a commemoration that is designed to educate, so education is extremely important and we can go on to show how education can be tied into exhibits that are even already existing in the park, such as the Seneca village Central park commemoration, which is the which deals with the seizure of a predominantly african- american village by the local government through eminent domain, to make way for the expansion of central park. This action resulted in the displacement of families from a self- made thriving community in the antebellum north, and this behaved this behavior was repeated throughout, has been repeated throughout our history: women's suffrage, monument. This is women's rights and the statue was unveiled on August 26, it's a wonderful beautiful statue and it's interactive and educational as well, and we can tie in the advocacy of not only the women's suffrage monument but also the anti- lynching advocacy made by Ida B Wells. At that time, marion J sims statue replacement. We do not know what that is at this point, but that is also something that could be tied in as his history and as related to the the example of the Central Park. Five, who are the story, extends to Emmett till to the Scottsboro boys and on and on also we could tie in the New York historical society, which has a an exhibit on the 200 years of slavery in New, York, City and prior to its abolishment in 1827, and they also have an extensive exhibit on seneca village, which includes a lecture series and educators guide. We could tie this into the Rikers public memory project and it's a community. This is a community- based initiative involving collective stories about the impact of Rikers, the riker family purchased the island in 1664 and over a 200 year period engaged in profiteering from the slave trade in the New York City Area Slavery ended in 1827 in the state of New York New York City purchased the island in 1884., the Rikers island jail opened in 1932 and has been notorious for overcrowding, violence, abuse, substandard and inhumane conditions. The Rikers public memory project is advocating for its closure and one of the exonerated five spent a good deal of time on Rikers, so community- based advocates. We have just as just as a sampling of the support that we have from community- based groups and and policy and lawmakers in terms of advocacy. This project could also be a vehicle to advocate for legislation around ending unnecessary jail, detention for people awaiting trial and for low- level, offenses, shorten excessive prison sentences and improve release processes, sentence fewer people to incarceration and make sentences shorter change. The financial incentives that fuel punitive justice system responses and stop probation and pro parole systems from fueling incarceration and give all communities the voice in how our justice system works and how an examination of punishment versus rehabilitation and, again, just looking at more in terms of legislation that could come about as a result of this wrongfully convicted recovery act, which was related to which the exonerated five have been very instrumental in getting and bringing that about. Eliminating qualified immunity. If there is room to add I'm sorry, qualified immunity is a police protection that prevents financial justice for the wrongfully convicted. So that would be something that would be advocated for ensuring right to counsel during in interrogations, banning the use of police deception during interrogation. Sentencing reform pre- pre- trial detention reform and addressing financial incentives in the prison system, examining what we criminal criminalize and also taking a look at the prison to the school, the prison pipeline, which is wherein the if students are not doing well by fourth grade third or fourth grade those numbers are that data is used to project future prison populations, hi Karen. This is cicely, it's been 10 minutes. I just want to make sure that we're going to be able to have time to get any feedback. Can I just finish another five minutes or less? Let's go less, because we want to make sure that they have time to give us feedback. Okay, we're coming to the end. So these are the panelists. We had three panel discussions, and this presentation is a is a compilation of the the feedback from those discussion panels so these, and we also were able to engage Sarah burns, Malik, Yoba and Youssef Salam and Mrs salam, his mother and cynthia. So we've had quite extensive information brought to bear on this project, Brenda Berkman, who is the director of monumental women, Board of directors? She was extremely helpful in explaining what her process was in term. What her organization's process was in terms of getting their statute into central park, which is the first statue of real women and Cynthia Copeland, explained the process for seneca village, so our planning methodology has included extensive vetting of the issue. It came about as a result of a meeting on October, 2nd where it was voiced. It then went to Executive committee I mean it was. It was vetted in parks and recreation on March 25th. We were given permission to form a a subcommittee to deal with the issue, so we have met in committee on all of these dates: December 11th, since December 11, 2019 and we've had meetings subsequent to May 26th as well, and then we had three panel discussions which were done virtually and then the full board passed a resolution on June 3rd. We then oh and then okay. Those are the panel discussions here and we have been asked by the Parks Department mayor's office and the Central Park conservancy to submit a statement of objective of objectives and goals, and this is how this presentation came about. So we're looking to submit this to initiate the process for review our. We had a group which involves Terry, Wisdom, Chanel, Washington and Mrs Salam and Stephanie palmer, who went out and walked to the walk- through of the area and made a determination as to what would be the best location, and so their criteria was that they wanted to wanted to be involved the route that people would have entered the park in 1989, how accessible it would be for park visitors and how it could be least intrusive to the integrity of central park and respect of this of the central Park mission, so that site that was selected was, and it's being recommended as 110Th Street and Fifth Avenue at the entrance there and it's a grassy. You know a grassy area, and that is the end of the presentation and you know if there any questions. I'd be glad to take them. Thank you, Karen, and can I say thank you so much for the hard work that was a wonderful presentation, very thorough you and Terry, and the rest of the committee. Ms Salam have been you know, putting so much work into that. So thank you for that. Are there any yeah anything? Are there any questions or comments about the presentation, any suggestions as we move forward, so that will be the presentation that we will share with the other boards. You know, depending on the amount of time that they have, we will be cutting it down, if necessary, to make sure that we can present. But does anyone have any suggestions or comments? Yes, hi. This is Terry. I just wanted to add that the other member of the walking tour was Wilma Brown, the district leader, and she is doing a lot to engage other people. You know to write some letters of support, so that's the edition and we do have some video and some slides. So if those are needed to engage people or to get better clarity or understanding as to the spot that we chose, which is to the right of when you enter the park- and I believe it's called the Dana lawn, but it's a very open area that has a lot of space, and even if we put our monument or you know there, it would still not impede what other people need to do or do in the park and it's near bathrooms and playgrounds and the I believe the Dana Center. So that's it. So. Thank you, a great presentation, Karen. Thank you. So much. Thank you. I just like to say in terms of what Terry said about the letters of support. We are working on getting copious amounts of letters of support to date we have and thank you to Hazel. We have a letter of support from Ndm double acp. We have from the innocence project from Senator, Brian Benjamin and from the borough president. We got a beautiful letter of support from Community Board 11., so been very extensively written. So that's what is happening in terms of that and we have an invitation, is sicily. Just let me know to presented cba so, and the surrounding boards to, in addition to our board and 11, would be 7:5 8 and six, and we were also looking at presenting at twelve and six speak. I'm sorry, twelve and nine. We got pushed back from CB4 and as a result of that, we developed a list of faqs because we were not prepared at the time. So we are that's, been circulated and we're developing responses to those, and sicily mentioned some of the questions that were brought up. We also looking at, in addition to the faqs for clarity to develop a small two- minute promotional of demonstrating what the exonerated five are doing now, because it was brought up that they are not model citizens. I think it's just fabulous. What they're doing considering what they've been through in terms of advocacy around social justice reform. I think we have another hand Donna Gill, oh this Karen. That was great and you sort of answered my question because I was my question: was the presentation does not speak to the, why it is necessary, and I think, if we're going out to other boards asking for support, that would be a question that would come up. You know why do you think that this is necessary? So I think we may need to do something, and the faq sounds like a great idea on the education of the process, because, though we know the necessity for this in our community, when we go out to other spaces, other people may not have the same feelings because, as you said, sicily, they still, I mean the fact that they use the terminology of Wildland. You know that speaks volumes, so I think that some education around the- why may be appropriate in the presentation, because it may help the understanding of the reasoning for this particular monument. Well, we did. We had a few slides on goals for in part commemoration which addresses that, but we can look at look at it a little more closely the wilding. We are expecting a piece from Mrs Salam on the appeal process which, throughout all of that negative terminology, I believe it was in relation to the exoneration. So yes, that's right. We were on that last call and donna. One thing that I did want to make clear that when that did come up with CB4, I did make it clear. While we are highlighting the exonerated five, this exhibit, or the spirit of this is for telling just one story, but it's millions of stories that we do not know about that. We are telling of all the black and brown people who have been overlooked and subjected to the criminal justice system in such a cruel and inhumane way. So that's one thing that we wanted to also highlight that it is while we're talking about the exonerated five, it's more than that it is like Karen said in Mattel. It is all of those folks throughout history that have been and will be disenfranchised by the criminal justice system. So that's one thing that we make clear but we'll make sure that the presentation says that as well you're welcome what the committees ask is to move this forward to the the mayor's office, the President's office, Central, Park, Conservancy and New York City parks to begin to initiate the process and Stephanie did you have a question and then Terry and then, if there is not anything, I do not believe we have to vote on this. We just want to make sure that you all knew what our stance was and what we're going out into the community with Stephanie and then Terry, and then we can move on hey. Thank you. Can you hear me yes, yeah? I just wanted to. I listened to Donna's concern and I think what Donna was saying I mean I think was this was a great presentation. You've done, Karen has done an incredible job. I've had an honor to sit through a lot of those panel discussions. This was an awesome task, but I think Donna's point was you do not want to just win mines. You have to win hearts and that's the story. You know to tell the story- and I just want to say that we had an opportunity to see that as well with burns piece on the exonerated five, so it might be a good idea to reference. You know that piece as well to our presentation, because you always want to win minds as well as hearts. So that was just the comment and again, congratulations Karen! Oh thank you! Thank you! Kevin Terry, really, quickly, yes, really quickly. I think that you know it's a work in progress and those of us that are on the task committee are in complete agreement that we have to say the. Why? Because there are going to be pushback and also Stephanie, we do have to win the hearts and the Sarah burns. Piece is there, but another major piece as we're moving through that is extremely engaging. Is the piece the dramatization that Ava Duvernay did: okay, which is a major motion picture and the psychological analysis and the breakdown in that piece that wins hearts, and that says why it says how and I mean as a filmmaker. She actually had each person that played the part of the exonerated five. They spent time with them. They understood them, I mean it and then they had discussion. You know on Pbs or wherever with Oprah, so you put that in there and that says why? How when and where- and I think that also because it's a drama sedation, but it was a whole psychological breakdown of everything incredible. So if people have not seen it, they need to see it. They need to see the discussion that had the exonerated five and those that played the characters and one of the characters was only 13 and he did not even know about the exonerated five, but he was an amazing actor and I think he studied with Corey Wise each one of them studied. So this in itself speaks volumes, and we also have the supports that include that yeah. Thank you, Terry. We also have the support of Sarah burns. She contributed to this presentation document in terms of the educational aspect. Thank you, Karen and thank you. Parks Committee Awesome work and I'm excited to go around and present this to the other board. So thank you for that. Please just like to know, would we be able to move this on move this forward to the agencies that I mentioned the mayor's Office Central, Park, Conservancy and New York City parks? I believe so I mean. Is there any objection from our com Ec to moving this out and putting this out do we need to vote or not? I just I'm asking because a voting sheet was provided, I'm not sure if it's necessary to vote, I mean it's not necessary. I mean I, if there's any controversy or anything, then I feel like we might need to if somebody feels a certain way about this. But if we're all in agreement that we are supporting this presentation, the way it was presented, then I believe we should just move it forward. It's a subcommittee event, but it's so it's nothing that we are, but it is CB10 putting it out. If you will yeah no Washington does have a question in the chat. I do not know if chanel, if you know mute yourself or I can yeah she asked. How are we putting this out? I see it. Yes, I'm asking the slides that were the presentation she just presented. Will that be a part of what folks see when they receive this email to possibly participate? I do not understand the question okay, so when we do outreach right is there I know there's a letter, but will you be attaching the presentation that you just did with that letter when you send out for folks to get on board, it would be a virtual presentation and any supplemental documentation with respect to letters of support which we're hoping to get by October, the 9th on or before October the 9th so and any other the promotional. If we get that done in time, that could be included as well, but I'm just this is just to start the process yeah. I think I do not know if I'm hearing Chanel clearly, but I think what may be being said is as we're going out and you know trying to get support. Some of the people that we're trying to get support are just going to give it, but other people may need to see a little bit of the presentation if we're going to try to get really broad- based support, and I think obviously in the committee, I know we're going to go back and you know look at it and just make sure you know as we're reaching out to the mayor, because I think that we also need to include some community groups that may be participating with us community education groups, community theater groups, you know that are Harlem based community media groups that are Harlem based. That may you know, be engaged to work with us, because I think that that's gives it more legs as well in terms of actually what we're doing. But I know we do not have a lot of time. You know, so I think you know a little bit of tweaking a little ads of things and then just push it out. Well, I think that we can present to other groups. This was something we were asked to produce for those agencies. Sicily was on the call for that, so that was back in August. I think so it's been quite a while. So I think that if we could just get the ball rolling with them, we can always come back with the letters of support and rebut anything that they may bring up. Okay, are there any other questions? If not, we can move on. Thank you, Karen, thank you Terry for this, and we will continue to work on this. Karen has her parks meeting regularly so yeah so Cecil? I just want to be clear. We can begin to move this forward once we tweak it, we can move it forward to those agencies so yeah I mean if we're moving it out, and this is speaking for us, so it's kind of like a letter of support. Maybe we should do a vote just to make sure that everybody is on support and support, since this is going out to the mayor's agencies, so we could do it just by common consent. If that's, if we still have quorum, we can still do that just by common consent that this is going out to the mayor's office, the Manhattan president's office and central park conservancy on behalf of CB10. So this is this is what we're putting out in New York, City, Parks and New York City Parks Department. I'm sorry! I just want to be clear that when you say we're putting this out again, so we the mayor's office, will receive the presentation she received along with the letter yeah. It will be a virtual presentation, so we'll make a schedule a time to do a virtual presentation for those offices- okay, Charles, so yeah. I just in light of Chanel's point and a few of the others. I think there needs to be a clearly fashioned motion to the Ec as to what we're being asked to do. I think it's clear you know, but at the same time I think this also needs to go to the board for a vote next Wednesday before anything goes down to any of those respective representatives, elected officials or agencies. Okay, does anyone have any other comments about that? I mean I see what you're saying, because it is a reflection of the board and we are putting this out like a big letter of support. This is another piece to our resolution that we already passed. Does anyone else have any comment about that? I believe we should go ahead and vote now on this. We could just do it by common consent, karen we can go ahead and since it's just next week we can set aside some time to have the board fully look at it and then we can send it out. Marquis. Do you have anything to say? No, I agree. Okay, so I will make those corrections that we were working on. Thank you. Well, we've met. We've met, we've had three three meetings of for revision. So yeah we had a meeting. Was it last night yeah it was yesterday. Sorry, I missed that Terry, but thank you for doing that. Okay, so I will entertain a motion now to support the Parks Committee Presentation and after making those revisions that we will send this to. I think you said the mayor's Office Central Park, conservancy, Manhattan borough president's office, the Parks Department, and that's who we'll be saying it too? Is there I'll entertain motion what's wrong? What's the motion that this that we will move forward with it? Would you say who was the motion? I did not hear that I'm looking for a motion to support this. I make a motion to support this central park. The exonerated five subcommittee got it. Is there a second Chanel Washington, all in favor aye, any opposed hearing none, this motion carries. We will do a brief presentation for the board. Let's try to keep it like eight minutes. If we can or to open up a question. I know I know it's going to be hard, but we do have a lot of stuff on here for Wednesday and then we'll move it forward to those agencies. Thank you, Karen. Thank you. Terry welcome, okay, so really quickly. We just have another quick thing. I was supposed to be on here for transportation, but I wanted just to present something that's coming up really quickly and I'll. Send the letter out that Landmarks Preservation Commission sent to me just so you all can see it, but they are considering another historic district potential, historic district between Frederick Douglas Boulevard between 136Th Street and West 140Th Street, and they are going to have a meeting about it. Wednesday October 21st at 6:00 p.m, virtually via zoom, so they've included us in this. They will be at the Trans Parks and excuse not parks for the landmarks meeting on that on the second Tuesday. But I'll send you the letter, so you walk and see it. They want us to help, get just put out the information that they are. Considering that making this a historic district, it will be the first Doris Brooks was the first. This will be the second african- american historic district in the state of New York. If we get it passed, dorsburgs was the first so, but that's coming so I will send that out. So you can see that and what is the area? What are the what's? What are the boundaries it is? The study consists of two sections on either side of Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 136Th Street and West, 140Th Street, but I'll send you the excuse me send you the letter, so you all can be prepared because Karen, I know you're on transportation, so I'll see I'll, send it to the transportation committee on the board.
