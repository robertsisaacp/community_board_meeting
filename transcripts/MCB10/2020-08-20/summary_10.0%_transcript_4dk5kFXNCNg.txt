Has a residence here in Harlem, since the early 80s And I live between 123Rd and 124Th Street on Malcolm, X, Boulevard, and I am part of a rather informal group that we are putting together amongst my neighbors to address some of the issues that have been going on in our neighborhood.
Covid-19 community concerns since we're still waiting for Miss Mcgraw for more You know comments from my end regarding the work that is going on and being carried out by warm and, of course.
One thing that our office does between the community partnerships unit that I work in and our crime strategies unit is that we try to map out and navigate where exactly some of these shootings are coming from, where exactly some of the guns are coming from, and you know our Ada's work diligently to try to make those connections and prosecute those cases outside of that.
Can you talk a little bit about how your office you know is addressing that in terms of what some of the criticism, even from the police commissioner himself says we're doing our jobs?
You, know our office to abide by those certain ramifications, but in terms of violent crimes like gun, violence.
One thing that I would like to at least do for now is to leave my information available and accessible to the public, so that folks can reach out to us with any ideas that they may have, because we're very much about supporting the community from the ground, up, and I think it's community members that really have a keen sense on what may be best for their communities, and we want to hear those voices first before we reach out with that top- You know working with warm and sweet.
You know in the agenda of the shootings, hello, everyone I apologize for being late had another meeting, but We have been very dedicated and diligent about being involved in a lot of the organizations that are especially those cbo's that are out there on the street corner resources.
So every saturday for the month of August, we're partnering, with, I, believe it's like 15 organizations, including your office shock about being just present on the street And we're seeing that as a way to combat a lot of the violence just being out there in the open and being present and positive.
So, that's one of the things that we're doing, but I also send out to our board members a protect your block agreement that we have And it's about, just being a good neighbor, and it's about just encouraging young people It's not if you it's not always being the one to report, something but being cognizant and being safe for yourself as well.
The reason why I'm late as I was on another call, with some of the Manhattan community board chairs, to talk about overall issues that you know that are on the ground that are not.
We did have a call, but I was unfortunately unable to get that call because I work call, but I brought it up to Christina and Brian Benjamin's office that there needs to be more yes, pre- planning, and that comes from you know, connecting with NYPD to make sure that they're posting those signs for the cards to be moved In the meeting agenda.
The community has missed us a little bit since we did not have our constant contact, but now we have a new system to really reach everyone, so there are needs for people to in a social distance thing way be out on the 22nd and the 29th on some of these play streets because they just need people to help.
You know regarding what we've been talking about in terms of community shootings and now this Harlem Street initiative before we go to resident concerns on 123Rd 124th He told us that the Ag's view is that the changes to the bail regulations is not really driving the shootings, but maybe he could tell us what the Ag thinks is driving the shootings, because I think these Harlem street initiatives they sound like a great thing on a good day, but you know my concern is: Are they the right sort of interventions, or should we be doing some other sort of interventions to address the the shootings I represent the Manhattan district, attorney, Sai Vance, and not the attorney general?
The block And he's doing like 30 days in different neighborhoods, where they gather you know on a corner and it's a group of people.
So, but I think we as a community need to get to some understanding of that, and also I guess this is tagged with groups of young people, but You know I know, I went past, the park.
I do not know if it was a pre- rucker event, but the park that's on 145Th. They had like 500 people in there for the basketball thing, there was no social distancing at all.
You know our community was already in a place economically, where we were not giving the opportunities the same as anywhere else, but at the same time people are losing jobs and when you're losing jobs, you're looking for ways to make quick money and ways to make quick money are usually some ways that leads to some things that are not that safe and not that sound.
I think that you know when we have talked to NYPD about some things: and, most importantly, talking to the young people when we're out there.
I've been able to talk to some young people, not that they're like telling me a lot of things, but it's a conversation.
This is this is actually all about Ray Roberts and his block And he's always having these drug dealers actually dealing in front of his house and not being able to do anything about it , he's coming to the Community Board and seek of support.
Today was the fact that I met with the police officers on Wednesday, after speaking, to the commander and walked with them over to the methadone centers to have a conversation with security, as well as with their director of services, so just to speak about security, quickly, all three, all three facilities,, that's Harlem, United, Kaleidoscope, Slash, start and Mount sign up They all have security, people that are supposed to be outside patrolling the area.
The first thing they took away was the undercover narcotics detectives, So they're no longer on the street and The drug sellers dealers know this You walk down the street they're dealing in open air in the middle of the day, because the only way that they're going to be arrested is if a uniformed police officer sees them making the deal and make the arrest?
Let me just read on what, if anything, do Local homeless, shelters recently released convicts or prisoners from from you, know, from being locked up due to the Covid-19 and or drug rehabilitation programs such as Harlem United Have to do with this block being a de facto location for open market heroin abuse and Malcolm X Boulevard.
You know, I think, those people that have been standing outside for years now in front of between 120 fourth and fifth streets on Malcolm X, Boulevard they've been out there for years.
You know, we need to see how public safety, health and other committees can address.
I do not know if I can be heard, but one of the things that we really need to do is to stop making excuses for our elected officials and or the police department who's supposed to protect us, because we do not get a discount on our taxes.
You know it's by design It's by design, but then again, I also want us to think of these people that we're talking about like they are.
I have a whole video worth of pictures of drug deals and 10 bags of heroin and people riding up and down the street just doing whatever they want in this regard, and I I've been forwarding these to the to the Community Affairs Office for over a year now, and then you know during the course was formulating our little block.
