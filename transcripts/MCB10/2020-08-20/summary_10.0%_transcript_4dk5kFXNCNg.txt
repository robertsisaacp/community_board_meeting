Has a residence here in harlem, since the early 80s and I live between 123rd and 124th street on malcolm x, boulevard and I Members of our community I'm here representing the Manhattan district attorney sy vance Usually, the director of our Manhattan office, linda jones, janae, usually is here for the public safety meetings and she has asked me to cover for this session.
Of course, you know by street corner resources critically important to many of the issues That's on this agenda, so I'm looking at you know, cobra 19 community concerns fireworks, You, know I've, been in public safety meetings previously and obviously, there's been a lot of conversation Have any concerns you know or continue: concern?
Let's turn to you, and just let's hear some things about what your office has been doing very proactively on in regards to these shootings that have been plaguing our community right, So first I just want to mention that you know, since kovid, all of our victim services have gone completely virtual and remote The messaging for victims primarily, is that this, despite the pandemic, we're really urging victims to reach out to make 911 calls and to take advantage of the various types of services that our office provides to victims in terms of shootings, sci-fence As, you said charles, has been very proactive in really going out to the community and fielding the different types of concerns that community members have I.
Can you talk a little bit about how your office you know is addressing that in terms of what some of the criticism, even from the police commissioner himself says we're doing our jobs, the da's aren't doing theirs I mean, even if you look at the numbers that the NYPD has produced, the recidivism isn't as a result of people coming out on bail, so I think it really depends on which numbers you're looking at and where the correlation falls in some ways.
I think we were waiting for stephanie mcgraw, it was her name was misspelled in the you know in the meeting agenda and we did cover the community shootings and you've now addressed harlem street initiatives.
The community has missed us a little bit since we didn't have our constant contact, but now we have a new system to really reach everyone, so there are needs for people to in a social distance thing way be out on the 22nd and the 29th on some of these play streets because they just need people to help serve They want to make sure that that's out there water and that people are social, distancing and being safe , It's 127th street between adam clayton powell and frederick douglas boulevard, That's one from 12 to six on saturday and then mccoombs place between 151st and 152nd , that's 12 to 6 and then 115th street between adam clayton powell and frederick douglas boulevard from 12 to 6 Those are the streets that we're focusing on right now and community board members and community definitely feel free to once you go there, there'll be a representative from either brian benjamin's office or one of the elected officials, and you can tell them you're there to volunteer or contact us That is my wrap up on play street Do. We want to open up the discussion?
You know regarding what we've been talking about in terms of community shootings and now this harlem street initiative before we go to resident concerns on 123rd 124th He told us that the ag's view is that the changes to the bail regulations isn't really driving the shootings, but maybe he could tell us what the ag thinks is driving the shootings, because I think these harlem street initiatives they sound like a great thing on a good day, but you know my concern is: Are they the right sort of interventions, or should we be doing some other sort of interventions to address the the shootings I represent the Manhattan district attorney sai vance, and not the attorney general?
Sharing, but tracking this down really comes down to a community-based effort to really work with NYPD and work with our office to track down where exactly these guns are coming from So. If there, if there are no other comments seriously, I think we can go ahead hi good evening, everyone I, don't know all the details, but I do know that our assembly member al taylor, also which I guess is in conjunction with us, has a something like take back the block and it's a group of people, and you know we need to understand, like what is going on that these things are happening, I mean, is it gang related or you know, is it?
Because with the defunded police effort, the first thing they took away was the undercover narcotics detectives so they're no longer on the street and the drug sellers dealers know this When you walk down the street they're dealing in open air in the middle of the day, because the only way that they're going to be arrested is if a uniformed police officer sees them making the deal and make the arrest?
You know cediria mentioned a lot of things about what's going on with the police as far as the undercover it's obvious, you know that these people have the feeling or the understanding that they can come here, and this is the place to come to do that The harlem united program, You know I, think those people that have been standing outside for years now in front of between 120 fourth and fifth streets on malcolm x, boulevard they've, been out there for years.
As our community board You know, we need to see how public safety, health and other committees can address.
A complaint specifically around you know the drug epidemic in that particular area I know, usually they would be joining the call today, for whatever reason, I don't know why they're not on the phone, but I, wouldn't encourage to keep the dialogue open for the constituents who are making the complaints I'm going to get familiar with the nco The neighborhood coordination officers also to attend the monthly community council meetings of the 28th present Also I just want to let everyone know that the office of the special narcotics prosecutor is also a viable option.
I think that you know it's good, that you're coming to get support from community organizations such as the community board I, would urge constituents to place 311 on calls, because, sometimes just looking at it, you know from out of your fifth floor window or sixth floor window looking down on the street, it's not enough and I'm not saying that people aren't putting in three on ones Your neighbor I saw some things that I have not seen since the 60s and the 70s you had mentioned earlier that there were there was open pharmaceutical drugs being sold, I fear for the children that may have to return to that school What is going on in our community and the fact that it's in our community- That is very disturbing to me, because that's where the anger comes in and with anger comes confusion and with confusion comes violence and it's problematic, but there's always hope, like a man, says and I look forward to working with you.
You know this to our chair of the health committee, dr hazel dukes, and we're going to coordinate you know some things: listen, I'm, a hall of mine for life for life when that block was you know, was open market You know for everything heroin marijuana, you know everything you know, and so now is the community that you know I know you had some comments that you wish to have made and because we're at the end of our agenda right now, go ahead, Donna.
I have a whole video worth of pictures of drug deals and 10 bags of heroin and people riding up and down the street just doing whatever they want in this regard- and I I've been forwarding these to the to the community affairs office for over a year now, and then you know during the course was formulating our little block group, malcolm x, boulevard, united We , have we have had another zoom meeting in the past with law enforcement involved, narcotics north, so we have been reaching out You know within the constraints of the law and I agree with what I don't see you all and I agree with the last speaker that we need to have like a presence, a large movement or a group of something a day or two of some type of a large presence, a group of people that addressing this situation here on this block and not just this block but around the corner.
