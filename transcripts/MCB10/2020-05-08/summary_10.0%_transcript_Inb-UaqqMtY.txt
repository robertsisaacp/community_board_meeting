First I also would like to thank our Manhattan borough president Gale Brewers office for acting quickly and providing free and unlimited zoom accounts for you guys who are not visual.
Once again, thank you for the free zoom accounts that you provided to all the Manhattan community, boards, and I want to thank the beta NYC team for all of their hard work on keeping us connected.
I also want to think the mayor's office, Gail Brewer's, office, Councilman Perkins office and all of our city agencies and elected officials who have been keeping us updated with all the Corvette 19 reports and newsletters.

You, know, city institutions that are getting cut I think we should wait to hear from the state.
I mean I, think you know the Parks Department is apparently determining along with NYPD I What's going on with this virus, I do understand that people can not congregate.
I know they think they're not going to catch it, but that's what I do understand the reason to close this, and if people have specific issues, I'd be glad to bring them to the attention NYPD and Parks, but I do think we can not congregate.
We have a lot of people with the virus that also members of the church and in the area I've seen the data And I've, seen it broken down by gender and age and other things Anybody breaking this down by race and community board, because I just feel like there's a lot of people in my circle and just looking at the factors that make people most vulnerable and at- risk for fatalities?
Those indicators are high, if not highest, in the black community, when you're talking about diabetes and asthma and those things I know it's been broken down by type of job, which of course, is sort of what you're talking about, because so many of the folks who are working in The, you know there's eight people from the MTA as an example.
It's doing a lot of work in the community, making sure that people are still able, like they're working with the mayor's office, to provide a myriad of services through different restaurants.

As we know, the Department of Ed and Marquis can keep me honest has said that the spring break now is only going to be limited to four days, which really just looks like two days, because they're counting, Saturday and Sunday, so that they continue to work through There's been some pushback from a lot of people, because people feel as if they need a break.
Week, So we're going to have continual education to meet the state mandates, but we are trying to do something different from just focusing on instruction, and that is there's a lot of They're working around the table to figure out what that exactly is going to look like and how they're going to roll that out.
Right now, as the mayor has stated in his daily press conferences that getting all the medical staff, their PPE and ventilators is the most important priority right now and so New York City emergency management, we're working with Health and Hospitals and all the other relevant agencies to make sure that chain of getting resources and logistics, that's being all well coordinated, so that the hospitals that need them will get all the supplies.
You know we were seeing where he was thinking that there are people still congregating in public spaces and while we encourage people to go out and get exercise, because that's very important, you know congregating and in that, like unmask in public places, is not advised at this time, And so we really just want to make sure that the community is still getting the message that social distancing.
That's a big concern for many neighborhoods that overall, as we know in the health in the health department, as we are trying to close the gap in health discrepancies, some neighborhoods are far harder hit than others, and so we really want to be able to get that messaging.
