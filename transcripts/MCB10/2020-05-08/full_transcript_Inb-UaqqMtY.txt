Okay, so we're calling them to order our meeting at 6:15 p.m. my name is Cicely Harris I am the chair of community for 10. Thank you all so much for dialing in normally, while meeting time is six o'clock in the Adam Clayton Powell jr. state office building, but under these times we are meeting via zoom technology. First of all, I would like to thank the borough president for purchasing the technology to enable all of us to communicate and stay together just a few ground rules. Everyone is basically on mute at this time, our panelists and our attendees. So if you need to speak, just go ahead and use the raise your hand feature also for the folks on the phone, we'll be checking that as well see and the chat as well to make sure that everyone has a chance to be heard and participate as much as possible. So it is important for us, even in a time of change and chaos like this, to keep some type of normalcy and familiarity as we can. So that's why the CUNY Board is striving to continue to meet virtually with our regularly scheduled meetings. That's why it was important to have this meeting today at six o'clock, the first Wednesday, that's where we always are at six o'clock. So we wanted to make sure that we come together and for our committee meetings for the month of April, although we will be meeting it via technology via zoom and conference calls. Those meetings will go as scheduled unless there is a change of plans from that committee year, but we are striving to keep that bit of normalcy. We will continue to keep the community abreast of any COBIT 19 situations and updates, but we also in keeping our sense of normalcy. You want to make sure that we are continuing to address the issues that were in our community prior to Coba 19 and will be here after koban 19. We want to continue talking about affordable housing and small businesses, public safety, education, job creation, transportation getting us safely to work when we are able to get to work and making sure that our essential employees are getting to work as well. So these are all the things that we are continuing to do. That's why it's important that we keep our meetings regular and that we inform the community that we are still having our meetings. The office is now operating virtually we are telecommuting. Thank you, shot taken Juanita for getting that set up, so you can contact our office from 9:00 to 5:00, yet email or our phone number make sure that you know that keep abreast of social media. We are posting all the time on all these updates in our community and abroad. I would also like to thank the elected officials for doing their part of keeping us engaged the borough president again a wonderful newsletter, if you're not subscribing to that newsletter. Please do it has a lot of helpful information, also a great Town Hall on Monday. Thank you for that Assemblywoman Inez Dickens. Thank you for your program on small businesses, Congressman svi, keeping us informed with teleconferences senator brian benjamin great emails and meetings again, councilman Perkins, an assemblyman L Taylor. Thank you all for what you're doing and keeping us connected to resources. I'd also like to thank a lot of the organizations for stepping up the 125th Street bid, always on point keeping us informed, greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. Thank you for your calls. Harlem parts of park as informed on the small-business fry twirl college had a great webinar the other night, so we are truly all in this together and we want to make sure that we stand form. I would be remiss if I did not mention our health care professionals out there every day, risking their lives, their families for us to make sure that we have proper health care. Thank you, Harlem Hospital, for being there Mount Sinai the urgent care, centers Metropolitan Hospital, our prayers are with you all as you go out. Also, let's continue to sue some to support our small businesses. They are open as much as they can be. They are delivering food and open for takeout. Also our churches. Let's remember our church is a lot of them are live streaming. So, let's make sure that, even if you say you're, not religious, it's sometimes good just to get a word of encouragement times like this. So from your couch, you can get a good word, so it's that's great to know, and we also like to thank the essential personnel that are out there for us every day, getting on the subway we'd like to thank the MTA workers, NYPD FDNY MTA and grocery stores- pharmacies, everybody that is doing their parts and make sure that we are safe as a whole and that Harlem continues to thrive. We like to think of our friends at the 3/2 precinct, as they suffered a loss and detective Dixon and for everyone who has suffering loss right now. Our prayers are with you. We are encouraged by your strength and we are oblivion every day. Some quick points that I wanted to bring out to you a lot of things we we've heard over and over again, but this, as you know, this is being recorded. So we want to make sure that it's able to be played back on the information that is current for today. Governor Cuomo did give a account for today and right now the total is 80. 3712 confirmed cases of covet, 19 was 7900 17 new cases, New York County, of course, has 47 thousand cases, 447,000 439 cases. People are continuing to be tested. We have tested at least 220,000 people with all with 15 people tested. Just yesterday, hospitalizations there are 12,000 226 New Yorkers, currently hospitalized, due to coronavirus. 3022 patients in the ICU and deaths are at 1941 thousand from 1500 yesterday. So these are some things we should keep in mind. Also some good news on the front. There are test kits that are being sent to the hospitals. 500,000 test kits are being sent to the hospitals and all over the state for use. The first batch of these kids will be delivered to the state yesterday, actually with 25 thousand kids coming daily New York City playgrounds are closed. Folks, it's important that we use social distancing. The playgrounds are closing up the park, so we want to make sure that we are doing social distancing. So those public spaces do stay open health insurance, New Yorkers are who are with without health. Care are encouraged to apply up to April 15 unemployment benefits. There is a new PSA that is talking about unemployment benefits that will be available and today is census day. Yeah I hope everyone was able to complete the census. We should all raise our hands on here. If we completed this emphasis, we can utilize that functionality if we could I hope that everybody is completing the census and being active about those things. Quick census data, Thank, You, Nikki Yearwood. For sending this to me right now, the Harlem area is below 27% right now, so that's not good. It's not good and also the average. The national average right now is 36%. She did send Nikita with didson a lot of documents our way. So we want to make sure that we post those four posts to have, and we will do that. I've talked to 125th Street bid and a couple of other organizations. People are not practicing social distancing outside my window. Today there was a fight. There was a lot going on today. It's nice weather what we need to impress upon our friends and neighbors that we do practice social distancing. There was an article I think you should take for sending that to me today or excuse me Charles for sitting that to me today highlighting corner on 125th Street, where poets were still hanging out. We have to make sure that we are bringing attention to this, and, if you don't stay home for yourself, stay home for your family, for your colleagues and your co-workers just to make sure that we're still doing that. Also that's for a mental health. Note please, if you do think of someone, your friends and family, and they cross your mind. Please reach out to them. That is a sign that you do need to reach out and oh, you can't touch them. It's important that you call them email them text them, because folks just need a little bit of contact, even though it's not physical and lastly, as I close out I did hear an encouraging word from Pastor Mike from FC BC I was able to tune in on Sunday from my Fiat and so from my couch, and so what he did say that was so important is that we are more than conquerors, which is important to remember and he's finished by saying that I don't know how we are going to win this, but I know that we won't lose, and that was something that stuck with me and I hope that we are carrying that out and feeling that way as they go about our day as we are our three our neighbors six feet away. So let's continue that may God continue to bless you and your families and bless Harlem. Thank you for that Cicely first I also would like to thank our Manhattan borough president Gale Brewers office for acting quickly and providing free and unlimited zoom accounts for you guys who are not visual. This is Shattuck mitchell district manager, CB 10, sorry about that. But once again thank you for the free zoom accounts that you provided to all the Manhattan community boards, and I want to thank the beta NYC team for all of their hard work on keeping us connected tonight. We have gaby on the line with us from beta, NYC and she'll, be assisting us with technical support for this session. I also want to think the mayor's office, Gail Brewer's office, Councilman Perkins office and all of our city agencies and elected officials who have been keeping us updated with all the corvette 19 reports and newsletters on this past Monday by the FDNY I responded to a fire, bought a northbound to train in our district at 110 Street and Malcolm X Boulevard I'm, the fire killed Garrett Noble, who was a 36 year old, MTA conductor. Three others were critically injured, but are expected to survive. I'm 70 people were injured in total, including 5 firefighters. No arrests have been made at this time, but the NYPD is investigating this as an arson. So we want to send our condolences to his family and also to the family of detective Cedric Dixon of the 32nd precinct at Sicily mentioned earlier. He was 48 years old and the first NYPD officer to die from the corona virus. He was a 23-year vet and he passed away this Saturday once again. Our condolences took them both and for those who have lost friends and family members. During this difficult time on, the CB 10 district office has been closed since Monday March 16, but the office staff has continued to work remotely. Our constituents have been advised to communicate to the staff via email or on our mobile phones, we're continuing. They use our social media platforms and he blasts mailing lists to send out pertinent information to the public before the district office was closed. We were in the process of interviewing candidates for the community assistant position. Now, in the wake of this pandemic, the Personnel Committee would try to schedule. Zoom interviews and upcoming weeks. Kovat 19 assessment and testing center has been open to the public in our district at the Gotham side in Hamm hospital after patients evaluated them. Those have been determined to be high. Risk will be immediately transferred to the nearest healthcare facility on the hours of operation are monday through friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and the address is to 64 West 118 Street once again to 64 West 118 Street I've also been in contact with the director of the mayor's office on nightlife. Miss Arielle cows and I have a survey that I hope to get out to our small businesses like restaurants, who have been affected from loss of business. I want to acknowledge our organizations and local restaurants and our district, who have gone above and beyond the call of duty and our community who provided free meals to the public I know. Al sharpton has been providing females at National, Action, Network, Marcus Samuelsson, a Red Rooster csail Hajji at Ponzi, Bistro and chef JJ johnson, at field trip Harlem and for everyone else out. Working on the front lines voluntarily or involuntarily, also want to thank our local hospitals, Harlem Hospital and Sydenham medical staff and healthcare professionals and our central workers putting their lives on the line who continue to make the city run of the DSN. Why Department of Sanitation is still on schedule for their normal pick? Ups and sanitation workers have been supplied with protective masks and gloves as of date arm as far as Department of Earth partment of Transportation Ott's in the side of the street, parking is still suspended through April 14th and out of the Department of Education. We got notice today from the governor's office that teachers and students are expected to keep working remotely through SAR their scheduled spring break, and this news just came in today just to speak on our social media following I'm. Right now, it seems like everything has increased, maybe because everyone's working from home, but we really got a big boost in our Instagram presence. A couple of months ago we were only at six hundred and seventy two Instagram followers, and today we're at a thousand and twelve on our Facebook as our strongest on medium to connect with everyone right now with I'm thirty, two hundred followers and our eblasts has over twenty five hundred followers, so we're just working them, keep getting those emails and getting those contacts. So we can get the information out to the public and I have completed my the census for myself and I'm not send out the link to the board members for everyone to share with their friends and family today as census day. So just encourage everyone to get out and complete the census and I don't want to keep you know anyone waiting on. Oh, we have our agenda and we have our agencies and elected officials on the line. So that concludes my report for tonight. Thank you for the time Thank You shotty. Thank you for that Deborah.

It's been moved and seconded it's a move. The second thing can I have a motion to X. Is there any discussion? Sorry discussion, no changes. Can we can I have a motion to vote by consensus? I, don't know if we can do that. Can we do that Oh on lazuli, just accept it, because it's I have a motion, that's been seconded. Did we just leave it and go from there fatigue? Do you remember the rules around voting on zoom'? Do we have to adopt the agenda or, if Athena could tell us, we have to do a roll call for everything. It's the same. It's the same procedure, yeah, it's the same procedure, so we can do. We can do a common consent. Athena I'd have to confirm that my understanding is that you were supposed to continue operating as we would in person. Okay. So then we would normally do a common consent right, okay and the bylaws of saddling on it. Okay, so there's no discussion during the motion, the vote by common consent. Yes, all of all for the vote are there's any. Are there any knows anyone against it? Well, you have to say I'm in consent, Deborah just to make it easier. All you have to say for common consent.

Well, what's that I mean I, don't after chat later right, I will adopt the April meeting, April the Marchant minute, semana minutes and May right. Okay, all right! Thank you on to committee reports. Now, at this time. Sorry, they were really quickly. I would like to make a motion to adopt the chairpersons report, as stated previously before public session may have a second. Are there any objections? Hearing none? The chairpersons report is adopted, as previously stated at this time. I also entertain I like to make a motion to accept the district managers report. As previously stated before the public session. Is there a second? Are there any? Is there any opposition at this time? Hearing on the district managers report is adopted, as previously stated: okay, Thank, You Deborah we're gonna go ahead and move into the committee reports. As I stated in the chairpersons report, we are taking special consideration to make sure that all of these committee reports are coab in nineteen related and haarlem. Related I do see that we have some more attendees at this point on the phone, including madam borough, president, as I stated earlier, if any of the elected officials have to make a statement prior to our old business, which will be the section where we talk about Covid-19, 19 and detail, please let us know raise your hand so that you can go ahead and speak prior to that point and I see Nina Saxon joined as well. Again, please! Let us know if you have to leave early I'm Linda what guy as well. Okay, all right, I, don't see any hands at any of the lights, and officials need to leave Cornell. Okay, we're going to go ahead and start with our committee reports, arts and culture committee. I. Believe Jerrica are you on? Let me unmute you George Tyrell. Our chair is unable to make it tonight. He shared a link with resources for members of the arts community about grants and different other opportunities that they can access during this time. We're just asking the district manager to be able to distribute that to our listserv, because it's a pretty lengthy list in addition to that George is- has been in conversation with the Harlem, Arts Alliance and so Harlem Arts Alliance, as well as some other arts organizations are going to be coming together in the coming weeks to come up with some resources and additional ideas to help support the arts community. That's it that's all we have for as far as an update tonight, Thank You Jerrica from arts and culture I. Believe, madam borough, president, has a next engagement and needs to speak now. Can she be unmuted, please who's that present ma'am, all right I! Just thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you very much. I will be quick and it's all about the virus and thank you for 10. So a couple of things last week, as you I think you know- maybe you saw we did- give to Harlem Hospital thanks to the City University of New York's Graduate Center, a huge amount of PPE s, I think mostly masks and shields and gowns. So they were very pleased and you know nothing better than to make sure the workers are has much PPE as possible. Second, we have been working hard to try to get food to people. We got healthcare, you got food needs, you know them all. So Fresh Direct has been helpful. We decided to focus on nature, and so we are working from the top of Manhattan to the bottom of my hat and they go to the same location every single week, every Monday, every Tuesday they go to the same location and there are three or four developments in Harlem that they are going to. We can get to that information, but they have been really consistent and it's a very strong package of food, not just for one day. We also focus constantly on meals for seniors. It is not a good system, so I, without getting into all the specifics. We are been talking to Kathryn Garcia, who of course, is head food now for the entire city, she's trying to find some kind of a major procurement, because the senior centers it's very confusing about when they get the food and comes from a national distributor and then it's doordash brings it to the seniors, who are a part of that Senior Center. But what about the ones who are not you're supposed to call 3-1-1 and I won't get into the fact that you don't get necessarily the food so we're working hard to get seniors food, and even if you live the night, sometimes the door doesn't work, so the door - deliver cannot get to your food and people have to eat. So I just want to say we're working hard on that. The schools, as you know, have the centers. They also have, in some cases, food and Thursday. Traditionally, the only people getting food at the centers, the hubs. The food hubs are those who are parents and students, but starting Thursday anybody who's hungry between 7:30 and one. You can go to this school and get food and along those lines, because we're interested as you are in the new way of teaching. In other words, technologically, we had a really robust do tube with Teachers College Columbia, and in this case it was born 9 because obviously Columbia is in their district and it's all on our website and if you're interested feel free to look at it. The next YouTube is going to be on small business and we're gonna, do it with Columbia's business school and we're certainly involve folks businesses from Harlem we're all concerned about funding from the nonprofit community and for small businesses in terms of SBS, which is the city. As you know, they've had an ongoing couple of opportunities for nonprofits and for businesses, including grant programs and some interests zero percentage. However, they are transitioning completely almost to the federal program starting Friday and Monday. I won't get into all that, but it's good for the gig workers, it's good for independent contractors. It's very complicated, 800 pages in terms of the number three stimulus package, but I think that in terms of businesses, it would be good to have a further discussion if they keep their employees and they don't have to pay the loan back, but if they not necessarily easy to keep your employees if you're going from total recession, - supposedly starting up a new. So that's a challenge. The nonprofit community is equally important and thanks to Athena and thanks to, of course, to the Greater Harlem and to all the work that Lloyd and bolsa are doing. There is a phone call three o'clock on Friday with the nonprofit arts community in Upper Manhattan and again we have a daily newsletter, I hope you're getting it and it does include how to participate in that and we'd love to have you we're concerned about housing. Does a April first we're a tenant city. We are urging a couple of things. Obviously the governor has said no way. It's gonna get evicted for 90 days, but you know it's still very nerve wracking, because if you don't have the funding for rent you're, you should be, and you are nervous with I. Don't trust long to respect the owners of these buildings. So there's a lot of discussion and Albany about how to handle that we are urging the rain guidelines board, which of course governs the increases for rent stabilized to just leave the topic alone in 2020. Go to 2021 without any increases and there'll be many other discussions about housing. Today's census day, I'm very proud. You can hope that others will do the same. Oh and then finally, construction not supposed to be constructing now, unless it's affordable housing, we're still getting complaints and we're bringing them to the attention of the Department of Buildings and I want to thank Athena and her staff, because northern Manhattan offices virtually working really hard, as we all are, and as you are in this unbelievable time of crisis, I mean when you have to order as I did yesterday, another refrigeration truck because there aren't enough for the bodies the dead bodies in the building, because there are so many so I had to get a truck from FEMA. In order to carry the bodies out, then you know we are in serious trouble. Thank you very much. I'm Adam borough, president. Yes, so I believe there's a couple of questions. If you don't mind, of course, so one of the questions is regarding the state budget, yeah I'm, 400 million in Medicaid cuts. Do you have any comments on that or any information I only know the same as you do, I think we should wait to hear from the local elected officials. I know they work really hard. There are many challenges in terms of this budget and how it impacts and I'm already getting calls about. You know, city institutions that are getting cut so I, don't know a lot about it. I think we should wait to hear from the state officials. Okay, thank you for that. We also do have one more question about the enforcement recomment recommendations concerning crowding in parks and green spaces. Randolph's clear was unofficially closed this afternoon by the - 8 precede, because the park uses violates the governor's physical distancing order. Is there any information or advisement that you can give about that? Well yesterday, even before that one, there were two and four twelve that were closed. I mean I think you know, the parks department is apparently determining along with NYPD I suppose where there is too much socializing and it does I guess because I'm so involved as you are in, what's going on with this virus, I do understand that people cannot congregate and you know I have kids I know they think they're not gonna catch it, but that's what I do understand the reason to close this, and if people have specific issues, I'd be glad to bring them to the attention NYPD and Parks, but I do think we can not congregate. Okay, there, any I, don't believe there are any more questions. So thank you so much, madam borough, president for dialing in we will continue to follow your wonderful digests that you put out every day. We'll have the great information. Thank you for doing that. Thank you. Oh Cordell! You have a question, there's a raised hand. So do I turn it up. You can go ahead, go hi cord, oh okay! How are you and your family, okay, you're, alright, how's, that wonderful son, very good? Thank you! I'm Gail, you know, we've had some deaths in the community. People have been contacting me. As you know, my church had four deaths. Last week alone we have a lot of people with the virus that also members of the church and in the area I've seen the data and I've seen it broken down by gender and age and other things and I wonder. Is there anybody breaking this down by race and community board, because I just feel like there's a lot of people in my circle and just looking at the factors that make people most vulnerable and at-risk for fatalities? Those indicators are high, if not highest in the black community, when you're talking about diabetes and asthma and those things and I just want to know, are we looking at that I've you seen any numbers that reflect that broken down by race and numbers I mean I will get you the information. I know it's been broken down by type of job, which of course, is sort of what you're talking about, because so many of the folks who are working in the you know there's eight people from the MTA as an example, all people have color yes, so, yes, I've been Drake I've, seen it broken down by profession, grocery stores, etc. But let me find out and I know that I know what you're talking about. Let me see what I can find and I'll. Let you know thank you. Ah hi. This is Mari mas, there's also a map that shows where the hardest hit areas are I posted it on my page on my Facebook page I can share that with Chi and want you to share with the entire committee, but it does show where there are large health disparities. There's a there's, a correlation there, so support ELLs point: there's a correlation where there are gaps in our health care system Mari. This is one that's broken down by zip code. Yes, okay! Thank you so much, madam borough. President. Thank you really, that's all the questions we have right now. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, again, let's make sure that our list of officials, they know that you can raise their hand if they need to speak. How do they do that on the phone again? Is it started? Six start. Nine are six starting lunchtime nine to raise him okay. Next we have a economic development technology and communications Mari univer, yes, I am Jennifer had to be on another call and chanel, so they both really share some information with me to share which most of it has already been shared. Thanks to our madam chair, Cicely, Harris & shattuck Mitchell, a lot of the information as well as Manhattan borough president go for. There are loans that are available to small businesses that are being recommended, I'm, going to just share that list. With that information with the board, I've shared some of that last cousins, an email from the department of small business services, and it is as Mahara president Gale Brewer pointed out. It would forgive loan, so small businesses as long as they continuously paying their employees, there's also a freelance relief and independent contractor relief through the SBA, so that information came out today. I'm still reviewing that information, but I will share it with our board as well, so that we can share it out to the general public. The Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce is having an event with Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer on April, 3rd I'm, assuming and I think that's also with the arts and culture committee as well. So that's coming up soon and I'm Harlan parts apart and it's doing a lot of work in the community, making sure that people are still able, like they're working with the mayor's office, to provide a myriad of services through different restaurants. So you already shot at about Ponte bistro chartered out Red Rooster Sylvia's, different businesses that have given back to the community so that they can get access to food, which is so important as it was already shared earlier today. So just making sure that you know businesses that are able to are continuing that work. The soul needed and, let's see so Harlan part of Harlan parts of park, is working with mayor's office. And that's really that is the full amount there yeah just making sure that people have the resources. They're encoded 19 and our information also that I know that we're doing really well with the social media, but are we sharing this on a permanent on our home website permanently as well like people can just click on our website and get the information so cheek, yeah hello are the links to the websites that are offering to connect folks to services. Are they on the website? No, but we can put those up. Yes, thank you. So that's a great idea. We'll definitely do that. Thank you mari and thank you very much thanks and Derek, thanks for putting in the chat that nan has food six days a week from 12:00 to 4:00 or until supplies last. Thank you for letting the community know that they're loved, okay, we're gonna move on to education and libraries. Do you have a report Deborah all right got to UM use. A lot of information is already out there. Of course, Laura president Gabriel did a wonderful Town Hall on Monday on YouTube, that's available on her website that you guys should check out, as she mentioned this coming Thursday starting this coming Thursday. Anyone who's hungry can go to the schools to get food during the day up until one o'clock. There are lots of resources that are available if students are still having problems with not having equipment to log on there. Services available and I have all these links I'll send all these links to check teak so that he can send them out to the public. As we know, the Department of Ed and Marquis can keep me honest has said that the spring break now is only going to be limited to four days, which really just looks like two days, because they're counting, Saturday and Sunday, so that they continue to work through the co, vid and I know. There's been some pushback from a lot of people, because people feel as if they need a break. Is that correct, Marquis, yeah so right now the UFT CSA and the department education are in talks to do something different here in New, York City. So it's going to be it's going to be focused on family and engagement week, so we're gonna have continual education to meet the state mandates, but we are trying to do something different from just focusing on instruction, and that is there's a lot of they're working around the table to figure out what that exactly is gonna look like and how they're gonna roll that out, but that stay tuned, at least by Monday next week, they're hoping to roll out something where it's about more about family and engagement of children, rather than just continuing to do the same work that they've been doing. Okay thanks a lot Marquis and that's the end of my report, like I, said I, do have a lot of links and I'll send those in to mark -, Thank You Debra, we're gonna move on to Health and Human Services I. Believe there is a presenter named Pauline who was supposed to be on the call to present for Health and Human Services or as dr. Shirley hi. How are you good? How are you I'm from the health department, so I was asked to give a presentation, but the chair, madam chairwoman, gave a wonderful overview earlier at the start of the meeting, so I didn't want to belabor the point, but I think from the health department's point of view. Right now, as the mayor has stated in his daily press conferences that getting all the medical staff, their PPE and ventilators, is the most important priority right now and so New York City emergency management, we're working with Health and Hospitals and all the other relevant agencies to make sure that chain of getting resources and logistics, that's being all well coordinated, so that the hospitals that need them will get all the supplies. And so that's pretty much. What we're working on in terms of the logistics and health end, but in terms of public messaging I, think it's really important that people continue to understand why social distancing is important and I think. The reason why the governor decided to close the parks is because, unfortunately, you know we were seeing where he was thinking that there are people still congregating in public spaces and while we encourage people to go out and get exercise, because that's very important, you know congregating and in that, like unmask in public places, is not advised at this time, and so we really just want to make sure that the community is still getting the message that social distancing. While it is very difficult for some people, it needs to continue for the health of everyone, particularly the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions and I know. That's a big concern for many neighborhoods that overall, as we know in the health in the health department, as we are trying to close the gap in health discrepancies, some neighborhoods are far harder hit than others, and so we really want to be able to get that messaging across that. This is really important to protect those who are vulnerable at this point, and so we appreciate all of the elected officials and the community boards for providing this information to the community. Additionally, we want to make sure: can people still hear me? Yes, okay, great, so, additionally, we want to make sure this hasn't been really spoken about since the very beginning of the pandemic. But we really want to make sure that people are seeking mental health care if they are needing it, because we do know that isolation is very difficult for some people. Some people who have very unstable home lives being forced to be inside your house to be a very difficult time, and so we really want people to be able to seek out care when needed, and so NYC well is a resource available to folks. But again, as madam chairwoman had suggested earlier, reach out to your neighbor and just make sure that people that you love and care about and your neighbors are all being checked on, particularly the elderly and those who might be even more isolated in this time, and also on that vein, that we are working on a citywide, anti-stigma tracker, I, don't know when this is not going to be live, but we have heard from multiple communities that, because of this virus, you know certain people of a certain ethnicity or nationality have been targeted, mostly East Asian folks, but other people have been targeted as well, so people who are essential workers who need to be on the subway every day. Some of them might be harassed because other people feel as though they shouldn't be in public and so there's there are many people currently or maybe people who have tested positive for kovat 19 right. There are many people who might be targeted because of this, and so we want to make sure that they know that there are resources available. If you feel, as though you've been harassed or denied service because of your nationality or ethnicity, we are partnering with the Commission on Human Rights, so you could file a case with them, but we really want people to know that is available. It's not okay, to treat people with disregard, or you know openly with hatred and bigotry, because you think that this virus was you know it originated in some place. And now it's here. This is affecting everybody and we are all New Yorkers and we are all in this together, so I think that's really important messaging to put out into the community as well. So those are my two biggest updates in terms of what we're working on in terms of public messaging. But if you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them, you do have any questions, I'm proud for Pauline. Thank you so much for joining us. First of all, oh thank you. Thank you all for having these meetings. It's really important, so we do have a question from district leader, Cordell Claire she's wondering about the breakdowns of deaths and fashion and testing, especially I wants people of color African Americans. Just specifically, is there any data on that and does the data break down so far as into community boards or ha-lo specific data? What is the Bradys yeah? Yes, I definitely heard that question earlier and we do so far only have it broken down. There's a map that Mari mas had mentioned on our website, broken down by cases per zip code. I, don't think we have that granular information just yet only because I don't think you know. The current situation is nearing the end at this point and so I don't know whether or not that information will be compiled at a later date, because, right now the pressing issues are for getting frontline staff all of their equipment. That's needed, but also just providing that sort of baseline information and then later on as this progresses, and that when we get more information, that might be something that will be looked into to break down even further in terms of like ethnicity or racial background, and maybe community board level. I, don't know for sure about community board level, but because even our community health profiles, they, it was pretty difficult to break it down by community board level, which we did do with the last two Community Health profiles have been broken down by community board level, so it could potentially be something that we would work on, but that wouldn't be until a later date, but we don't lean and the importance of that. Okay I believe we have a question from one of our board members, Stephanie Palmer, you can speak. No I was just referring to kordell's question about on the breakdown just recently read that there are also racial implications that have to do with those folks who are able to go to work and those people who are able to stay home, and it appears as though a higher percentage of black brown yellow people have to go to work. I just wanted to add that and something that might be helpful as we look at it. Yeah I mean there's I, think there's a lot of indicators as to why certain populations are impacted, more and so I think that's something that we could probably take data on later to sort of break down to a more you know, granular level, but you're right. There are many things that go into why certain groups are harder hit when it comes to these types of issues. But again you know based on our community health profiles, certain neighborhoods again have different health outcomes right just on a normal year to year basis, and so we at the Health Department really want to focus on closing those gaps, and so I think this is something that we'll also bring to light. The disparities among neighborhoods in New, York, City, Thank, You, Pauline I believe another board. Member has a question Karen ory, and then we will go to our one of our callers Sheena Kaufman Karen. Can you yes? Could you hear me yeah ask: are the death rate numbers that we're hearing are those exclusive to cope with 19? Yes, so they are based on the code. Cove is 19 diagnosis, but of course, as we know, most people who are unfortunately dying from cope in nineteen do have underlying health conditions that contribute and make Kovac nineteen that much harder to recover from, and so yes, those numbers that we have listed on our data map on the website for Ovid 19. Yes, so kovat 19 is, but there are Co mortality, morbidity, meaning other underlying health conditions flow I. Don't believe we break that down, though, with that clear we're gonna go on to Sheena Kaufman. Yes, hello, you can hear me yes, oh okay, I'm, sorry, I'm I, apologize, I couldn't get zoom on my other phone, my Joyce how's it going my personal phone, so I apologize for being really late, so I have some up some updates. We officially closed the box starting today or the playgrounds are being closed. We start we're starting now. I'm sorry, really question for Pauline no I'm from the parks department. Okay, so we're gonna give bags you when parks presents. Okay, thank you and I. We do have one more question from one from six. Four six there's a number here. I believe. If this is a question for Pauline, please go ahead and ask your question six. Four, six, the last three digits are 0 4, 0, you're unmuted, yes hi. How are you this is mr. Buena from state senator Brian Benjamin's office? How are you? How are you have a question for me? Thank you for joining us. You have a question for Pauline I, don't have a question for Pauline. I was actually going to give an update, but I can just wait. It's fine, just wait a second. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's are there it. So there are no more questions for Pauline. Thank you. So much no problem I will pop you off in okay. Thank you. Thank you. Oh Charles Johnson. You have a question. Am I warm you I, don't know you. Can you hear me now? Yes, so now they have a question for her in terms of how many shelters we have in the district and how are they handling that circumstance within the shelter system? Can you hear me? Are you able to hear yes Pauline? Are you able to answer her Pauline? Can you answer her hi? Sorry I was kind of unmute myself, so I can definitely reach out to DHS about fear their shelter system, but from what I understand they are doing they're following all the appropriate guidance from the CDC in terms of you know, making sure that their clients are not exhibiting any symptoms and if they are they're being isolated correctly. So I am more than I'm more than happy to reach out to my colleague over at DHS to provide any specific, related shelter information for you all. Thank you. Thank You, Pauline I do not believe I see and traced. Thank you. Okay. Oh there is one health Evon Lucas. Is this a question for Pauline, okay, Canton? Okay, so we're gonna move on to transportation, again treacherous and historic preservation and landmark I am the acting chair for that committee. We don't have any real updates today, except that we do have one boat item. It's a street cone aiming for Althea Gibson I will be presenting that under the voting item, but we did want to just echo that we want to make sure that people are practicing social distancing on the train. We've seen lots of video lately of crowded platform potential workers. It is true that transportation has been cut down a lot and a lot of folks still have to go to work as much as we can. We need to practice social existence. Saying we've also talked to the MTA about what can be done about this I know they decrease the service because of the lack of ridership, but folks do have to still get to work and practice safe traveling. We also did mount a city bike about our issues that we have from the last meeting and that letter has been sent to them about the placing of city bike which is now offering a discount and free transportation to all essential workers in the city bike program that is all I have for transportation housing Charles. Can you talk? Okay, Charles, yeah, I wasn't unmuted before so, I think the barrel president I'm good evening. Everyone I think, that's you know. The housing situation has been. You know covered somewhat. The primary thing that we've been hearing from lots and lots of people are, of course, the expectation that there's got to be something further done beyond just the closure of the landlord tenant court. You know I'll read something. You know that I got today. No relief, lawmakers in tennis advocate says thousands of New Yorkers could face eviction once the moratorium is lifted, triggering mass displacement and fueling New York, City's homelessness, crisis I've, seen some of the notes. I know Janelle as posted something those seniors posted. Something with respect on this chat with, what's going on in our shelters, National Public Radio did a great report today. You know from the shelter's talking about. If you really want to you know, what's going on with terms of social distancing, all you have to do is get a report from someone in a shelter that has described forty people in the lunchroom. You know that's about ten by fifteen, with no gloves no protection for anyone serving food and then having to eat together and then saying well, how do we wash our hands when there no bathrooms to wash our hands? There's no sanitizer and do anything so we have a real problem that we're gonna be focused on the committee. Displacement is always the issue about this homelessness situation, including, what's going on even at eight fill the Brando Park. You cannot keep people out of the park. We have nowhere else to go to live, so we have a hundred thousand beds. You know that are available in hotels and we're hoping, but our city and elected officials and state officials, one that they're gonna get greater. You know debt relief, you know to tenants, meaning forgiveness, not just deferring it for 90 days, we're ultimately getting there because they won't be able to pay after 90 days when the LNT courts are open again. But what happens where those people go into shelters? You know and you're talking about people dying. There are people leaving, shelters, NPR reported this because it's unsafe to be in shelters, it's safer to be in the streets. So that is a crisis. You know that is a human crisis. You know that we had bet to address as a mental health crisis. It's obviously a drug addiction crisis. So our committee will work with all of the other committees, Public Safety help and otherwise to formulate a policy from this board, because we need to start thinking about policies. You know every committee should be thinking about what they're resolving in their meetings this month. You know we talked about our meetings being the continuation of town halls. Everybody should be coming whether it's education, public safety, health, housing, land use, everyone needs to be coming out with specific action items. So one of us we're requesting I think in our meeting on the 27th would be. We need rent forgiveness, at least that's just my opinion. If banks are being forgiven, if major companies are being forgiven, you know major indebtedness. Our tenants need to know that 90 days, they're not gonna face the inevitable, because those L&T costs will open again and eviction will flow and it's gonna be like bloodletting. You know so we need to think about what our policy is gonna, be with respect to that and somebody, whether you know, needs to get the Steve banks or whatever held, is responsible for what's happening inside of these homeless shelters and do something about protecting those people in there and open up these damn hotels and let you know that are closed down and let some of the homeless people have a home again, and that should be something that happens on a permanent basis. So it's something passionate about something that is. You know, God forsaken crime, that's going on out here with respect to the neglect of people. We can talk all the fancy stuff, we talk, but we have a real housing crisis and it is now going to become a of crisis. If we don't do something about it. So that's my report, Thank You, Charles, I, hope everyone is paying attention to the chat. If you can there's a lot of good information on a lot of good questions circulating on that questions about where the formerly incarcerated will be going once they're released questions about a lot of the shelters and the children in the shelters, I, don't know I know we have I promoted some of our guest speakers to panelist, so they could be prepared to speak in about ten minutes hopefully, but if they can't take a look at some of these questions on the chat and be prepared to answer some of these questions. Okay, we're gonna move quickly to the land use I, don't know! If there was a report, Karen Dixon did you did you have a report? I'm sorry I had to unmute myself. There wasn't a meeting last week last month, okay, but I believe the only thing is like the usual Earp's are on hold. Is that correct, I believe so? Yes, okay, Parks and Rec Karen? Yes, I could I wasn't, as was said by the chair, and there was a mention at the parks, the resort, playground closures, but it's my understanding that open spaces should still be available. Also, there is a hospital, a field hospital that's being set up in Central Park. It's a sixty eight bit treatment center. That's it is going to be treating overflow of patients from Mount, Sinai Hospital, so that's being set up as well and in terms of we did speak with Steve Simon he's going to confirm to speak at the as a panelist on at the Town Hall coming up on Monday. He did request surety that you sent him a request with the information. So you know, if you could take care of that would be great our meet our committee did meet by telephone conference last month and we discussed the Central Park five issue, a commemoration and the waterfront situation here in our area. So that's basically my report. Thank you. Thank you. Karen you're welcome and Public Safety Charles I believe we had someone from the three two precinct that was going to present that Charles, just real quick I want to know a little bit. There were few concerns. Our bra I get probably put a pretty pink touch. It's honest. What did one of you yeah? Can you hear me barely you're breaking up sound better? Yes, a little bit better, really breaking up what I was saying with that arm, yeah you're breaking out. We can't hear you I'll pretend with me how to help safety meeting on me, okay, so Charles. What we can do is if you want to dial in and we can come back to you, okay, so what we can do is No, okay, so Charles what we can do we'll come back to you, we'll figure that out- and so you can make your report we're. Gonna move on really quickly controls, not working so Charles we're gonna really quickly. It will come back so really quickly. We do have one voting item before you want to our panel. We have the Althea Gibson street code Amy. Everyone should have gotten that ahead of time, maybe on Tuesday. Yesterday, okay, maybe I'll, say yesterday really quickly Charles we're gonna move on won't come back to you, we're gonna. Do this voting item? See you figure that out, so we have the Althea Gibson Street Co naming. Are there any questions about it? You all received it the other day. If there are any questions, Barbara Nelson, you have a question. However, you can speak I work and we can't hear you are you speaking fatigue? Yes, I can't hear Barbara Nelson. Are we moving on it's a book. I was discussing the boding item and then we'll come back and machinae will definitely talk to you next time, so we can follow up with parks. Okay, just do this really quickly, while we're trying to work out so that Barbara can speak. I believe that Deborah Gilliard wanted to say something really quickly about the senior. Can me now? Yes, okay, so I just said, I agree with the borough president about the senior meal program is such an enormous task and for the past two weeks at the senior centers, they have prepared the graph and gold meals, which means the senior could go to the center and they got a prepackaged meal, but a Department of Aging for the health and well-being of the older adults. They decided to phase out the grab-and-go meals and they wanted to have a centralized program of mail delivery directly to the seniors. So it just thought it Monday, so it's still like it has a lot of kinks in it that they have to try to iron out. So, according to their rules, the meals, the clients will receive a direct delivery of meals, which will include a five meal package. Deliver it to us. I just got a package yesterday and then the box that had five meals, blessed have fruits and vegetables so useful to get this box once a week and they're supposed to you know, help you, along with your meals and the most direct path to access. Just that direct delivery meal is through the senior centers and older adults can also connect to the dipper and they give the number two one two four six, four six nine or they complete one and then but it's gonna take a while because they just thought it this week. So it's gonna take a while to I'm out all the kinks and stuff to see how they're gonna deliver. Who supposed to read to all the seniors. It's just gonna take a while cuz, that's an enormous task, and also some of the supermarkets have allowed seniors to shop early to avoid the crowds. So you could just call your supermarket ahead of time to see you know if they are in effectiveness. So I just want to thank all the politicians for sending out newsletter. I newsletters I want to thank ivy nur for thinking about us, so it's just something that we have to deal with and we'll get through it. Thank you. Thank you. Okay I believe miss Kaufman. You did want to UM speak under parks. Oh you can hear me now. Yes, okay, because I can use my phone just get all messed up, I'm, sorry! So as you, everyone is aware, we've started closing all the playgrounds today as the governor spoke, and it took her down to the mayor to then to our Parks Commissioner, weave, locking down all playgrounds and we're going to remove all the basketball ramps, and this is just to control I'm. Sorry, you can still hear me. Yes, okay, and this is just good control. The crowds we've been having some difficulty in some areas, so I guess you know well over the BrahMos, so not particular up in Harlem, but I think we have some issues in our fitness areas that we had a lot of crowds and we did put the sign. But of course, a lot of people didn't back here. Joe, the playgrounds haven't been that bad, but because they can do some of them, they grind up doing all of them. So we begin this task today our staff is still working. We still working on the 70 operation, we're still going to be given you know the public. You know the care that's needed. Our staff has been limited due to child care issues, but now the deal he has provided to all essential workers, a drop of location where we can drop our children off and still be able to come to work, so that was provided to our staff last week and put them to sign up, and then it introduced to a drop-off we're also doing food give-give outs at Thomas, Jefferson Park. You have to register and to uber and other arm cab industries that they have out there. They are picking the meals up. Our national Garza is helping, along with our park staff with just with this matter, and we going and they're picking the meals up in Indy dropping them off, and this has been going on since early this week since Monday, so they have to go online to register our tennis. Courts are closed. Our soccer fields are closed. Regular spaces are open, but no gathering is allowed. As we all know, I heard someone mentioned April of Randolph. There was some complaints that came through that there were large gatherings there. They wanted to be able to split them up and cuz people would learn hearing through it. So I went body this evening and so far it's okay. It's people have spaced out a little bit. So even though NYPD is around the area, nothing seems to be happening for the most part. Most people have been at here. Until would you know the six? We grew I guess we are all just waiting for this thing to be over at this one point in time, but as we might have another armed pickup drop-off center at Pelham, Fritz we're waiting for they're. Okay for that, so that can alleviate some of the problems that Tom Jeff, because it's crowded over there. It's is heavily busy over there with the mail program. Karen are you still there miss Orry, yep she's still on okay, so I do have an update with you about the arm, the short about their own, the Harlem River shoreline. Okay, I see that's here, okay, so we we're going to have a presentation of the shoreline in a coming months. Once you know once this is all over with so we represent as presenting to you the work, the scope of the work along the shoreline. So Steve wanted me to let you know about that and to make sure that we're going to make sure that they come to both ten in eleven to give you okay to make sure we you know present, you know what was going to be taking place. There was a seat and I know there were some concerns that people were emailing me about certain issues and certain parts, but I haven't had any issues in the parks and district ten. Everything has been so far so good. Thank you for letting us know that. That's great to hear yeah, it's it I had we had a, we had a stabbing shooting and district 11, but district 10. So far we haven't had any issues as of yet and I'm hoping this stays. That way. Thank you. Miss confident is a great rapport. We're so glad that we're not having issues I, don't believe, I see any questions for Miss Kaufman at this time. I just like to say she know: can we talk offline about the waterfront? It's off? Okay, sure. Are we going to meet later this month or no? Yes, we're meeting on the 8th, mm-hmm, okay, and we get that out that information out. Thank you. Miss Kaufman, okay, we're gonna move on yeah, our panelists ready. We see here okay, so we just had one more item on our list and that was the street cone aiming and did anyone have any questions about the street? Coming me from Althea, Gibson I believe our panelists, most of you all, have been promoted to our attendees have been promoted to panelists the special guests. So please prepare to answer the questions that are in the chat box and we will have this one last item. The street cone aiming is for West 143rd Street between Adam Clayton, Powell, Boulevard and Malcolm X Boulevard, and it is Althea Gibson way. It was voted on in the Transportation Committee I believe we were one shy of quorum, but it was a consensus vote there just to show support for it, and then it was discussed in executive committee where it passed. Are there any questions about the epiha Gibson street code evening? The reason why it's tears cuz she slipped on that block from the board of members. Any questions you, okay, I, see no questions at this time. Okay, as the chair of the Transportation Committee I, move that we accept the street code, naming for Althea Gibson, Street, Althea Gibson way, which is at West one 43rd Street between Adam Clayton, Powell, Boulevard and Malcolm X Boulevard. Is there a second a second discussion? Is there any hand raised I, don't see any at this time? Are there any hand raid on the Althea, Gibson Streetcar Named stay, no questions we prepared to vote I believe we have to go into this Li. Give me second I must start to add me on our board members. Okay, going to vote so give me my second okay and then for the last half. We will have our panelists present and make sure that they are able to answer the question. Some of the questions were about the shelter system. What is going on in New, York, City jail system and how is Harlem specifically and the reason why we wanted to make sure that we have folks that know about Harlem specifically on this call it's because this call is being recorded. We will be placing this on YouTube so that we can look back on this and put this out in the community. So remember, all these responses will be memorialized that transcript and place on YouTube, so that the community can continue to have access to this presentation. Okay, all right I believe we only have second roll call and then it's not to get you finished. Okay, just let me know when you're done all right, then I'll do the second roll call and then I'll do the voting I believe. Probably the best thing is if they could, if they want to give a brief synopsis or they have questions they answer.

So now we were going to move into our over nineteen presentations from our special panelists, so everyone who was in an attendee of scheduled to speak it's now in the panelist chat, so you should be able to unmute yourselves and speak. So we do want again. Like I said, we want to make sure that you are conscious of looking at the chat for all the questions that you might be able to answer and know that this will is being recorded and will be placed on YouTube for future use. So, first of all we had the bro president speak already. Thank you for that. We wanted to follow up with our representative from the mayor's office Isaiah and then I. They are you able to speak hi, I'm, yep I'm here, okay, go ahead, please all right! Thank, You Cicely! Good evening everybody! My name is Isaiah I'm, the Manhattan borough director out of City Hall. Everybody best wishes everyone's staying happy and healthy during these trying times and I want to echo some of sheikhs words from earlier, really thanking our essential there's, especially the health care cats going out there on the front lines every day, I thank them for everything, you're doing so, quick update the mayor's office, the health department numbers for today, as of 5:00 p.m. we have forty five thousand seven hundred and seven total cases of coronavirus in the five boroughs Adam, and we have one thousand three hundred and seventy four deaths broken down by borough. That's thirteen thousand eight hundred sixty nine Queens eleven thousand one hundred sixty in Brooklyn, seven thousand eight hundred and fourteen in the Bronx six thousand five hundred and thirty nine Manhattan and two thousand three hundred 54 in Staten Island I want to highlight that in proportion to the populations of the borough's. If you look at the numbers per 100,000 residents, Manhattan's number is only 351 per 100,000 residents. I, don't want to say that coronavirus is going down or anything like I. Don't want to give anybody any kind of false hope or aspersions, but I do want to highlight that is the lowest in the city. Her per capita Manhattan has the lowest amount of Crona babies cases. So a little bit of hope for us. I also wanted to talk about social distancing as I'm sure everybody's aware. The guidelines are that folks should stay at least 6 feet away from each other in public if they have to go out and that's only if you have to go out for essential travel, all social gatherings are banned all social gatherings, including and kind of Park. This includes all religious activities and houses of worship. Activities must seat. Also, all playgrounds as I think parks were previously. All playgrounds are closed. This is for the governor's order, as of today, parks has been enforcing this. All businesses that have an exemption from the closure rule from the governor that can still operate. They still have to follow social distancing guidelines. So your supermarkets, your post offices, laundromats every business that's allowed to operate, still has to follow social distancing. I want to encourage folks the city administration in the state. We are taking it very seriously, please if you observe or hear of any establishments or you see folks that are not distancing, you can call 3-1-1 and make a report of that. We follow those reports in real time and we dispatch members of several agencies, including the NYPD, to go and investigate for folks who may be concerned. The first visit is all an educational visit. It's just to make sure folks understand social distancing. Only after that first visit is made. Will there be any chance of being a levy defy and those fines and range up to $500 for repeated violations of social distancing? Also I wanted to talk. I think miss Gillard mentioned earlier she's, a good job talking about the grab-and-go program, I'm, not sure I. Think Department of Aging may be on the call, so I'm just gonna keep it top-line the program rolled out this Monday. They are providing all of the meals invoked, who dipped a contract in senior centers all across the city. So, instead of seniors coming to the centers to pick up their go, it would be better for us to deliver the meals to the doors of the seniors and those have been registered with their local Senior Center, any senior who may be concerned if they're registered they want to check on their status or if they want to register, to receive the free meals. They can do that by calling three one or getting more information from dip this website, the Department for the aging. Also, we have a new website that we launched called help now NYC. This is the hub for all things, coronavirus related. You can go on that website to volunteer if you want to volunteer with the city, if you want to seek resources, any kind of relief or the many programs being up in the city or the state. Currently you can go on this website to donate money or supplies. If you have any, the city is always looking. You can also go on this website. If you are a certified medical professional in New, York State, we are always looking for folks to help out and volunteer with the Medical Reserve Corps on the topic of donating money or supplies. If you know any corporations that want to do business with the city selling any kind of PPE personal protective equipment masks gowns gloves there is a forum on EDC's website, the New York City, Economic Development forgot to see corporation. Sorry, if I am it's me speaking, there's a forum on their website, they can fill out, and that goes through the folks on our end and we will follow up with them to see what we can do. And lastly, I just wanted to echo the previous sentiment happy census day. Folks, please complete your census. We do want to make sure, even though these are really difficult times, we do want to ensure that as many people can get counted as possible, so please encourage your neighbors to complete their census ease, since this is since I. Thank you and safety questions. I believe there is one for you from remember: Stephanie Palmer she asked she's asking: has the mayor's office made any conclusions about the reasons for the lower number of cases? In mention thanks for the question? No, there hasn't been any to my knowledge looking into why the numbers are low in Manhattan, but it's just a number that they're reporting on at this point and then, sir, what he said about Queens. He said in Queens, or you see places why higher levels of poverty. You see people cohabitating, so you have different families and family members living together more so they said in Queens, then you may see a man have I believe Athena had a answer and she said testing. Did you want to expand on that? Athena can yeah. Just very briefly. I was just acknowledging that a lot of what we've heard is that the testing numbers have not yet increased at the level that we expect them to. We know that we're just seeing testing sites increase their capacity, and so the thought is that there are many more who potentially have the virus that we've not yet gotten to so I. Think that's part of the reality of not reflected in the numbers Thank You Athena. Thank you for that I believe a toy hearse before switched. You have a question: Victoria, okay, hello, yes, hello, yeah! This is Derrick I, had a text question by zaiah sister long, yep, I'm still here, I'm, just actually having trouble finding how to open the chat. I just see them pop up and no worries. No worries is going at a rapid pace. There's a lot of participants in the chat room. My question is this: at a guy reach out to me, he wanted to offer hotel space panel 27 Street for the first responders, I guess in the hospital in that area hit me offline if any interest from City Hall yeah. Thank you definitely I'm. Sorry, just Derrick Perkinson eyes there Derrick Oh, Derrick cool yeah I'll, follow up with. You definitely will be interesting. Send me that information, and also for any other folks who may have similar kinds of connects things that want to be connected with the city for stuff, like that I'm going to drop my email in this chat box. So as I figure out how to open the chat box, maybe if somebody else should see if you can put my email in the chat box, please thank you guys and thanks for everything you do, but it thank you I believe we don't yet they're questions where I say: I care and I do see your question. We do have Michele Booker on line representing congressman SPS office. I believe she did have a little information about the stimulus package and that might answer your question. Karen Michelle. Can you speak now? Michelle I, don't think we can hear her. Okay, I know she's on the phone, but shawty she's under attendees. Can you unmute her she's zero for zero? It's our last number Michelle, it's unmuted, Michelle, okay, so, hopefully she'll be able to come on later on to talk about the stimulus package. Tina, do you have any information or does anyone from Brian Benjamin's office have any information about the store yeah? Just that the congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement on six trillion dollar package? You know which included spending on a variety of things. We saw four billion in support for eviction prevention, five billion for the Community Development Block Grant, we've seen 1.25 billion for tenant basement to assistance, 50 million for section 202, that's housing for seniors, there's been lots included for veterans and for Family, Violence, Prevention and other housing assistance programs, but in particular for small businesses. As we discussed earlier, the congressman has set up a program which will be in combination with New York Presbyterian and the Hispanic Federation and they're distributing money. We're asking folks to apply for grants that will be distributed through the congressman's initiative. I know Michelle when she is next able to get on will talk about it more in detail, but basically it will be for northern Manhattan and that's been defined as the area north of I think 155th Street, and there was ongoing discussion about how the community can further access those dollars. Thank You Athena. Excuse me my question was: how will the New York City area be affected by the fourth stimulus package, which is for infrastructure far as infrastructure is concerned? I'm, looking through the bullets that I have on the stimulus and much of what's here is not talking about infrastructure, so we would need to look that up and get back to you with that. Thank You Athena we'll make sure that we get that information to you Karen once it comes through and I think. That is something that everybody is concerned on. So thank you, Athena also a request from Charles Powell. If you could have someone at the housing meeting, which is in April 27th, of course it will be a zoom meeting, but we would like someone to talk about tenant protections in the stimulus package and how it is affecting housing. Absolutely we'd be happy to support. You and I will also engage my colleagues around this issue as well. We want to continue doing all we can around the eviction moratoriums, but also around what you heard the borough president reference, which is the writ guidelines board and their process, and we want to make sure that even the HDFC's, as well as the cooperatives, as well as our winters and NYCHA. We just had a call with the chair of niger. Yesterday and they deserve the continued support, as does all of us living in the city, so we're happy to support that next meeting. Okay, thank you. Next we're gonna hear from me and Saxon, and then we will follow up with the question about the senior meals. You know, if you could, let us know, what's going on with you in your office, sure hi community boards and hi everybody, okay in the breath of time, the new yet to be controller, has been working tirelessly around the covert number nineteen. She has done a lot of things. One of the things that he had actually done was did an economic profile report analyzing the budget and pension impacts expected IT contracts, drafting letters to government agencies calling on public companies to protect workers and consumers and take with action to protect the complete the controllers employees. He has also had been very active in the housing crisis on Charles. He definitely knows what's going on in terms of on the housing prices, and so he has written a letter calling that it should be a rent, free and other things that should be happening. So he said a lot of letters and statements regarding government services, contracts and procurement, calling on the private sector to come and help and also I'm dealing with homeless on students. I have a full report that I will send on to the district manager tomorrow to be disseminated to every board member and every stakeholder in the district and there's different links that everyone can link on and if they have more questions or concerns. Just reach out to me personally, Thank You Nina welcome I'm in for any of the panelists. They can answer the questions. We do have a question about senior meal program and then we will hear from I believe we do have senator Bryan Benjamin's office on. We will hear from them next, but first the question about senior meal programs. Well, the delivery person deliver to the senior or do they have to go to a senior citizen. See. Excuse me: well, the delivery program actually delivered to that senior or will they have to go to a Senior Center Marcus Wilson has heard feedback that seniors mustn't, go to the senior to the center themselves or have someone at the Senior Center to receive the meal. Is this correct? How are the dog seniors getting their meals? Would you like me to answer that this is Athena? Yes, so I know. We spoke briefly about this earlier and Deborah gilead from the senior task force joined us. So as of yesterday, the Department for the aging has discontinued meals at the center's, which we called rabbit sites right now they have transitioned to a delivery system, so you can contact Department of Aging at two one, two aging New York City, which is two four six four six nine or they could call 3-1-1 yes or 3-1-1 correct. Thank you now we'll hear from the rubbage enough for Brian Benjamin's office, and then we will give to Kevin Bitterman call regarding a medical staff who are certified to work here, but coming from somewhere else. Anyone from Brian Benjamin's office prepared to speak yes, hi good evening. Everyone, so most of my report basically has been covered, but I will, however, go over just a few. Just a few updates that we'd like to give from our office, as you already know, are the New York City playgrounds were closed. However, the parks remain open. Just for exercising and being able to keep wellness for yourself, our New York City is creating a central coordinating team led by the State Department health. It will organize upstate and downstate staffing needs our patient transfers patrol hospitals, transfers to the USNS comfort. This will help reduce the strain on New, York, City hospitals. The state expects that explains the crisis will be in mid or early April, with roughly one hundred and ten thousand Kovac 19 cases requiring hospitalization and thirty-seven thousand cases requiring a ventilator without strict social distancing. We believe this will last until drug July, however, exactly when or how long- or this looks like so far as opening back up we're, not sure yet it may be it may it may be reopening businesses before then, but now we're focusing on saving lives and keeping people healthy. We need. We need your help to encourage people to stay home, direct people, medical supplies, direct people, provide medical supplies and volunteers through proper channels. So far as our stimulus package, we will be getting back to you or you can call our office and you can direct all of your questions and concerns for that stimulus package to eat the meal valley or fill Gunpla, and they will get right back to you with any questions and concerns that you may have for our stimulus package. So that's all of my update for this evening. Thank you so much. Thank you for those updates good. If you get stick around, we do have questions and that you may be able to answer our next question comes from Kevin Bitterman I know we have dr. Cheryl on the phone dr. Cheryl Smith, our own board member, but if any of you panelists could answer this question our medical staff who are certified to work in NYC but reside elsewhere, able to be paused while providing service in NYC I know the governor made a call for physicians everywhere to come here and help out. Is there housing for them? If they do come answer that so Kevin there is I mean obviously there's been about 30,000 health care providers, physicians, nurse practitioners and an important part of this particular epidemic is respiratory therapists because of the need for ventilation. So, yes, you can come in. We do have people come in from out of state as well as upstate and the what happens is that the they go through the website that the governor has set up the governor's office then connects them with the hospitals and the hospitals themselves will then look over their credentials. So that way we don't want someone coming in to say their position, then they're not or not have they may be a physician, but not in good standing. So we want to make sure that they're not only a physician but also in good standing and doing the things that they should be doing for their credit, a ssin so yes and they're actually a fair number of people that are doing. Thank you. Thank you for answering that question. I believe next we have Mina white is on the phone from assembly and I'll Taylor's office, hi, everyone I, hope, you're staying safe and being well so I just want to echo. You know what everyone else has stated. You know our office has been primarily providing you know. On-The-Ground resources and kind of just streamline I mean we're constituenting. You can find information, soceity gonna know if you got our newsletter, but if not I can make that it will have it, but it can be. Recent and I also do want to emphasize that there is an emotional support line that the state has provided. The number is 1/8 mine, 3 1, and that is another resource in addition to NYC thrive, where folks can speak to licensed therapists and then also regarding health, that the state is currently having an open enrollment. So anyone who is uninsured, you don't have to have coded 19 symptoms, but this is just for anyone who was uninsured. They can get on the New York State Health mark date, and that number is eight five, three five, seven and I'm sure. As most of you know, there is a now on paid leave for families as well as individuals. So if you or a loved one has Covid-19 the 19 symptoms or must quarantine, you are entitled to paid leave and that's you know, depending on the size of your employer, but that is something that you are entitled to and that, on the governor's on paid family leave NY gov. There is a form present that you can provide to your employer, and this is all in the newsletter. So once you all see that you can, you know, take a look at that and then, in addition to the 90-day moratorium, the Assemblyman is a strong supporter of Senator Gianaris --is bill for the rent freeze, and that is Senate bill number one: zero two four and the Assembly Bill number is 8 1 to 5 a is an apple. So all those is also its present on the newsletter, but I did want to just emphasize this on. The call is that you looking you know, have that readily available and also just empathize census since a census. Again a lot of the discussions that were having on snap on medical, you know supplies resources as well as school, breakfasts and lunches has to do with the census. So that can't be over emphasized enough, even in this crisis. This all has to do with how we respond to crisis. So thank you. All invidious receives a newsletter, so let me know if you don't have it thanks. Thank you before we get to our next question on census. There was a question for any of our panelists on here I'm, going back to the rent issue, the rent stabilized renters, a lot of them have already received rate renewal notices that begin July. First, what amendments to rent impact, those renewals, if they sign now any of our panelists Athena Brian Benjamin's office, said Jenna, no I, don't have a current answer for that, but I can take that back Kevin and get an answer for you. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we're gonna hear from I believe there is a representative Philip Ellison from the public advocate's office. Did you hear me? Yes, all right good evening. Harlem very good. Take have some of your time and be with you in this moment. I echo everybody else and just making sure everyone is good. Health, family and friends. I know for my family. It is hitting close to home with my family. My parents receiving calls I just want to send out that my aunt is a health care worker, so much love to all the health care workers from our office at the public advocate's office. So I just want a couple moments to your time. As you know, Dramani Williams has been very active in our office under Jumaane Williams, the committee organizers, the borough advocates and the deputy public advocate's and our legislation policy team really working under the public advocate's Bonnie way. So a couple, a couple of updates, particularly today as we talk about rent I, want to read a couple: few words from the Public Advocate. You know the first of the month. The rent check is coming due. It has a moment of dread, so he's grateful for the calls and advocates and elected officials concern. New Yorkers were heard the earlier this month when a 90 day eviction moratorium put in place, but it's not only a temporary stopgap. The reality is tenants across us anything not paying rent today every day, what three weeks or three months. So we understand- and we hear you know what the public advocate is arguing for. Is he released measures he's supporting the legislation that Debbie majority leader Michel generis and Assemblywoman yulie new has put forward which would cancel rent for tenants across the state are facing financial hardship because of the coronavirus and in turn in turn, I know. I heard this question. He is saying that allow landlords to write off that amount from the mortgages they owe he's calling for a rent increase must be frozen until New York is able to return the rent to work. Excuse me, a rent freeze would prevent existing rental agreements or new ones from increasing to the race directionals crisis and end the car carve outs that are written. The statewide eviction suspension- let's suspend suspension, is an essential step in to recognizing the importance of housing and health care during this current more random. So just the Public Advocate is putting out talking to his peers in the state legislature advocating for legislation I'm really calling for ret moratorium to really go much further. So you understand that and thinking about some of the space, small landlords and the right house, Morgan, disco, I, know that's been topic of conversation. We did release for everyone on the call the Public Advocate has been talking into different agencies. Different leaders, looking at other states, been very active and has every step of the way has been actually one of the earlier leaders in the city to call for our safety measures and from a lockdowns, and so the public ever get released. A report on the recovery of the city. It's a living document, as this crisis involves, and so I do think. People should take a look at it. As we're focused on you know, the locked out potential lockdown they're, calling for lockdown and act enacting emergency public information campaigns. Closing down a recreational facility is expediting, B, car, serration, homeless, housing, a limited prepared food service delivery. So there is a report. There is something that's going to push to City Council other places to think about. How does our city deal with this crisis in the short and long term? And if you are interested in looking in that is our website is pub and I'll make sure I put this. The chat pub PU be advocate that nyc.gov and if you go to press you can see that update. You can find the report on how do we deal with this crisis in the short and long term? There's a few more things that I know I've received and Cornell clear has reached out to me the district leader as well and folks are thinking about family members and Rikers I receive calls from folks who have family members in Rikers. The public advocate wrote a letter and called an accountability for all of the inaccuracies in advocacy's and dangers of the response going on Rutgers. That's good Rutgers, University, Rikers Island. Excuse me. It's been a long day. The public excites, the reports that social distancing are is being egregiously, violated and incarcerated. Individuals and staff are not given. Supply is to sanitized spaces as outbreak continues to grow there. He questions their criteria for release, there's not enough PPE and cool treatment available and I'm hearing firsthand myself of some of these things from folks who have loved ones in Rikers right. So we have to think about those folks, and what does that mean as well? You know ghetto Brewer, the borough presidents on a tremendous job in and up in the Harlem, and we just wanna shout out and thank them for working with us and the other borough presidents, as Jumaane Williams laid out a price gouging report rights that meant for things comparing the prices of everyday items right understanding the stores are taking advantage and excavating people at this very time from medicine and things that they need right and that's unconscionable, and we will not stand for it. So looking at those prices, looking at what's been going on, surveying the drugstore citywide and we proposed policy and legislative solutions in regards to price gouging, which is a which is something we've seen at Harlem, we've seen in all different boroughs right, so the public, a buds been on top of making short prices, do not rise in these unconscionable unethical ways, and some of the things he's calling for in that and I'll close down very soon is just a three-strike penalty on the scouting first offense of Laura and said I can't Maxim, fine and third is triggering a revoking of this Merchants permit. So we are not playing games when it comes to this and I think. Lastly, outside of supporting the everyday needs of rent, we have to be thinking about Nyjah and I want to shout out on her work. Capacity. Does Senor Glover, who has been doing a tremendous job talking to night residents, as the public advocate as well as nights has been promised to clean their buildings, they're dealing with other issues as well, and we are organizing and trying to support the voices of the tenant leaders and doing with that so holistically to the public advocate's here, if you have concerns or questions he's in the news he was on year, one this morning he's on social media twice a day he's being talked to you, please, someone in Harlem I talked to should Chuck Miller Tuesday. Today, if you have some questions and concerns, I will leave my information and I'm down here to talk so I wish you blessings that. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you for that great report. A lot of information there and just want to highlight something that Mari said for the Public Advocate that we're asking that you put a special attention on the digital divide and making sure that the de OE is supplying computers to students that parents have access to teachers and records for their children. So that's something that we want to keep in mind, and that was a an ask for the public advocate's office that and I just wanted to respond briefly. I would say that I have there's a commute or ganar I work with Lila Maria on the Lower East Side, who comes up to Harlem. We go back and down, and back and forth together or she's a parent of six. We are deputy Public Advocate when the organizer of Education are pushing. They have a Youth Forum tomorrow and that's just separate, but every Youth Forum tomorrow to see how youth are feeling I'm Susie on Friday, there's gonna be a new forum for folks who have kids or who want to outlet to see what other kids are feeling at this time, but particularly I know cuz doing some outside work of my job capacity. We know the rollout is as disparate all over the place. I've talked to parents myself, who some schools gave students a week to get adjusted for parents to get adjusted to have supports to get them accustomed first, before just going right away, and some schools did it. We know folks didn't receive, didn't receive some hardware. We know folks at homeless, shelters didn't have Wi-Fi and iPads a couple days later, and so we are concerned about the remote learning challenges I my personal capacity and our team in the office are on that and it will have a report to you as that and Lila Mae and the Lower East Side is pushing citywide and I will be paying attention to Harlem. So if you have any specific needs or if you're noticing anything, please bring it to me. I'll leave my information in the chat and I'll make sure that we follow up on remote learning, as we all make this transition shout out to the parents shout out to the teachers on this call. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you right now we're gonna entertain one question about the census and then our next speaker will be from the district attorney's office with their update, but I believe we have a board member what they question on the census that is Robin Nelson thought she wrote it out. Can she kidding shitty? Can you on mute, Barbara yep. Give me one. Second. Let me see where she's at okay I'm unmuted. My question was: we have a lot of supportive housing units in our area, and many of these individuals are not receiving letters for the census, because they're living in single room, occupancy or they're in what we call supportive housing. We are psycho one-bedroom and they share bathrooms, but it is their permanent housing and a lot of them is being paid for by city vouchers. So why aren't we contacting them to count them in all senses, especially in Harlem? Thank you do any of our panelists when I take that question. I can just offer that you know we have really great relationship, as you know, with the Census Bureau and I'm happy to have a list of any buildings or SROs that you think are not being included and share that with them. The Cole year would issue, as you know, is one of the partners that we continue to work strongly with here in Harlem and also to make sure it gets to the top to the commissioner I think it's a valid point and we need to do more to get those populations that haven't traditionally been included. So whatever we can do to support sounds good. Thank, You, Athena I'll, try and send you a list of what I have Hey I'm, sorry, just one last thing and then online. Of course, even if someone has not received the hard copy in the mail, there's always opportunity to fill it out online and for those who may not be aware of that, don't they need a cold. They do and that's why they're not getting the mailings so therefore, they're not being included in the census and I understand I understand, so we can identify those and call it to their attention. Thank you, I appreciate, thank you for that. Next, we're gonna hear from the district attorney's office hi. Can you hear me? Okay, yes hi. This is Jacques from the from the district attorney's office. I just want to give the community a couple updates on what's going on. First, we are cancelling our a candlelight vigil doubt that was set to happen this month and we're also postponing the clean slate event that happens in May, so we'll keep everyone updated on the new date for the clean slate event. Secondly, our domestic violence hotline is still active and running. We definitely know that this may be a time where people may experience those kind of concerns related to domestic violence or intimate partner violence. That number is two one, two, three five, four three eight and if we still have counselors that are available to talk about safety planning to talk about a wider range of things that are related to domestic violence and intimate partner violence, we also know that this may be a time where folks are experiencing different scams or frauds, especially with that stimulus check coming in the mail. If you think that you've been a victim of a particular scam or fraud or know of something that may be happening, we really urge folks to email fraud, complaints at da NY, DOT, NYC gov I'll, of course include all of this information in the chat box. So you have it. Another thing is: if you want to stay updated on things that are happening out of our office -, please follow us on Twitter, Facebook or mr., graham at Manhattan da and lastly, our office. We are all working, he won't leave, but we just wanted to let the community know that we are also available. I cover the Central Harlem area and Belleville at three four, seven, two, seven, six, three one five one! Thank you thank you can take a quick question. I believe Cornell Claire had a question for the DA's office. Do you have any information on DB resources during the koban nineteen pandemic? And if so, can you send them to her and provide them to the folks on the call tonight in terms of information to the public? We don't have anything specific. We've been handling DV cases on a case by case basis, as you can imagine, with everyone having to operate from their home, but I can definitely reach out and see if there's anything related to information that might be available to the public that we can have sent out and another question really quick. Jacque is there anything that is in place for folks that are kind of stuck in a situation right now during koban 19? Is there or there in place in a bad situation? Is there any additional resources for them, or what can you put out for them? So in those cases we do connect individuals with their Wasel counselors. Who can talk about things like emergency planning? They can also connect them to resources, but particularly when it comes to getting out of an unsafe situation, they can. They can connect them to resources that can provide that type of emergency housing that they may need. But it's really on a case by case basis, Thank You Chuck. If you could provide the information as soon as possible, we can post that on our website and make sure it's available to the community as well as the people on the chat. Of course. Thank you, I'm Kara. Before we get to your question, can we hear from Miss limbo guy? Please Chetty. Can you I knew her she's on panelist? Yes, I'm, the guy cuz I'm meeting Linda? Are you prepared to say anything tonight, Linda? Okay, we can reach back out to her Linda I. Don't think we can hear you, okay, we can try to reach back out to her and follow-up. What's hard, there's anything else. I believe we have a report from Cornell Claire and then we will have someone to talk about the impact on small businesses. Cornell. Could you share? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, good all right, I'm gonna be very brief. First of all, I'm gonna, thank you Sicily and the whole board for staging this. I know this is no easy feat and it was good information and a lot of information. It's really needed just two things. We all know that the governor postponed the election from April 28th to June 23rd, but I want to let people know that they if they have concerns, because- and this is real people who may be concerned about even going to vote or the ability to go in vote on June 23rd, they can request an absentee ballot mm-hmm. The reason for it would be temporary illness and the deadlines for you to ask for that would be well I'm. Sorry, I know, that's the voter registration June 16th would be the last day to postmark. An application sent to you in June. 22Nd would be the last day to apply in person. So if you would have your wanting that, you should try to request that as soon as possible, if you, if you're in doing that, the deadline to register is also going to be made 29th, mm-hmm and I'm. Sorry, yes, the deadline would be I May 29th, so we want to get everybody if you're, if you're not registered, you have time to register for the jewel 23rd Prime Airy and, as you know, or as you may know, the primary is going to have all include the state primary as well as the federal election. So we're going to have our congressman on the ballot. We will have the Assemblyman, the state assembly, the state, senator the state committee, men in the state committee, women and as well as judicial delegates and our presidential nominees. So all of that will be on the ballot in this coming election and I just wanted to make sure that people knew that also in an effort to get information to a lot of people that I worked with daily. My club members and others in the community I have been doing a three o'clock live for the last two weeks. Every day, I do a Facebook live whatever information. I get I pass it on. So, if there's information that the board has that it would like me to post on my life, I will do that. I. Think it's very helpful and we have to mitigate a lot of other things that are starting to happen like the many hoaxes and scams that are being played on people from Social Security representatives all the way people who are representing themselves. It's quality con Edison, you name it there's been every scam, Under, the Sun, unfortunately so I think there's always good thing for us to make sure that we are putting out accurate and good information that people could go directly to the source for it. So thank you all of yo, please be well I hope your families are well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Thank you for that report. Now we do have a question from Karen ory, our landlord's being assisted by COBIT 19 stimulus package, and, if so, how can any of our panelists elected officials take that question? Does anyone have any answer to that so Sicily? Let me just try to weigh in on that and I know that that's an evolving question Carrie, it's a great question. What we do know is that you know some landlords, especially regarding you know, payroll issues. You know maintaining their maintenance tasks and others that's clearly in the stimulus bill. Obviously there's also mortgage hook. You know forbearance agreements, that's being worked out, principally by the state so far, and Kurtis would probably address that when he talks about what's coming out of the governor's office at Empire, State Development, but we need more movement from the city. You know the indicate knows kind of especially regarding HDFC's and not-for-profit of affordable housing landlords. So that's an evolving question. I, don't think, there's enough information out there right now, Charles thanks for taking that question, we did get an update from Linda guy. She just wanted people to email, Perkins email address. She did post it in the chat, so everyone can be added to their newsletter. So we should take advantage of that and get on that newsletter. I believe we have DJ Leroy to tell us a little bit about small business he's on the phone. If you can unmute yourself and talk about small business and what is going on there, Thank You Cicely and thank you community board, not a ten I'm. Sorry Lord, but I just want to say that and I heard Charles Powell talk about the effect on sometimes small business, the state right now and not getting ahead of the governor and his pronouncements, the state. Actually, we will be in a briefing on Monday the 6th to actually then get all the information in terms of state resources and what will be available to the small business community. So I can definitely assist Lee. You should take report back to you or send you some hard copies of that information right now. The only two that are up and running and available are the city through, of course, Greg bishops, office, SBS, and while this is actually going on, I'll send you and should take a copy of that, but in a nutshell, the things that they're actually talking about under that are financial assistance for businesses impacted by kovat 19. We know that, but the employee retention grant program whenever you see a grant. That means you do not have to pay that back. So that's always a good thing, as opposed to a loan. Now the only problem with the SBS programs for the small business community is that there is a requirement and that requirement is two years of operating business revenue. Okay, which can that's right, can knock out a number of the businesses, but I'll go through it. New York, City, employee retention and grant program. The small business continuity loan program when every day is a quartic or interruption in business. This is a loan program that small businesses can tap into with a cap or ceiling of $75,000. In addition, oh then they're tying it in to a couple of things through the SBA. Now that's the federal program. The SBA has two major programs and unlike SBS, they don't have the caveat in terms of the operating for up to two years. There's can actually be startups and less than two-year operating stuff, and one of them is the Paycheck protection program. In a nutshell, small businesses, owners in New York can apply to paychecks protection program or PPP for forgivable loans, help cover payroll, rent mortgage payments and utility costs. Okay. Those are the four things covered by that. If you don't go to the website, it's method, essentially it should take. I will forward you this that you can throw it out to the membership. Okay. In addition, now the one thing that we do have that the governor, of course, as a put out there, is that they, if there are suppliers and or vendors that can provide some of the PPE personal protection equipment, then they need to immediately and I will send you the website. But let me see if I can actually bring it up here. There goes yeah, that's gonna, be code, 19 supplies, colvett 19 supplies, one word at exact: DOT NY, dot-gov, okay, and that is also the number. If you call up the number of five one, eight four, seven, four, three: eight, not I nine. That is the number that date you will be given so well so I have my work cut out for me because, like I said, I will be on a webinar on Monday the 6th in order to get the information in terms of what will be the small business response from the state and, as you know, Community Development Corporation. We are a subsidiary of Empire State, Development, Corporation I will find that out for you I. Definitely normally I've been in a running conversation with Greg Bishop, so I will send them Thank you Thank You, Athena, no extensions, I, don't know about, but I know we received the same notice that far okay, that line okay, any other questions, any questions for Kurtis, while he's here one of the things that we continue to do just in case you know we are the agency that does state certification for the small business community that is still ongoing. We are doing it as you know, like everyone remotely, but we will be responsive. You know if any anyone has a question, as relates to getting certified to do business with the state we are still operating. In addition, we do have a you know for nonprofit organizations. That may be let's say, looking to have done a gala or something this period. We are still taking applications, but if you're talking about a gala, we have no idea when that will be up and running again. Could you please put the information on the chat of the number and the website for it? The PPE, you guess I will absolutely good one. Thank you. We have a question for you. Curtis is the two years of operating business revenue restricted to New York. If a small business has relocated to New York. What was the program that I was talking about? Was the SPS program, so absolutely only New, York, City and I had asked commissioner Bishop whether or not there would be any as I say waivers for this no they're strict on it. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone here you could stick around. Is there anyone here from Assemblywoman I know stickings office, okay, I, think we've heard from all of the elected officials now is that correct? That's good Cicely can I just respond to the question that was posed from Kevin Bitterman about the rent renewals. Yes, I was just going back to that. Yes, thanks, okay, so the answer is that people are being advised to sign these renewals that the RGB, the suspension that the president and everyone has been advocating for only affects those leases starting in October, and if we convinced the governor to suspend it, then the suspension will start wherever rents currently are so you know we're pushing for a suspension or a pool of money to address those people who can't pay their rents now who might be in arrears. Thank you for that. There is a concern, a question that we had about people who are in isolation during this time are their wellness checks for people in distress that are in isolation or what is going on in the mental health community to help folks in distress, Sharyl or any other panelist can take that question, I'm, not sure about wellness checks, but again the New York State emotional support line is open for service I. Think over 4,000 volunteers psychotherapists were recruited to join this support. Woman and I'll put the support line number in the their chat and then also NYC thrive, which is also another 24 hours city service. For is sorry, so this is our Cheryl, so, just specifically for patients that are in the hospital, they are our regular, obviously they're in a medical facility. So there are regular time periods where the patient care associates. The nurses, as well as the physicians, will check in dependent on what facility facilities they're in there are teleconference lines that are in the rooms themselves. What the provider on the outside of the isolation room can speak and see the actual patient, so there's actually multiple ways, but essentially someone does go into the room. It's not like they're left in the room by themselves forever. You go in the room and you're left there forever. Obviously, it's one of the saddest things that we're experiencing right now, because a lot of patients are dying alone and, as you can see everywhere, the staff it's thin. So it's a it's a really sad time period for everyone for patients, as well as for us for the providers, because this, the nurses or the providers would normally want to stay and actually speak with patients and or hold the hands for people that are scared, and just one of the things that's happening is that once you go in you go in by yourself, so family members, essentially from the door of the emergency room, you are you're by yourself from that time period on, so this is Mark Moss. The concern that I'm seeing with Colvin 19 is that people are now not only social distancing but are isolated from regular people that they see every day. So what I've been doing is reaching out to residents of associations and asking them are they doing well checks? Some of them are very organized. Some of them have captain's on each floor if they can go and check in on the neighbors that they know, because while people are isolating their homes or so disorder, social distancing from their homes, I really want to ensure that you know neighbors continue to keep the camaraderie. They continue. Even you know, following the rules of code bid, nineteen that we're getting every day from the governor from the mayor to keep six feet away, making sure that people are checking in on their neighbors. They know make sure that there's no distress, hello Mari, so here talking to tenant associations, president of the tenant associations, they're doing well checks with their weird neighbor that ain't no and making sure the children and families especially are cared for during this time. That's the concern can I just add something as well, not necessarily just about the isolation. I think the isolation is incredibly important and I. Think one of the things that we need to do is make sure that we are maintaining human contact now, because of the age that we're living in. We can obviously FaceTime. We can do FaceTime and do other technology things that we can be able to at least communicate with others. I just want to also at least let the puck everyone know all of your medical visits, especially your medical visits that you would normally have as an outpatient visit should, at this point all be tell televisions. So your provider should be calling you to schedule or not to schedule you but to actually speak to you on the phone to do your visits that you normally would go into the medical facilities for to do them as televisions and that's what side in ham is doing and all of HH h NH at this point is doing this as an ambulatory search for ambulatory care, obviously no elective it. If there is any specialty appointments for the most part, you should have been contacted to. Let you know that there's not any specialty visits unless they're. Let's say it's pulmonary and something like that: that's more essential, but most elective procedures, dermatology procedures that not deemed to be critical, those appointments of being delayed and postponed to other times and other appointments. Primary care appointments are being done over the telephone. Thank you, doctor, she's right your point and to dr. Cheryl Smith's. Point I've also been talking with Isiah Jenkins from the mayor's office about how Kovac 19 has caused us to you, know kind of accelerate a lot of these procedures, technologic being able to speak with people via time and on zoom and so forth. Parent coordinators or parent advocates have been talking about the fact that court has been halted. So if parents want to see their children, they can't they have to. You know: wait for court to get back up and running so I think we lost our connection with Mari, can't hear ya visitations happening in that regard online at the library just continuing those same technology, those technological ways of being able to interact and reach out to loved ones, especially during this time, because it is such a critical time and such as right. This time you know people need to be able to be how to be in touch with their loved ones and that's you know the ones that are separated and are not able to see them on a regular basis. We have to somehow find ways and that's why I was recommending like stuff like Charles Powell was saying resolutions policy work that can to that effect, help our community because it disproportionately affects our community I'm, repeating what I said, because the mute button keeps coming on. I have to keep reiterating my point. Okay, thank you! So much mari. We have one more question for dr. Smith and then we will be able to go ahead and in the meeting, but just Athena did have an update. Please everyone keep looking at the chat, cuz, there's a lot of good information in the chat and she it did say that people do need to sign their lease for news, don't hold off on signing them. You need to go ahead and sign those and share this information. Sicily. You can get any census information. Thank you can you can call in, and you can also go to the website. You don't need a code, so those people that may not have gotten it. You could just go to my 2020 census gov and you can fill out your census form there or you can also call I posted it. Thank you yes in the chat, so it's important to always look at the chat and also this is me Nina. Listen. If any nature resident is I'm having issues with they went, they can do a one-shot deal and they can do it all online and we can do the interviews or line something. So I just want people to know that good ank, you thank, you I, believe we didn't have one last question about co-pays I'm, doctor Cheryl. If you do know or athina, have you heard anything about co-pays being waived at all I believe mr. badeff and board member Bitterman had heard from providers who are not taking co-pays now, but nothing has come from his insurance provider. Well, it depends. Let's start with the testin in New. York can be done free of charge, but again it may depend on what specific test and where you get the tests, all New, York, State and New York City tests are free and free of co-pays. However, if you go to a private lab, a private doctor's office that sends it to a private lab, it may not be free and you may not have a copay most of the insurance most of the most of the most of the insurance medical insurance cover. Companies are fully covering with out co-pays, but that is not every single one, so you have to check with your specific insurance company. In addition, when it comes to kovat medical care itself, not just the testing, let's say you could get hospitalized or emergency visit that specifically relates to koban those are covered. Thank you. Thank you. I know. Michelle has been trying to get on here, Michelle Booker from congressman SPS office Michelle. If you can just provide the stimulus package information you haven't been able to get on here, but yeah I know you've been watching us, but we would like that stimulus package information. Whatever you have, if you have a link, a one-pager that we can post, that would be great. So, whatever information you can get us, we will definitely post it on our website and send it out via social media, Michelle and I'm. So sorry that you weren't unable to join- and we went there unable to hear you, okay, hear me now. Yes Michelle. Oh my god like that was like ours, hello, everyone and thank you. Everyone for your feedback, I'm glad I was finally able to get on I, see good to the late hour. I just want to highlight information that wasn't spoken about before are the first. Under the stimulus plan, the Social Security Administration will still be functioning, so those individuals who are getting supplementary Security income payments and yet benefits that should be going out in the timely manner. Please let our office know if that's not happening, but they should be receiving their Social Security payments also regard regarding the direct payments, the $1200 per person that is supposed to be sent out by the IRS within the next three to four weeks, so that money will be coming as long as people filed evilly to 2018 or the 2019 tax returns. So as long as they have filed that or file a tune, they should be receiving that as long as they're within the income framework, which is $35,000 up to individuals, excuse me and $150,000 from married workers and there's an additional $500 per monument child. However, if those funds will decrease, if you're, making more than 99 thousand dollars per individual and, of course, if that's doubled for married workers and just to piggyback off of Thank You Athena for mentioning the northern Manhattan emergency recovery fund, that was a collaboration between New York Presbyterian and the Hispanic Federation. There is a link online and individuals as long as you are a company, they will be providing support, and that includes nonprofits, and as long as you can, you know show the required information. There will be two million dollars that will be accessible and the second round for eight million will be for a long term. Community sustainability, if you have any additional information or for needed I, can follow up with you offline, Thank, You, Michele businesses as well. Yes, you're! Welcome. Thank you. Thank you again. If you have any links that you would like to post, please post it in the chat or anything that you would like for us to know. Any information that would be great I know, there's going to be a lot of questions about that coming out when people really start thinking about the money that they may or may not be able to get so I believe that we have gotten all our questions done. I have a question system. Okay, Karen last question: go ahead, yes, I just like to ask: is there any correlation? Maybe Cheryl could answer this and also Michele? Is there any correlation between the installation of fifth generation Wi-Fi and the a virus? And if so, and also is there? Is there any planning for installation in the this? Some forthcoming stimulus package I'm for infrastructure, so I will respond to the thank you Karen for your question. As far as I know, the infrastructure component of the stimulus package is still being hammered out in Congress, so it's for infrastructure. They there has not been anything. That's come out regarding that yet and as we get more information, I will provide that for the community and Cheryl. Can you speak to any correlation between this radiation and the coronavirus dr. Cheryl, you know what I was distracted. I'm, sorry. What was the question? Is there any correlation between 5th generation, Wi-Fi and the coronavirus? I? Don't have any information in terms of actual data as opposed to no so I. Don't have any data in reference to that at all. Thank you because I don't like to what don't call it and I'm sorry in here no I said: I don't want to present any information, that's not data and not like admissible, and although that people think or what they're saying I don't have data. Okay. Thank you for that. Thank you for that clarification, I, believe we've got all minds are clear ugly. There is one more comment from one of our panelists Curtis. Did you have some response to the fifth generation question? No, this is actually for the talked about the SBS grant. I just had a text from Commissioner bishop who said the grant is trans. Listening to the federal PPP program, which goes live on Friday and the loan, the loan will still be available. Oh that's great. Thank you. Thank you for a little coding, it's great information again. Thank you. Everyone for dialing in today, I think this was a really good conversation. We got a lot of ground covered. Please again, chat will be available on YouTube. We will get through this Debra Gates. Oh, you have the vote. Please let us know the vote. Please IIT. Can you Debra I'm, looking for Debra? Thank you. Thank you should seek I just want to give the results of the vote. The resolution passed with 27 guests. Thank you. Thank you for that. We had. No. That was our old business, no new business. At this time. Any announcements I think we had a lot of announcements, so you can also post those announcements in the chat. If you have anything to say, if all minds are clear, I will entertain a motion to adjourn the meeting. Anyone going to make a motion I so move. Okay, we close. Yes, all in favor, we just buh-bye. Is there any opposed hearing? None? This was a great meeting. We are adjourned at 9:28 p.m. of you guys be safe. Thank you, too.
