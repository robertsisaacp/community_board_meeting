So I'm, really beseeching your assistance and leaders in the community to assist us, and you know making sure that people are over there.
First off the Assemblymember Dickens office is still working diligently with helping our constituents with the ongoing unemployment claims crisis that has plagued a lot of people in this city and especially in this country, working with our constituents to log on to DOL and expedite their application, process, hoping that will push for them to get the assistance.
That's out there working hard to make sure families get fed, and then lastly, I just want everyone to know that our office is open kind of reflecting on which miss Adrian Felton said as far as small businesses, the Assemblymember is on calls almost daily dealing with the small business assistance with finances during this crisis, so our office is definitely open.
You know we're getting short on words to describe what we're all trying to do at this point in time, but I wish everybody good health and good state of mind going forward.
I would also like to thank the only woman for taking a leave with our small businesses, got some excellent calls and made those available to a plethora of people.
I'm going to be calling every single member of the community boards in the borough, Manhattan just to make sure to say hello.
My next question is: have you filled it out and some people, maybe they've, been away because of health reasons and now they're back, and they think that you know they shouldn't have filled it out or whatever, but fill it out.
Let me or Athena know if you need more I've, been on a lot of testing, tracing and treatment discussions today, and, of course, we're all trying to figure out what does contact We need more testing, sites.
And I do think that anybody can go whether you have symptoms or not, but in Harlem, of course, the Ryan Health Center, and the great word that work beside them is doing.
I think you know that, but it's my impression that there is a State, job, email, slash website And, then there's a city, job, listing, If people are interested, I think pay little less attention to what you need in terms of academics and does get on Of course.
We want the Summer Youth Employment Program to exist, hey what a great way but to have young people participate as contact.
Although a lot of people have died, we're all working on the food issue, Thank you to Fresh Direct for three weeks That's where we focus on the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Manhattan.
Ted has been terrific, but we need I know that your committee of Arts and Culture is phenomenal and so is board minds.
We just have to figure out a way for these groups to get some funding, and so I pointed out to the city today that if they're going to be funding contact tracers, who could be better than artists to be the ones that understand how to reach peers and people in general,?
I mean I, think that the I'm not only worried about domestic violence, but the teachers point out that young people, their numbers in terms of any kind of abuse, are way down, and you know better being in an office that deals with this.
But so do you think that you deserve money that from a prevailing wage job that bet you that you didn't get please file and our office we're doing a phone banking I will also make sure I send that to the district manager to send out to everyone in the community.
Also I, think the mahan borough president's office has an amazing newsletter that comes out like every day which I look.
You can call you just gotta form online And I can put that information in the chat, but you definitely need to know to make sure that our seniors are okay.
A couple actually really important base Harlem the Public Advocate is in our office has really been at work in the ways that we can always more work.
Does it mean manual, contact tracing with people, and it's likely gonna be a mix of both, and What's most important for Harlem?
A big thing today is that the Public Advocate with borough president Adams and a number of other cities, another, a number of other elected officials, city councilmen in Austin, Texas Alta Morris Chicago sent a letter to the Department of Justice, saying.
We know that folks, that look like us have been getting police and in ways that other people across the city and other areas have not.
We know that for social distancing and how we're treated so forth by the police and so domani has the Public Advocate has been talking about that for weeks about how do we police at this time and who does it?
So you know the public advocate our office is thinking about the health data.
We do not want folks to use this public health crisis as a way to expand their surveillance state Can people apply for the contact?
There are people that are not public health professionals that are being are going to be hired to be contact.
I know it's on the fund for public health Is the contact tracing different levels of jobs out there?
If you look at the funding for Public Health New York City, they do have some of those jobs, but we're concerned that the barrios the barrier to entry for some of these jobs that could be done by a lawyer or an educator or a different profession as long as they're trained appropriately is there, as you know.
Rosa rivers, but before we bring him on to answer some questions about arts and culture, about tourism, about economic development or anything that he wants to share because we're open to whatever he has to give us I wanted to just really quickly announce to everyone that we do have nine new board members.
What we wanted to be able to is to focus a spotlight on the smaller and smaller arts organizations and independent artists Lee, and how we're doing that is that we have partnered with the Bo president's office.
Hill We want to make sure that we are talking in a unified voice so that he elected and the city agencies and funders will really understand the importance of the contributions of the independent artists and so I'm, not able to stress that enough.
With a $500,000 fund and I and for those people who live in the Washington Heights in wood section, the New, York Presbyterian has put up dollars and The northern Manhattan Arts Alliance is looking at those artists in that catchment.
The importance of artists by having these little conference calls where hundreds of people are on, and we are also getting the funders to recognize and be a voice for the arts and cultural community.
So if Deborah and Kevin could prepare to do a roll call, but let's first hear from Senator Benjamin, hey, Brian, first of all, Thank, You, Camille or We, were just on a call earlier today with shitty Mitchel and a number of folks I see on this call talking about the impact of Kovan 19 on Harlem, and how are we dealing with some of the health disparities around that two quick things that I want to talk about is lot of.
You know PPE and getting a pass in the back, whereas uptown in communities of color people are getting thrown on the ground trampled sent to send up to jail for an on offense right, I mean at the end of the day.
We clearly need to make sure that we are social distancing, but how we respond to that is the issue And, so I'm in the process of calling on all my legislators, we're going to go to the mayor and tell them that we do not want the NYPD under any circumstance, enforcing social distancing going forward.
We could spend money on some more community groups going out there and giving public education telling people about social distancing doing in a way with it where it is respectful of our community and not a situation where I got a watch, one sort of approach in Chelsea and a whole other approach in Harlem, so I'm focused on that I will have a report to you, but this is serious.
We are not going to create a situation And, oh by the way these folks getting arrested, are not being put in jail and where we have Covid-19 19 issues over as well, right and so and to spend the police officers who are arresting them, aren't even using PPE and face masks.
There are people, six, seven, eight folks and two-bedroom apartments, someone's coming back from the from the hospital saying that they're asymptomatic, like Ovid I, mean there's so much trauma and going on in our community.
's to work on Looking forward, to continuing to partner with you, your office and everything that you're doing and thank you for everything they're doing on the front.
We want to make sure that that's happening and that anyway, the community work can push things forward can be a conduit for that.
If you see something definitely say something to the board, if you see an issue, one thing that has been repeatedly brought up to me is the lack of social distancing, and you know: Brian Benjamin, senator Brian, Benjamin mentioned it.
We want to know what's going on, because sometimes people need hard facts to figure.
Do just want to shout out some really great committee meetings that have been happening, the housing meeting and excellent meeting Charles Lisa, so many people were able to join so many questions were able to be answered.
This raises questions like you, said, Cicely, about the data on deaths and accuracy of the information that we're receiving under the state disclose an additional 1,700 people at nursing homes who are presumed to have died from coronavirus, bringing the total to at least four thousand eight hundred and thirteen people since March first, and that number does not include residents that were transfer to a hospital local hospitals before they died.
You know that we're ready back open for business, but the new cases that we're seeing is the most alarming thing Actually the cases are an uptick amongst older people of color and these people, who has been affecting have the ones that have been sitting in their homes.
Would also like to say that if you look at the statistics, you know that are happening with that elderly people in there saying that this thing in the house and they're still getting sick.
They need to actually be inside more because I know that the weather is getting warmer and people are gonna, go be out and about.
One is keep protecting our public hospitals and he will continue to fund hospitals about bringing testing right to our hard hit communities, as you know, and we have testing centers outside in him as well as Saint Nicholas houses.
You know and they're people going in and out Seeing your state and home You know not just related to Kobe 19, but there's food issues, there, deliveries of food and things of that sort.
You, know one person's home, Thank You Charles, and that definitely highlights so much of about what's going on, but people's living arrangements And it points squarely to economics, is a key issue and how anybody is able to survive and live with COBIT or just in general.
Yes, this past week we want to contact with the mayor's office and they asked the board members for suggestions on open streets and I did take I.
Another thing that we need to make sure that our lots of officials and those agencies are giving the community time to respond.
You know a letter of support on the agenda tonight, so I just want to say that if there's anyone out there that has a student or kid or know someone that is still in need of Technology, you can down three one and ask for and I add, and also the mayor decided that I guess that they got such a big donation of iPads, that if you don't attend a district school so that you have a student who is special needs, you can also and iPad. If the child goes to a private school or an international school of anything and they live in the city.
What are the funding plans and the membership plans that will make it more accessible for the people that they want to ride these bikes, so I know that they have the $5 program, but you have to have a credit card to be able to take advantage of that $5 a month.
It should be looking at housing, so that also can be a road block to that You know we will work with you all to talk about how they make it more accessible for everyday folks to be able to take advantage of it.
With your help with the borough president I, don't know where we are going to ultimately land up, but I know that the Housing Committee is so many different things.
You know: housing, community board, resolutions, yes, Thank, You, Charles, great question all right and just an update.
Know Athena in her office has been working diligently around the Carthage Marcus Garvey park development and they continue to have meetings weekly, sometimes daily around how to resolve the myriad of issues that continue with that project.
We had a committee meeting and we just felt that this was such an important issue, and that would affect so many youth in our community that we needed to add our voice to the people.
This summer, and so I think that the committee has done a great job in presenting an item that will represent the community board.
You know community of Americans with Disabilities, and so thank you because for everything that you continue to do with our community board and the Harlem community overall, the legacy report next time from Christina.
Other thing that I want to let people know is that businesses in our district are receiving funding, but because they are closed, they are not really sure what they should do with the funds.
