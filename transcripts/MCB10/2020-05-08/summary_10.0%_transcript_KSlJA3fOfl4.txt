I'm just going to like trying to figure it out right now, but thank you Adrienne for that report.
So I'm, really beseeching your assistance and leaders in the community to assist us, and you know making sure that people are over there.
First off the Assemblymember Dickens office is still working diligently with helping our constituents with the ongoing unemployment claims crisis that has plagued a lot of people in this city and especially in this country, working with our constituents to log on to DOL and expedite their application, process, hoping that will push for them to get the assistance.
That's out there working hard to make sure families get fed, and then lastly, I just want everyone to know that our office is open kind of reflecting on which miss Adrian Felton said as far as small businesses, the Assemblymember is on calls almost daily dealing with the small business assistance with finances during this crisis.
You can reach out to my gmail personnel, that's n, Norwood, n, O, r, wo OD to five at gmail.com As far as how we can continue to assist small businesses within our district and within our city with getting the financial compensation that they need during this crisis and again we wish everybody are happy.
You know we're getting short on words to describe what we're all trying to do at this point in time, but I wish everybody good health and good state of mind going forward.
I would also like to thank the only woman for taking a leave with our small businesses, got some excellent calls and made those available to a plethora of people.
One Staten Island I'm going to be calling every single member of the community boards in the borough, Manhattan just to make sure to say hello.
My next question: is: have you filled it out, and some people, maybe they've, been away because of health reasons and now they're back, and they think that you know they should not have filled it out or whatever, but fill it.
We need money for those who can't pay the rent, we're all working on masks and we were able to give out fifty thousand this week and last week And, we focused on the nursing, homes, churches, River, Band, Riverton, the Kennedy, Center and, of course, the great street corner resources and the Senegalese Association.
Let me or Athena know if you need more I've, been on a lot of testing, tracing and treatment discussions today, and, of course, we're all trying to figure out what does contact We need more testing, sites.
And I do think that anybody can go whether you have symptoms or not, but in Harlem, of course, the Ryan Health Center, and the great word that work beside them is doing.
I think you know that, but it's my impression that there is a State, job, email, slash website And, then there's a city, job, listing, If people are interested, I think pay little less attention to what you need in terms of academics and does get on I noticed in California they're using AmeriCorps.
We want the Summer Youth Employment Program to exist, hey what a great way but to have young people participate as contact.
Although a lot of people have died, we're all working on the food issue, Thank you to Fresh Direct for three weeks That's where we focus on the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Manhattan.
Ted has been terrific, but we need I know that your committee of Arts and Culture is phenomenal and so is board minds.
We just have to figure out a way for these groups to get some funding, and so I pointed out to the city today that, if they're going to be funding contact tracers, who could be better than artists to be the ones that understand how to reach peers and people in general, we're very focused on summer youth, but also on just schools in general, because all during the year, I said, social worker is needed in the schools and now, of course.
Just all the construction issues I know that they in his francis houses, is an ongoing discussion that sure that teen has been working.
Think people are focused on it, whether it's more hours and approached his Harlem Hospital They're, so swamped they tend to work internally.
I mean I, think that the I'm not only worried about domestic violence, but the teachers point out that young people, their numbers in terms of any kind of abuse, are way down, and you know better being in an office that deals with this.
Also I, think the Mahan Borough President's office has an amazing newsletter that comes out like every day which I look.
So I think it's just important that we push and make sure that we are informing constituents and as well as our neighbors on the 24/7, You know it's a Mista grounds, hotlines that are available in the state that you private it You just got ta form online.
And I can put that information in the chat, but you definitely need to know to make sure that our seniors are okay.
The borough president did a little bit And I appreciate her for doing that, for emphasizing the importance of the census for community Boyd's hen just want to give you the numbers.
What's going on with the census and letting us know our numbers, so we'll keep in contact with you.
A couple actually really important base Harlem the Public Advocate is in our office has really been at work in the ways that we can always more work.
What does it mean manual, contact tracing with people, and it's likely going to be a mix of both, and what what's most important for Harlem is thinking about the data management.
A big thing today is that the Public Advocate with borough President Adams and a number of other cities, another a number of other elected officials, city councilmen in Austin, Texas Alta Morris Chicago sent a letter to the Department of Justice, saying.
We know that folks that look like us have been getting police and in ways that other people acrosss the city and other areas have not.
We know that for social distancing and how we're treated so forth by the police and so Domani has the Public Advocate has been talking about that for weeks about how do we police at this time and who does it?
So you know the public advocate our office is thinking about the health data.
We do not want folks to use this public health crisis as a way to expand their surveillance state Can people apply for the contact?
There are people that are not public health professionals that are being are going to be hired to be contact.
If, they're, going to contact trace people in our communities in public housing for people undocumented people with different immigrants they need, they should also be coming from those communities and those community- based organizations.
I know it's on the fund for public health Is the contact tracing different levels of jobs out there?
You know you think, of the Apollo Theater in Harlem The foundation for arts and culture in our community and of 12.
The city has been the artists who are independent, who are the writers and playwrights and directors, and visual artists and choreographers literary writers, etc, who do not get the attention that they need, and so with the Harlem Arts Alliance Oh as a narc service organization, with about 350 members of this community arts and culture, practitioners.
What we wanted to be able to is to focus a spotlight on the smaller and smaller arts organizations and independent artists Lee, and how we're doing that is that we have partnered with the Bo president's office.
Hill We want to make sure that we are talking in a unified voice so that he elected and the city agencies and funders will really understand the importance of the contributions of the independent artists and so I'm.
The empowerment zone just announced a few days ago that they now have increased their funding for artists, with a$ 500,000, fund and I, and for those people who live in the Washington Heights in wood section, the New, York Presbyterian has put up dollars and The northern Manhattan Arts Alliance is looking at those artists in that catchment.
The importance of artists by having these little conference calls where hundreds of people are on, and we are also getting the funders to recognize and be a voice for the arts and cultural community.
So I want to focus on two quick things number one as it relates to of this: The police activity around social distancing that a lot of us have been seeing acrosss.
You, know, PPE and getting a pass in the back, Whereas uptown in communities of color people are getting thrown on the ground trampled sent to send up to jail for an on offense right, I mean at the end of the day.
We, clearly need to make sure that we are social distancing, but how we respond to that is the issue And, so I'm in the process of calling on all my legislators, we're going to go to the mayor and tell them that we do not want the NYPD under any circumstance, enforcing social distancing, going forward.
We could spend money on some more community groups going out there and giving public education telling people about social distancing doing in a way with it where it is respectful of our community and not a situation where I got a watch, one sort of approach in Chelsea and a whole other approach in Harlem, so I'm focused on that I will have a report to you, but this is serious.
There are people, six, seven, eight folks and two- bedroom apartments, someone's coming back from the from the hospital saying that they're asymptomatic, like Ovid I, mean there's so much trauma and going on in our community.
's to work on So I'm, looking forward to continuing to partner with you, your office and everything that you're doing and thank you for everything they're doing on the front.
We want to make sure that that's happening and that anyway, the community work can push things forward can be a conduit for that.
We want to know what's going on, because sometimes people need hard facts to figure.
I. Do just want to shout out some really great committee meetings that have been happening, the housing meeting and excellent meeting Charles Lisa, so many people were able to join so many questions were able to be answered.
This raises questions like you: said: Cicely, about the data on deaths and accuracy of the information that we're receiving under the state disclose an additional 1,700 people at nursing homes who are presumed to have died from Coronavirus, bringing the total to at least four thousand eight hundred and thirteen people since March first, and that number does not include residents that were transfer to a hospital local hospitals before they died.
They need to actually be inside more because I know that the weather is getting warmer and people are going to go be out and about.
One is keep protecting our public hospitals and he will continue to fund hospitals about bringing testing right to our hard hit communities, as you know, and we have testing centers outside in him as well as Saint Nicholas houses.
You know and they're people going in and out They're, seeing your state and home Know The exposure is, you know not just related to Kobe 19, but there's food issues, there, deliveries of food and things of that sort.
You know one person's home, Thank You Charles, and that definitely highlights so much of about what's going on, but people's living arrangements And it points squarely to economics, is a key issue and how anybody is able to survive and live with COBIT or just in general.
Yes, this past week, we want to contact with the mayor's office and they asked the board members for suggestions on open streets and I did take I.
Another thing that we need to make sure that our lots of officials and those agencies are giving the community time to respond.
What are the funding plans and the membership plans that will make it more accessible for the people that they want to ride these bikes, so I know that they have the$ 5 program, but you have to have a credit card to be able to take advantage of that$ 5 a month.
It should be looking at housing, so that also can be a road block to that You know we will work with you all to talk about how they make it more accessible for everyday folks to be able to take advantage of it.
The City Council's proposal, And I, know a thing that you've been working, on.
You know: housing, community board, resolutions, yes, Thank, You, Charles, great question.
Also, if he could put his information in the chat so that you will be able to email him, if you need some additional information on hooking up with a committee that you're interested in and we're going to move on to the presentation of voting items, really quickly.
We had a committee meeting and we just felt that this was such an important issue, and that would affect so many youth in our community that we needed to add our voice to the people.
One of the things I wanted to add Madam, chair Sicily, is that when this issue was first being discussed, that one of the ways that we could be a support and Madame Hazel Dukes is to identify the sort of regulations and the oversight bodies for nursing, homes.
We want to force, people that come and provide services in our community.
That is definitely a conversation that we need to have to have, and hopefully this letter, this joint letter a little supportive Manhattan borough president, the Attorney General will be able to move forward and figure out what is going on in this facility, where you can file a confidential complaint against the nursing homes.
Other thing that I want to let people know is that businesses in our district are receiving funding, but because they are closed, they are not really sure what they should do with the funds.
