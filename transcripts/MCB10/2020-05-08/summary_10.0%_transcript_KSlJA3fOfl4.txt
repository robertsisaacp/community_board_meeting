I would send over to you guys fresh release that was released this evening because we wanted to have the call first, We have real column and some gloss, but literally Harlem business owners with the life stories reporting today and making formal complaints about, and our community They have great relationships with business relationships with and they could not receive the people.
I am the community liaison for New York State Assembly Member What's, going on in the community, so I have a couple of updates to share First off the Assemblymember Dickens office is still working diligently with helping our constituents with the ongoing unemployment claims crisis that has plagued a lot of people in this city and especially in this country, working with our constituents to log on to DOL and expedite their application process, hoping that will push for them to get the assistance needed It's, definitely on their financial well-being, We are working very diligently as far as our office is concerned.
I know that it brings back good information to the community, so we're all working on I'm going to be calling every single member of the community boards in the borough, Manhattan just to make sure to say hello, My next question: is: have you filled it out, and some people, maybe they've, been away because of health reasons and now they're back, and they think that you know they shouldn't have filled it out or whatever, but fill it out.
We need money for those who can't pay the rent, we're all working on masks and we were able to give out fifty thousand this week and last week and we focused on the nursing homes, churches, River, Band, Riverton, the Kennedy, Center and, of course, the great street corner resources and the Senegalese Association Let me or Athena know if you need more I've, been on a lot of testing, tracing and treatment discussions today and, of course, we're all trying to figure out what does contact We need more testing sites.
The city said it was the state and the state didn't necessarily move quick enough, but everybody's aware of it now, although a lot of people have died, we're all working on the food issue, Thank you to Fresh Direct for three weeks, they were contributing their services to the night, show that's where we focus on the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Manhattan.
Ted has been terrific, but we need I know that your committee of Arts and Culture is phenomenal and so is board minds We just have to figure out a way for these groups to get some funding, and so I pointed out to the city today that, if they're going to be funding contact tracers, who could be better than artists to be the ones that understand how to reach peers and people in general, we're very focused on summer youth, but also on just schools in general, because all during the year I said, social worker is needed in the schools and now, of course, a social worker is needed more than ever in every school.
I know that, because of the Assembly members put a lot of time in on small business , I did get some good news from the people we've been working with at the Columbia Law School and Business School I , don't know that they have money yet, but they at least feel like they got some help.
I know that they in his francis houses, is an ongoing discussion that sure that teen has been working on So I also want to say: I know: we've lost some people, we lost karen Hori sister They had a wonderful memorial service for her, virtually that's one of their meetings , so we lost too many people Thank you, madam borough It is excellent and it is just a quick glance at everything that's going on, so it is something that people need to actually be aware of, and I've been on.
one of their nearby sites to be a more of a site for the community Thank you for that, and you know we have dr Dukes and our wonderful health committee and dr shell Smith and everyone involved so whatever you would need from us to make that happen, and we are here to help you with that So much Cicely, the borough.
I mean I, think that the I'm not only worried about domestic violence, but the teachers point out that young people, their numbers in terms of any kind of abuse, are way down, and you know better being in an office that deals with this So I.
We are also working on revamping the food program we sent I sent out to CBO's and other partners information on an RFI that the city has issued for CBO's that may have capacity to help with the food delivery program Also other updates today, not today this week we are continuing to open more testing sites, Nicolas houses site in ham or in Harlem Hospital One of the things I work with the Harlem complete count Committee on doing is really having a conversation about how the census has an impact across the board So on you know, and even during this pandemic.
A couple actually really important base Harlem the Public Advocate is in our office has really been at work in the ways that we can always more work, 's, not about being first but I, think Jomon e and calling out health data.
So it's a coalition of leaders that Jumaane Williams public advocate is really pushing to try to push the DOJ to look at this because they're Lastly, in terms of the week, we know that folks that look like us have been getting police and in ways that other people across the city and other areas have not We know that for social distancing and how we're treated so forth by the police and the Public Advocate has been talking about that for weeks about how do we police at this time and who does it?
I just want to say actually for a second thing for the question, because what I wanted I want Harlem to be clear, Our office has said this The personal research in California There are people that are not public health professionals that are being are going to be hired to be contact.
One way of saying that they're important what we're doing is We are definitely validating the importance of artists by having these little conference calls where hundreds of people are on, and we are also getting the funders to recognize and be a voice for the arts and cultural community Thank.
Lower Manhattan The call really felt like we were coming together as a city to discuss these very important institutions and what gives life to New, York City I just wanted to say thank you for allowing me to say a few words in support of arts and culture and Thank You Athena for being my partner I believe we have one last elected official before we get into our public session.
So if Deborah and Kevin could prepare to do a roll call, but let's first hear from senator Benjamin, hey Brian, first of all, Thank You, Camille or We were just on a call earlier today with shitty Mitchel and a number of folks I see on this call talking about the impact of Kovan 19 on Harlem, and how are we dealing with some of the health disparities around that two quick things that I want to talk about is lot of things.
You know PPE and getting a pass in the back, whereas uptown in communities of color people are getting thrown on the ground trampled sent to send up to jail for an on offense right, I mean at the end of the day if people aren't social distancing, while that is bad, that is not against the law In the process of calling on all my legislators, we're going to go to the mayor and tell them that we do not want the NYPD under any circumstance, enforcing social distancing going forward This is going to become even more of a concern as we close it's this summer.
I'm, Benjamin kind of piggybacking on what you said have a quick question for you here sure we're talking about technology, putting young people on technology This time, people are dying and people in homes My office get so many where there they're asking There are people six, seven, eight folks and two-bedroom apartments, someone's coming back from the from the hospital saying that they're asymptomatic, like Ovid I , mean there's so much trauma and going on in our community.
These, are things that are on our forefront of our minds and when we get on these calls, it's important that there are strong to dues that come out of these calls So. We want to make sure that that's happening and that anyway, the community work can push things forward can be a conduit for that If you see something, definitely say something to the board, if you see an issue, one thing that has been repeatedly brought up to me is the lack of social distancing, and you know Brian Benjamin senator Brian Benjamin mentioned it.
So people can just get it at this point that we need to do what we can to respect ourselves to respect our elders and to respect just life in general Are things that we're thinking about and in a community that has been so hard hit, we're still waiting for those official numbers, so we're asking the politicians to give us the CD 10 numbers we care about those numbers we want to know what's going on, because sometimes people need hard facts to figure out.
On top of that the state has grant granted they've granted immunity from all civil suits on file during the pandemics of there were issues you know that the family had you couldn't even follow a civil suit against the nursing home At. This point I'm, however, the state attorney general's office You know that we're ready back open for business, but the new cases that we're seeing is the most alarming thing and that's actually, the cases are an uptick amongst older people of color and these people, who has been affecting have the ones that have been sitting in their homes, they've been at home and they're still getting sick, So, I'm gonna read you a few statistics, and this is for the state and city The preliminary data submitted by 113 hospitals over the last three days show that most new admissions have mostly been staying home they're, predominantly in New York City, which is at 57% and 18%, are in Long Island and people of color.
They need to actually be inside more because I know that the weather is getting warmer and people are gonna, go be out and about If that means that our grandparents, our parents, our aunties and uncles, are gonna, suffer and die because we don't want to get Lastly I'm, just gonna review, something that I jet, that I dressed in an executive committee meeting and that's the mayor's office.
The second was to launch a massive public awareness campaign and me assistant, Lee We were on that call today with brian benjamin, the bro president's office and other elected officials I'm just to speak about how the ten million dollar funding is going to be allocated and how they're gonna get organizations That's in the community that are already doing the work.
My report later, as the chair of the Housing Committee Let us, please remember that when you're talking about those seniors and others staying at home who are they're staying at home with there are multiple families living in one apartment with you know, with all sorts of people who are going in and out.
That people had to get back to you within like an hour or two Another thing that we need to make sure that our lots of officials and those agencies are giving the community time to respond.
So I want to give them kudos and say thanks very much, but Karen on I will be packed in full swing, beginning at our meeting, only eight to double eveness our meeting date and so I would ask that we support the letter that is going to the governor because there's a lot of good equity and to me at this point the governor and the state commission of hell for that fault, and so we need to call it out again from community board ken on the census.
I have been working until childress members of the committee count to make sure that we come up Thank you, dr Dukes, wonderful job, Health, Committee and I Look We, look forward to hearing more about your letter of support or a letter of concern for the Harlan Center of Nursing and Rehabilitation, which is a voting item for us tonight.
That's kind of like access , You know housing, community board resolutions, yes, Thank, You, Charles, great question all right and just an update, Those housing court located in Harlem is closed, but typically set up to open on may 15th, of course, either subject to any type of extension of the stay at home order.
Now, move on to the vote, I just wanted to be able to say that one I want to thank Christina curry for all of what she continues to do in terms of the support for Americans with Disabilities, but, most importantly, I'd like to hear at some future meeting a report from Christina as to how : 19 has affected You know community of Americans with Disabilities, and so thank you because for everything that you continue to do with our community board and the Harlem community overall, the legacy report next time from Christina It is the resolution for New York, City, Park, Central, Park, Conservancy garden and dairy access path.
Sorry to hear that, and our prayers are with you, Don for our board member of community Morton Just give a short some information about the PPE, all right, From our end, the congressman had worked with the empowerment zone and other organizations to support small businesses in the district We were happy to learn that the home school, the arts did receive our funding from the PPP, which is good news.
Other thing that I want to let people know is that businesses in our district are receiving funding, but because they are closed, they are not really sure what they should do with the funds.
