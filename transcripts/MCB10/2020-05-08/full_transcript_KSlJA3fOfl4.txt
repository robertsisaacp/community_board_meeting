We are looking into that in terms of black and brown people not receiving the aid that it's to them, as opposed to the counterparts. I would send over to you guys fresh release that was released this evening because we wanted to have the call first. I also have some documents to share with you guys a bulletin of how it's supposed to go a link where you guys can actually make up. We have real column and some gloss, but literally Harlem business owners with the life stories reporting today and making formal complaints about and our community. They have great relationships with business relationships with and they could not receive the people so that I think now is a focus point for me, but there are other things going on. That's one of the key ones. Thank you for asking. So can you put that link in the chat? What I can do? I can probably I'm gonna see if I can upload the bulletin cuz it's embedded in the bulletin or send us. You should really works. I'ma, try, okay, so Sicily we were just chatting before you join. You tell us when we really need to get started. Yes, hello! Everyone I, apologize I've been on SSI of having technical difficulties over here, so this is like one computer I've been on today, so I'm just gonna like trying to figure it out right now, but thank you Adrienne for that report. I, hopefully, will hear a little bit more from you in a minute, hopefully that wasn't everything right, Thank, You, Adrienne, okay, I'm glad to hear that you're doing well and I'm glad to see everyone out, especially our new board members. We're giving we're gonna. Give you a special welcome in a second and I apologize that I haven't gotten a second or a chance to reach out to you. We just got your information very recently, so I definitely will be reaching out, as well as the officers of the board and the entire board as well. To welcome you Shattuck. Are we ready to begin? Yes, we can I'm, still I'm still I'm getting people on the line as they're coming in okay, hmm I mean you can begin and I'll just continue to bring people on okay and well follow the agenda. First of all, let me just welcome you again. My name is Cicely Harris I'm, the chair of community board 10. This is our second virtual. We had our April meeting virtually and is our main meeting so welcome. Hopefully this goes just as smoothly we're still all getting used to this new technology that we're required to use at this time. So we want to go ahead and get started. Just a few rules really quickly a way that we can make this a lot smoother. A lot of all of our board. Members should be panelists. So if you are a board member and you're under the attendees, please text me or shattuck, and we will put you in the panelist list. That's how we're gonna be able to see you, that's how we're going to be over the boat. We do have voting items today. So our new board members, if you feel comfortable voting, you can go ahead and do that if you have any questions, definitely feel free to. Let us know raise your hand in the chat as a panelist. You can raise your hand. Attendees can also raise your hand, but you can also use the question-and-answer section or the chat yes, so we will go ahead and put our elected officials and their representatives as panelists, so I'm shocked. If you see anyone, that's coming in that's a much official, so they could go ahead and speak. That would be great to go ahead and put them in as panelists and we will be paying attention to the chat and to the Q&A. So if you have any questions or concerns, definitely put those in there and we will raise those up at the right time. Okay, I will call the meeting to order now and there's six 11:00 p.m. we will start with the regular agenda. I do see a couple of elected officials on here. Hey did you want to go ahead and start this evening? Hello again, everyone I'm so pleased to see so many people well with everything that's going on with this fire. Is such a strong, resilient people and warms my heart to see so many people up and still doing the work of the people so say on that one yeah I was scamming about B and I'm, going to try my best to upload the bulletin that the attorney general's office won't work for Letitia James has put together regarding this whole PPP process, there's been a number just, so you guys know, scam. Artists have been popping up everywhere. You know what I got that loan for you know and people at this time. You know in dire straits to pay their employees to make sure that their staff are actually still gainfully employed of trying to get some money out of desperation. They're, not you know, reading the fine print or not reaching out to our office to see how legitimate these persons are. So we had to get kind of in front of it before it goes out of whack. So I'm really beseeching your assistance and leaders in the community to assist us, and you know making sure that people are over there. I will do my level best to upload this I'm trying now to do it so that you guys have this so and there's a way for them to make sure that they're not being scanned. Additionally, there's also been a disproportionate granting of PPE for Graff black and brown people as opposed to people who are non black and brown like white organizations, some of them who don't who have not been. You know long-standing. This assists but are reaping that and that's something that our office is now looking into with at least a few major banks. But it's not so much that I can say, but I can say that we are looking into this kind of possibly with bank, so I'm gonna do my best also to send over two, maybe two shots. Iike someone cuz I know that I probably can't put a fresh release up in there, but I'm going to do what I can and then everyone who's here. I'm sure you have a running list of email addresses and you can share them with everyone and I know it's a number of other things, but that is key at this moment in an assist of time. That's what I'll share tonight! Thank you, Thank You Adrian. As always, you are a source of great information and thank you for always just being available for the community, especially during this time. Thank you. So much I did see Nina Saxon Nina. Are you available to speak on behalf of comptroller Scott stringer? Okay, we can come back to Nina. I do see Nina, nor would I. Would you like to speak Nina? Yes, hello. Everyone knows me well, I would like to formally introduce myself. I am Nina nowhere. I am the community liaison for New York State, Assembly, Member, Inez Dickens I definitely want to bid a healthy hello to everybody hope everyone's holding up. You know with everything that's going on I know we were all out here doing our best to keep everybody updated and informed of. What's going on in the community, so I have a couple of updates to share. First off the Assemblymember Dickens office is still working diligently with helping our constituents with the ongoing unemployment claims crisis that has plagued a lot of people in this city and especially in this country, working with our constituents to log on to DOL and expedite their application process, hoping that will push for them to get the assistance needed. There are so many out. There definitely have food to buy and bills to pay. So any delays, specially delays lasting three weeks or more, is a tremendous strain on an individual's mental well-being. It's definitely on their financial well-being. So we are working very diligently as far as our office is concerned. To assist in that matter. Also Assemblymember Dickens has been working on getting meals for a night of development as well as senior communities within her district in the seventieth, we've been working very hard on that, as well even buildings that have also been provided meals through other means. We are still working to do what we can from our end, because you know there's no such thing as too much. There are a lot of residents out there that are working with seniors that cannot move around. Can I really come home family to be able to get out and get meals for them? So we want to make sure that everybody is service within our district, and I know there are others out there that doing the same so hats off to everybody. That's out there working hard to make sure families get fed, and then lastly, I just want everyone to know that our office is open kind of reflecting on which miss Adrian Felton said as far as small businesses, the Assemblymember is on calls almost daily dealing with the small business assistance with finances during this crisis, so our office is definitely open. I have my email address. You can reach out to my gmail personnel: that's n, Norwood, n, o r, wo OD to five at gmail.com and I'm, more than happy to translate any messages to the Assemblymember or look into things myself as far as how we can continue to assist small businesses within our district and within our city with getting the financial compensation that they need during this crisis and again we wish everybody are happy. You know from with moving I, don't even know you know we're getting short on words to describe what we're all trying to do at this point in time, but I wish everybody good health and good state of mind going forward. Thank you. Thank you. Nina for that report and again, I would also like to thank the only woman for taking a leave with our small businesses, got some excellent calls and made those available to a plethora of people so I. Thank you for that and I. Thank you for the work that she's doing we've been joined now by our Manhattan borough president, madam Gale Brewer, along with Athena Moore and Natalie, a speedo mountain borough president. Would you like to speak? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, thank you very much for all your work. The community board and your district manager has been everywhere. I know how hard that is, I'm really impressed with him. You are all great as members and the new members are fabulous, but your district manager is even more fabulous because he really does make the effort seven days a week because I'm out there so I see him and I appreciate it. I know that it brings back good information to the community, so we're all working on. So many different fronts like I, said. Congratulations to the new member I know we're all tired of hearing about census, but we're not doing well. I only base my number on Staten Island, because I am determined. The step now is not going to beat us, but there are 53% we're at forty eight point. Three percent and the city is at forty six point one so we're biddie leading the citywide average, which is not great but Staten Island. We gotta beat them I, just wanna, let you know I'm going to be calling every single member of the community boards in the borough, Manhattan just to make sure to say hello. But my next question is: have you filled it out and some people, maybe they've, been away because of health reasons and now they're back, and they think that you know they shouldn't have filled it out or whatever, but fill it out. So I want to congratulate you on your Housing Committee. It was great to participate, we're all trying to figure out in the middle of June. The moratorium goes so then, but the rents going to be due and I heard today on one of my gazillion zooms that I thanks to the Congress member, that the next stimulus hopefully will include residential rent support. We do need it from the federal government. It might also include operating dollars for municipalities and states. I didn't hear anything about commercial rent, so who knows, but just every piece of information I try to pass on. We need money for those who can't pay the rent, we're all working on masks and we were able to give out fifty thousand this week and last week and we focused on the nursing homes, churches, River, Band, Riverton, the Kennedy, Center and, of course, the great street corner resources and the Senegalese Association. We will have more. So let me or Athena know if you need more I've, been on a lot of testing, tracing and treatment discussions today and, of course, we're all trying to figure out what does contact Tracy mean? We need more testing sites. I think our newsletter is the only space where I have both the state and the city. They kind of keep them separate so anyway list the ones that are public as well as, of course, Harlem, Hospital and I. Think, basically, now I believe that there are thirteen or fourteen health or Hospital sites, in addition to the ones that I listed that are available and I do think that anybody can go whether you have symptoms or not, but in Harlem, of course, the Ryan Health Center and the great word that work beside them is doing our phenomenal. The mayor is giving out tons of masks in the parks. I know, I went to one of them last weekend to run to ten to 12 and by 10:45 they were all gone. So if you go anywhere, you got to go earlier. We I just did a contact tracing discussion with the Public Advocate and we're doing one on Tuesday May 12 at 6:30. It's a town hall, you tube with the issue of Public Health and privacy, with Columbia University and Congress Nadler and many others. We've been doing these wonderful forms with Columbia on different topics, but I think people very complicated topic and good to have public discussion, so I hope you'll join us. Now there are a lot of jobs. We have posted them in our newsletter. I think you know that, but it's my impression that there is a State job, email, slash website and then there's a city job listing, so you I would apply for both if people are interested, I think pay little less attention to what you need in terms of academics and does get on I noticed in California they're using AmeriCorps. Of course we want the Summer Youth Employment Program to exist, hey what a great way but to have young people participate as contact. Tracers I can't imagine a better group, so something to think about in terms of young people and I know. Nyc service is also doing some funding so that people can be supportive of delivering essential services like meals and food. Hey Lou Dukes has died great on the issue of nursing homes. I think that her letter is extraordinary. I've seen some pretty awful things in the nursing homes in the last couple of weeks, even though they are caught, they did I have to say they did beg for PPE three weeks ago and we tried to give them what we had. But it was a very sorry situation between the state and the city. The city said it was the state and the state didn't necessarily move quick enough, but everybody's aware of it now, although a lot of people have died, we're all working on the food issue and I think you've already made time say. Thank you to Fresh Direct for three weeks they were contributing their services to the night, show that's where we focus on the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Manhattan. We did King towers, leaving village, Carver, Johnson, Washington and Clinton, but also many other developments in the borough of Manhattan and now to the credit of the mayor. He has picked up so all last week and this week we meet the wonderful people from Fresh Direct with our van and then we take whatever food. We can because they're big packets of food to other developments in the area, Athena and I, along with the amazing boza rivers, have been working on the issue of Uptown Arts. I am focused very laser on this issue, because, first of all, nothing in our city is anything without the Arts and it hasn't got enough attention. So there's only the box office city, money, state money or philanthropy there's no third party reimbursement for the Arts. So we have our third telephone call teleconference on May 15th in the evening, 6:30 anybody's willing to join board. Ted has been terrific, but we need I know that your committee of Arts and Culture is phenomenal and so is board minds. But we just have to figure out a way for these groups to get some funding, and so I pointed out to the city today that if they're going to be funding contact tracers, who could be better than artists to be the ones that understand how to reach peers and people in general, we're very focused on summer youth, but also on just schools in general, because all during the year I said, social worker is needed in the schools and now, of course, a social worker is needed more than ever in every school. Given all of the stress that were under so on, May 15th, which is a Friday at 3:30, we're doing a virtual town hall on the need for social workers, the executive director of the mixed silver Institute and many others are going to be joining us. I. Don't need to tell you the need there, but it is frustrating to me that we're still trying to figure this topic out and I just want to say. Finally, what the great you know what we have to learn from all of this, whether it is the challenges of the digital divide, the challenges of food, the challenges of jobs. I know that, because of the Assembly members put a lot of time in on small business, I did get some good news from the people we've been working with at the Columbia Law School and Business School. That groups I thought they were never going to get through. The process have gotten at least to the desk folks at the Small Business Administration in Washington I, don't know that they have money yet, but they at least feel like they got some help and I'm hoping that works and so and then of course, they're. Just all the construction issues I know that they in his francis houses is an ongoing discussion that sure that teen has been working on. So I also want to say I know: we've lost some people, we lost karen Hori sister. We also lost rosa MacLeish, who was a member of the CEC in district 5 and she died. They had a wonderful memorial service for her, virtually that's one of their meetings, so we lost too many people. You know I know, but not something that we can ever forget. So thank you for all your work and there's a lot more to be done, but we look forward to working with you. Thank you, madam borough. President and I've said it in the last meeting and I'll say it again. If anyone is not subscribed to your digest to your newsletter, they should definitely do that. It is excellent and it is just a quick glance at everything that's going on, so it is something that people need to actually be aware of, and I've been on a lot of calls about important for a president. You have been right there and even on more calls. So thank you for all that you're doing. Thank you for those masks. I know that people appreciated them. We are always looking for more resources. We did have a question and if you could answer it great or if any of the other panelists could answer it, we have a question from one of our constituents about renters and businesses. She is a small homeowner and like many folks, she doesn't have tenants, but the mortgage is still do what can be done for folks in that situation. My understanding is that the lets that mean we'll have to see what's coming out of Washington the that is one possibility, because I believe that mortgage and rent are part of the discussion so other than that the other possibility is Albany and there may I'm sure their Albany legislators. One suggestion has been that the mortgage be paid at the end of your 30 year of 15 year or whatever, and that you not pay during this time period. So all I can save you with either money from Washington or there has to be a change of the law in Albany and I think both are being discussed. Okay, thank you and I'm. Just another question. We were on a call earlier today where we were discussing testing sites, the availability of testing sites. Do you know, or can we have Tucson raise the question whether we'll be testing sites, more testing sites above 125th for folks that live uptown that came up earlier with senator brian, benjamin, yes and I, think you know the same discussion I think it definitely should be taking place. There were some suggestions that were made and I think people are focused on it, whether it's more hours and approached his Harlem Hospital they're, so swamped they tend to work internally. So how could they use a site? That's maybe not exactly on the hospital but one of their nearby sites to be a more of a site for the community. As an example, so that's what came up and I know I mean we need. We need others, so I think that's gonna happen. Thank you. Thank you for that, and you know we have dr. Dukes and our wonderful health committee and dr. shell Smith and everyone involved, so whatever you would need from us to make that happen, and we are here to help you with that. Thank you, Athena did you want to say a few words or Natalie? Thank you. So much Cicely, the borough president really has said it all this time. We just want to continue to extend ourselves to the board and to thank again you and Shoetique, and all of your committee chairs, and welcome to new board members we're just here in support of you and whatever you want to continue to be safe. Thank, You, Athena I know that it's a topic now and because the increase and the stress that everyone is under, we were talking about domestic violence. It has increased Thank, You Stephanie from warm for bringing that up. Are there any initiatives that any of the elected officials want to bring up tonight? Talk about or solutions or hotlines, or anything like that, oh yeah I mean I, think that the I'm not only worried about domestic violence, but the teachers point out that young people, their numbers in terms of any kind of abuse, are way down, and you know better being in an office that deals with this. That's not a good thing either. So I think all we've been able to do to be honest with you is to publicize and every newsletter how people can access the hotlines but I'm equally worried about kids, which of course could come under the mess. The violence, but usually the numbers are much higher to the hotline. So god knows what some of these homes I don't know what to do about it honestly, except for keep letting people know that they are secure and contacting the hotline and any other aspect of their trusted. We are on what is going on in each building to do well, checks, one family's like going door-to-door with families to make sure that families and children Thank You Mari, for that update. Thank you for that. I do believe. Nina Saxon is on Nina. Did you want to speak on behalf of controller Scott stringer? It's evening, everybody I hope everybody is okay, Karen, I'm, so sorry and welcome to the new on board members. That's on this week the controller announced his preliminary answers to the luminary budget and I'm just going to highlight one thing that I think is very significant. That speaks a lot of volumes, and that is that the controller during his report come announce that, because of Kovac, it's gonna be over 900,000 unemployment. So I just want you two to know that that's like a really serious and what I'm gonna do is make sure that I send the actual budget to the district manager. So everyone can look at the overall his analysis of what the city budget is and how it reflects us. Also, as you know, that our office is also doing a phone banking, we have over 2.5 million dollars into Welling wages that we want to give back to all New Yorkers throughout the city. Even though Manhattan doesn't have a lot, we have over 67 I think people, but we don't know where that 67. It I can't tell you that on a personal level, but so do you think that you deserve money that from a prevailing wage job that bet you that you didn't get please file and our office we're doing a phone banking I will also make sure I send that to the district manager to send out to everyone in the community. We also I think the mahan borough president's office has an amazing newsletter that comes out like every day which I look at. We also have a the office. Also has a resource guide which, if you don't have it I, will definitely make sure that shotty gets it. So he can share it to everybody, and we also have an MWBE webinar, which we've been doing and the next one will be on. May the 14th we've been having over 500 people RSVP, and we have it over there over in ten different languages. So, if any, if anybody feel that you want to go to the kemberly webinar to where we are helping mwbes navigate to city contracts and doing the tough time, please do so. I am here for the duration of the meeting. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. Thank you so much Thank You Nina hi. This is Nina from something interiors office. How y'all doing oh great me nice? Why didn't I make a comment and again Karen I'm, so sorry to hear about the passing of your sister, but I do want to I wanted to just comment on the fact that there needs to be an increase in testing above 120 countries, so the Assemblyman has made recommendations, especially within our district above 140th or places that should be testing sites. So looking forward to that, you know being on the way and then also our office has been also making warmest falls. Also home. Go to your point, merit sorry about domestic violence, and just you know, people not having access to resources. So I think it's just important that we push and make sure that we are informing constituents and as well as our neighbors on the 24/7. You know it's a Mista grounds, hotlines that are available in the state that you private it. You can text, you can call you just gotta form online and I can put that information in the chat, but you definitely need to know to make sure that our seniors are okay, our children and those who are you know, domestic abusive partnerships. Thank you mean eyes at all. Yeah! That's all! Thank you. Alright! Thank you for all that you're doing and Assemblyman Taylor. Thank you. So much yes, I do believe. I see Isaiah from Jenkins from the mayor's office. A jus want to say a few words I'm. Sorry tonight can I get my up get a little later. Yes, you can't, we can move on really quickly. I believe is cordell clear on the call district leader Kordell did you want to say a few words Cornell okay, I asked if you'd be brought over. Yes, we promoted her up to pass. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I just want to remind everybody, cuz I, there's a lot of confusion for some people out there on the election coming up on June 23rd. There is an election. There was an election even with, and there was a conversation about the not being a presidential primary. There was a court case which a judge ruled that New York does have to have the presidential primary on the ballot on June 23rd. That could change if it's appealed or anything like that. But I don't want people to think just before. I didn't want people to think there wasn't an election. We have an election anyway and it's just making us harder this whole Cove in nineteen sittel harder for us to get message out to the public and to our neighbors and our friends and our families. So I just want everyone to be mindful. We do have an election on June 23rd. As of right. Now we have an election and everyone is entitled to get an absentee ballot. Those are the application supposed to be getting mailed to every voter, but you don't have to wait for that, and I can put it in the chat Cecily. We can go online and request their own absentee ballot. Make sure you have that application in make sure you have that application in and they will send to you so that you for everybody can vote by absentee ballot. We don't know what the situation will be in Jul 24, your loss and others who are bereaved. This co19 has touched so many families, including mine, and you know we are going to get through it. So I you have my deepest sympathy, everyone who has lost anyone. Thank you. Thank you, Kordell and thank you for reminding us about the election really quickly. I know you're, not elected official but Nicole year. What did you have anything to add about the census? 2020 very quickly, hi Sicily. Thank you so much for allowing me to speak good evening to the board members part of me. There's a little noise outside it's a little busy this evening with traffic and the sirens. Just you know, I, don't want to say she stole my thunder but I'm. The borough president did a little bit and I appreciate her for doing that, for emphasizing the importance of the census for community Boyd's hen just want to give you the numbers. Forty seven point: nine five percent of the community board tracks have responded to the census. That is, as of last night at midnight. We update the numbers on a daily basis. There are two tracks in particular that are still in the 30 percent ranges: those are census, tracks, 200 and since its tracks 2 to 6. Since this tracks, 200 go from 118 to 124 street, from Malcolm X Boulevard to Mount, Morris, Park and Fifth Avenue, so it's basically those tracks around Mount Morris Park on the Lenox Avenue side, and then this census tract number 226, which goes from 130 to 134 Street between Malcolm X, Boulevard and Frederick, Douglass Boulevard, and then there's the census tract that contains bought houses and espen our garden since this tract number 236, and so those three census tracts. My you know, focus in the community boy, ten area to make sure we get those numbers up, the others are in the forty. Some are in the fifties right now. As you know, the Bureau has been impacted by Kovach 19, as has everyone else, so we're not doing any field activities until June. First. That was the last word we received barcode bit. Nineteen updates are regularly posted on our website. We have pushed the date back for response. We've made a request to Congress that we push back the response date to October 31st, but our message is always and will be to respond now online by phone or using the form that was received in the mail by today. Everyone should have received information on all three methods of response, and we are now looking at how we're going to do the non-response follow-up. Given this new environment. But if anyone has any questions, I'll be on the line, I saw a couple of questions come through. I will respond to those in the chat you can visit my 2020 census, dog of so complete your senses. You can call eight four excuse me a floor. Four, three, zero twenty or you can respond using the forum. The questions are simple again: the packet is thick. I've received a lot of feedback regarding the size of the packet I'll. Just quickly say, the packet is thick because there's could be a form inside there could be information on how to call and respond, as well as information of going online to respond, and that can be kind of thick because you can respond in 13 languages and you can respond for up to ten people. But if it's just one single person, the forum is gonna. Take you two minutes. It's not taken. Even for more people. Someone said to me: there's several people in their home. It took less than five minutes, so please don't be deceived by the packet. Please go ahead and open it up and again I'm here for questions. Thank you so much to say, I appreciate it. Thank You Nicole for the update and always keeping a surprise of what's going on with the census and letting us know our numbers, so we'll keep in contact with you. So we'll know where we are those numbers. Thank you Isaiah or, if you're ready. Now, if not, let me know- and we can move on to the next portion. I have a question for Nicole: oh I'm, sorry that Isaiah - his presentation, hi, okay, so I have some updates. It's gonna be super brief. Mask coverings, I think the borough president mentioned this before we are doing on pre mask giveaways at the at Clark locations. Folks, who want more info on where those locations are nyc.gov slash face coverings. You can go there to see where they're gonna be and blend. We are also working on revamping the food program we sent I sent out to CBO's and other partners information on an RFI that the city has issued for CBO's that may have capacity to help with the food delivery program. Not a lot of information has been released yet and as a right now, they're just asking for orgs that are interested. No contracts have been signed yet, but any orgs that are interested. Please do, please do let me know and I can send out information, also other updates today, not today this week we are continuing to open more testing sites. Testing is our number one priority in Harlem we're operating st. Nicolas houses site in ham or in Harlem Hospital. We also opened the Dyckman clinic on Dyckman Street, uptown and I will stop there. If folks have any questions happy to take a few Thank You Isaiah for your update, we will continue to monitor the QA and the chat box to see if there are any questions. But thank you so much for your update, I believe there was a question from Charles regarding the census. Is that correct, Charles, Powell Charles? Your question? Can we connect the census to pee and unemployment applications, so I was I was trying to cut the cut my talking time short, but thank you Charles for the question. We can actually connect to connect the census to unemployment and PPP. One of the things I work with the Harlem complete count Committee on doing is really having a conversation about how the census has an impact across the board. So on you know, and even during this pandemic, you know why we're still focusing on the census, the census data is going to be used to provide funding for all of the resources we're going to need in response and recovery. What does that mean? Unemployment insurance is based on census data. The funding formula for unemployment insurance is based on census, data currently and, of course, with more people applying for unemployment insurance. We're going to need to make sure we have the correct numbers in terms of PPP healthcare, our clinics in our communities, all of those are going to be based on funding to those resources are based on census data. So we need to make sure, even if we weren't before that, we make sure we have a complete and accurate response, particularly in Harlem, because we need the resources. A lot of our food pantries are senior programs, our school lunches. We have grab-and-go lunches, school breakfast and school lunch programs are based on decennial census. Data funding to our schools is going to be based on decennial census data, headstart program funding, also based on decennial census data, Pell grants student loans, Medicaid Medicare, so there's all these resources that impact the health of our communities that are based on decennial census, data on section 8 vouchers, funding for public housing, also based on census data. So, yes, we can connect that and I mean there's a multitude of programs that are directly tied to census, data that we're going to need in response and recovery and separate, and apart from those in general census, data issues in response and recovery to emergencies and disasters, we just actually launched a portal on our website. That's directly talking about kovin recovery response for our businesses and for individuals. Is that answer the question. Thank you to call for that answer and just really quickly. The census can be completed without the code that is sent in the mail. Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. You can use your address. Thank you. Okay, well, I believe we have one last left an official port report from Jacques Granville. Yes, this is Jacques. I want to give an update from the District Attorney's Office I Vance just want to go over a couple things very quickly in terms of the how to reach out to our office for domestic violence. We do have our domestic violence hotline that is still operational, and we also have our counselors that are still providing services on a virtual basis. I'll leave that number in the chat box. Just so folks can have it, but we also urge folks to call 911 if there is an immediate on domestic violence emergency along with that, we also have an email for fraud complaints. So if you are victim or know someone that is a victim of any scams, our fraud related to code in 19 or an experimental drug, we do urge folks to reach out about those concerns. And, lastly, we have a what's app for unauthorized construction or reporting dangerous conditions. Of course folks can still call 3-1-1, but we also have an office what's app number, which I'll also leave in the chat box. That's all the update. I have for now I'm happy to answer any questions. If there are any thank you jack and we I believe just joining us is Phillip Ellison from the New York City public advocate's office. Do you have a quick report? Phillip Sicily I think he's an attendee that needs to be brought over. Did you bring Phillip over hello? Can hear me? Yes, I love! What's going on tonight, I hope everyone is in good health pleasure to be here. Thank you, fatique for calling me and allowing me to be on this call. A couple actually really important base Harlem the Public Advocate is in our office has really been at work in the ways that we can always more work. To do. I would say one just happened, but I work with fatigue and so forth to share this out, but I and I was personally a part of this research for the last bit. We were one of the it's not about being first but I, think Jomon e and calling out health data health despair, calling out police he's also called out the mayor and the governor. We have heard a lot in the media about contact tracing that there needs to be more testing, but there needs to be contacted, tracing right, tracing who has symptoms, been sick, who has symptoms if we live in touch of it, and so there's not a lot of information about what that looks like we probably aim is like Bloomberg and the governor and the mayor throat. You know been out there around there, so what we just did is it went at five o'clock this evening alongside borough president brewer, we co-sponsored and led the event. We had a town hall, a virtual town hall, on contact tracing with a number of people of color who are leaders in the space of Technology, Public, Health and law to really break down what tech, what does contact tracing mean was as well as a doctor? What does it mean for us? What does it mean and from a technology standpoint, you know if they're gonna be doing technology? What does it mean manual, contact tracing with people, and it's likely gonna be a mix of both, and what what's most important for Harlem is thinking about the data management. You know for all of our data for all the folks in public housing, all the poor folks, all the folks in Harlem who's, gonna manage our data or the folks that come in contact with the system. When is it gonna end? We don't want anyone to monetize or sell this data. We don't want anyone to abuse it, and these are the questions that we have to answer. So essentially, my updated part is that Jumaane Williams, the Public Advocate our office sent letters to the mayor and governor last week. It was in The, Daily, News and Friday, and about we had a press conference on Monday and we just had the Town Hall, so I'll make sure Troy that I send out that press release and the town, the Town Hall, the link for everyone on Facebook live to everyone on this board and everyone who's on the list. Sir, second, a big thing today is that the Public Advocate with borough president Adams and a number of other cities, another a number of other elected officials, city councilmen in Austin, Texas Alta Morris Chicago sent a letter to the Department of Justice, saying. If the air has you know, can there be investigative investigations on some of the executive leaders in terms of Mis handling, this public health crisis right? And so it's a coalition of leaders that Jumaane Williams public advocate is really pushing to try to push the DOJ to look at this because they're, the Melfi so many ways. And lastly, in terms of the week, we know that folks, that look like us have been getting police and in ways that other people across the city and other areas have not. We seen it in a Lower, East, Side and we'll see it in Harlem. We know that for social distancing and how we're treated so forth by the police and so domani has the Public Advocate has been talking about that for weeks about how do we police at this time and who does it? Is it public health care workers? So all's to say is that javonni was in the press on Monday talking to our cover leaders, pushing back on how we are policed and who deals with public health crisis? Just so you know the public advocate our office is thinking about the health data, we're thinking about these things. We do not want I'll close out by saying this public advocate's office does not want. We have to ask the right questions. We can't just assume our leaders are in good intention. We need to put it out, then we educate people as well about our data and privacy in our rights. So we do not want folks to use this public health crisis as a way to expand their surveillance state and so I give you all. This updates. I appreciate your time. I make sure I follow up with these announcements, I just made and the video of the town hall, so you can share and learn dr. Shattuck and I also caught her Cordell clear was engaged to this board as well. Was there and sharing information? Thank you. Do you know? Where can people apply for the contact? Tracing jobs? Is that has that been made available? Yet there are certain places. I do know and I put someone posting this and I can follow up and sent and now- and that was a I just want to say actually for a second thing for the question, because what I wanted I want Harlem to be clear. Our office has said this and I've done the personal research in California. There are people that are not public health professionals that are being are going to be hired to be contact tracers. If they're going to contact trace people in our communities in public housing for people undocumented people with different immigrants they need, they should also be coming from those communities and those community-based organizations right. So we have to have that narrative out there push back on that, and so there are some places. I know it's on the fund for public health is the contact tracing different levels of jobs out there? So if you look at the funding for Public Health New York City, they do have some of those jobs, but we're concerned that the barrios the barrier to entry for some of these jobs that could be done by a lawyer or an educator or a different profession as long as they're trained appropriately is there, as you know, it's too high. So we want to push thank you for that, for that update, I, believe that all right, some, our elected officials at this time, we're gonna move on. We do have a special speaker tonight, mr. Rosa rivers, but before we bring him on to answer some questions about arts and culture, about tourism, about economic development or anything that he wants to share because we're open to whatever he has to give us I wanted to just really quickly announce to everyone that we do have nine new board members I know, madam borough, president bought them up and Athena, but we wanted to welcome them. Their names. Just sort of one knows that they should be on I, believe they got the information and should be able to attend today's meeting, but we'd like to welcome Omar arias Kamaria Milford, Africa, Oh, Nadine, Pinkett, Milan, Reid, Ayesha Romani, shot shade on Smith's I apologize if I am pronouncing anyone's name incorrectly, Marcus, Wilson and Terry wisdom. Thank you. So much we're really looking forward to working with you, as I said before, we'll definitely get back to you. The officers and I about training and hopefully we'll be able to put together. There may be a big zoom call, so everyone can welcome you, okay, so we're going to move on in our agenda. We do have a presentation today by mr. Rosen rivers of the Harlem Arts Alliance. You know everyone is familiar. Mister with mr. Williams, a Harlem resident, longtime, Harlem resident Harlem, Arts Alliance new heritage, theater greens, producer artist, sits on the grade of Harlem chamber, comrades, Harlem League, you name it he's into it. Thank you so much for being here today. Thank you know what I'm introduced. What's really important is in Omaha a resident and I've been a Harlem resident. You know for the past seven decades, and so what is important for me is the work that I do in order and culture and the spotlight or the importance of the artists who have added to the cultural landscape and the cultural history of this community has just been phenomenal and we recognize his world over. What has happened with Kobe 19 challenges is particularly that they funders and the electives look at the larger arts institutions. First and foremost, especially when you mentioned in tourism. You know you think of the Apollo Theater in Harlem or you think, of the larger institutions, but the foundation for arts and culture in our community and of 12. The city has been the artists who are independent, who are the writers and playwrights and directors, and visual artists and choreographers literary writers, etc, who don't get the attention that they need, and so with the Harlem Arts Alliance Oh as a narc service organization, with about 350 members of this community arts and culture practitioners? What we wanted to be able to is to focus a spotlight on the smaller and smaller arts organizations and independent artists Lee, and how we're doing that is that we have partnered with the Bo president's office, Gale, Brewer and Athena. We have reached out to not only community board 10, but community board, 9 and community board 12, because we wanted to create a united front from 96th Street up to Marble Hill that the artists within that footprint. We want to make sure that we are talking in a unified voice so that he elected and the city agencies and funders will really understand the importance of the contributions of the independent artists and so I'm, not able to stress that enough. We've done two zoo arts and culture meetings who are now working on our third and what's most important. Is that how do you demystify what is actually available for individual artists if they, if they don't, have the resources or the desire to think that what is being proposed is for them also when they see that a lot of the attention is given to the Lord, the arts organizations? So again, we are. We are committed to the fact that not only do we do it through our advocacy efforts, but also to engage Columbia University to be a part of our advocacy to City College, also at the table and to revisit the funders within our own community was harmed Development Corporation, who announced that they have now set up an additional pool of dollars for artists. The empowerment zone just announced a few days ago that they now have increased their funding for artists, with a $500,000 fund and I and for those people who live in the Washington Heights in wood section, the New, York Presbyterian has put up dollars and the northern Manhattan Arts Alliance is looking at those artists in that catchment area. So there is much information that needs to be shared. Working also with community board, has really been a pleasure. Thank you, George for your assistance to Athena and I and making sure that we reach out to those artists who are directly impacted and who lived within this catchment area. In addition, we have been now working on getting celebrity artist to do PSAs around Kovac 19 and so that we're very happy with because of WBLS and image broadcasting has agreed to post those and when they post it, they say that it's a courtesy of community board, 10 arts and cultural committee and also the Harlem Arts Alliance. We are now through the chamber getting ready to launch two shows a next Saturday on wher FM one is to wet our called him. An international journalists and griot- that's a herb boy, so her lloyd would launch his half an hour show that the chamber and city college will be producing for a half an hour. Show that will air next week Saturday. In addition, we're taking em Hotel Gary Berg on this journey with us for many years, Imhotep had a program called the GBE experience that was done on the stage of the Apollo Theater, where, before a live audience, he would bring in artists, celebrities, elected officials, activist, etc and engaged the audience with what was a German to our arts and cultural community. We're bringing that show. There will be a one hour, radio program with wher, also on next Saturday, and that will be an hour show so we're trying to get the word out in many platforms about the important work of arts and culture, and we continue to do that and again. Thank you to this board for partnering with the Hall of Arts Alliance and making sure that we cover this district and beyond Thank You. Mr. rivers, for just updating us on everything that you have going on and for supporting the individual artists, because that's really important what can everyday people like me do to support our institutions do to support the artists? What can an everyday person do? Well, first of all, it's important that artists know, but they were important so to recognize that they are making a contribution and they have made contributions. That's one way of saying that they're important what we're doing is. We are definitely validating the importance of artists by having these little conference calls where hundreds of people are on, and we are also getting the funders to recognize and be a voice for the arts and cultural community. We, the everyday person, I mean there are multiple GoFundMe campaigns. Artists are really trying to get their archives. Archival work together so that they can go on to many platforms through the technology. We have partnered with silicon, Harlem and Clayton banks to really talk to artists and to show them how they can take their work and take their artistry to that next level. That is now a new norm which is through the use of technology. So again it's really getting the word out and to be able to work with artists by having these kinds of conversations for them. Thank you thank you and just as a personal note, I was able to join your calls. It was amazing to see the diversity on those calls from uptown Midtown, lower Manhattan. The call really felt like we were coming together as a city to discuss these very important institutions and what gives life to New York City. So thank you so much for all that you're doing I don't know if anyone has calls questions for you is there anything else that you would like to share with us at this time. No I think you have an impressive list of others who are really waiting to also add their voice and I know that I'm on another conference call at the same time, I just wanted to say thank you for allowing me to say a few words in support of arts and culture and Thank You Athena for being my partner. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. I believe we have one last elected official before we get into our public session, so if Deborah and Kevin could prepare to do a roll call, but let's first hear from I believe Brian Benjamin is on the line: senator Benjamin, hey, Brian, first of all, Thank You Camille or ten Thank You Sicily. We were just on a call earlier today with shitty Mitchel and a number of folks I see on this call talking about the impact of Kovan 19 on Harlem, and how are we dealing with some of the health disparities around that two quick things that I want to talk about is lot of things. I could talk about, but I know. Time is always of an issue here. So I want to focus on two quick things number one as it relates to of this the police activity around social distancing that a lot of us have been seeing across the city. It is a neural, enormous Lee, concerning watching the disparate and not even display a police enforcement. When you can have downtown folks are getting. You know PPE and getting a pass in the back, whereas uptown in communities of color people are getting thrown on the ground trampled sent to send up to jail for an on offense right, I mean at the end of the day if people aren't social distancing, while that is bad, that is not against the law. I'm, not I'm, not trying to say. We clearly need to make sure that we are social distancing, but how we respond to that is the issue and so I'm in the process of calling on all my legislators, we're going to go to the mayor and tell them that we do not want the NYPD under any circumstance, enforcing social distancing going forward. If you look at the fact that it's going to get hotter, this is going to become even more of a concern as we close it's this summer. I do not want to feel like every day I'm watching, another aragón of video, and so we are going to go to the mayor I'm, calling on all of my electives and working on this right now to say, come up with a new strategy. In my opinion, there should be community based trusted groups that are part of a process with the city, where they're getting compensated from the city, we're spending on a lot of things. We could spend money on some more community groups going out there and giving public education telling people about social distancing doing in a way with it where it is respectful of our community and not a situation where I got a watch, one sort of approach in Chelsea and a whole other approach in Harlem, so I'm focused on that I will have a report to you, but this is serious business. We are not going to create a situation and oh by the way these folks getting arrested, are not being put in jail and where we have Covid-19 19 issues over as well, right and so and to spend the police officers who are arresting them, aren't even using PPE and face masks. I mean it's just the amount of hypocrisy with all this is so ridiculous and so I'm focused very clearly on that. Secondly, on the Summer Youth Employment Program, we cannot going back to the first issue. We cannot have a situation where we don't have employment for our summer youth, but in communities where folks need that income to help pay their bills and get very useful life skills and job skills. Given the scale of the city budget. This is this is not even close to a real number, so the fact that we would even look to cut this is ridiculous, and so I'm working with a number of folks to try to get that restored. I can talk about a bunch of the things, but I don't want to take up more of your time, because there's so much going on, but I really wanted to talk about those two things. The police should not be enforcing social dis ting in our community, and we need to get that Summer Youth, Employment, Program back in these kids could be on soon, for I mean whatever we could put kids on zoom' there's a lot of things we can have them doing the same way. My office is working and some of your officers are working are our summer. Youth can be doing that too. We don't know how long we'll be in this crisis, and so we need to have our next generation trained to work in this environment and we should be not cutting some of you jobs at this time. So those are two things I wanted to bring up to you, madam chair and I'm Benjamin kind of piggybacking on what you said have a quick question for you here sure we're talking about technology, putting young people on technology. Do you have any comment or opinion about the disparate treatment of parents who are having ACS cases brought against them because their students are not logging in, although they don't even have the technology in do so, I mean that I have a very strong opinion on that and, quite frankly, it's not the logging in issue see. This is my point. This gets back to the uneven dish. You know how we unevenly handle certain issues. There are kids and wealthy communities of whose parents, having hard times with logging in also well. How do you pick and choose who to handle a certain kind of way, and so no I firmly believe that we should be providing the resources to our communities to make sure that kids get online and if they can't, because of a variety of issues, we've got to use the compassion. In this time people are dying and people in homes I mean I. My office get so many where there they're asking. When is someone gonna come and take a dead body out of our house? There are people, six, seven, eight folks and two-bedroom apartments, someone's coming back from the from the hospital saying that they're asymptomatic, like Ovid I, mean there's so much trauma and going on in our community. We need to have some compassion at this time and to be careful in how we deal with all these issues, so to be to be very clear. I do not think that we shouldn't in any way shape form be treating folks in that way. Thank You senator Benjamin. It was a great call this afternoon, so I know we have a lot of to do's to work on so I'm. Looking forward to continuing to partner with you, your office and everything that you're doing and thank you for everything they're doing on the front lines, thank you. We're gonna move on now to our public session, so we're gonna have our first roll call, but before we go into that, I just asked for everyone to be respectful in the chat online. As we're having these discussions, it is important that we are all able to voice our opinions, but if we can invoice those opinions and very constructive ways that we can ask important questions for our panelists to each other, that will get us to a solution. That's what we want to be about, especially in this time. So as we move forward, let's have a first roll call by secretary Deborah Yates, an assistant secretary, Kevin, Bitterman, and, if I may say really quickly, we for voting purposes. The roll call is very important because we will not be doing a voice roll call at this time, so we will only be doing a general consensus and if there is a disagreement or a nay in that vote, that's when we will do a voice. Person-By-Person roll call, okay, you mean so we're doing a voice role called. Are we doing a consensus vote on voting items? Yes? Okay!

If you have any questions, feel free to unmute yourself at that time, so we're gonna move very quickly into the chair persons report a good thing about me going at this point in the agenda there's so much has already been said by the elected officials. But a couple things I did want to just highlight is that you know we are still here: CB 10 is still operating, even though we're not physically in the office, Shattuck and Juanita have an AR have been and are available to the community to the board members from nine to five the email telephone to answer any questions that you might have, so we are still here. We are still working I want to thank the committees for having their meetings for still being there at that same date. Time in place that we are familiar with, we are trying to make sure that we keep our meetings the same, so we can be a constant in the community. So when we say we're gonna be at our regular board meeting at 6:00. We want to be here for you all at 6:00, so thank you for tuning in and for the board, members being so dedicated to everything that you're doing and Karen who are Ori. I know that a lot of folks have already said this, but from the board and on behalf of me, the parks can be that you so diligently serve. Our prayers are with you, with the loss of your sister. I know that you were going through a lot right now, as we all are, but I want you to know that we are lifting you out that we are thinking about you and your family and for anyone who has lost someone, we are thinking of you and lifting you up in prayer. You've already welcomed our book new board members, so we're excited about you at the same time we're sad about the board members that we lost. We had a really great team, so you're joining a great team, Carlene I believe John Lynch evany Dominique. Thank you for all of your hard work. The past year, past two years in John's case had eight years. Thank you for all that you have done. I love that Carlita's on the call. Thank you so much for still supporting us and for being an awesome resource for us. I hope that we continue that relationship and with all our passport members. We definitely want to make sure that we are still talking and that you are still staying in the loop and supporting our beloved Harlem again. We want to also thank the frontline workers, the health care workers, Harlem Hospital metropolitan, st. Luke's, all of the hospitals, the hospital workers that are out there, the folks that were able to go out and do the standing ovation, the clap, Holland Hospital. It was a beautiful and wonderful thing, something really to behold, something that really echoed our love for our healthcare workers in our frontline workers. So we will continue to support you in any way. We can I've been on several calls, just like everyone here, probably in Harlem in the world. Do these own calls. They are full of great information, some of the things that we want to always focus on our small business, the summer youth program. These are things that are on our forefront of our minds and when we get on these calls, it's important that there are strong to dues that come out of these calls. So we want to make sure that that's happening and that anyway, the community work can push things forward can be a conduit for that. We want to make sure that that's happening. So, if you see something definitely say something to the board, if you see an issue, one thing that has been repeatedly brought up to me is the lack of social distancing, and you know Brian Benjamin senator Brian Benjamin mentioned it. We've all talked about it, but we're talking about it. We need to figure out what works and what doesn't work. So people can just get it at this point that we need to do what we can to respect ourselves to respect our elders and to respect just life in general. I know we're talking about it's that fine line between the freedom and your right of enjoyment and what is that right, end of enjoyment when you are affecting someone else's right of enjoyment? So these are these are things that we're thinking about and in a community that has been so hard hit, we're still waiting for those official numbers, so we're asking the politicians to give us the CD 10 numbers we care about those numbers we want to know what's going on, because sometimes people need hard facts to figure out. Hey you've got to do something different. We have to pull back, we have to social distance. We have to wear a mask, so we're looking for those hard numbers of what are our kovat numbers. What is our hospital is hospitalization rate. The whole mantra is now we're on the decline it's getting better, but what does that mean in retrospect to folks that are still passing away and contrasting Coppage? So these are the questions that we as community board members, as these are the questions that we as constituents need to ask and constantly ask our elected officials what is going on? How can we do better and do we have the tools to do that? So those are some things that we just need to remember. I, think that is all I have except I. Do just want to shout out some really great committee meetings that have been happening: the housing meeting and excellent meeting Charles Lisa, so many people were able to join so many questions were able to be answered. We had Madam President on. If you want to continue those conversations. If these things turn into a forum, a necessary higher conversation, we want to make sure that we're able to do that arts and culture. Mr. Rivers already mentioned at beador just doing a phenomenal job, you're going to hear these spots from celebrities on the radio lots of used by Harlem, Arts, Alliance and db10. So we're excited to have that opportunity. The Education Committee, the Health Committee parks all doing such due diligence at this time. So again, thank you. So much I will put my personal email in to the chat. So if you see something say something, Shattuck is always available one either they are always available. So again. Thank you. So much we're going to move on to the district managers report. Thank you for that on sis. For your report, my name is shotsie Mitchell for the new board members I'm, the district manager, Community Board 10 just want to say good evening. Everyone first I like to thank everyone for joining us and I'd, also like to say my thoughts and prayers to our community members, who have either suffered from or lost loved ones. Due to the coronavirus. I know the madam borough, president Gale Brewer she's left the call, but she had some con words to say about me earlier on the call so I D enough. You could take those. You know just my things back to her and let her know that I said thank you and I appreciate her hard work as well. So for those who don't know CB 10 our district made the cover The Daily News this morning and not so much in a good way on the news story. As reported by The, Daily News basically spoke about I'm 20 bodies that were wrapped in black bags that were carried out of the Harlem Center for nursing and rehabilitation located at 30 West 138th Street, and this is a facility, a nursing facility that we've had issues with in the past. According to the state, they reported that only five people had died of kovat 19 at the site. This is the same Center, which is facing a lawsuit for letting a residents body decay for five days in a storage closet in December. So this raises questions like you said, Cicely about the data on deaths and accuracy of the information that we're receiving under the state disclose an additional 1,700 people at nursing homes who are presumed to have died from coronavirus, bringing the total to at least four thousand eight hundred and thirteen people since March first, and that number does not include residents that were transfer to a hospital local hospitals before they died. So that means that the number is much greater than four thousand eight hundred and thirteen. So there has been very little transparency and we don't know the real conditions that I love ones are facing in these nursing centers. On top of that, the state has grant granted they've granted immunity from all civil suits on file during the pandemics of there were issues you know that the family had you couldn't even follow a civil suit against the nursing home. At this point I'm, however, the state attorney general's office. They have launched an investigation into the matter and they have a hotline that you can call to file confidential complaints on that number is eight to three to four nine, eight, four, nine and once I get more information on that. The hotline, as well as the website information, I'll post, that I'm to our Facebook and Instagram and I'll, also send it out on our a blast that leads us to my next point. I know that you made Sicily. You were talking about social distancing, the number of deaths right now it seems to be decreasing slightly. It's not. You know such a major decrease. You know that we're ready back open for business, but the new cases that we're seeing is the most alarming thing and that's actually the cases are an uptick amongst older people of color and these people, who has been affecting have the ones that have been sitting in their homes, they've been at home and they're still getting sick. So I'm gonna read you a few statistics, and this is for the state and city. So the preliminary data submitted by 113 hospitals over the last three days show that most new admissions have mostly been staying home they're, predominantly in New York City, which is at 57% and 18%, are in Long Island and people of color. Most of them are older and non-essential employees. Sixty-Six percent were admitted from their own residences of the New York City hospitalizations. Ninety percent have not been traveling by car service, personal automobile, mass transit or they haven't even been walking around they've, been doing it, they've been doing their work from home and apparently they weren't going out much. So this fact reaffirms the need from precautionary measures for personal safety and public health, including wearing a mass and using hand sanitizer. So these are elderly people who are you know in the house. They haven't gone out, they haven't travel and they're still getting sick, and this is showing the increase, the bomb and the numbers for the for the new Kovach, a patience which leads us to the next point. On enforcement and social distancing guidelines. I know Derek spoke about it, I'm Cicely, you spoke about it and Brian about the way the law enforcement is handling on these instances. You know, according to der mache, he's the Commissioner NYPD. He said that you should look at these on an individual case. They basically stayed in that. You know there's two instances right now: that's being reported of NYPD abuse, but that's not the rule per se. They're saying that you know that that's just here and there they said the one thing: that's constant in the videos that you're seeing is that everyone in the video is not social distancing and then, when I look at the videos, the one constant thing I see is that the people that are being harassed and brutalized are black and brown bodies. So you know we're big to differ with on the Commissioner on that point. But I would also like to say that if you look at the statistics, you know that are happening with that elderly people in there saying that this thing in the house and they're still getting sick. That means our younger people that's on the street. They need to actually be inside more because I know that the weather is getting warmer and people are gonna, go be out and about. But if that means that our grandparents, our parents, our aunties and uncles, are gonna suffer and die because we don't want to get. You know fresh air, that's something that we definitely need to consider. Lastly, I'm just gonna review something that I jet that I dressed in an executive committee meeting and that's the mayor's office, the task force that he created on a racial inclusion and equity. So the first task force will be led by first lady chirlane, chalene McCray and the deputy mayor for strategic policy. Phil Thompson. There will be separate task force focused on reopening each industry and it will be a preliminary report from this task force, which is due on June 1st. So these are four points that the mayor's plans focuses on step. One is keep protecting our public hospitals and he will continue to fund hospitals about bringing testing right to our hard hit communities, as you know, and we have testing centers outside in him as well as Saint Nicholas houses just was advised today. We also have a Matt Ryan health as well as farlan Hospital, so the more sensors that we have the more testing we will have available. The second was to launch a massive public awareness campaign and me assistant Lee. We were on that call today with brian benjamin, the bro president's office and other elected officials. I'm just to speak about how the ten million dollar funding is going to be allocated and how they're gonna get organizations. That's in the community that are already doing the work. Administering the masks is. Excuse me, the masks talking about social distancing, how we can beyond participant in the public awareness campaign, step three is to do grassroots outreach and that's what the premise of this call was about, and, lastly, was to expand phones, a clinician program so for people that are, you know in the house, they may be disabled or elderly they'll be able to call on the phone and have access to a health are professional and, for the sake of time, I think I will just cut mark rapport short at this point. Unless anyone has any other questions. Thank you. Thank you, fatigue, you're doing Oh, Charles I saw your comment. You can go ahead in if you want to so I. Just want to. You know just point out concha T, because this relates to housing and I'll abbreviate. My report later as the chair of the Housing Committee. Let us please remember that when you're talking about those seniors and others staying at home who are they're staying at home with there are multiple families living in one apartment with you know, with all sorts of people who are going in and out so I just wanted to point out that you know, while I appreciate your report, it's kind of ludicrous to talk about senior staying at home in a nicer development when there are three levels of families living in that same development that are going in and out and the exposure. Therefore, it's not like me, I'm 71 years old, so I have the benefit in the Grand Court of being able to stay in and stay pretty protected, but I know that there are families, and you know that too. We talk about this all the time when there are three generations of people living in the same apartment. You know and they're people going in and out so I think those numbers you know in terms of hey they're, seeing your state and home but they're still being exposed, know the exposure is, you know not just related to Kobe 19, but there's food issues there, deliveries of food and things of that sort, so I just want to point out that we have multiple families living together. That statistic, in my opinion, is somewhat skewed by the reality of what we have in terms of our of a housing crisis. You know our community like East, Harlem and Central Harlem and West Harlem and Washington Heights. You know, have forced people to live together under these circumstances, so whether you have a one-year-old asymptomatic, a ten year old asymptomatic, that's living with Grandma, you know, and along the daughters and the children I did when you made that comment. It just said to me that we need to be a little bit more conscious about the realities of how people are living seniors are not living by themselves. You know they are living in multiple. You know scenarios where you know they are being exposed to people in their very households. You know who have to get out and go to work every day and support them. You know so I just wanted to raise that raised. That point. It's just really. You know, in my opinion, the question of the housing crisis that exists today with based on with what you said. I think the point to be made is for that. You said the young people, the generations that are under the seniors, for them to be cognizant and for them the practice social distancing and to do with all that they can do because it's the you know the outdoor elders of the scene, citizens that they're affecting so, if the younger generations could you know when their travels during the day, if they can practice social distance, then wash their hands, and you know do the things they're supposed to do so. The seniors won't have to suffer and die. No, that's true fatigue, because even governors and others who are states are reopening one governor in Georgia, for example, said what you know you want to reopen. But what about when you go home and you're infecting your grandparent and you know and others, because you decided it was safe for you to go out but you're bringing that virus back into the household you know. So all I was really saying. Is that asymptomatic? You know is one thing, but we are dealing with situations and I would love to hear from other board members and others who are living in those kind of situations. You know no one's living alone. Really you know that's a disparate. You know reality. You know that we having multiple generations of people that are living together and they're the potential for infecting and reinfecting it's not about the outside, but they exactly what's happening inside one people's. You know one person's home, Thank You Charles, and that definitely highlights so much of about what's going on, but people's living arrangements and it points squarely to economics, is a key issue and how anybody is able to survive and live with COBIT or just in general. So thank you for that also Adrian. Yes, it is important that with food deliveries, another common way of contracting kovat is not properly wiping things down. So we have to make sure that we are doing that and that people have the materials and the cleaning products available to do those things when they bring those groceries or food deliveries into the house. Thank you for bringing that up. Adrian. We have one more comment from board member Marcus Wilson and then we need to move in to our committee reports. When you move in to our committee reports, please try to stick to the one, the two minutes per speaker: okay, really quickly, Marv they'll comment: hi, Sicily, I'm, not sure if this is better discussed during the parks portion of the meeting, but I know you know everyone expects you know social listening to go outside and you see where people are down. You know downtown and they have open streets available when I went and online I looked it up and there's literally the open streets go from like 89th, treating the jumps to Washington Heights. So there's none and hauling right now, I'm, so I, don't know. If the open streets we can look to for the parks to get something set up, I tried to get something set up for an hour block to have it shut off where people can actually have social distancing outside have an entire block or two blocks where they can. Actually, you know, communicate or you know, Congress I think did you have something on that very briefly? Yes, this past week we want to contact with the mayor's office and they asked the board members for suggestions on open streets and I did take I. Think about five. What members responded and I submitted on those recommendations to the mayor's office, so I have yet to hear back, I'm, pretty sure they're still being considered, but once I hear back, we will definitely know what streets to Harlem will be available. I know Charles recommended on st. Nicholas Avenue between 135th and 125th Street, and someone else recommended between a hundred and tenth and a hundred and twenty fifth Street or - that part. So from what I've seen they're looking to open up blocks that are close or close proximity, parts of parks? Thank you and I know that some of the board members did not see that because it came in really quickly I think shot ikan that people had to get back to you within like an hour or two. They didn't give us any type of lead. Wait with that! That's another thing that we need to make sure that our lots of officials and those agencies are giving the community time to respond. It doesn't count if you give us five seconds and say you sent something and they didn't hear from us, so we just want to make sure that we're able to address that correct shot of what happened. Yes, that is correct. They literally sent me that email, probably about 11, and he said we need responses back by 3:00 p.m. the latest, so yeah. So that's unacceptable. So thank you so much for that. Thanks for that question, Marcus we're gonna move on to the committee report a gamer space sticking to the one to two minutes. Thank you, arts and culture. Do you have anything today not for George, yes, George, what up meet Sycamore, what up George a mutant except the way I was talking to my mom for a second. Could you repeat what you said just asking? If you had anything good to report for arts and culture, oh yeah, I am working on a new PSA on with Anthony Hamilton and I. Don't have an update on what it will say at this point right now, I will circle back so you and give you that information. It should be coming in another about another two weeks and me and I'm Harlem community was painted in Harlem. Honest Alliance is working on it. Thank you so much George for that great energy and we look forward to hearing that pfam out from the PSA. Okay, echo, dev I, don't know if Jennifer is on here. Chanel I, don't believe, is on either Carrie. Now we will go on and go to the next report: education, youth in libraries. We do have a letter. You know a letter of support on the agenda tonight, so I just want to say that if there's anyone out there that has a student or kid or know someone that is still in need of Technology, you can down three one and ask for and I add, and also the mayor decided that I guess that they got such a big donation of iPads, that if you don't attend a district school so that you have a student who is special needs, you can also and iPad. If the child goes to a private school or an international school of anything and they live in the city, they are also now eligible to give an iPad by calling three one. Thank you. Thank you. So much Health and Human Services Thank You Michelle Booker, is not here and, as you know, I've been out on Sydney, but let me say to the health committee members who are there and I heard dong was in there. I did hear Carol Dixon, but they've done and dr. Smith stay done a yeoman's job. Just let me say all the health issues was brought forth by the Health Committee I see begin, so you can be very proud of this committee, even in my absence, I spearheaded so call about what had happened in our center here, the Holland Center from a call from a condition, and so from that dr. Smith and the committee worked on putting the letter together. As you heard borough president I signed the level of courses the chair, but they did the work on that. So I want to give them kudos and say thanks very much, but Karen on I will be packed in full swing, beginning at our meeting, only eight to double eveness our meeting date, and so I would ask that we support the letter that is going to the governor because there's a lot of good equity and to me at this point the governor and the state commission of hell for that fault, and so we need to call it out again from community board ken on the census. I have been working until childress members of the committee count to make sure that we come up. We can't not fail in Harlem I missed out to our Linux terrorist president as Kim to do his work. I will be reaching out to astronaut god, president, you see how we can get in that. Thank you very much. Thank you, dr. Dukes, wonderful job, Health, Committee and I. Look. We look forward to hearing more about your letter of support or a letter of concern for the Harlan Center of Nursing and Rehabilitation, which is a voting item for us tonight. Thank you for that transportation, historic preservation and landmarks. That is my committee. I am the interim chair for that committee. We don't have much to report, but we do have an update on City bikes, which we will be continuing that discussion in our next meeting. So the last report was that City we had two especially controversial sites in CB 10 one was going to be placed in the dorrance Brooks historic area on 138th Street over there by st. Nicholas Park, so that site is no longer under consideration. So we did win that battle yay for that and it is a win and that they were able to move the station. The bike station across the street, where it should have been originally at st. Nicholas Park. So that's where it is the reason why there's number reasons of why? But the main reason was a lack and funding towards that particular location. So they moved it across the street because it was a lot easier or less construction, because in the dorrance books area it has to be done a certain way and without the additional funding they could not do that. So it did move to st. Nicholas Park across the street. There. However, there they are bent on making sure that we have 24 city bike stations in our area, that's above 135th, so the second. The new proposal is at 136 and Frederick Douglas Boulevard on the uptown side of the street. So on that first corner I, think there's like a Malcolm limo company there and inside the block on 136 right there when you're. Turning the corner they're proposing a bike station that will take up parking, it'll take up five spaces, so we are again reiterating our dissatisfaction with that. We everyone knows: that's a Harlem president who has a car who has seen anybody circling the block several times at night morning, whenever Oceanside parking, that parking is a essential thing for us up there and we do not want any spots that invite stations that will take away additional parking. So we are asking for you're going to write another letter. Today we wrote a letter the first time we're writing another letter, just reiterating our displeasure with the new site. The new site was just elected last week. I believe and do T did put a city bike map out last week that went live last week, so we published the link I believe the link is still operational, so you can see all the new plan city bike sites so those sites, although they're new, they didn't give us much time to actually give an opinion. So I've already talked to them. I've put my displeasure on the record. We're definitely going to do a formal letter, the site that was taking parking on 142nd and Adam Clayton Powell, that's still a go for them. That's still a no for us, so I am putting those things in a letter. We will be talking about it at the transportation meeting, but the installation despite Covid-19, despite all these things going on city bike, is moving forward and they plan to start the installation of these bikes early May. So now, basically anybody any city bike stations that are planned near parks, our schools will they'll start in May and then the other bike stations will be probably put in around you. So for more information definitely come to our meeting assistant. This can I. Add one small thing to that, because behind the scenes we did not get a chance to report back to you and should take that we were on the phones with DLT, both Natalie and I, and getting the d'haran site removed. But, more importantly, this whole conversation about coming to you for additional input. They weren't going to do that necessarily and we lost their hand in saying that they could not move forward to do these sites without making sure that you all were on the ground. Saying yes to it and the whole notion about removal of parking spaces versus sites that we think are accessible versus other issues, I need you all, as you said, to continue thinking strategically about that, because one thing that they do is say: well, we can't put it here, so you have to let us put it here, so I know you're being thoughtful, but I just wanted to underscore how important, in the short turnaround that your input is on that. Thank you. Thank you. So we're definitely I did have a conversation. Thank you for that. Athena, for going to bat for us, I did have a conversation with our Rep Jennifer, so I am on the record voicing our displeasure about it, but we are writing a formal letter. So thank you for underscoring that we need to do that. Thank you for that. I also really quickly just want to highlight the funding for this city bike. I. Believe it's through lyft. Is that correct the funding for a city bike? So it's not totally out of city funds. It is through lyft. That's one of the important the reasons why the money has to be spent why they have to start making moves on putting these city bikes in, because, if end-of-the-year funding and that money has to go out or they'll lose the funding for those sites. So that's one of the things they expressed to me. Yes, why juergen sees yes and also they said that they don't have the flexibility, often because of that direct funding attached to it, because we even asked are there ways to rebrand it so that it doesn't look so hideous in the community? And could we take off the name city bike? Could we do other things? Could we make it more cultural and they kept coming back to the fact that this is a funded initiative and the city depends on those revenues, so it is a balance that we have to strike and just really quickly a lot more things too much time, but we are thena and thank you for taking time to even talk about this discussion is if they must put these 24 city bikes up here. What are the funding plans and the membership plans that will make it more accessible for the people that they want to ride these bikes, so I know that they have the $5 program, but you have to have a credit card to be able to take advantage of that $5 a month program. It should be looking at housing, so that also can be a road block to that so I, if possible. You know we will work with you all to talk about how they make it more accessible for everyday folks to be able to take advantage of it. Thank you. Okay. All right, we are going to move on to housing, Charles. Okay, let me meet myself. Thank you. I saw a very good scaffolding. That's existing in front of multiple developments. I live in a Graham, Court and I. Have the Graham court I have the people who were moved from a Phillip Randolph Park? We have the former make Mike a HDFC I'll call it who has scaffolding up and don't mind saying that I also have scaffolding for my beloved to church at FC BC. So, on those three corners it has been unconscionable. So thank you very for mentioning that housing. Real simple, thank you all for, as the borough president indicated for being on a house enjoying land news call Monday before last. There were so many points that we're still actually putting together the Menace of that meeting. It was an incredible meeting with so many different things. The real question you know is, of course you know: do we have any initiatives from all our elected officials I see that michelle booker as joined us? You know from the congress, you know, that's gonna talk about tenant relief, but you can't have tenant relief without landlord relief. You know we have members of our community. I know the president of the 135th Street block Association is on this call and they're talking about private homeowners. We talked about HDFC's, so Athena, with your help with the borough president I, don't know where we are going to ultimately land up, but I know that the Housing Committee is so many different things. I want to things on a Gil I want to thing. You know Lisa downing we've been on calls every day trying to figure out what, when and how we'll be. You know the governor. You know who has issued the executive order about. You know the you know the you know the fact that their non eviction, but you know, there's so much fear with respect that. What's gonna happen when those no moratoriums, you know, run out brothers on the federal side of the state side and it's just an everyday scenario: not-for-profits, affordable housing. You know organizations are struggling, my own personal, portable housing, you know portfolio greater harlem housing, we had a 60% collection in April, we're expecting that'll, probably be around 25 to 30 percent, you know, but yet we don't have any forbearance or anything relating to. You know the fact that we have to pay mortgages. We have to pay taxes and we have pay utilities and all the rest of the things and we have to pay. You know our employees. So it's a it's a work in progress, so I think it's too much to be able to even talk about further and I want to stay within the 2-minute limit and I'll. Stop at that point. Thank, You, Charles I. Believe there's a if you can answer this question. I, don't know you can answer it now or save it for your housing meeting. There's a question: are they going through with the privatization of Harlem River houses? So the question was again just repeat the question again: yeah and everything that you know that's an excellent question and it's something we'll take up pull it out. Next, you know Housing Committee meeting for the person who asked the question, but you know I believe that everything we've been talking about: NYCHA privatization, those private projects you know are proceeding but I'll investigate that a little further Thank, You, Charles and I believe we have one last question: I, don't know about the housing cords, but I know that the criminal courts are not open. There are some judges that are starting to review motions electronically, but it's hard to serve them. You know physically at this point I know some court courts are individually up to that Judge, starting to receive motions and paperwork a child. Do you know about the housing courts? Yes, so we know that from what we're you know and I read the actually, you know have the connections with judge tingling who own our weekly calls. Athena I know you on some of those calls with judge, tingling and others, and you know he's a County Clerk and also you know somebody who's leading us. So they are limited. You know housing applications. What we are Serna Bell, you know is the kind of you know usual ways and which people are talking about. So one of the things that we're addressing is the connection between housing, court and civil courts, because we expect that, depending on where the governor goes and the mayor goes with the you know, the City Council's proposal and I know a thing that you've been working on. This really intentionally belief is that they're gonna try to prevent you know evictions. The City Council is proposing going into 2021, but the civil courts will open and the belief is that you can of course have that dual such situation. You can go to the housing court for an eviction, but you can go to civil court for judgment and we're trying to make sure that we're covering both bases. So our proposals will come out and probably in the next meeting that we want to be able to say that the City Council's proposal is no evictions by the city marshal or sharers. But, most importantly, no you know litigation you know should occur. You know that relates to the underlying contractual scenario. Remember every lease is a contract, so you can go to civil court and sue and get a judgment and that will affect people's long-term credit and ability to remain in their housing or get new housing. So that's kind of like access. Lee, you and I have talked about this. That's the duality of where we're going with future. You know housing, community board resolutions, yes, Thank, You, Charles, great question all right and just an update. Those housing court located in Harlem is closed, but typically set up to open on may 15th, of course, either subject to any type of extension of the stay at home order. But thank you for bringing that up. Okay, let me see, let's go on to land use and then parks and recreation. Can you hear me yes, hi good evening? Everyone I, don't have much to say we had a great meeting, Charles and I the Monday before last, and we're still trying to reach out to various elected officials to see how we can get some support around homeownership owners who are facing foreclosure and also small landlords who have no protection currently and I. Know Athena in her office has been working diligently around the Carthage Marcus Garvey park development and they continue to have meetings weekly, sometimes daily around how to resolve the myriad of issues that continue with that project. Other than that, that's it. Thank you Lisa, Parks and Recreation good evening, everyone. This is Karen ory and I, just like to begin by thanking everyone, madam chair and Madam President and all of the CB 10 family. For all of your kind and thoughtful expressions of condolence and your love is definitely felt I just like to move on with them Parks and Recreation. We had four in-kind capital projects that were presented by Central Park Conservancy they're, asking for a resolution for two of those projects and we'll be voting on that this evening, and we also move forward in developing a subcommittee to address the issue around developed, developing some sort of exhibit in Central Park with respect to the central exonerated five. So we're moving forward with that project and also we had an inspection, but we have an ongoing discussion, respect to the New York City vision. 2020. Thank you. Thank you. Karen you're welcome, Public Safety I know. Charles said he might be on the phone Charles Johnson, okay, I'm, sorry to mention that we have rescheduled the meeting to Monday May 26th for the next Parks and Recreation Committee meeting. Thank you. Karen. We'll definitely update the calendar to reflect that. Thank you. If Charles joins later, he can get this publicly at safety committee report just really quickly. Just monitoring the chat for any organizations or groups of folks or just anyone who is interested in offering a service to the community, and talking about that, please go to that. Your interest. Their committee meeting I, see there's someone here to talk about mental health. Thank you for that, and thank you for offering their services. We do have a Health and Human Services Committee, so that will be the third Monday of the month. So please feel free to join that meeting. The chair is dr., hazel Dukes, and she will definitely give you any the foramen in the space to talk if the agenda allows. Thank you so much for that. Also if he could put his information in the chat so that you will be able to email him if you need some additional information on hooking up with a committee that you're interested in and we're gonna move on to the presentation of voting items really quickly. There is a question for you Lisa. If you can't answer it's a land use question the Carthage project needs to go through a you'll herb if it's going to be build outside of a contract. How is this not happening? Is that something that we can address now or we should talk about it in our land use meeting, which is the usually the third Thursday yeah? It's something that can you hear me? Yes, it's something that Julius and I talk about all the time when the planning Commissioner came to our meeting a year ago. He said it did not require a you alert project process due to past history. You know this project was an Abyssinian development project prior, so all the paperwork for that project had already been done and that it wasn't required. If Julius would like to write a letter to the deplaning Department authorized by community 410 to further probe, he can do so, but they're in the process of demolition, so I think it may be too late. Thank you, Lisa. There's any additional questions about that. I believe we can follow up in our land use meeting. Yes, thank you and you see from miss Seabrook a question about a resolution for their sidewalk I do understand. There has been quite a few meetings about that, so miss Seabrook I will contact you and she will contact you about how we follow up about that. But thank you. Cicely can I comment on that. One. The Housing Committee we've heard from I guess: koban 19 is just really kind of a messy borough kind of abbreviated to process I wish we could have done it sooner, but housing is looking to do a resolution and support 130 fishery block association is requesting. We've asked the EDC Economic Development Corporation to weigh in and talk to do, T. We just haven't done the resolution yet so we're a little behind from the Housing Committee, but we're gonna have a very comprehensive resolution. You know for the board to consider for next month, Thank You, Charles and also the next meeting is going to be a joint land use, Housing Committee and that's going to be on 21st at 6:30. Definitely up that update, that's and reflect the accountant to reflect that. Thank you. So, moving on to presentation of voting items, education use in libraries, we have a letter of support, Summer Youth, Employment Program. Let me just say that this letter, we appreciate all the hard work that has gone into it and Deborah. Are you ready to present it? Yes, thank you, I. Thank you. Cicely I'd like to start by thanking us, Stephanie Palmer for all of her work on this letter, so that we had a great item to present and all the rest of the committee who helped make suggestions to make this letter the great letter that it is and the way that this came about is after Van Amburg. President Gale Brewer had that wonderful forum. On the summer youth program, we had a committee meeting and we just felt that this was such an important issue, and that would affect so many youth in our community that we needed to add our voice to the people. Who were saying that this is something that must happen in some way, shape or form this summer, and so I think that the committee has done a great job in presenting an item that will represent the community board well and if anybody has, of course, and I hope that you guys will support it. And if you have any questions, let me know: does anyone have any questions, I believe all the board members should have received a copy of all these letters in your email? Okay, thank you. So much Deborah health and human services letter support Harlem Center for nursing and rehabilitation. Michelle are you on dr. Smith I called Michelle Booker like 10 o'clock in the morning with my outrage and of course she had the meeting presided over the beating and dr. board number Dixon along with Michelle, did an excellent job, so kudos for Tara know me but started a show community bullet in there again raising issues. As you know, madam chair I, guess now about go and people saying company. Thank you, dr. Dukes Michelle did you have anything to add to the letter or conversation about the letter again. I just would like to thank everyone on the Health and Human Services Committee, as well as she TKE for drafting the letter and pulling all of our ideas together. I do just want to let every know that this is extraordinarily imperative, that this Harlan Center for nursing really has an investigation by the AG, and you know, in with protocols coming down from the governor's office. Even today in the news there was report I, you know that there were over 20 bodies being removed from the center. You know- and this is beyond what happened in December with the woman's mother and it's just a chronic problem with this facility and all lives matter, including lives in nursing homes, and so we just really need to just push and make sure that this, regardless, whether it's a pandemic or not, that every life matters and lives are treated with dignity upon being deceased. Thank you for your time. Thank you for that Michelle and dr. Dukes. Does anyone have any questions? Okay, it's horrible and already disease. Now we're hearing twenty body. This is Adrian. I actually put article in the chat, for those who are, you know, didn't get an opportunity to read some things that are happening, so that was the article about the nursing home, and it is really unfortunate that this is happening and a letter from you God's, a collective letter you know would be you know really great on it's writing in our district I, don't know I'm just saying I. Think one of the things I wanted to add madam chair Sicily, is that when this issue was first being discussed, that one of the ways that we could be a support and Madame hazel Dukes is to identify the sort of regulations and the oversight bodies for nursing homes. Most are not always aware that it's a state level issue in terms of the Department of Health and others that regulate these facilities, so our advocacy has to continue at that level. In addition, we all have recommitted ourselves to monitoring and given oversight and the simple thing of providing Pease which we've been on the ground. I think you've already heard us report on having done that, but I think. Ultimately, this is a trend. That's happening around the country, it's not just limited to New York or to Harlem, and so I think we can also garner additional strength working in coalition, which we are, and this is the beginning of that- and you have the electeds Brian Gail Inez SPI. All of us were on previous calls and now, with the addition of the AG's office, there's nothing. We can't do. Finally, just that we also did a press conference in front of Isabela nursing home, which was another one that had identified lots of bodies and things were set, but one of the things that one of my colleagues also shared and Natalie and I talked about. This is finding the balance where outraged here in Harlem about these kinds of atrocities, especially when they're not being transparent about the data. But we also know the balance in it is that there are still lots of essential workers in these facilities that are still feeling fear and like their lives, are at stake and not safe and then putting their lives on the line every day to come to try to help. So at the same time and they're black and brown people right, and so we have to find the balance between advocacy and closing down places that need to be closed down and, at the same time making sure that those black and brown people, who are the workers that they are not vilified either and the people who are running these centers like allure and others that they be held accountable, that they be held accountable. So we should just make sure our advocacy is just that crystal clear, so she's very familiar with that, I was chair for Stephen Curry. We found that so we've got to get back and do our due diligence higher I agree. You hold highly that the efficacy that we have in using only facility, oh right after we've, got very much involved with it. They hired an african-american woman who came to flower boo. Is there a minute? Oh now, that we told her our concerns and everything. So we got to go back and do our due diligence as Charles Tyler said so many things, and you notice that the I'm gonna call all day long bugging everybody, but there's so much happening right now when we got to do our priority and I'm going to be bringing that before the Health Committee I was for our time what we need to do and we do absolutely Errol Smith I was actually gonna get to just that point. I think that we need to be clear in our advocacy and targeted and strategic in our advocacy, because, just like dr. Fuchs said, the majority of people in those facilities are black and brown people and are really employed, and we want to force the administration to do the right thing. In addition to that, we need facilities in our neighborhood. So it's not about the fact that we don't want the facilities we want to force, people that come and provide services in our community. Do it in the right way and to have an understanding that we are watching and that we want them to have high standards, not just basic standards that we want. High standards so I think that's really important for us to be able to hold the administrators feet to the fire on all levels: clinical levels, administrative levels- it is critical, thank you, Thank, You, panelists, and everyone on the call. These are all good points. Christina curry did have a comment she says. As of now, nursing homes are not allowing independent living centers into their facilities, citing Covid-19 19. We are relying on relatives to tell us what is going on so and I. Believe Christine's, just like dr. Dukes, has said: try to get access to the center prior to Kovac 19 and what's the night access at that time. So it is an ongoing situation where it seems like. We definitely need more oversight and an investigation into it. We used to have a that reduce mentioned CB 10 used to have a nursing home committee which I did serve on, but it had to be disbanded once it was sold to allure. So we no longer have that access either. So that is definitely a conversation that we need to have to have, and hopefully this letter, this joint letter a little supportive Manhattan borough president, the Attorney General will be able to move forward and figure out what is going on in this facility, where you can file a confidential complaint against the nursing homes I'm going to put it in the chat now move on to the vote. Oh no go ahead and go ahead and move on I just wanted to be able to say that one I want to thank Christina curry for all of what she continues to do in terms of the support for Americans with Disabilities, but, most importantly, I'd like to hear at some future meeting a report from Christina as to how : 19 has affected our you know very cherished. You know community of Americans with Disabilities, and so thank you because for everything that you continue to do with our community board and the Harlem community overall, the legacy report next time from Christina. Thank you. We have one less voting item to cover. It is the resolution for New York, City, Park, Central, Park, Conservancy garden and dairy access path, renovation projects we did presented at the executive committee where it did pass. There are just two projects that are addressing this as CB 10 does border Central Park, along with those other community boards. We do have to vote on any changes done inside the park. The first change is a conservatory garden, that's located at one between 104 and 106 Street west of Fifth Avenue, and then the dairy project, which is it's been characterized as a Victorian garden, and it's at 65th Street answers as a general visitor center and provides public information for the designs of Central Park. Both of those two projects involve making it more accessible, including just some fatigue that has been put on those facilities. Some of these sites are is old as from 1895 and they just needed to be upgraded. Are there any questions on these on this resolution, these two projects being the conservatory garden and the dairy hearing? None. We will move on to our business session. So if Deborah came prepared to do a second roll call for both being that I, don't if there's any controversy once this second roll call has been done, everyone will say if their president will move into voting. That will also be done by common consent. If there is a disagreement or an a please just make that known. Okay and I meet yourselves, okay, so we're gonna start the second roll call.

Deborah chief teller, should be mocked as excused because he's currently deployed on assignment I just received the email on to that effect. I know I know previously, but I just remember so picking more commands excuse for this meeting no problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So much for that update Shoetique and everyone for passing the letters just a little side note on the Summer Youth Employment Program letter. That is one letter that we are seeing sending as from CB 10. But all the community board chairs have decided to send a separate letter that we all will sign as a shot, a sign of unity that is affecting not just CB 10 but all of Manhattan and the other boroughs. So thank you for your support on that letter, any old business so making sure that we're able to facilitate, especially when it comes to resources that are going to help businesses recover after nineteen that can I just add that the Upper Manhattan empowerment zone, the see four million dollars for PPP and is struggling to find viable businesses who qualify. So if you guys know qualified businesses who are in need or nonprofit organizations, please reach out to them. Thank you, Lisa! Do you have any contact information for them that you want to put into the chat, or should they just come? Should interested businesses come to the land, use meetings, okay, Lisa we'll be sure to follow up with you to be oh I'm, sorry, you can email me or you can go to Yuma's website and I'm sure they have a info at Yuma's, org, email address and they're checking it regularly. Thank you. Thank you. Lisa and Mari I'm, just really one quick announcement that was put into the chat from a former board member Don Jones from a board member of Manhattan Community, Board, ten, so sorry to hear that your second cousin, Danny towns, 93 of years of age, went home to be with the Lord early Sunday morning and lived in Linux Terrace for over 50 years. So sorry to hear that and our prayers are with you Don for our board member of community Morton. At this time, are there any announcements? Hearing them I will entertain a motion to adjourn hello. Yes, I heard my hero, I wants to just I, wanted to I. Just give a short some information about the PPE all right. Thank you. So from our end, the congressman had worked with the empowerment zone and other organizations to support small businesses in the district. So we were happy to learn that the home school, the arts did receive our funding from the PPP, which is good news. We don't know how much, but that they did receive. The other thing that I want to let people know is that businesses in our district are receiving funding, but because they are closed, they are not really sure what they should do with the funds. So I welcome those businesses that have these types of questions to reach out to the congressman's office, so that we can help do a deep dive on what steps they should take, because now people are getting the money, but the businesses are closed, and so they don't want. They want the loan to turn into a grant and the way to do that is to have 75 percent of employees or staff receiving support from those funds. So we're trying to figure out how we can support in that manner. Yep, hello, yes, sorry I was actually going to say: Columbia University SBDC, the Small Business Development Center is actually giving counseling to small businesses and we thought to what they should do if their businesses are closed but and they are not able to hire back their staff, but one to have that funding turned into a grant. So I would advise small business owners to contact the SBDC at Columbia University that serves our community. Thank you. So much personally, we have to our members attendees in the chat who had their hand, raised I'm, Debra, Cochran and Julius tragedy really quickly have an announcement from board member Marcus will s'en I just wanted to let everyone know, I, know everyone's cleaning, their homes and everything and looking for places to donate goods, goodwill value and they're still accepting donations. So you just have to email. The email addresses donations department at Goodwill, NY, NJ, org and they'll. Send you prepaid donation bags that you can just dose into you and they'll? Actually, you can just put it in to the UPS or on your post office to send back to them Thank You Marcus. We will here in these last two quick announcements from Deborah Cochran. You know.
