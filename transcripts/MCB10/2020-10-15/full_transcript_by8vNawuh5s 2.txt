You hey miss Ari. Can you hear me okay? So I signed the closed captioner you're on you're on mute. Sorry about that all right, no problem, okay and then I'll have the power to make the presenters the holsters wait. First, I'm going to I'm going to make you the co- host. First. Before I make you the call. Okay, I have to set up the facebook. Okay, all right wait, one! Second, I'm Miss Ori in the in the participants list you have when people come in, you have to admit them into the room. Okay, they'll show up on the participants. So when you follow me on screen, you just hit participants and it'll pop up and you'll, see what's popping in okay, all right, so facebook live is ready, I'm going to start it now. Okay, oh Maria's, here hi Marie, Hi, Karen, hi good. To see you good to see you too so we'll just we'll start at 6 30.. So I'll have to make you a co- host marie. So you can do that mission. Okay, just waiting for shatik to get us set up finish getting this okay, Miss Ari! So you are the host and Miss Wash is the co- host okay and then I do not know if Miss Lasorte has anything to present otherwise we'll that'll, be we just it's just for Miss Wash, all right, no problem! So I'll see you later. Okay, all right! Thank you! So much shetty, no problem. Okay, shatik before you go, I have a question. This is the captioner yep. Is this going to be the new start time for the meetings? No, we start at 6, 30.. Okay, my agency has a start time of three o'clock, so I just wanted to make sure that this is 6:30 will be the new start time going. But it's all our meetings are always 6:30 unless it's our General board meeting which meets at 6.. So there must be an issue with someone that communicated that to you yeah. I think so. Now meetings are always in the evening, so I can send an email to make sure that you get the correct information. That would be great yeah if you would not mind because the start time I had for this meeting and last night's meeting was six o'clock. Your time, oh you had it at six o'clock. Yes, sir, that's correct and I'm in California, so it's actually three o'clock my time. Oh okay, that's why you said it: okay, cool I'll, get that fixed up for you. I appreciate that Sir. Thank you very much. Let's see who we have on so how have things been? Marie they've been okay, yeah trying to enjoy the weather a little bit and get out and yeah getting out into the park. I go to the office once a week, so I get out into the park yeah. You do not have to go in every day yeah most of my colleagues do but or more or less, but my work, because it's a little more research and you know writing and stuff it's not as necessary, but I kind of wish I had to go more just because you know it's getting a little lonely, all the working from home. I mean it's okay, whatever I feel lucky that I can do it, but you know, I think, the sort of lack of connection with colleagues in person. I think, oh I miss it. You know and no it takes its toll. It really does yeah with family now, but I was for nine weeks and it was just too much yeah. No it's hard. I mean I, you know I feel, like things are going still pretty well in the city. I'm you know fingers crossed that once it gets colder, they stay that way, I'm a little worried, but I feel like we've done pretty well, so I'm really hoping we can kind of stay the course. Yes, we have to continue to take precautions. Exactly so literally we'll see, I think John Reddick should be coming. Is he do you see him? Are you seeing other people who need to be let in maybe I'll text him? No, not yet? Okay. So I'm going to text her, it's still about two minutes. I know Lane said that she had another engagement, so she was not sure if she'd be able to come on yeah- and I think with me and John- it seems like that would be pretty good. So do you want to wait for John yeah I'd like to he was we did. I did email him, the we were communicated just recently, so he should be there because, since it's recorded, we could technically start on time. I mean whatever you'd like to do. So. How are people participating? Are they people are more looking at it live on Facebook. Do you think, or I'm not sure we get maybe 30 people virtual meetings, so I'm not sure okay, but it's also. It should also be on youtube. Oh here comes someone and welcome Javier, our captioner. Thank you ma'am happy to be here. Hi Karen. Can you hear me hello? Yes, hi Marie, oh hi John. We can hear you. Okay, oh, is this John? Oh yeah, I met Karen, it says Karen, yes, okay, you're John! I am okay. How are you John? I'm very good to see you good to see you too, so we're arranging for a meeting for the statement of objectives and goals. I hope to see you next week, which day is that next week we do not know yet Isaiah is going to set up the meeting Isaiah jenkins, so we're excited she did a lot of hard work. So if you would like to start okay, so I will it seems like I can share my screen because I'm a co- host, so I'm going to try to do that. Oh you. Can you can yeah? Let me try, it seems like I can good. Can you guys see this there? It is okay, awesome! You can see it okay, so I'm going to start, if you guys are if you're, good Karen, yes, okay, hello, everybody I'm pleased to be here to give an update on seneca village, and I'm here with my colleague, John Reddick, who has been working with us on various projects, including seneca village. He helped with the sign this interpretive signage project and he's actually going to be coming on board to work for the conservancy. Is the director of community engagement projects so we're really excited and to have him help us kind of kind of further a bunch of projects, but also the seneca village project. So we were here, I think about two months ago with an update, and you know we're wanting to kind of come. Do these updates regularly and what we've been working on recently is outreach about seneca village, about all the resources we've developed and are continuing to develop. So, as you know, we have the interpretive signage project that is in the park the series of signs that you can navigate in the park itself and we're thinking about promoting this now in a way as sort of an alternative to kind of zoom learning. You know for those who can get to the park and we're. You know aware that not everybody can. It seems like this is a good way to be outside and learn history and to think about history of seneca village in the park, and you know we know that there's just a lot of people at home with their kids wanting stuff to do, and so we want to promote this anew as an option for going out and enjoying the park, but also exploring history. But again we know not, everyone can get to the park and that's why we really worked hard over the summer and we put a lot of the content around seneca village on this app, which has been pretty popular. I do not have the data for September, but in August it got 350 uses and we're continuing to promote this as well. The other thing we've been working on, as you know, plenty of cultural institutions have been on virtual programs. These are some that do not relate to seneca village, but these are a bunch of virtual tours. We've been doing, and what we've been working on for seneca village, specifically, is a virtual field trip that is going to be shared with teachers throughout the city, but you know focusing on ones that we've worked with before that surround the park at schools that surround the park, and so we're just launching that I think today. Actually, we sent a communication out to a bunch of teachers and what we're going to do is with John's help and hopefully with your help as well, really try to make sure we're reaching schools in Harlem and teachers in Harlem and East Harlem, and you know again other schools surrounding the park, and you know beyond that. What we're also gearing up for is thinking about some new programs that we were thinking. We would try to launch in February for black history month, but you know essentially, next winter, 2021. and really again. The goal of all of this stuff is really to kind of build a base of community around seneca village really get everyone to start, exploring the history and really create you know, excitement I mean there's already a lot of excitement around this history and a lot of interest, and we want to really build a community around seneca village that we can engage moving forward and thinking about commemoration. So so that's stuff we're working on. I think the question for you Karen and for CB10, is you know? How can you help us spread? The word about the stuff we're doing now with the virtual field. Trips, specifically, you know we're happy to put together information about it. If that's something we can kind of host, I know you guys send out like a monthly or even bi-, weekly mailing list of information, but whatever you think might be a good way to reach. People we'd be happy to discuss that further with you. If I could just step in for a moment, one of the things that that's going out, it looks like curriculum for using seneca village from fourth to twelfth grade, and so teachers, or you know, some kids are working from home. Some of the kids are coming to school and we feel like this is like a base of information that teachers can draw from and tell kids that are in the neighborhood on a Saturday or Sunday. If your parents want to take you over to the park or you can pick times where you feel safer, if you're people in the park to actually look at a physical place, there'll also be information. You know lesson- based kinds of information online that they can access as well, and so it's really important for us to try to really reach out to teachers. I know there's like black teachers who care there's lots of different groups, we're particularly interested in this material, so we're really looking to the community Board to help us really make sure we touch every base. You know for education around this, oh yes, we will definitely do whatever. We can john to support this yeah, so I can follow up with you Karen in an email and hopefully we can kind of work on a kind of mailing list of sorts, oh okay and then so. The other thing that we've been working on is really in a very preliminary way, to think about a process and a framework for permanent commemoration. As that's always been our goal, the signage exhibit is temporary. We got it extended for another year, but we're really again. As you know, we've been from the beginning working towards a plan for something permanent, and you know I feel really strongly that this is a really important moment for thinking about seneca village, but thinking about just commemoration and monuments, and you know I think, we've been thinking a lot about how really the movement for racial justice has really exposed sort of the meaning and history of monuments in new ways. I feel like I'm continually drawn to this particular image of the monument to Robert E Lee in Richmond Virginia, which just is you know, completely transformed this monument into something new and really is calling attention to its meaning in such a powerful way, and I just think that we're you know we're at a really interesting place, and I think that there's a lot of people thinking and working on monuments right now, and so we've been also doing a lot of research and participating in various public discussions or you know not participating. But you know attending a lot of discussions from various groups. Monuments lab is one in Philadelphia. That's becoming very well known that they do a lot of work around. I think rethinking the monument. So how do we kind of move forward to rethink the monument and create conversation around the future of monuments, and they had a big town hall last week that I attended that was really stimulating and filled with really kind of interesting ideas. You may have heard that they actually just got a grant from the Mellon Foundation part of this really large project that they're working on, which is to give 250 million dollars to different groups and municipalities to really rethink and create new monuments in our cities. So again, this is a really important time and I think that it's really important to us to kind of think about all these things as part of developing a framework for thinking about commemoration and, of course, we're always thinking about the history of monuments in central Park, and you know recently, as you know, the women's rights pioneers monument was added to the park, which is the first monument to be added to the park since the 1960s. And so you know, we've been really reflecting a lot on the lessons learned from this particular project and how they can inform us going forward and also just again the sort of history of monuments. I wrote a blog post about that recently, which I'm happy to share with you just really about how they came to be in the park and and really what they represent, and so I think all of this stuff together is stuff that we're thinking about, and I think we want to think about how to develop some programs and maybe symposium and other forums for community engagement around some of these ideas as part of the process for moving forward. So I think that's really what we're working on John do you have anything to add just to lean on what Marie's talking about you know we look at the Harlem gateway, there's been a variety of public monuments along the northern end of the park and into central Harlem with the Harriet Tubman Ellison, and some of these other projects I feel like they've, come to be really quality projects that really engage the community and in engaging the community. We really looked at the broader history of the sites, the people that are being commemorated, and we think this is an ideal time with the interest to add to that array of monuments to something very thoughtful. You know looking at the history of seneca village, but even to give the artists a program from which to do any kind of art. It needs to be a kind of consensus from the community about what they would like to see or ideas they'd like to see explored even make a selection from so we're sort of feel like we're on the road to kind of figuring out how we would lay out a sort of ground plan for moving forward and thinking about commemoration. And if we look back on when the New York Historical Society first started researching a village, it was also pretty much nothing known about it, and so it really has been a local effort. That's brought the history forward, it's not scholarship of some other part of the country or the world. It really was. You know, Harlem based in New, York, City, based and looking at that research. So I think, having done spent all that time and put all my all that value in it that we should really be reaching out and bringing some of that information forward to the broader public for one and bringing in church like mother, Amy, Zion and some of the institutions that were involved with those sites that have histories, so the public gets to know the broader history before we think about a commemorative piece, they realize all the potential things that could be drawn from. So that's going to take us some time, but we want to try to organize it in a way that we get a really great outcome in the end, and so that's the path we're on with this. Well I'd just like to ask in terms of the permanent issues right. What do you think that's about hello, Steve Simon! I did not recognize the rabbi there. Oh where'd, you get all that Beard Steve just wanted to ask the question. In view of the respect to the moment, here's the number here all right, all right can everyone here. I just like to ask the question marie with respect to the permanent exhibit. What do you see as a time frame for that? When do you start beginning to assess the ideas that are out there and begin to begin to take steps to start the process to implement a permanent process project? You know, I think what we're doing right now is you know just looking at and thinking about, what's going on right now, and I think that you know, I think that this winter we could probably start thinking about a schedule and a process like a little more specifically. I do not think we're really ready to do that right now, but, but you know we're in the very the beginning stages of getting that going so, okay, and just just how what? If do you think something might be developed over the winter and then would we would we get an extension for the for this temporary exhibit yeah? I mean you know I'd like to see if we can do that again, depending on the schedule for everything I think, if there's still interest in the temporary exhibit, we can certainly do that. You know we also do have the app now and we also are working on a larger project to do an audio guide for the entire park, which would have a seneca village component. So I think there's other options too for kind of keeping the interpretation aspect of it going and providing continuing to provide information so yeah I mean, I think that you know, I think it's important to think about these projects too. As taking, I think it's important to take a lot of time with them as well. I think to me one of the lessons of the women's rights pioneers monument is, they felt like it was a little rushed and I think, as a result, I think there was not as much opportunity for community dialogue about it and there was not as much opportunity for discussion of the design, and you know I definitely and I feel like there's a bit of a rush around some of the other city monuments that are happening right now as well. So I just I want to make sure we're taking the amount of time that we really need versus conforming to some other schedule, but I think it's something we just need to start looking at a little bit more. Well, I just like to say the women's monument is phenomenal yeah, it's great and it's getting a lot of attention, and you know I think the photo I took here was maybe a couple weeks ago right after Ruth, Bader Ginsburg died, and so that's what you're seeing some offerings to her. And you know I think it's really. It's really been amazing for people that I think about representing women in the park and what that means again to thinking about the history of monuments in central park and what it means for representation in public spaces, and all of this stuff is related to what we're thinking about with seneca village as well. I think what I want to add, though you know, I think, where we're looking at the Seneca village commemoration differently is. I think we want to think a little bit more about what a commemorative landscape could look like versus a monument in the landscape, not that there could not be some art component or monument like component, but I think this project really had a lot to do with creating a monument and putting it in the park and I think, with seneca village, because of the landscape, that it is and because there is so much history of seneca village in that landscape. I think there's a really unique opportunity to really make the commemoration feel connected to the landscape. So, for instance, you know in seneca village there's this highest. The highest point in central park is in seneca village, and you know it was a place. People in seneca, village likely went to the top of and could see from, and you know we have the water source. We have the natural spring, that's still there and we have all these rock out crops. So we have all these connections to the landscape that I think we really want to think about as part of this project. So I think that's. The other thing we're looking at is other examples of projects that are more than just monuments, and I think again it relates to what is happening right now where people are really re- examining what a monument can be, that it does not have to be a bronze statue. So, and one of the things I mean, if you look at, if we maybe we start having some seminars or things where people look at what the possibilities are and the possibilities come out of the ideas of what we think about seneca village. What does seneca village say to us in terms of the community, its history and all those are the ideas that we'd be bringing forward to the artists for the artists to give us ideas of what they think it could be and they're the creative forces for which we're going to find something we either love or like or dislike, and I think if we start from the idea side, we were we're more likely to get variety than though I like the women's statue very much, would you look at that and really know it was done in the 2020? You know what about says 2020.. You know I feel like there's a lot of young artists. There's a lot of young thinking, that's contemporary. That would be nice to have had a dialogue to see what the possibilities could have been. This still might have been the best project that came out of all the artists, but I like to think that if there had been more of a dialogue, there'd been a more interesting. You know broad, more broadly interesting piece and so for Seneca village. I think there's so many points of view that come in to make that a significant historical site that I think our charge is to really put forward the parameters of what we think are important or things that could be considered and let the artists bring us the I d, the physical ideas. You know I will say, with the women's suffrage, with the with the women's monument that it is up to date in the sense that it's interactive, you can hear the voices of the women who are depicted and get some history. So it's a more modern statue in that sense, are there any other comments or questions? If you raise your hand, I can call on you that would be the most orderly way to conduct this meeting so there any other questions from board members questions or comments. Okay, I'm looking in the chat Aaron, oh yes, barbara yeah! I like the idea. I was listening to Marie talk about Seneca, village and thinking about not just a monument but something that aligns with the landscaping depicting what the life was like back. Then I mean not: many of us today can actually experience what it was like to live in the park just walking through the park and riding through the park. You know that it had to have been at some point more than just beautiful, but a wonderful place to be so if it means that I heard you asking about a timeline, so does that mean that in the process of those thoughts and development that it would extend or negate the ability to do something for seneca village, or is it just something that we're not going to rush and we're just going to put more effort into from the community yeah? I mean I like yeah. I do not think it means it's not going to happen. I think we're definitely just wanting to take some time, and I think that you know what you're saying I think is really important, also because you know, based on what we understand about, why people moved to Seneca village in the first place. You know, I think it had a lot to do with people escaping downtown Manhattan, which was crowded and polluted, and you know, as an African- American you were faced with. You know not only discrimination but threats of violence, and you know so. This was an escape and it was an escape into what was a pretty rural place. There was not a lot of development in that area, and so we know you know based on what we know about the history of the landscape in the building of the park. It actually has that part of the park has not changed all that much. You know all the rocks that are there, the hills. You know again this natural spring, so I think you can still kind of discover seneca village in the landscape of the park, and I think that it's really important to think about how the commemoration and interpretation of this history and today's community can really tie into what is there now. I think it's a really unique opportunity, not a lot of other american historic sites in New, York City get some I do not want to. You can really do that, so we have to work with what we got. Look at the bottom doors, yeah, okay, I'm just someone has some background noise, I'll mute, oh hi, Sheena! Are there any other questions? Let me check and see if there are any hands raised. I karen. I have a question, but I can't seem to figure out how to raise my hand. Oh, if you go into more, I believe it's more okay, I'm not I'm. Looking at my three dots, oh somehow, I do not see a more okay, so if you can call anyone when you're able, okay, guys yeah okay great, I wanted to just share a couple of things regarding the seneca village. I think it's a great idea to you know, continue it and to develop it into a permanent exhibit. I think, as we begin to develop it into a permanent, exhibit that we definitely should involve different community members, who are historians, writers, artists, creative people. I mean we have a wealth of creative people and this is not a very well- known thing in terms of seneca village, so I think we have an opportunity to really talk about the history and I visited the exhibit, and I think the exhibit is a great first effort. You know just talking about the artifacts and everything, but it's not. The presence is not great enough, like you had to do a lot to figure out where the things were and if you're not really like computer savvy to see where the next one is or have your cell phone, and all that you know I had my 20 year old, granddaughter with me, and even she had a hard time to help me to navigate where the things were. So I think there needs to be more of a presence and though, like people are using whatever it's called with their cell phone, everybody is not doing that. Everybody does not have it, so I think it should be user friendly to more people. I can even envision performances in front of it or reenactments. I think that would be great and it's interesting. I just sent Karen a short video and maybe you can share it with Miss Wash or you know, whoever at another time, but I did go to the Suffragette monument and that was extremely powerful, because just at the time that I went there, one of my friends who's a pretty renowned dancer. She was there with another dancer and it was like some kind of day where dancers were dancing in the park in front of different things and her name is Dr Jacqueline Sawyer and she chose the woman's Suffragette monument to dance in front of so they did a little bit of what they were going to do, but the actual dancing started at 5 30.. So you know, I think, reenactments dramatizations activities like that, and then I'm not sure how you can do this, but it was very difficult to find the monument, the Suffragette monument, I'm not that familiar with all of the park, and so you know once again I had now my younger grandchildren and we had the GPS on and we were walking and we entered like at around 67th street and we were asking people and honestly we were walking for an hour. We went through Bethesda fountain, you know most people did not know where it was so I think something has to be done so that it's not that kind of thing I mean it actually was great, because we had many park experiences. We talked to many New York people and a lot of people were saying. I want to see it too, but I do not know where it is and Lo and behold, alas, after getting some ice cream and sitting down, you know we found it. So I just think, and even with the the the you know, seneca village, that was not easy to find either. So I think we have to work on some ways to you know, make these things more foundable findable and do some huge activities and presence, because, especially at this time, you know they're very important and they matter, and you know that will be like it is something that we're thinking about as we look at the exonerated five, but you know that's my comment and I think you're absolutely correct. I really want to do some research, because I also did both the I've been doing Central Park, but I actually did go to the the the STEM program, the women's STEM statues that were in the central Park Zoo, and that was pretty powerful too, because I think that the way they did those monuments- and I saw the woman who was the you- know the funder on New York, one or something, but it looks like that was done in 3D and it's poured in resin, which is a quicker thing, not to say, do not have art. So those are all my comments I mean thank you Terry. Thank you. Thank you. I just like to say that this has been the Seneca village project has been 20 years in the works. Is that right Marie so has been thoroughly vetted wow, but you do make some points Terry, but Terry I just like to did Marie. Did you want to comment? No, but I appreciate all your comments and yeah. I think that what we want to do in just the next round of outreach. Yes, we make it clear. This is how you download a map of the signs, and you know we have brochures and stuff. I think I think, unfortunately, because of the pandemic, some of those more like we have all these brochures, but I did. I do not think they made the rounds very much or as enough as we wanted. So we did want to make it a little easier to find the women's monument yeah. I think there needs to be a little bit more on our website, because I think, because it's very excuses, we have a question from one of our participants. Thank you. Thank you. The time all right, let me see I'm trying to unmute you. Would you please? Unmute 917., would you please unmute Karen? Is that me? Is that me? I'm sorry, I'm not sure it's a phone number? Yes, that's I'm! So sorry I had to join by phone. But more of a comment. Just a quick comment. This work is absolutely incredible. I was fortunate or either old enough to visit the exhibit at the New York historical society. It must have been 20 years ago and I remember the incredible enthusiasm that people had visiting that stand. You know that sort of stand- alone exhibit, and I think in fact the New York historical study had to extend it because it was so. You know lots of folks wanted to have an opportunity to see it. I was thinking that it reminded me, and it says: Murray reminded me of district six, some similarities to district six in South Africa, where a community was destroyed because people who should not have been able to live together peacefully did so successfully and they saw that as a threat in district six, it's be in South Africa, it's become a museum and part of it looks at as a as a opportunity to look at advocating for social justice and a space for reflection and contemplation. So it might be interesting at some point to look at those kinds of similarities. But again I think this is an incredible project and thank you guys so very much. It's exactly those other types of projects that we're kind of so sort of collecting right now, like looking at other examples. So that's very helpful. Are there any other questions or comments? Hi Karen, it's Mari Moss. I just wanted to say. As you know, I did the I missed the walkthrough for Seneca village, but I took my daughters there. The history is rich and I'm really looking forward to this project coming to fruition. I hear a lot of great ideas just now, so I really feel like there's going to be a lot of historical value as well as commemoration on this project, so looking forward to this coming to fruition, especially since you said it's 20 years in the making. Thank you mari looking forward to the progress. Yes, thank you any other questions or comments. Okay. Well, I think that we can thank Marie for this wonderful information and we're going to be looking forward to updates and we will be getting back in touch with you to develop that email list so that we can get the word out that the virtual tours are going to be taking place and it's just fantastic to learn about the curriculum. That's going to be available for the schools. This is, and this is so timely, so very timely. Well, thank you all, and I really appreciate all your comments and insights and I'm looking forward to having more discussions. Thank you, Marie Salong. Okay, thank you, John. Thank you both very much. Okay, thank you. Okay, so we will move on to our next time. You're welcome to stay John and Marie if you'd like we have another engagement, but thank you, oh okay, all right! Thank you. I'd like to move on to our next presentation, and that is with John La Sort and we'd like to welcome her. She is the new administrator for district, nine, historic parks and John. I do not know where you are: oh you're there with Steven: oh hi Steven. Can you hear me you wanted to present or do you need to no at first we were having technical problems. I see Sheena there too. Do you Karen. Can you hear me? Okay? Yes, we can hear you, okay, hi everyone. I can hear you okay, so hi I'm Jana Lasorte and I am the new administrator of historic, Harlem parks, which of course includes the Great Jackie Robinson Park, and I'm here mostly tonight, just to say hello to everyone, I'm a month in on my job here. So there's a lot to learn. I know I'll be learning a lot from you guys. So it's great to join you for my first visit here and I'll. Tell you a little bit about this position. I've got Steve Simon here too, the great Steve Simon, you all know our political and otherwise guru and Sheena Kaufman. As you all know, our amazing park manager and my partner. So my role here is to really partner with Sheena and all of you and look at what we want to make happen for Jackie, Robinson, Park and specifically for me, looking at strategic planning and helping to resource opportunities for the park. That could be in many different ways. I'm looking at a grant, for instance, right now that I'm hoping to put in for November one that would be for some strategic planning and working on some programming ideas and conversations and meeting people. That's very important that I meet the leaders around the park, including I'm sure all of you and hearing from you about where things are at what your hopes are. What some of your you know needs are, I know, Sheena's, probably she's, one of my key resources for that I've been learning a lot from her. So I am in this role to essentially be an advocate and a partner and build support, and I'm happy to answer any questions in terms of what I can share now Karen. I can't hear you we're looking forward to collaborating with you and one thing that we had that I had mentioned to you. We just wanted to know how is it going with the parks without borders in Jackie, Robinson, Park and maybe well I'll? Take a person yeah I'll, take a first step at that, but then I'll pass it over to Steve and she and if she wants to add anything, but I am, are we okay? There we have a technical message. I am as devoted to parks without borders, of course, as commissioner silver and all of us at parks, so I'll be looking at ways to really, particularly when spring comes, but before that too, looking at ways that we can animate the boundaries of the park in terms of you know its street connections to help bring people in and really help them. You know encounter what I think is a gem of a park that is not as recognized perhaps as some others, but the amphitheater, for instance, looking at how we can really animate that, with a wide variety of events and programming and really, I think, bill the essence of Jackie Robinson to me. There's a sweetness there in that park. That is different from the other parks in my portfolio, Marcus Garvey, Morningside, Park, St, Nicholas and Jackie. Robinson are the four that I work with and Jackie Robinson, as you all know, has just a real feel of home and kind of this like just lived in family, feel of community and comfort, and I think that we have a real opportunity to leverage that in many different ways. So starting to think about that, and I welcome any ideas and anybody who wants to reach out to me I'll, give you my email before we end tonight, but I'll pass it over to Steve. You want to say more yeah and Gina has all of the work been concluded on on the Bradhurst Avenue Sidewalk. Is that all done? All of that stuff is not. I'm sorry not Brad hurst do not shake your head. Do not you no barber. I know you know everything about bradhurst, but no, I misspoke, I meant I meant Edgecomb age. All of the contractors work has been done. We just we're working on getting Barbara. I only depend upon you for bradhurst, so you got it. Okay, no problem! Okay, good, okay, fine, okay, go ahead! There we are. We go we're working on we're going to work with the blacksmith on putting back some of the what I am fencing that was knocked down by some vehicles, driving around driving down brat edge, cone extremely fast, and you know resulting into the uplift right on your fence. So, but where you you're talking about the fencing around the trees or the to tour, the tour de fencings around the trees, they were not going. Okay, they were knocked down. I have the fencing. We have that okay. Well, the okay! These are. These are somewhat minor points, because the overall project has been completed and we have done. I think even Barbara would agree that we did some great work there. We opened up the entrance coming down from 155Th Street near Acrosss from 409 edgecombe, an entryway that had been closed for decades. We opened up that staircase. We rebuilt the staircase rebuilt the path so that people could make their way now at that on the northern end of the park from Edgecombe back down to bradhurst, and they could go from Brad earth back up to Edgecomb. We rebuilt the the pathway in the staircase at the southern end of the park, which is a major thoroughfare, as you know, but people in the Bradhurst neighborhood going up to the subway and coming home from work, so the connecting between again between bradhurst and edgecombe, two major improvements for the park that we were able to accomplish through this program and and then we did this additional sidewalk work between 145Th and 150th streets with a new fence along edgecomb matching the fence that we had previously installed from 150Th to 155Th and and a new sidewalk treatment. So we did some major work to the park and a major improvement to this park. We're not saying that all the work is done. Barbara can tell me how much more we have to do, but, and then certainly we want to. We want to do that, and I know that when you discuss your district needs statement further on in this in this meeting, you're going to want to also advocate for some additional work at Jackie Robinson, because we're not done with that park, we need to do more and and when we need your support to push that along. You know. We recently finished the facade work to the Rec center, which was very important to keep the building whole and to prevent leakage coming in from the from the roof and from the sides. So we're concentrating on the park and- and it's very important to us- we certainly want to do more to bring it up to an to a to a greater level. But it's unfortunate that because of Covid-19 we could not have a ribbon cutting ceremony, but maybe maybe when all of this is over, we can get together and celebrate this new improved park. And we thank you for your support. I thank Karen because she participated in the original planning meeting for this project and and for all of your help over the years. Thank you, and can I say hello to rose, I see roses here rose. I want you to smile. Thank you, okay, so I have a few updates. You can hear me. Yes, I see China before you. I just wanted to ask us a question of Janna yeah and in terms of strategic planning. What do you have in mind now that we are as we go forward, hopefully from the pandemic in terms of strategic planning? Well, right now, I'll tell you. I have to look at the particulars of this grant, but in general Karen. What I'm looking at right now is I've been tasked by the commissioner to just kind of come up with a general starting list for things that we want to do in each park and then talk with the community boards talk with the friends and alliance groups and talk with community members. So if I were to get a grant, for instance, that would be you know, part of the process, but even grant aside, that is going to be part of the engagement process to make sure that you know we're talking with everyone along the way so that we get input. We get criticism, we get ideas, we get wish lists and we can bet that so that we're putting together a plan that really is endorsed. And, of course we can't do everything that everyone wants at the time. Everyone wants so also looking at the priority that we can put that in alignment with related to budget related to our resources, etc, and also outside resources that I'll be working to develop. So that might be corporate partnerships that might be non- profit partners, different friends of the park that we can bring in whether they're private givers. You know in- kind donations, all of those resources that can help us move this collective vision together, and I want to share too Sheena and then back over to you one thing back to parks without borders. Just a note for everybody in case you have not walked by Jackie Robinson Park recently, there's an incredible photo bill exhibition there. That is also part of this parks without borders. You know this whole idea of animating the park and really attracting attention and raising people's curiosity about the park. So if you're walking on 145Th there's a big photoville exhibition that was done in partnership with the Schomburg library and it's pretty wonderful, it archival photos from the schomburg of Harlem history and Photoville is a photo installation expert they're, a non- profit that works with photography to present them to the public, and they did two for Harlem. They actually the founders live in Harlem and they did two for Harlem. One is at Jackie Robinson, Park and the other ones at St, Nicholas, Park and they're. Getting tremendous feedback. People are really loving them. We're actually talking Sheena- and I were talking about this with Laura, who is with Odoville about the possibility of extending their time at Jackie, Robinson Park, possibly through. Let's say, maybe a Christmas. You know holiday tree event, so we're looking into that. As we look to, you know, bring more wonderful things to the park, oh, and by the way, I should just say something. Personally, you guys I've been in the city for 21 years, I've lived uptown for 13 of those after I left Brooklyn and I used to teach at city College, so St, Nick, Park and Jackie Robinson, I'm really familiar with, have had a lot of different friend meetups at those parks and events and just going through them in the course of my life. I live in Washington Heights, but my stomping grounds are Harlem in the heights, so that's always where I'm at so it's just really an honor for me and a pleasure to be working with you to keep improving and making Jackie Robinson Great as Jackie Robinson Part, so Sheena I'll give it back over to you and I'm happy to answer questions too before we all close out our part of the program tonight. Thank you. So this goes for Miss Barbara we're going to have. I have three volunteer projects coming up for Jackie Robinson One on 10:20. The other is 10:22 because we break we have to break them up for for the Covid-19 and we and then 11:6 New, York kids is coming and they're going to do a morning shift in the afternoon shift. So we're going to break up 50 people each so we're going to be doing some planting some cleaning, some painting of some of the benches on Bradhurst I'm trying to get Edcom slacks changed before we make you know painting, because when we put paint on them it just does not take so they're. All warped. Some of them on Brad hurst is the same, but they look a little much more decent if we put some paint on them, but I'm going to see if I can get them changed all right. So that's the three volunteer projects I have going into Jackie Robinson and I was just going to say: if anybody wants to meet me come I will be at Tuesday's event. So if anybody wants to meet me, I know sheena. We got ta watch out our numbers for Covid-19 regulations right, but I but I'll be there Tuesday with Bnp Paradise, which will be this right there. It's going to be, I think, about 20 volunteers, for that project and on Tuesday and on Thursday is going to be another 20.. So we break it up. You know today we have, I had a meeting today, a walkthrough at Bilbo Jingles. It looks beautiful just a couple of little things. They have to work out, but nothing major, so we're looking for next Wednesday to get it turned over, but we're not sure, but people have been playing inside. They have jumped the fence and they have played inside the basketball court. So we have another coat of sports coating to do on the basketball court. So we you know we're looking to put signs up. Please do not jump the fence because the sports coating is going to be down and we do not want it to mess up. So that's for Billboard, Jangles, fred, Johnson, beautiful. It's a it's! A lot of horticultural work, that's been put in the freight Johnson, but it looks amazing. It looks amazing, that's still next year to be turned over, but the looks of it as you walk by you'll, see all of the plants and the you can see the grass in the back for the mini soccer and you'll see all of the refreshing things for Fred for Fred Johnson. So look it's coming along very well. It's really good. I think that is it for those updates for those projects. Well, please. I want you to come out to if you could come out on 10:20, 10, 22 or 11 6.. What time Sheena, okay, the 10:20 is at 10 o'clock. Is it 10:22 is that 10 o'clock also and 11:6 is at we're going to start setting up at nine we're going to start set up, so we can break up in teams and we're going to try to clean all out the overclip of edgecomb as much as possible. You know as safe as we can do. You know make it that's what we're going to be working on and doing some planting. Yes, do you want to tell rose that we're going to be redoing the handball court at Courtney Calendar in the spring, or should we keep that a secret? I was going to miss roses. You Steve, I went no, I do not know. I do not think we should. No. I do not think we should tell her. Let's save that for some other time we'll do it some other time, please. You know please yeah, I we it's coming, it was it was. It was delayed. It would have should have started last week, but it was a slight delay, but it's coming it's coming for I'm Courtney calendar yeah. We need to. We need the basketball courts and I do not know what happened. I went to the arsenal yesterday. I was supposed to pick up some bubs and it's my park day for next week and they said that they was not doing it because of colbert. No, we I miss rose. I have my list here I'll talk to you off base with that tomorrow. I have my list of it's my part. They I have the calendar for district 10 and 11. so and I'll touch base with you for that, but no we're doing it a little different. This year. Okay, I'm patient, I'm being patient, Miss rose. We we're trying and we're trying Colby got us by the throat other than that we're doing pretty. Okay in district 10.. Our ratings are well. I actually are excellent. Depending you know, all of the things that's going on yeah excellent, so anyone have any questions Gina. Could you just make sure you send us the list of it's my park day for all the parks that we're having in community boards and I'll be talking about them? Also? Is that including the planting of the boat along Adam, Plain, Powell, Boulevard, yes, Miss, Lulu John is getting her hers as well she's on my list, yes, okay and, if possible, in Jackie Robinson. We have like a soft fencing by 148 and 140 seventh street. The fencing looks like some kids were playing and pushed them in. So I do not know. Who does that? Oh you mean the defense around the horticulture bed. Yes, it's okay! It's down! I was going to probably remove that. I wanted to try to see if I remove it if we get better it'll look different, but if I see that a lot of dogs and people are doing things that they not I'll put the fence back, I'm going to probably remove it to see how it works out, see if the it changes the atmosphere around going up to the band shell, not a good idea. Do not remove it as of yet because the only thing that has stopped the barbecues in the amphitheater is that we've had parks departments sitting there to stop them from the open flames, but do not remove it as of yet because what they did is they came down the stairs to have their barbecues right by that? Okay, all right, then I'll, have it fixed. I replaced it. Thank you. Are there any other questions or comments? Stephanie, you have your hand raised. Did you have a question or comment stephanie? Oh no, I put it in the chat. I just wanted to acknowledge that Tina's been doing a really great job, keeping us updated, and I wanted to say thank you very much. Thank you. You're welcome any other questions or comments. Oh Steve, I have a question sheena. The park that is on 143Rd between Adam Clayton, Powell and Frederick Douglas Boulevard, is that the fire department is looking to do a mural there for a fallen firefighter. Is that something? What would be the process for that? Well, first, let me answer for that. Park is really a bad park. The vandalism in that park is above what we can withstand and then the shape of how the the Handbook court is designed. It's almost like. You really could not see it unless you you're in the area, the fire department has a wall and a parking lot. That probably will be great for a mural, but because how Renaissance is designed, the handball court is first was underutilized for one, and the second is just another way for them to vandalize, like they're cutting open the fences now they're taking pieces of defense away just to get into the playground and into the schoolyard. So I'm having a problem with that, because they're taking their p as we're, replacing it they're, stealing it back and then taking extra, then taking another piece. So you know I, okay, not good yeah. Well, let me just say that this is a playground that is overdue for a renovation and, if you're going to be doing your budget priorities tonight. I would hope that you could include this on your list. This is what's officially known as the renaissance playground adjacent to the school there. Now I want to. We want to work with the fire department. We respect what they want to do. We want to honor the firefighter I have read a very I do not know if you saw the same email Karen with a little bio or a little story about how this firefighter Michael Davidson. Some kid came by one day and his bike tires had to be inflated and they wanted to know where they could go to have them done and he took them right into the firehouse. He had somebody do it. He brought the kid up into the cab of the of the fire engine. Had the kid play with the horn- and I gave the kid a whole treat and and then explained to his fellow firefighters, we're here to serve the community- we're here not just to put out fires, we're here to show that we want to treat the community with respect and we want to give kids a good time and let them know that we're here for them- and I was so touched by that story. I'm I want to. I want to work with the fire department and figure out what is the best way we can do what they want to accomplish and we're going to we'll come up with something and and we'll keep you in the loop. Thank you, and I just like to say with respect to that fire firehouse that we at my block parties they've come out. They brought the fire truck, the kids could get on board and they gave away. They had giveaways and we've even had them come and do workshops at Christmas to talk about fire safety. So we'd have had an interaction with them in terms of community outreach and that's sort of I. If it does not have to be that specific location, maybe something that could be a little more visible still in the district 10 area, well, we'll work something out yeah, because I'm afraid that it's going to be vandalized and they're not going to appreciate it like it should be. Okay, I understand we'll talk about it. We'll work, something out. Okay, all right! Are there any other questions or comments, I'm regarding parked up updates or parts without borders at Jackie Robinson, one thing I'll share with everybody, and just internally we'll start turning our attention to this next week, but it's hard to believe, but Christmas is coming down the pike, so we'll be turning our attention to that next week and thinking about, of course, another great Christmas at Jackie, Robinson, Park and holiday season. So we'll be starting to look at that internally next week and I sadly I do not have access to the chat, but I can give. I can give my email right here. It follows the same formula as Steve Simons and Sheena's, but would you like me to do that? Karen? Yes, I actually have it. I can put it in the chat yeah, that's your name and title in already: yes, ma'am, so yeah. We had some technical difficulties here today, so we're we kind of Jimmy rigged it. Thank you. You're welcome, okay and I'll put that in just a few moments. Well, thank you, Johnna, Steve and Sheena. Thank you so very much and please stay because we want you to hear some of the other things that we have on our agenda tonight, so we'll move on, and I would like your weigh in on this Jan and Steve and sheena the Clemson University and I'll just unless, if someone has a comment or something in the meantime, I'm just going to, I can take a moment to put in Johnna's email before we go on to the next item and let me see and in terms of Fred Johnson, is there any connection that's going to be made with the waterfront in any way. I think we did talk about that in one of our previous meetings, not real. Well, I mean it's, you know right along the water and we are going to be extending the greenway so that the greenway will run right along through fred Johns along the edge of Fred Johnson and then through olive lane, playground to the north. So I think the major piece there will be that a gap in the greenway is going to be filled in through this project and then the next one we do in Harlem Lane, and so you know that that'll be a plus for the Harlem, the Harlem corridor, which is you know currently now you have to do some crazy detours in order to continue cycling up the up along the river. Okay, all right! Well, thank you, Steve, any other questions or comments on that. I'm just going to I'm sorry, I'm going to share my screen, we'll move on to the next item, which is the Clemson University. As you know, we worked on it establishing a relationship with Clemson, University and they're again going to be getting back to us and providing graduate students to work on issues that would involve tactical urbanism and they are still working on just getting approval from the from the school to be able to go forward with this. So we're waiting on that. But in the meantime we could be coming up with some ideas so that when they do come to us, we can. We can have some idea of what we would like to see being done. I'm just going to share my screen all right, so tactical urbanism and we're just as I said, we just want to look at some ideas as to what we could do with that, and tactical urbanism is our projects that employ low- cost temporary treatments to the parks and street. That's please disregard that work here, and the primary focus is on proving improving safety and improving mobility within the park. So we want to take a look at those aspects. Temporary chop projects can help to encourage meaningful public engagement, which is what Jonah was speaking about in terms of making the park more attractive and inviting and will generate support for permanent projects by allowing people to experience what's possible rather than just looking at rendering. So this whole project, the exhibit with the archival photos from the schomburg, is just fantastic. It would be right along those lines. I would think I'm still learning myself about tactical urbanism, so tactical urbanism uncovers value. It engages stakeholders from the very beginning I mean involves document documentation and measuring, and its design should be designed to attract attention it. The position of the projects should be intended to inspire programs or even to change policies. So with that, I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas, so I'm just going to come back out of screen sharing. If anyone has any comments on what you think we might be, asking would like to ask these graduate students, who are I'm sorry who are in a resiliency urban Resiliency study program here and I'm happy to oh, go ahead. No, someone else! Please go ahead. This is Kevin I'll, go next hi Kevin, okay, who someone had there hi Kevin? This is Jana, so Karen. You had asked me about this on when you and I spoke, and just now that I've learned more about it. Thank you because I had not heard the term before you're absolutely right. This is so exciting because it relates to kind of the prototyping of ideas that we can try out in the park to get to illicit response to exactly like you were saying, so. This is very exciting and I'll share real quickly and then back over to Kevin that I my background is in social innovation and entrepreneurialism like when I was teaching at city college, for instance, and so this goes again to this whole idea of I created a boot camp for 13 to 20 year olds, around social innovation, which is looking at challenges that we have in our in our cityscapes and our social environments and our physical environments and how we can challenge our own assumptions and come up with new approaches and new ideas to leverage the assets that are in our community and also what's happening in our environment, like with technology, for instance, but also usability right. So, like we were saying before with your previous speaker, not everybody has a cell phone, not everybody has a smart phone. So how do you make sure that something's also very user friendly? So this is very exciting. Thank you. Johnna Kevin yeah hi everyone, so one thing that I've been thinking about as it relates to this project and other kind of activations, with the parks in the in the immediate and future and long term is just in this kind of Covid-19 moment. I think you know in many ways the parks have been one of the greatest resources for our communities in this period of sheltering in place and being somewhat isolated in our apartments and so part of the study of really looking at, and this is very kind of basic. At this point I thought, but just how the parks can be activated in greater ways for the schools and just you know, continuing education and learning opportunities in the parks. I mean, I think, that's something that we know the parks provide, but that could be you know. Another level of study is what else is what is an untapped resource in the parks right now, as it relates to building community bringing education and learning into the parks? You know we have examples in the district of community gardens around hydroponics and you know other ways of growing. You know vegetables and horticulture, and how can that really be amplified in this particular moment in our immediate future, because I think the parks are one of our greatest resources so yeah that that's just kind of a thought that I have at the top of mine, oh Wilma's, asking. Well, we had a question. Thank you Kevin, I'm sorry, John or Steve. Did you have any response to what Kevin just stated hi? Do you want to talk? Okay, this is Jana. Yes, I echo what Kevin was saying absolutely and I think you know I'm it's going to be really exciting, actually to hear more and learn more about what CB10 wants with the parks and what your thoughts are, but also it gives us an opportunity to in invite people. You know going back to Commissioner, silver's pledge and promise of parks without borders and our commitment to that. What strikes me Karen is that this tactical urbanism really gives us a chance to invite people in to the process of the parks right. So I have done participatory budgeting and I was fascinated the two times. I did participatory budgeting that people really do want to be involved. They just do not really understand, maybe the pathways to get to an organization or to you know, or how to link into that opportunity. So with tactical urbanism, I'm really starting to understand that it's really putting it out there on the street, like you said in the presentation and inviting people who are passing by you know, young people old people does not matter all kinds of people passing by to get engaged. You know to experiment with us to prototype something, and I think that this is going to be a fantastic way for us to try out new ideas, and you know another example tactical urbanism. I think this particular study with clemson is focusing on activations in the park, but one of the tech, another example of tactical urbanism- that's happening in Harlem right now is our use of open streets. You know- and I think there are examples of how you know in parts of the five boroughs certain streets are turning into green spaces and pedestrian zones, so I mean that that's not taking place in a park, but some of our community spaces are being converted into a park space, so it just. There was a question in the chat about you know what is meant by tactical urbanism and I and I threw in a ever. You know useful wikipedia link where you can learn a little bit more, because I think it's yeah there's a lot in there for us to discuss and thank you for doing so. This is Wilma. Thank you very much for sending that to me, and I guess and you're right. I do not know much about tactical urbanism and I'm interested in finding out more about it as it relates to Harlem. I do understand that we are in a world of change agents, but yet still we want to keep some history around us as well. So I'm going to do some more research on this tactile human, this tactical urbanism. Because again, we do not want to change too much and well the thing around excuse me the thing around the open, dining, that's called survival mode right there to me. Oh yes, I do not think of that as being tactical urban, and that would not be the approach by far so, let's just give some I mean I just need some more clearer examples around urbanism. That's all absolutely, and I knew I'd mention open streets and it would, it would send up sparks because it is sparks, but I think I think it's I think it's interesting it's important for us to you know I'm learning more about tactical urbanizing urbanism myself and I think it's important for us to look at. You know the problem. You know we do not want to lose ourselves in the midst of trying a lot of new things. Absolutely yeah. Okay, I'd just like to say to Wilma the tactical urbanism is temporary. It's just designed to draw in and just to inspire conversation within the community, such as the archival exhibit that's in Jackie Robinson Park. Now that would be an example of a type of exception, and I, like is that the piece around the pictures yeah I live up on the hill, so I see the pictures often I think they're beautiful, yes Karen. Once again, I do not. I do not know how to raise my hand on the thing but yeah. Thank you, yeah. I think that, like everything else, we can get creative with the tactical urbanism and maybe get some of our community artists and creative people to work with the crimson people to develop some things and in my just journeys through the park- and I think I've mentioned this before at other meetings- it's really come to my attention, particularly in central park. Once you get past, that one- tenth entrance, that a lot of people of color are really not using or participating in central park at all, it's almost like a segregated thing that is happening. So I think that some of the initiatives that we can take is to really do some things to welcome and to like, have people explore the parks and that's all of the parks, like the Schomburg? Has a young scholars program that happens like every Saturday or something like that. You know which is really more for like high school kids, but I think if we could have, especially since it's during coving some family activities where people could really you know explore the nature, be a part, get to understand that you can do, and you know, there's nothing wrong with a barbecue there's nothing wrong with some basketball, but that they can explore other things and, like I said just in these little park, giants that I've done. You know mainly with my grandchildren, because I kind of feel like okay. We want to do something, educational and historical, and then after you know, I asked them. What would they like to do? That's fun, but it's really been kind of interesting watching them in the park and they do not even live in Harlem. They live like in the country in Southampton, but it's still been quite in a journey and an exploration and then just even being lost. You know and seeing all the things that we could do and my grandson saying I want to go sit over on the rocks with the people you know, so I think that that's a way to open up a lot and a lot of conversation and have black and brown people really be a part, and it's a way you can bring the city together. I think we could think of some activities, some educational things, some new things and get people doing some things that they would not. Ordinarily do especially in this colder, because you know it's so overwhelming what we're dealing with so to really explore some basic life things and most of this stuff is free. You know, so it's not a question of money, but it's a question of mindset and, just being a part and like I said I I'm astounded at who's in central park and who's enjoying, and it's not black and brown people. So something has to change. I know that originally the park was made for wealthy people and all that, but you got to change that paradigm. So that's my view. You know hi Terry, I'm Jana. If I may, I want to tag to what you just said, because this might be another good example to consider. I have a great friend of mine. Who's lived in Harlem, a long time he's actually a friend from college and he's a great photographer, very edgy, contemporary approach, and he shoots with his iphone by and large, mostly with his iphone and just gets these incredible pictures. So I've already chatted with him, and this could be an example of what we're talking about on the artistic creative side, about coming into Jackie, Robinson, Park and taking people especially. You know. This could be senior citizens, it could be young people, it could be any age at all, but we could orient it in terms of. However, we want to program it and how he wants to direct his approach. Taking, let's say, young kids like you're, saying young, black and brown kids, who are from the neighborhood, he's an african- american man who is just incredibly creative and inspirational and taking them through the park like almost like an urban park ranger, but with the eye of a camera, so that they could use their phone and learn how to shoot photography with iphones in a very professional way, but also they're actually exploring and hiking the entire range of Jackie Robinson Park, because, as we know, Jackie Robinson when Sheena took me all the way back there, because I had not been all the way back there before it was. It was incredible to realize how deep that part goes and how wild it is, and some in some wonderful ways. So maybe that's an example of what you're talking about it absolutely is, and it would be Jackie Robinson. It would be all the parks, but also piercing that veil, particularly in central park. That's a part of New York City, though the 110th that's a part of Community board 10., but it goes all the way down to 57th street. So we've really got to pierce that veil and be a part of the park. The park is for everybody, there are tax, you know as taxpayers money and if something also can be done, which I do not think this has to do with the crimson people. But it's kind of like the central park, Zoo costs, money and even for the children's price is 15 and the senior price is 15. I took my two grandchildren that was a 45 pop. So that's a lot for you know anybody. If you got a few kids and you want to take them out and then you know they're going to want something to drink or eat. Unless you bring your lunch, so you know I'm just trying to say that I think there's so much to explore and this culprit time is a great time for us to begin to explore and at the same point, to educate and not just kids. You know it should be families too, because when you start taking kids to things and the families are not part of it, you're kind of defeating the purpose, it's a village type thing so you've got to bring the parents in too. Who may not have had. You know that opportunity or thought in that kind of thing. So I think you know we have some great opportunities here and we can engage lots of community people that are so creative, like someone did and I'm going to just wrap up some long time ago, a friend of mine did he's a photographer and a filmmaker as well as I am, and he did something called that time called street life, and that was when that Song Street life was out and he did pictures of people who lived on 153Rd street by Amsterdam. He grew up there and then he had like a kind of exhibit that everybody came to and people were so proud of what the experience was and how he captured them. So I think we have some have some great nature opportunities to explore that even a lot of adults do not even know what the park holds right here. Thank you. Thank you Terry. I just like to say speaking about Jackie Robinson Park. I think that's a great opportunity for students who are studying geography to do topographical, mapping, there's just so much that could be done in the parks that we do not take advantage of right now and I know central park which does does the well in terms of the zoo. Maybe we can look at cultural passes, because that was done for the museums to make it more affordable for low- income families, so maybe that's something the parks Department can look into, and also in terms of tactical urban urbanism that involves the community and the stakeholders. So we do charettes now with parks around the Community Partnership Initiative. I believe it's called and those are fantastic. That's when the people in the community come in and they work with the parks, engineers and architects, to begin to talk about what they like to see in the parks, and then the design plans are developed and then they're brought to the Community Board. So I think that that's a very a great democratic process and tactical urbanism would involve that same process agreed. Okay. Are there any other? I think that was a great discussion on to get us a little acclimated to tactical urbanism. We still have a lot of research to do, and I invite everyone to know over here. You know just try to become more familiar with it and look at examples of it where it's been done in other parts of the country and internationally Karen, yes, hi. I just would also just one other comment as we begin to look at tactical urbanism and thank you Kevin for that definition that I would like to recommend that we look at opportunities to combine it with workforce development, especially it relates to young people who are not in school or who are not in the labor force and look at what possible opportunities we could do given that need in our community as well. I think that's a great idea, great suggestion. Okay, so with that I'd like to move on to our next item on the agenda, which is the district needs statement, so I'm I put together what I did was. I went through the existing district needs and everyone should have gotten a copy of that, so you should be familiar with it and what I did was I looked at I com. What I did I compared 2020 to 2021 and just took a look at what was what had been funded, what is still pending, what is what was not a category for parks so, and I've been attending the Sunday district needs task, force meetings and so we're getting a clear idea of how the district needs statement needs to be developed for it to be more effective. So I'd like to share with with you- and I will send this list out to everyone so that you could take a look at it, which is you know where I made the comparison so give me a moment and I'll share my screen. Why is not this charging? Can you push that in for me? Thank you. Well now, it's back on thanks! So, okay, can everyone see the screen? Yes, we can see. Okay, all right, so this is you can see. I did not see a a listing for 20:21 for this particular item, which is one so this is from 2020 and I've got some great news that, and maybe Steve can speak to this. We will be including this in our district needs statement that there has been money secured for Colonel young Playground, ball field renovation, so we're just looking to raise the additional money. So we would we would be getting forfeiture funds that have been set aside, that's two million dollars and then we need 5.5 million total. So we there was 750 dollars set aside by Inez dickens a few years back, so we want to see if that's still available and whether whatever other monies are available to our elected officials and through the parts department. So we will be including that in our district's district needs statement as well, I'm going to jump down here to five. This is a 2021 request and you can see that the Department of Parks Response, I put in the 2021 response, does Stevia want to say something. Okay, can you hear us? Yes, Karen? Yes, okay, I I'm a little reluctant to say that we've actually secured money for Colonel young we're, certainly in discussions with with people about the possibility of getting funding for the park, but nothing's really nothing's really confirmed at the moment. But there are very serious discussions that are going on and certainly having the board listed as a high priority would be very useful and- and I did not quite catch what the important thing I think to emphasize is that we're talking about installing a synthetic turf, multi- purpose field that would serve both? You know baseball soccer football, but I would hope that in your description of the project, you would point out that what we're looking to do is to have a synthetic turf, a multi- purpose field, multi- sport field, whatever. Oh, yes, definitely that's what we've been keeping in the district needs statement. I think we've been doing this in 2014, so it's been a couple of years now we're going to keep hope alive in an instance yeah, but it's underutilized, our youth needed. We have children in the schools who really do not have any place to have sports right. It's really needed and we need to be engaging our youth and you know being utilized mainly by adults. So we need to make it it friendly as well and and be able to you to utilize it to a greater extent than what we are right. I just do not want to jump. I just do not want to jump too many steps ahead to say that we already have two million dollars, because it's still in a discussion stage: okay! Well, that's it's good that it's in discussion, as I said, we're just going to you know just keep up, keep the faith and continue to push for this, because it is very much needed, especially in view of what's going on with Covid-19 and how we're seeing the disparages in that are affecting our community Karen. Can I yeah Miss Cameron two things. I would like us to consider for district 10 that I find that it's lacking it's lacking track and soccer in this district. It has not one area here with the exception of Colonel young. That has that. So, when we're thinking of you know redoing some of these areas to properly engage some of our kids. We need to think about that when we doing something some of it, that's the first, the second I want us to really consider adding William Mcrae to out you know to. I can't see the board, because the printing is very low, so I can't you know very short, so I can't see it. No! It's not on you it's on me because I'm on the phone, that's why I can't really see it William Mcrae and with the inclusion of renaissance. These two playgrounds have not been renovated in over 30 years. So you know we would like to you know, get some backing on these two areas and you know bring them to. You know better utilization. You know when thinking of them, but we should really think about area with the with the outside of county young. You know district 11. It gets a lot of attention because it has a lot of ball fields and activities and things but district 10 does not so we should think about when we did. You know redoing some of these areas for soccer and track. You know to get our kids. You know to be doing these things. You know in this particular area, especially in the district, and there is none okay. Well, that's what I understand. We need to look at other parts as well. Well, Colonel Young is one of our premier parks. So that's why yeah, but will we do have William Mcrae, as you can see listed here, we're asking for playground renovation resurfacing for prevention, so in 2021 there was the department of Parks response was that people tried to try to accommodate this request with existing and they do office of Management and budget supports the request. Well, Renaissance might be a good, both track field tracking synthetic area to do the schoolyard is extremely huge. You know, and I think that would be a good area for that. You know, then the school will be able to utilize it without an issue right: okay, because they do not come out too often there that's cool okay, so we can include Renaissance. I do not think we have it in this district needs statement. I mean in this is this listing? Yes, that definitely will help and I'm going to bring the kids out okay, yeah, because I think you do not need number six anymore, because bojangles is basically completed. So instead of instead of bojangles, you could substitute Renaissance Playground, oh okay, for the same type, and I tell you with mcrae in number five. The resurfacing is not really for flood prevention. The resurfacing is basically because it's falling apart. So Sheena is this the one that has the sinkhole? Yes, this is sinking the the swing area is sinking that area where the playground equipment is sinking. The basketball court area is fine. It's on grass level ground, but the whole playground area is sinking. This is marcus. If I could just add, I actually live right on 138th and Sheena knows I've been an advocate for this park, since I do not know when and she's right. I have- and I have to thank her for this, because this park has not been renovated, since I was a little a little boy and I'm 33 years old, now, wow, and it says you know that, like Steve said it says resurfacing for flood prevention at this point is actually for safety like yeah, the children can't run from one side of the park to the other without falling or getting hurt, because it literally goes from, like a two foot dropped from one side to other three foot drop from one side to the other. So I think this is like something of like high priority. Absolutely yep. I'm sorry tell me your name again: Marcus Wilson, yes, yeah! Thank you is this. Please make this a high priority. This is a this park, absolutely needs to be reconstructed, at least the at least at least the playground area. Okay and then marcus I'd like to stay in touch with you to. I want to enlist you to help push this along, definitely Steve. Thank you. No thank you. Okay, all right just going down the list, this is calendar playground. They need a bathroom. I would not, I know that they have been asking for a bathroom there. We had a bathroom in Courtney calendar years. You know I'm going to say about 30 years ago, I'm going to. I could be off by a few. The problem why it was removed was because this, the constant vandalism to where it was located at and the area that they're looking to put it at, is the same area that we had major problems. You know you know in the in the past, it's in the corner area and it's easily to be it's the area just easily to get to be vandalized. Actually it's not. It used to be like in the in the corner. No, it was not in the corner. It was actually in the middle against 131St, Street side and during reconstruction. It is in the plans the plumbing is already there and the bathroom was going to be moved now to the corner. It was not vandalism, it was taken down during reconstruction yeah, it was, but it was taken down, but it was taken down because of the vandalism. I worked in the area and we had we. It was we were getting so much vandalism there, because I was the one that was doing evangelism reports. I can't say that I do not know as a community person and living there since 1960. I know the house was dilapidated and I do know that all the plumbing is there and that it's supposed to be in the corner, not where it was before. That's totally different. It was in the middle. The park was designed differently and it was actually it's in the plans. If you look, they checked, they checked the plumbing and everything is still there, but it was forgotten and then the budget, because it cost so much and they forgot about it, was never put in. I made a presentation to Community Board 10, and then it was dropped again with Inez and perkins. Everyone agreed they was giving me the run around and it's dropped again, but it's a very active playground. It has two leaves in. It has many schools that come there and yet there is no bathroom. The basketball court is cracked from one end to the other. The fountains are outdated. It really needs work in that playground. It's been 20 years since 20 years. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, yes, so we definitely need to to take a look at that Steve. Do you have any comment on prospects for that part? Well, I have to say that I agree with Rose. I would like to see a comfort station. You know it's a you know. 30 years ago is maybe times have changed, maybe we can figure out a better place to locate it. You know I respect whatever what Sheena says she has great ex experience and no and knowledge about the situation, but you know if we can rustle up the money for a comfort station. You know it's going to cost. Maybe two three could cost even more than three million, but you know you know wherever we can provide one, we should try to do it and if there's room in this playground, you know I'm open to trying to figure that out. So you know the question of course comes down to money, but keeping it on your list, keeping it keeping. What you say before keeping Hope alive is a legitimate thing is, is certainly a valuable thing for the community Board to do, and- and I would I would I would- I would see every reason to keep this on your list. Okay, and can I add if we could, as far as community members, if we can get, let's say someone to maybe help with the finances? I need to know I'll reach out to whomever on a price. How much would it cost? How much would it cost if we was to get a compensation if we were to get our basketball court fixed? Can someone give me a price so that we can have a gold and then maybe I know a lot of people and there's other people who know other people and it's a community thing, and so we can help, maybe defray some of the course, but I just do not know like. What's a figure, can someone give us an estimate so that we can help well I'd, say the the course of the comfort stations is is a little difficult to just estimate. There'd have to be some. I mean some research done as to the plumbing lines and whether or not they now need to be replaced because they're pretty old, I'm sure so you know the the costs we've been doing lately have varied, as I mentioned before, they've been coming in anywhere between two and four million dollars for brand new comfort stations. So you know I it would be pr. I would have to get somebody in our capital division. You know if this became a serious consideration, then I would have somebody do some. You know some real research into this. It would be much easier for me to to give you an estimate for the basketball courts. You know that would be pretty easy to determine. We just have to look at the square footage, but the conversations is you know there would be a there would be a range. So it's not that easy, okay, so Steve. When can we make that happen? When is that? When can we have someone come out and do an assessment? Oh god, I do not know I you know I mean I do not know that. Well, I do not know. Let me let me give that some thought and I have to consult with the people in my capital division. Okay, so when should we get back to you on that? Well, let me first see how high you rank it. Okay! Well, let me let me let me see how much support we have for so I can explain that to the people in the capital division that this is something the community really wants. So is this. Is this something that would be done after we submit the district needs statement? Yes, okay! Thank you, Steve! Thank you. Any other comments or questions about the district needs state of these bugs these are actually budget priorities. Budget requests so Aaron. You can take a look. Yes, I'm sorry! I had to go out and walk the dog and I apologize so I'm thinking, Steve, Wheat and sheena. We talked about that flooding in Jackie, Robinson Park, while they were still doing the run- up. Renovations. Has anything happened with that because you know when it rains it really floods, it confuses the basketball, the baseball field. Everything is flooded, has anything come out of that we've been talking about it for a while. Now this is the. This is another good request on you for your list. This requires a you know, a serious capital project to redo the drainage and and the lines and the in the basketball courts and and in the baseball fields. This is a good. This is a good item for your list. Okay, what I would like to do is to send this out to the committee members and have you review it and make your comments and submit them on a before Friday? Is that something that and then you can take it? You take your time and look at this at you at your leisure. Is that something okay editing? Are we just reviewing it for submission? Oh, no, editing! Okay, can I make one more suggestion? Yes, Phillip Randolph Square yeah. I really. I would really like to be able to redo that square and expand it, make it into more of a of a legitimate park. You know the D.O.T, you know, as you probably know, took out the parking lanes and then exp put in a a zone extending it southwards, towards 116Th Street. There's a potential here to really expand that square and create a decent amount of space that people could enjoy, and you know we could sit down and talk about what to do with this space. But you know I could you we could use some money to to, and you know to create a better vision of what could happen there, instead of just having some benches and and some hardscape, and I would have really appreciated if you would have that on your list as well. Yes, they phil, Randolph Square, has been very much in our in our purview. You know that we've been taking a look at over the years, so thank you for that Steve, because I can't see the list. Do you have say Nick spouse on that on that list. I believe so kind of see. If I see it here yeah. This is a crazy thing. We got. We have saint Nicholas, I yes, I thought I saw it on here. I just can't seem to find it but you're saying Saint, Nicholas Park, oh Karen, I am do not call it Saint Nicholas Park, it's it's Saint, Nicholas, South Playground. You know we recently renovated Saint Nicholas North Playground, but we did not do saint Nicholas South. So that's what Sheena is referring to. We have. We have a very nice playground at Saint Nicholas North, but we should. We should have a matching playground, two blocks to the south on the other side of the church, St Nicholas, South, okay. I think that it's in here I think it's in here, I'm not saying it, but if it's not, we can certainly include it, but in terms of you're talking about a completely a complete renovation, completely, yes, Steve. Are we going to be having another community parks, initiative or Community partnership program? I do not. I do not. You know I would love it if, but considering the city's a fiscal situation. I do not think we're. You know I'm not feeling too optimistic, but you know this was what enabled us to do was say: Nicholas, North so and then some other playgrounds in your district Martin luther King and some others. But we had a great you know. We had a great opportunity early on in the administration. We got a lot of money and we were able to renovate various parks and playgrounds that had not seen any investment for 20 or more years and and we did a lot of work in Harlem. If let me tell you, if we had a chance to extend that program, we probably would be able to do or saint Nicholas South, and this is a program that enabled us to do bojangle's playground and Fred Johnson and Harlem Lane. You know we had a lot of money and we spent it. We spent a lot of it in Harlem, which is a good thing steve, because Harlem was truly forgotten in terms of upgrading. I mean I've been listening and we talk about how there have not been resources for our children to engage in certain activities or sports, and I mean you know, I'm going to call myself a senior because I made in those playgrounds, but still you know we were forgotten for so long. So what we're seeing Steve and in this district's needs is that we do not want it to go any further. We're still here to talk about it. We want to make sure that it's there for our children and that there are facilities that they can use and be safe in. That's all we're saying no, and that and that's, and that was the great benefit of this program. In fact, if you wanted to say in your district needs statement that you want to see the community parks initiative expanded or continued and new funding allocated towards it, you won't get an argument from me. Okay, you got it and rose. I like the idea of reaching out to other entities, especially looking at because Saint Nicholas, South and north that's like HPD property over by NYCHA housing and they're falling on the HPD funding, which is federal funders. Maybe we can't even reach out you know, because they're talking about rebuilding or redoing something to the buildings, I mean we can ask, can they participate or submit some funding? I'm just thinking and talking out loud. So I'll, look at the document when you send it Karen, okay, all right and I think, for the sake of time, to move the agenda along. What I will do is I will clean this up a little bit and I'll send it out by tomorrow, all right karen. This is Kevin. I just want to say I got a text from board member Karen Dixon and she was trying to get into the room. Oh, I can't oh when I come out of this like because I can't access outfit she's going to try again so, okay, all right I'll, come out of this. So is everyone? Okay with that, so we'll move along move the agenda along and go on to the next item. So I'm just going to come out of this. Yes, I'm fine Karen! I just want to say hello and thank you and Steve, and I are going to sign off over here. Okay, all right: okay, we just had just the Harlem River park, Waterfront resiliency, we're hoping to get your input on that, but nothing there's nothing to report on that study. I can. I can check tomorrow to see where it stands, but I do not. I do not. I do not have a report to give you you know, since we get since we last gave you a report on it. Okay, yes, we had that report back in August. I believe. No, I'm sorry right, I'm June Jim yeah! I do not believe there's anything new. I can check tomorrow, but there's nothing there's nothing for me to report on, but but on these on these budget priorities. If you want to also run it by me and I'll sure have any, if I have any suggestions for you, I'll I'll certainly want to provide them. I want to I want to assist you in this effort, because what you're doing only supports what we're doing okay- and I will send that over to you too, as well Steve. Okay, all right! Thank you all right, very good. All right all right see you soon all right all right! Thank you! Everyone! Okay, thank you see you later. Do you have Miss cam? You have anything from me and you know I think I think we're good. Okay, all right, bye, miss robes! Thank you! So much for the fantastic. Thank you see you Steve. Thank you take care! Thank you guys. Okay, sorry, I just I just Wanna. I know Karen's trying to get in oh yeah. I do not see her. No, she says she's in the waiting room. I think I see. Oh she just somebody left. Oh no! I do not see her okay, I'll text her and let her know okay and I'm going to. I was to share the screen again, but the next item is statement of objectives and goals. Presentation. As you know, we we were able to. We got a fool. The full board passed unanimously. Our presentation for the Central Park Conservancy- I mean I'm sorry for the commemoration in central park for the exonerated five and social justice reform. So what we're doing now at this point we're setting up a meeting for next week, which would include myself, sicily, the chair of the Board New York City Park Sam, Biederman, Central, Park, Conservancy, Elaine adenisio, the senior vice president of Planning Chris Nolan, he's an architect who was working on the Harlem year project, the red pool renovation and also John Riddick, who was on the meeting tonight, also will include the mayor's office and from the borough president's office. So we're going to start the ball rolling on this project. So it was a lot of work, but not as long as I mean. I think, we've made a lot of ground work. We do not want to be 20 years in the making here, so we're trying to move it along. So we're very excited about that progression. So, just and then we're also working on getting letters of support was still we had hoped to have some by last week, but we're still waiting and trying to get as many as we can, which will move the project along next item is the October board. We thought we were going to be going back. We were on the September board. We got tabled for the resolution that the borough president submitted so we're going to have to we're being asked to visit the boards who are requesting presentations before we are placed back on the agenda at the borough board, so maybe by November. Well, we would go before the borough board and that those would be more. That would be more support. Especially a resolution would be fantastic. So that's where we are with that and Karen hi, I'm glad you were able to get in I'm sorry. I screamed hi good evening. Everyone, I hope everyone's well. Thank you karen you're welcome, I'm just going to go very quickly. This next item is the Harlem River Waterfront Resiliency Study, and I just want to go over it for clarification and again I'm going to share my screen so give me a moment: Karen, yes yeah. I just wanted to say one thing quickly. I put it in the chat on the exonerated five. I think if everyone can watch when they see us and also the discussion that happened, you know you need netflix or you can be a like a visitor to netflix to see it. It's four parts, but it's contemporary. It came out this year, ava, Duvernay and Oprah Winfrey. Did it but there's a discussion on youtube and that link is in the chat too. So I think, if we're going to talk about doing anything with the exonerated 5, this is a must. It came up in the community board where they were teaching us or we had the workshop with the mayor's office about. You know, race relations, but everybody should see this because it really dissects the situation and it will assist in the conversation even who you're going to meet with. They need to watch it because it's contemporary and it answers all of the questions, so I just wanted to put that on the record. Oh, I agree cherry. Thank you very much again. It's even in the chat. It should be required, watch it. Okay, there's also the documentary by Sarah, Burns and Ken Burns right, the Central park, five. Yes, the documentary and this, but because this dissects and it's now and if people have questions as to why you know what are they doing now I mean this is comprehensive component, okay, so very important. If we're going to talk about it. If everybody has not watched this, then we're not fully researched and developed on what we're talking about. Oh okay and it's in the chat, it's good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Terry! Yes, okay! I just want us to take a look now at the Harlem river climate resiliency. We had a presentation back in June, so it's something that we need to think about it's put out by the Department of City planning and it comes under the New York City Comprehensive Waterfront plan, the back in 1992, the Department of City planning released this comprehensive waterfront plan in 2008, the Office of environmental remediation was formed and the goals were to improve linkages to and along the waterfront, ensure high quality public spaces at the water's edge by establishing design guidelines, encourage public oriented, waterfront, dependent and waterfront. Enhancing uses, preserve and enhance visual corridors from the upland to the waterfront, retain and expand recreational opportunities that are enhanced by a waterfront location and plan for the development and maintenance of the public waterfront. So these are some things that we need to think about for our area. As we go forward, the plan balances competing interest. Those of industrial uses versus invest investment, so industrial uses would be the environmental values, preservation of public uses, investment in water infrastructure, waste, water treatment facilities and restoration of natural systems. The local law 49, which comes under the Department of City planning, developed the division, 2020 New York City comprehensive plan. So it's eight broad goals that are involved and it's the plan is revisited every. It is renewed every 10 years. So this is vision 2020, which we are in right now, so the goals include I'm expanding public access to the waterfront and waterways, enlivening the waterfront with the range of attractive uses integrated with adjacent adjacency to upland communities. I'm the support of economic development activity on the working waterfront, improve water quality through measures that benefit natural habitats, support public recreation and enhance waterfront areas and protect wetlands and store front habitats. I believe that our area, the East River, is a an estuary, so that's a very significant body of water, which has its own characteristics and could be used utilized for educational purposes, for students to study marine biology and that sort of thing. Another goal is to restore degraded, mature waterfront areas and protect wetlands and storefront habitats, also to enhance the public experience of the waterways that surround New York, which is called the blue network, improve governmental regulation, coordination and oversight of the waterfront and waterways, and identify and pursue strategies to increase the city's resilience to climate change, excuse the spelling of climate and left the e off and sea level rise. So resiliency is a big part of this. The study area, if you look here, the provision plan resulting from this particular study considered the area spanning from East 92nd street to East 154Th street, which would include our area, and this is a map of the topography and that examines low lying as opposed to and I'm not an expert. So I can't really explain this map to you, but this was presented, and this is a part of the presentation that was made to us back in June, and this again is a just an analysis of the area and what we need to take into consideration. Yes, who's, tahani, yes, hi Tom. What are you guys doing? I know it's a while and I do not want to extend our meeting time, but are there any warnings in this presentation, something that we need to take action on, or are they just giving us an update on what the topography of is of our area? It's preventative so for the most part, but we have had some terrible flooding in this area. So you know we do not know. We've had a lot of storms this year. The Gulf area has been hit badly. I think they've had eight storms already or something or four to eight. I mean it just seems like a phenomenon, and I think it is the most that they've had in any recent time. So so and that's so yes, I do not know of any immediate alarm anything immediate that we should be alarmed about, but we can certainly ask them to come back and give us an updated presentation. Steve said he would look to find out if there was he said there was not anything new, any new developments at this point, but he would get back to us on that in our district needs statement to include any reinforcement of these banks and borders. Anything we need to do to take these preventative measures, since I know a lot of the things that the board has been demanding, the district needs statement has been on there for a while, and so if we see the impact of climate change so much here in our area, then we should probably start throwing those into our district needs statement as well. Okay, when we, when I send it out if you could make a commentary with respect to that, we just have the information that was given to us from the Parks Department and the mayor's office on the resiliency study. So we do include this information in the narrative that we've been doing that for the last couple of years. So I hope I answered your question. Tahani yeah, absolutely I'm looking forward to getting this presentation as well and digging through it. Okay, all right! Let me just continue on so building resilience is a big part of this plan. Moving forward, the city will build resilience by engaging continued conversations which we're, having now and coordination among local stakeholders, agencies, elected officials to refine needs and identify opportunities to pilot test interventions as resources and opportunities as they become available and integrate making investments for the future by studying and incorporating best practices into projects and policies moving forward, and also with respect to what you said to Honey. There is something called the 100 year flood and I think it's a 500 year flood. So we never really know when that is what that time period is. But when that can happen, so we do need to just be prepared. So the city has already begun efforts in each of these key categories, which I just mentioned. Acrosss the neighborhood and we'll continue to pursue future work to further engage the community in building resiliency, so New York, City parks in partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corporation is making improvements to the Manhattan greenway along the Harlem river. The city will inspect the city- owned waterfront from East 125Th to West, 145Th, Street and West 155Th Street to Dikeman Street, and aim to make repairs as to critical areas. New York City parks is also developing a new seven acre park from East 1 2015 132nd, which would be the Harlem River park that will create a continuous, publicly accessible waterfront on the east side from northern Harlem to east Mid. Midtown resiliency will be a key consideration in the design of this new park, so the Harlem River park, our section runs from 142nd going north to 155Th. So we need to take a look at what's happening over there, and I know that there was some phases that it was going through and we do not. We need to find out what phase what phases have been completed and what's pending, and you can read the full report at this website. I can give everybody a moment to jot it down, or I could put it in the chat. Let me put it in the chat. Okay, it's not letting me copy it, but fine! Okay, thank you for your patience, everyone! So any questions or comments on that. Okay, oh Terry, you wanted to say something Terry. Can you unlea yeah? Thank you. Yes, if you could just put that in the chat, because I could not write it down quick enough, okay and also, I believe that part of it is in our area. You know, as you said, it's the 142nd to 155th some years ago. It has to be at least 10 or 15 years ago there was a big project for Harlem artists and they competed. I do not know if it was part of the hall of Bid or what it was, but they had each an installation in the in that park, and I know one of the artists was Omamisha who was involved with the black lives matter. Mural. Another artist was highly King Ruby, who has one of the flags up at 125Th, but that is all like overgrown and unkempt. So I think we need to really look at that, because artists competed, they did these amazing installations and it's all like overgrown and not taken care of. So I think if we engage our community artists to put something in a park, it can't just be trashed. You know very important yeah, so we could look at that yeah and that that's it. That's all. I have to say: oh okay, because I explored it maybe about a year or two ago, and it was all you know meeting you know because there's a lot of just there's a lot going on in that section of the park with homeless and different things, but if they did an installation it should be addressed and kept up. That's not what we the message we give yeah. I think yeah it's about 10 artists that competed and they had big things at the state office building for them. So we should look at them. So thank you, Terry all right. Thank you any other questions or comments. It's just something to that. We need to begin to think about and we can make suggestions. Okay with that on any new business. Okay, hearing none I'll move on an announcement, New York, City, Parks urban park rangers. It has a free tour of the Mount Morris Fire Watch tower they've had been having these tours. The next one coming up is Saturday October 24th from 2 to 3:30 P.M. They are adhering to the Covid-19 requirements for social distancing and it's a there's, a limited number of of participants who- and they also are alone, I think they're only allowing certainly a certain number of people up into the watchtower and then they're wiping down the rails before so it's a very meticulous operation, but that is going on. I can ask you to send out the detailed information, if you're, for how to contact how to get in contact if anyone is interested. Okay, any other announcements, yeah I put in the chat about the article about the reclining statue of liberty, that's being installed in morningside park and there's a whole article about it. I do not know if it's been unveiled, but a Harlem artist. Did it and you know it's, I guess to me it's just showing that you know statues monuments and different things. I do not know how long it's going to be there, but the article tells more about it, so just calling attention to it. Thank you. Thank you. Would you like to put that in the chat yeah it's in it's in the chat, there's a link yeah. It came out, I think, in like Harlem patch, but if you click on it, the whole article is going to open and tell you all about it. Yeah, okay, thank you, Mount Mars Park and it's a big reclining statue of liberty, like kind of a thing of like where is our democracy gone at this point, that kind of thing so interesting.
