I do not know if those are board members or I'm, some of our general public, but just to start off we're going to go ahead And I serve as assistant secretary of the board and vice chair of land use, I'm, not on this particular committee, but I am health on health and Echo Death Committee nice to join the meet in tonight.
, I'm, Eugenia, Tang, I'm project manager for free mobility in Vot, so I'll be presenting to you about the commercial cargo Bicycle pilot program and how we can better improve the operations.
So, as I mentioned, FDBA, is the sponsor of of an open street program under the auspices of New, York City and the Department of Transportation.
Recently, New York City announced that they were going to make the open streets and the open dining project, which is something slightly different, but make them year.
Apparently, the open, dining program will also be extended year, round, so the difference being open dining is where restaurants are permitted to have seats on the sidewalk by their restaurant, leaving an eight- foot passageway for pedestrians and also they're allowed to have sort of permanent structures built in the parking lane in front of their restaurant.
You know Fdba's program, which was the open streets program which allowed restaurants to expand even further into the street, with non- permanent seating on Friday evenings and weekends.
Are you dealing with the issue of social distancing, specifically around this, because I know that on 116Th Street, especially with Harlem tavern, there does seem to be a little bit of collection in terms of people gathering, at least even at the time that I went fairly early on sun.
We would not be allowed to do anything with anything other than restaurants because of the social distancing issue and again that was a few months ago, but the idea was that they did not want to turn it into a big sort of street fair, but we had hoped to do that, and I've heard a little bit that maybe those rel those restrictions will be relaxed going forward.
We tell them that they're not supposed to park and for my observation it has not created a problem, but I have wondered if it's creating any issues- You, know tables and people in the street, and I.
I've heard reported from some residential security cameras where they're seeing you know the spot where a restaurant would traditionally put their trash is now where their guests are seating, And, so they're putting it into other people's locations, and it's not always on days of commercial trash pickup, but they're.
Yes, I just wanted to ask in going forward and as this situation endures, what do you think you could do to improve community It has been an issue Karen I, apologize.
Let the community board know what we can do to try to engage more people, not just fragmenting Douglas, World War but Harlem as a whole, so that people will know what's going.
The motorbikes, the you know, non- commercial motorbike, people, hey, I'm, jumping real quick, so we were having community stakeholder meetings with the elected official offices.
People felt that, because they were, you, know more foot, traffic and open restaurants open streets, whereas in effect that maybe department of sanitation would consider putting more baskets due to more foot traffic.
That's a different kind of conversation, but if you want just the regular mesh wire, you know green ones, those we can easily get so, I think wanted to say something too, But just on this point, if I may, I'm happy to volunteer to do a walk along the boulevard again, this weekend.
Imagine community board 10 puts in specific requests for sanitation, not only along Federal Douglas Boulevard, but 125Th Street Corridor as well.
It's been an issue, The question that I have is, I heard you say that at a certain point, sometime, I think you said October 31st, that your alliance was going to not kind of go through the extended period of time.
That's been allotted, one of my questions about the whole process, not so much in the town, the area down where the corridor is closed for the streets, but a lot of the restaurants that have opened up they're, not always in business right.
So open, dining, permitted restaurants to go into the you know, sidewalk and parking lane and again that has nothing to do with open streets, nothing to do with FDBA.
We have no authority, I, feel like they're all benefiting and all part of the fact that it's a you know, pedestrian, mall or open street.
You know through the open street corridor, which is not permitted.
We do have a commercial bike unit that can help us with you, know education and reaching out to certain businesses that utilize , You know it's really difficult to kind of identify if they are located on the corridor.
So, some of the complaints were, you know they wanted lacks enforcement on the parking, That's more of an NYPD issue than it is a D.O.T. So I'll address that at issue with the 28th precept absolutely and then chatting lyle did reach out to me before he was out of office.
But we're thankful to be here with the transportation, historic preservation and landmarks committee to present on a dot's commercial cargo bike pilot and we're also looking to discuss a potential site location by the whole foods market on 124Th Street, And I have taken part in a number of different discussions with this committee about loading and parking around the block.
I'm, a project manager for the freight mobility unit here at DOT here to present to you about our commercial cargo, Bicycle Pilot program and Eugenia.
Just, like this location, whole foods on West 125Th Street, is working to make the switch from using trucks, fans and walkers to using cargo bikes for their local deliveries as a pilot participant.
They can load unload and stage your deliveries at the curb, but having a dedicated space with the cargo bike rails can help improve safety and efficiency of their operations.
But we work very closely with NYPD dot's parking, division, commercial Bicycles unit and safety education's team to help run this pilot as smoothly as possible.
Participants of the pilot can stop to load unload and stage your goods at the curb wherever commercial vehicles can, which is how they're currently operating right, now, but often times, you'll, find that these spa, these spaces are all parked up, and so installing cargo bike rails can help provide a dedicated space to improve and expedite their operations, safely, which we'll come back to this point later.
If cargo bikes are found left on the street on the sidewalk for a period of time, without engaging in delivery.
This is this can help alleviate issues such as bike parking on street signs, fences and trees to keep the sidewalk clear.
It has the dual purpose of both serving the outgoing cargo bike loading operation and also providing extra bike parking to the community.
That specific corner does have a fire hydrant, which should be not blocked at any time so for DOT to say that we're going to put a bike thing where bikes can park creates even a bigger problem.
Have you reached out to the residents in that block to the businesses in that block in regards to replacing, or is it just coming to the Community Board like?
I think the people on that block could have things to say and we want to hear what they have to say.
So one of the things, at least just in the discussion and discussing this in my own head when you're speaking to the community on 124Th Street, their biggest issue, as the board members know right now- is really the fact that there are a lot of people loitering literally on that corner of 124Th Street, but on 124Th, as well as Malcolm, X, Boulevard, and I.
Some have seen it as desirable to take that loading behavior of those bikes off the sidewalk, since sidewalk space is often pretty constrained and to put it in the street in you know a corral , that's that's a regulated, space, That's designated space for that particular activity.
I know that this was a program that was piloted on below 60th street That says this is a viable initiative or something that we should consider in other neighborhoods, because right, now, I do not think we have the statistics to show the cost benefits.
Like you said, a lot of the activity so far has been focused south of 60th street, but we do not see a reason why a community like Harlem should not also be able to get their groceries by cargo.
That's going to be one of the major pushbacks that a business came into our neighborhood and now they're, taking the parking for cargo bikes so that they can make deliveries.
So I, do not know where you have planned to put the bike racks on this block, but it's very busy on this corridor.
We could switch places of those five parking spaces with you know where the truck loading zone is currently or we could place them.
Thank, you so much shatik for bringing up the actual vis visuals, because I think it's important and I am currently very concerned as when you speak to all of the local organizations and block associations, as it relates to this particular area.
You know what we've seen with parking is because the vendors take so much of the parking, a lot of folks that want to do business there on 125Th. So, then they're driving around they're circling around 124Th 123rd, going into the residential areas to park, which means our residents can't park for folks that want to do commercial business.
I know we're going to wrap this conversation up, because we do have another quick presentation on historic districts, but I wanted to ask what so what are the next steps?
We get some feedback, so we can give it to you and you, and vice versa, because I do not want another situation where all the parking spaces disappear and then people are upset We want to be able to get this out to as many people Just the businesses on the block that, like I said, a lot of the people attending those programs are arriving.
10 years ago after the 125Th Street rezoning, there was an effort and concerned by community members by the board to look at landmarking to preserve the historic and cultural aspects of central Harlem proper.
You know nearly 100 years later that this area will now become a city landmark historic district again named after private first class George Brooks.
I know that we have, as a board, voted on the historic district plan that we have.
Members, but we're asking the board members to let other people in our communities know that this district needs.
