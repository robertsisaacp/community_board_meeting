Do, you think, or I'm, not sure we get maybe 30 people virtual meetings , Isaiah jenkins, so we're excited she did a lot of hard work.
It seems like this is a good way to be outside and learn history and to think about history of seneca village in the park, and you know, we know that there's just a lot of people at home with their kids wanting stuff to do, and so we want to promote this anew as an option for going out and enjoying the park, but also exploring history.
We sent a communication out to a bunch of teachers and what we're going to do is with John's help and hopefully, with your help as well, really try to make sure we're reaching schools in Harlem and teachers in Harlem and East Harlem, and you know again, other schools surrounding the park, and you know beyond that.
I mean there's already a lot of excitement around this history and a lot of interest, and we want to really build a community around seneca village that we can engage moving forward and thinking about commemoration.
I feel really strongly that this is a really important moment for thinking about seneca village, but thinking about just commemoration and monuments, and You know I think, we've been thinking a lot about how really the movement for racial justice has really exposed sort of the meaning and history of monuments in new ways.
Think that there's a lot of people thinking and working on monuments, right, now, And, so we've been also doing a lot of research and participating in various public discussions, or you know not participating.
You may have heard that they actually just got a grant from the Mellon Foundation part of this really large project that they're working on, which is to give 250 million dollars to different groups and municipalities, to really rethink and create new monuments in our cities.
And I think that it's really important to us to kind of think about all these things as part of developing a framework for thinking about commemoration And, of course, we're always thinking about the history of monuments in central Park, and you know recently, as you know, the women's rights pioneers monument was added to the park, which is the first monument to be added to the park since the 1960s.
So you know, we've been really reflecting a lot on the lessons learned from this particular project and how they can inform us going forward and also just again, the sort of history of monuments.
Think we want to think about how to develop some programs and maybe symposium and other forums for community engagement around some of these ideas as part of the process for moving forward.
Think that's really what we're working on John We look at the Harlem gateway, there's been a variety of public monuments along the northern end of the park and into central Harlem with the Harriet Tubman Ellison, and some of these other projects I feel like they've, come to be really quality projects that really engage the community and in engaging the community.
You know looking at the history of seneca village, but even to give the artists a program from which to do any kind of art.
Do you think something might be developed over the winter and then would we would we get an extension for the for this temporary exhibit You know we also do have the app now and we also are working on a larger project to do an audio guide for the entire park, which would have a seneca village, component.
It's really been amazing for people that I think about representing women in the park and what that means again to thinking about the history of monuments in central park and what it means for representation in public spaces, and all of this stuff is related to what we're thinking about with seneca village, as well.
We want to think a little bit more about what a commemorative landscape could look like versus a monument in the landscape, not that there could not be some art component or monument like component, but I think this project really had a lot to do with creating a monument and putting it in the park.
Think again, it relates to what is happening right now where people are really re- If you look at, if we maybe we start having some seminars or things where people look at what the possibilities are and the possibilities come out of the ideas of what we think about seneca village.
Think that you know what you're saying I think is really important, also because you know, based on what we understand about, why people moved to Seneca village in the first place.
Seneca village in the landscape of the park, And I think that it's really important to think about how the commemoration and interpretation of this history and today's community can really tie into what is there now.
I think, as we begin to develop it into a permanent, exhibit that we definitely should involve different community members, who are historians, writers, artists, creative people.
I mean we have a wealth of creative people, and this is not a very well- known thing in terms of seneca village, And I visited the exhibit, and I think the exhibit is a great first effort.
It was like some kind of day where dancers were dancing in the park in front of different things, I'm, not that familiar with all of the park, and so you know once again, I had now my younger grandchildren We had the GPS on We entered like at around 67th street, and we were asking people and honestly we were walking for an hour.
So I think we have to work on some ways to you know You know they're very important and they matter, and you know that will be like it is something that we're thinking about as we look at the exonerated five.
I hear a lot of great ideas, just now, so I really feel like there's going to be a lot of historical value as well as commemoration on this project.
I'm, looking at a grant, for instance, right now that I'm hoping to put in for November one that would be for some strategic planning and working on some programming ideas and conversations and meeting people.
Know, has just a real feel of home and kind of this, like just lived in family, feel of community and comfort, All of the work been concluded on on the Bradhurst Avenue Sidewalk.
We rebuilt the the pathway in the staircase at the southern end of the park, which is a major thoroughfare, as you know, but people in the Bradhurst neighborhood going up to the subway and coming home from work.
And I know that when you discuss your district needs statement further on in this in this meeting, you're going to want to also advocate for some additional work at Jackie Robinson, because we're not done with that park, we need to do more And and when we need your support to push that along.
Looking at right now is I've, been tasked by the commissioner to just kind of come up with a general starting list for things that we want to do in each park and then talk with the community boards talk with the friends and alliance groups and talk with community members.
We look to, you know, bring more wonderful things to the park, oh, and by the way, I should just say: something.
It'll look different, but if I see that a lot of dogs and people are doing things that they not I'll put the fence, back, I'm, going to probably remove it to see how it works, out, see if the it changes the atmosphere around going up to the band shell, not a good idea.
We just want to look at some ideas as to what we could do with that, and tactical urbanism is our projects that employ low- cost temporary treatments to the parks and street.
Temporary chop projects can help to encourage meaningful public engagement, which is what Jonah was speaking about in terms of making the park more attractive and inviting and will generate support for permanent projects by allowing people to experience what's possible rather than just looking at rendering.
So one thing that I've been thinking about as it relates to this project and other kind of activations, with The parks in the in the immediate and future and long term, is just in this kind of Covid-19 moment.
You know we have examples in the district of community gardens around hydroponics It's, going to be really exciting, actually to hear more and learn more about what CB10 wants with the parks and what your thoughts are, but also it gives us an opportunity to in invite people.
I think this particular study with clemson is focusing on activations in the park, but one of the tech, another example of tactical urbanism- That's happening in Harlem Right now is our use of open, streets.
I. Think that, like everything else, we can get creative with the tactical urbanism and maybe get some of our community artists and creative people to work with the crimson people to develop some things and in my just journeys through the park- It's really come to my attention, particularly in central park.
Have people explore the parks and You know which is really more for like high school kids, but I think if we could have, especially since it's during coving some family activities where people could really you know, explore the nature, be a part, get to understand that you can do, and you know, there's nothing wrong with a barbecue There's, nothing wrong with some basketball, but that they can explore other things.
You know, so I think that that's a way to open up a lot and a lot of conversation and have black and brown people really be a part.
Who's lived in Harlem , A long time he's actually a friend from college So I've already chatted with him, and this could be an example of what we're talking about on the artistic, creative side, about coming into Jackie, Robinson, Park and taking people especially.
So I think we have some have some great nature opportunities to explore that even a lot of adults do not even know what the park holds right, here.
That's when the people in the community come in and they work with the parks, engineers and architects, to begin to talk about what they like to see in the parks, and then the design plans are developed.
We will be, including that in our district's district needs statement as well, Yes, okay, I I'm a little reluctant to say that we've actually secured money for Colonel young we're, certainly in discussions with with people about the possibility of getting funding for the park, but nothing's really nothing's, really confirmed at the moment.
