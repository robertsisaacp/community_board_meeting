If any time throughout the meeting Barbara you know you can immune and say anything. You need to say: okay, we're going to go ahead and get started. I think first on our agenda. What's hearing from open streets open restaurants FDBA, so that is John Lynch good evening again. So, as I mentioned, FDBA is the sponsor of of an open street program under the auspices of New, York City and the Department of Transportation. I guess it's been since around maybe around labor day. Until now, and at this point the program well, the program started with a update or an end date of October 31st. Recently, New York City announced that they were going to make the open streets and the open dining project, which is something slightly different, but make them year round, and I think they were, I think. Even today there was a city council hearing on certain aspects of that being said, I do not think I'm pretty sure that we are not going to look to continue the program beyond the current October 31st deadline. You know just in light of the you know, weather considerations and other considerations. We would probably cut off at the end of October and then look to pick up again sometime in the spring. The apparently the open, dining program will also be extended year round, so the difference being open dining is where restaurants are permitted to have seats on the sidewalk by their restaurant, leaving an eight- foot passageway for pedestrians and also they're allowed to have sort of permanent structures built in the parking lane in front of their restaurant. So that's a different concept. That's going to also continue year round. I understand, but that sort of has nothing to do with. You know Fdba's program, which was the open streets program which allowed restaurants to expand even further into the street, with non- permanent seating on Friday evenings and weekends. So that's the current status. I mean we believe our current open street program has been a great success. Restaurant the restaurants have benefited quite a bit. I do not know that we've had any significant problems that I'm aware of, but I think it's been. It's been a rousing success and we hope to pick it up again in the spring. I have a question I think cicely dropped off, make the call maybe she's having some technical difficulties on her end. But if you guys are not going to renew the application after October 31st, how does that work with D.O.T as far as the street closures would that the streets still be closed through to the weekends? No, the street would not be closed, so the open streets is effectively what closes the streets right. So if we're not going to participate on the streets, then the streets would not be closed. You know, as far as the actual procedure for sort of you know, taking a break and picking up in the spring. I had asked some of the DOT about that and I was told that there will be some kind of procedures laid out for how one would kind of pick it up in the spring, and I guess we'll hear about that tonight. Hopefully, hi John. This is sorry, so hi John. This is cheryl great to see you. So I have. I have a question because I we have an open street on 120Th between Mount Morris, Park and Malcolm X as well. How is it that the open street do you? Are you closing the streets yourself, because I actually happened to be walking on Frederick Douglas Boulevard over the weekend, and it was very on some of the streets. It seemed like it was open and other streets. It was closed, so it there's not. It does not seem. Maybe it was early on because it was around 12:30 that it was not consistent, acrosss, the all of the streets, so by 12:30 it should all be set up. Our program runs from 112th street to 120Th Street, but there is a carve out. We, the block between 117Th and 118Th, is not part of it because for two reasons, because there's a senior center there and also that there were no restaurants there, so we asked DOT if we can carve that out, so that street remains open. The rest of them should have been locked again. It's only the avenues, not the streets themselves, not the cross streets, and you know we would like to have more barriers. That was a bit of a problem getting barriers from NYPD, so some streets, a little, are buried a little bit better than others. Hopefully, in the spring we can kind of have more robust barriers and signage and different things. Okay. Well, that's helpful to me. So that's the so there is one street in that is a break. So that's that was the street. Actually, that was the street that there was actually nothing there, but who actually closes the street. Do you close the street, or I mean, or the restaurants close the street who's doing that? Well, a little a little bit of both so f FDBA is responsible. I mean I literally drag barriers back and forth every weekend, the we encourage- and you know, try to require the restaurants on their particular blocks to take care of their corners and many of them do. But, for example, down by you, know, 112th street there's not much there. One 20th street, even though chocolate's been sort of participating. You know we definitely do it ourselves there, but you know venataria Lido, Harlem, Tavern, boulevard, Row house, they all Melba's. I think they pretty much put out their own barriers, but we always go through and check and make sure it's all, and we've also had a couple of paid interns that have been working with us for the past several weekends and that they've been very helpful, and then that gets to my other question and I'll. Let Kevin go. So are you? How are you? How are you dealing with the issue of social distancing specifically around this, because I know that on 116Th Street, especially with Harlem tavern, there does seem to be a little bit of collection in terms of people gathering, at least even at the time that I went fairly early on sun. I think it was Sunday Saturday, you know we've. Obviously you know advised all the restaurants of what they should be doing. I mean that question sort of overlaps a lot of jurisdictions. I know there's someone from D.O.T who comes on site every weekend and every she texts me christine yeah christine. Does that yeah and SLA, of course, has a big. You know they have 400 people allegedly out. Looking at all these things, D.O.T, I think, has inspectors. So you know I mean you know we honestly, you know we're probably have the you know, least, resources at least authority, because we can certainly tell people we've had a couple of problems, one restaurant in particular. We talked to again and again and again- and I spoke in the DOT about them. You know, but at the end of the day it's other than begging. You know, we've warned them that you know maybe they'll lose their license. Maybe SLA will come by maybe they'll lose their ability to participate if D.O.T is unhappy. But aside from talk, there's not much else that we've been able to do. Sorry, I'm going to let you go Kevin, I'm sorry one. Other quick question is the fact that do you have any specific programming for your block for the blocks in terms of a continuum. I'm sorry I do not. I do not understand that. Do you have any programming on the street itself program, meaning activity other than restaurants, correct? No, we we tried to talk about that and in conjunction with the board we worked with. I know Chanel was involved very much at the beginning and sicily we were. We had requested that we'd be allowed to have tabling by organizations by you know: voter registration, naacp, Ava, rice from Urban League and several others. We brought them to the walk- through, but we were told at that time. That's what I got none of it's ironically, but D.O.T said they would not. We would not be allowed to do anything with anything other than restaurants because of the social distancing issue and again that was a few months ago, but the idea was that they did not want to turn it into a big sort of street fair, but we had hoped to do that, and I've heard a little bit that maybe those rel those restrictions will be relaxed going forward. But I know first corinthians about the church wanted to do voter registration. I told them, you know, please go do it, but just know that you know you know. We can't authorize you to do it and you know, but we were happy for them to do it. You know there have been a couple of other things that we, you know it's fine with us, but we were told that officially it was not permitted thanks, Cheryl Kevin, you had a question, I believe Karen had a question after you. So thank you first question. It seems to me that with the streets closed, they're still parking along Federal, Douglas Boulevard and is that is that allowable? Is that creating any problems in the evenings? I'm still seeing, at least on my block, a lot of cars that are parked, I'm just curious about what prevents somebody from pulling in and parking and leaving. If it's in fact a closed, open yeah we put signs up. I do not know if they've been as robust lately, but certainly we tried to put up signs, no parking signs, the you know the barriers can not block cars. In fact we're not allowed. You know we have to leave an emergency lane open, so we have to allow you know a fast motor vehicle to come through there. So, yes, cars physically can come in and out. We talked to NYPD about that and we talked to D.O.T about it. We were told that NYPD is not chose not to enforce the no parking streets and again, if someone here knows something different, but that's what we were told at the beginning. So really just you know, we put the signs up and we kind of you know when people come by. We tell them if they ask questions. Hey. Is it closed? What's the story, we tell them that they're not supposed to park and for my observation it has not created a problem, but I have wondered if it's creating any issues- and you know there are a couple of blocks where there's a lot more. You know tables and people in the street, and I just wonder if that has created any aggression or there's been any. You know thumping on the roofs of coffee yeah, not that I'm aware of we made. We may try something next week. That's a good idea. I do have some other questions that are less so about the open streets program, but about the bump outs on Frederick Douglas Boulevard. I do not want to direct those to Federal Douglas Boulevard Alliance, if that's not appropriate, because I think that's a larger city conversations. Do you mean the the parking lot yeah? The you know, the extended seating that goes into the parking lanes. Is that something we can discuss here now or not? Oh ahead, Kevin, I'm about to have a question and John again. If this is not really under your purview, I think I'm sharing it. It's just an observation, and it's not it's not true of every location on Frederick's boulevard, but we are seeing certain locations where there's a an accumulation of trash that builds up over multiple days. I've heard reported from some residential security cameras where they're seeing you know the spot where a restaurant would traditionally put their trash is now where their guests are seating and so they're putting it into other people's locations, and it's not always on days of commercial trash pickup, but they're actually seeing this on video footage. So, with these bump outs, I am seeing a build up of trash in certain locations and two after the rain that we had yesterday on my walk. This morning I noticed several areas where the water flow can no longer traverse the sea, the seat outs, and so this flooding that's happening between these seated islands. In the architecture of these design spaces, they forgot to put a plumbing irrigation system, and I just I do worry about that as we head into the winter months as slush and rain accumulates, and it does not drain into drains just there's. You know deep areas of water building up and I just wonder what can be communicated to the restaurants about needing to remedy that and again, I'm sure this is happening. Acrosss the city. But those are my comments. Well, all I'll quickly say is that if there are particular restaurants in the FDA pro FDBA program that you know, but I'm we're happy to hear about it and say something if it's appropriate. But yes, that is clearly a you know, not even just a frederick douglass issue or even a Harlem issue, but obviously a city- wide issue, so I'll defer to the D.O.T folks about that thanks, John Kevin. If there are specific locations where you are, you are seeing the ponding. I think it would be extraordinarily helpful for you and the board to you know, compile those take pictures and send those over to the DOT team. Just so we can start to take a look. I yeah I have not heard from anyone today, but I do know yesterday it rained all day, so any photos that you can share would be helpful. Great noted, thank you thank you Karen and then Donna Gill. Yes, I just wanted to ask in going forward and as this situation endures, what do you think you could do to improve community buy- in or if you even think that that's and it has been an issue Karen I apologize. Would that was that directed to me? Yes, I'm sorry John to you. Yes, I'm sorry. Could you just repeat: I was distracted for a moment. I apologize. I wanted to know if you felt you had community buy- in and if not, how do you think you could improve that, for instance, getting more of the community to come out and support just in going forward? How do you think you would could improve that yeah? Well, certainly, I mean D.O.T required us to do a fair amount of outreach. We did that through our email list through putting posters in lobbies- and you know giving it to various building associations that we know about. We we did a petition drive, so we got we got signatures from folks, but you know we're. I mean that's what we did on the FDBA block itself. We certainly did not hear any negative feedback as a result of that out outreach other than the senior center on 17th 18th. Raising a question about hey. What's going to you know, we need this street open and I immediately said: yeah, that's fine. We can. We can do that. You know this all happened fairly quickly. So there's a lot of things that we're looking at next year. We hope to frankly get restaurants to start paying more dues to us. We hope to raise some more money. We hope to have better signage. We hope they have better barriers. We hope to have better outreach. You know there's a lot that we will. You know sort of tweak and improve upon, but we did. You know we did walk throughs. We spoke to every business, not even just restaurants. We had people walking through talking to all the businesses, and you know obviously it's hard to talk to all the residents, but we did put posters in the various buildings. Thank you. Thank you, Karen and John. Just so you know when you all do open next year spring. Please let the community board know what we can do to try to engage more people, not just fragmenting Douglas, World War but Harlem as a whole, so that people will know what's going on, know the bus routes and feel you know I guess comfortable about coming in and just get the word out that we are shedding these with the street down, for you know the for us to enjoy it, but also to really support our businesses on that restaurant road that we have so we'll. Definitely, you know try to help out as much as we can in the spring and even before. If you want to start talking about it, come December yeah. No, we plan to plan this. You know tomorrow. Thank you. Yes, we want to be involved, no, not literally, but no I mean, I hope not. But yes, when you do start having those conversations make sure we want to be involved and help out as much as we can Donna. I think you had a question. I do John. How are you it's good? I do not see you, but I hear you I know there you are. I was concerned about enforcement because from what I understand that you said, the 28th is not really being very cooperative about enforcing the streets and I happen to be out there on Saturday and these people with motorized bikes were riding down the streets and I'm thinking wait. A second people are walking. There's elderly people, no one is stopping them. I know cars can not go through, but things like motorized bikes and just bikes in general. Is there anything any you thought about enforcing the fact that it needs to be just for walking more so than you know things like that? That's right, yeah! Well, the point I made before was that NYPD was not enforcing the no parking rules. Okay. Now, whether you know I mean and we've had, we've had conference calls with them. I mean they know that this is going on. You know we beg them for more barriers at the beginning and they were not really helpful, but they did end up giving us some more. You know I do not know what their view is of that kind of enforcement. I feel like every weekend I tend to see police cars sort of at different ends. I do not know if they're there, because of open streets or for other reasons the like, I said you know we're not we're not allowed to create an impermeable barrier, because if you know we're required to keep fifth at least 15 feet in the middle open. So again in theory- and you know, fire engine ambulance should be able to just sort of drive through unimpeded. That obviously means that a motorbike could drive through a bicycle, I'm probably less concerned about bicycles than I would be about the you know the motor scooters. So you know I do not. You know that's something. We can certainly raise about continuing discussions with NYPD. I do not know what their reaction would be to asking them to ban motorbikes from fdb. That would be nice and they could do it throughout all of Harlem. Well, motorized bicycles as well, not just motorbikes, because the bicycles are motorized right now and everybody's sort of right on those and those can go pretty fast. So you can't really get out of the way as quickly. So that was my concern because being out there walking in the streets- and you know- and actually there was a car that was driving through there and I'm like. Why are you driving to do? Not you see the barrier, so I mean I did not feel like being the police and saying you're not supposed to drive through here, and I did not know how the motorists would take it. You know. So that was just my concern with you know: enforcement. You know, I mean Maya is some. I have not I'm not aware of any additional NYPD presence or interest again. You know, DOT is here on this call and they have you know nearly a hundred open street programs that they've been dealing with. I do not know if they've have any insight on this issue that you're talking about as far as traffic and motorbikes or enforcing the you know the no car ban at all. Can I just say this is cheryl and I'll second, that in the sense that on 120Th Street, the biggest issue has been the motorized bicycles that are moving. I did not realize that we had such we had so many motorized bicycles, electronic bicycles that are going. It seems like 50 miles an hour when they're trying to get to the delivery. It's that's been a huge problem. Yeah, you know. When I went down and raised, I met at first. I thought you were talking about the you know. The motorbikes, the you know, non- commercial motorbike people, hey, I'm jumping real quick, so we were having community stakeholder meetings with the elected official offices. A few issues came up and that's why we reached out to the mayor's office department of sanitation as well as D.O.T, to answer any of the constituent issues, a few people who are now called they said they were going to be on the call tonight. I do not see that they're on the call, so I just wanted to ask a couple of their questions that I remember are from the meeting. So the first one was around department of sanitation. People felt that, because they were, you, know more foot, traffic and open restaurants open streets, whereas in effect that maybe department of sanitation would consider putting more baskets due to more foot traffic. When us, when I reached out to the agency, the response was that there was no plans to put more baskets on Frederick Douglass Boulevard. So I just wanted to know if Marissa could speak to that at all. Hey! Thank you teague. So at the moment there are no plans to put more litter baskets, but if you send me in an email should seek specific locations on private, douglas or anywhere in the district, then I'll send that over to our bureau of collection and cleaning and then we'll send an investigator will send a supervisor out there just to take a look at the area and see if it is warranted. It has to meet certain requirements, for any litter basket, specifically has to be in a commercial strip, which I think this will fit the bill. If you can just email those to me, that would be really helpful and then I can send it over and we'll investigate no problem. Thank you, Marisa Mike. Can you can I just jump in quickly now the baskets that you would put in? Are they just the regular baskets that allow rats to jump in and out or baskets that have a that have the covers? It would be the regular mesh right, okay, yeah, the not so great for rats, yeah, well, the fun ones for rats, I would say: yeah I'll have to see about other ones for any of the bigger ones and the fancier ones they have to be paid for with extra funding. So I do not know you know that's a different kind of conversation, but if you want just the regular mesh wire, you know green ones, those we can easily get so, and I know Barbara Nelson. I think wanted to say something too, but just on this point, if I may, I'm happy to volunteer to do a walk along the boulevard again this weekend. I do it every weekend and you know the these wire mesh baskets are, you know, prominently placed, but the reality is come Saturday morning. Definitely by Sunday, they're filled with coffee cups and sandwich wrappers and boxes and other you know, illegal dumping trash that happens along the corridor. So you know, I think, we've seen you know as the boulevard has flourished and it's in its opening of restaurants- and you know it's an exciting place to be in to walk, but the infrastructure to support the activity on the street has not kept pace with. You know even the reopening, so I'm happy to take on a little photographic journey and document some of the things that I see, because what happens is those litter boxes overflow and they sit? Yes, the rats are crawling in as they do other places in the city, but we're also seeing you know. We have rat burrows and the tree beds all along federal, dragons Boulevard because of the trash. That's sitting there and for extended periods of time from the commercial properties. So it's a you know it's a systemic issue on the street, there's a lot of food sources and there's a lot of uncovered trash containers. So I know it's not a new issue for us to be discussing and again this is not my committee, but you know as we're heading into the district needs period and our budget allocations. This will not be the first time I imagine community board 10 puts in specific requests for sanitation, not only along Federal Douglas Boulevard, but 125Th Street Corridor as well. So you know, I think that that's true, it's been an issue and you know it's something that we really need to get some solutions around. Well, yes, I was trying to jump in early at John high long time, so the question that I have is, I heard you say that at a certain point sometime, I think you said October 31st, that your alliance was going to not kind of go through the extended period of time. That's been allotted one of my questions about the whole process, not so much in the town, the area down where the corridor is closed for the streets, but a lot of the restaurants that have opened up they're, not always in business right. So, if they're only open on the weekend when they make you know during the brunch hours when for some of them there's one particularly up here near me and there's no, as I heard mentioned earlier, they're not wearing masks. I know that we're not the people police, but my concern is what part of that process. I do not know what their application consisted of in terms of when they'll be opening, so now you're saying that some will be causing. Is there any way that there'll be a list of something forwarded so we'll know which ones are no longer part of the street open streets and which ones will be yeah? I think that's totally doable it's a little bit of a gray area because you have again the open, dining and the open streets, so open dining, permitted restaurants to go into the you know, sidewalk and parking lane and again that has nothing to do with open streets, nothing to do with FDBA. You know in technically in theory, yeah the open streets allow them to go further out, another 17 feet or something into the street, so there are, and each restaurant once FDBA got sort of authority to be the sponsor each restaurant had to put in their own individual application for the extended open streets. The weekend program I mean I technically do not know which restaurants did or did not. I know that there are some restaurants that appear to not have ever extended into the street, but you know, but yet they you know they have their parking lane parking in there. You know they're all part of the overall experience of no traffic and all- and I'm you know, I'm perfectly, I'm fine with that. So so to answer your question yeah I mean we're happy to certainly provide information of which restaurants are actually doing open streets into the street and which ones are not. I mean I could sort of tell you off the top of my head, which one are you know, but again you know we I mean I kind of consider it all. Would you know, even though you know half my answer was saying hey, you know we have nothing to do with that and we have no authority, but you know the other half is like yeah. I feel like they're all benefiting and all part of the fact that it's a you know pedestrian, mall or open street. However, you want to think of it. Okay, thank you. You're welcome, Barbara. Thank you, Jennifer. I wanted to wrap back around with what you were going to say about the enforcement. If you had like the question that was earlier, if you had anything to add about the motorbike enforcement or anything that you had seen in other barrels or other open streets sure- and so I just wanted to clarify- we are talking about E- bikes. As opposed to motorcycles, is that correct, yes, electric bikes Donna? Is that correct? Yeah, yes great? And so it sounds like the e- bikes are still traversing. You know through the open street corridor, which is not permitted right. These are closed streets. Those lanes are only open, as John said, for you know, emergency vehicles and that type of purpose. We have heard this type of complaint along some of the corridors, but if there are, you know we'd like to take a look. Sometimes we have a commercial bike unit. Let me just turn that sound off I apologize. We do have a commercial bike unit that can help us with you, know education and reaching out to certain businesses that utilize, those e- bikes, but we do have trouble. You know it's really difficult to kind of identify if they are located on the corridor if they're just traveling through the corridor. If you see a tag on the e- bike, that's something that could help like if it's seamless or grubhub that's something that we could also look into. But you know, unfortunately, this is kind of a city- wide issue. If there are certain blocks along the corridor, where you're seeing more of this issue, we can reach out to some of our sister agencies to see how we could kind of like have conversations with these folks or you know, try to kind of cramp down on that. It's not. I do not think it's the answer that you want, but you know it is something that we're aware of, and you know it's a difficult one to kind of you know, there's no silver bullet here. Thank you, Jennifer Thanks shati did you have anything else from our community meeting? I think that was it only because NYPD is not on the call, and I guess they would be the agency that deals with the enforcement with parking. I did bring it to the attention of lyle. I do not know if he fought it to you Jennifer, but just to put it on record. So what happens is once the street closes down on Frederick Douglas Boulevard, all of the cars that would have parked there on the weekend nights and the days they did not force the park and park on other avenues. The avenues that they park on are at one specifically is Adam Clinton powell on boulevard along the median. So some of the complaints were, you know they wanted lacks enforcement on the parking and they just wanted to make sure that if the parks the cars were on the median that they would not be told or they would not be issued violations. But I guess that's more of an NYPD issue than it is a D.O.T, so I'll address that at issue with the 28th precept absolutely and then chatting lyle did reach out to me before he was out of office and we chatted a little bit. You know, as John mentioned in terms of parking enforcement. Nypd is not we're not relying on NYPD for parking enforcement for open streets and open streets, restaurants, but you know we can also try to reach out to the 208 as well as you to mention that there is kind of this displacement of passenger vehicles during the weekend hours. Thank you. That's it for me. Cicely thanks Shatik, and I am so sorry that I forgot to introduce Shatek Mitchell, our wonderful Diligent district manager Shatik. I apologize for that. Oh no problem, so I believe that might be it for the conversation on Ftba FDBA, open streets. Just one quick thing: Jennifer, have you seen any increased complaints about the m10 how's, the m10 running? We love our m10 bus. So how is that running on the weekends and how frequently? And where is it so? The Manhattan DOT office has not received those types of complaints, but we can reach out to our MTA and transit authority colleagues to see if folks have been reaching out about the MTA m10 rerouting. Okay. Is it still on the Manhattan avenue? That's my understanding. Yes, okay, they were, they were invited to this meeting of MTA. Yes, okay, but we'll follow up with them. If there's any other issues right. Okay, all right! Thank you. If there are no other questions about open streets, open restaurants, FDBA we're going to move on. Thank you so much John for coming out. Definitely we will continue to support FDBA and anything you guys are doing we'll continue to support you. It's good to see you all good to see. You too, I might even hang out and listen a little more okay, you're welcome like old times. Okay. I can't vote right now. That's okay, yeah! So we're going to move on Jennifer. I think you had another presentation: the freight bikes cargo bikes, I'm sorry! If I'm getting it wrong, no, not a problem thanks to silly and thanks everybody again for having D.O.T on for our presentation. So I know that you Jenya and Jeffrey or Jeremy Pardon and Sherry- introduce themselves earlier, but we're thankful to be here with the transportation, historic preservation and landmarks committee to present on a dot's commercial cargo bike pilot and we're also looking to discuss a potential site location by the whole foods market on 124Th Street, and so I just want to mention that you know. I know that lyle Ed and I have taken part in a number of different discussions with this committee about loading and parking around the block. So I just want to put that out there and mention that up front following our presentation, my colleagues and I will be on to answer any questions that you may have and we're looking forward to hear what the board thinks about the proposal. So with that I'd like to hand it off to Eugenia who's, going to share her screen and walk us through tonight's presentation. I'm sorry! Okay, can everyone see this? I see a blank screen, but it looks like you're screen sharing eugene here, oh okay, it's just loading; okay, great good, all right, hi! Everyone! Thank you for having us here today. My name is Eugenia Tang, I'm a project manager for the freight mobility unit here at DOT here to present to you about our commercial cargo, Bicycle Pilot program and Eugenia. Sorry to stop the momentum here. I personally can't see the presentation at the moment. I do not know if anyone else is having that issue. Oh it's! I can not either it's just buffering yeah, it's just a black screen. A hack is, if whoever's the host of this meeting can just share your screen, then stop and then you genie. I should try again. I do this all the time and work zooms. Okay, the stop share. Okay! Let me just try like oh okay, try it now. Can you see it now? No, not yet! Yes, if you want, I mean you can email the presentation to me. I can try it on my end. If it, you know if it continues to give you issues, what was the hack that someone suggested it's tiff, Sicily so Shatik, if you're sharing, if you're the, if you're the host Shauti share your screen to share any screen right, quick, then just exit out of it and then she can try again it might work. You know what I'm saying all right give me one. Second yeah just share like any screen: great okay. So then you exit and then she should try again. So it's the same issue still the black blank screen yeah. I can send you the presentation in just a second thanks everyone for your patience here. Is it small enough, a pdf all right, just making sure Jeremy? I have this as a pdf, correct, okay, Eugenia! Do you is that the latest version in Pdf form? I do not think so. Let me just Jennifer I'll, send it to you hey great. Thank you sit down all right thanks. I will be up and running in just a Sec. I hope sorry, I'm just going to try one more time since we're waiting. I think that did the trick yep, you see it yes, okay great. I was like sorry about that. Everyone still good yes, okay, great okay, starting off from the top, so my name is Eugenia Tang, I'm a project manager for the freight mobility unit at DOT here to present to you about our commercial cargo bicycle pilot program and how installing cargo bike rails can help the pilot run more efficiently. This here is an image showing the cargo bikes operating out of the whole foods, location and lower east side, currently using the space at the curb without a cargo bike corral. Just like this location, whole foods on West 125Th Street is working to make the switch from using trucks, fans and walkers to using cargo bikes for their local deliveries as a pilot participant, they can load unload and stage your deliveries at the curb, but having a dedicated space with the cargo bike rails can help improve safety and efficiency of their operations. For this presentation, I'll start off by giving a background of the commercial Cargo Bicycle pilot program and then I'll go through the bike corel program and how it can improve the operations of pilot with the new cargo Bike Corral design. I'll talk more about this and our ideas of a potential installation site along with some next steps. So back in December of last year, we held a mayoral press event announcing the launch of the commercial Cargo Bicycle pilot program. This pilot allows companies to partner with the Ut in making the switch from using the typical trucks and vans to using these zero emissions. Cargo bicycles for a safer, more sustainable and efficient way of delivering goods in dense neighborhoods. We launched a program with Amazon, Dhl and ups with about 100 bikes at the time and has, since grown to now, also have fedex and reef technology on board. So now we're looking at about 200 bikes that are operating in the pilot and it's continuing to grow. So we had initially stated that this would be a six month pilot, but it's been extended. This program is managed by the free mobility unit. In DOT, but we work very closely with NYPD dot's parking division, commercial Bicycles unit and safety education's team to help run this pilot as smoothly as possible. Particip participants of the pilot are given five guidelines which she had all agreed to follow. First, is the vehicle specification participants are permitted to ride on bike lanes if it's no more than 4 feet wide 10 feet in length 16 if they have a touch trailer, as shown in this image and 7 feet in height, any vehicles outside of these dimensions are still allowed to join the pilot, but they have to use the vehicle travel lanes. Parking on sidewalks are permitted only if the vehicles, the sidewalk is on sorry parking on the sidewalk is permitted only if the vehicle is under three and a half feet wide ten feet, long and four feet. Tall proper equipment is also required for these cyclists, such as lights, a bell and labeling of the businesses and a unique bag. I d for ease of identification. All cargo carried by the cargo bikes must be safely secured, so nothing can be hanging out and operators are given a speed limit of 12 miles per hour, including using contact, sensitive speeds in busy pedestrian areas and are to wear safety vesses and like a like helmet and a reflective vest at all times. Also since the Hudson river and the East River greenways are reserved for recreational use and has geometric constraints, participants are not allowed to use these two pads. Participants of the pilot can stop to load unload and stage your goods at the curb wherever commercial vehicles can, which is how they're currently operating right now, but often times, you'll, find that these spa, these spaces are all parked up, and so installing cargo bike rails can help provide a dedicated space to improve and expedite their operations safely, which we'll come back to this point later on. Operators are required to go through a mandatory training session, which goes through the traffic rules and the guidelines of the pilot, and, as for enforcement, cargo bikes do not have a license plate, but operators found violating the traffic rules such as riding the wrong direction, riding on the sidewalk or failure to stop at a stop sign are subject to receiving moving violations. If cargo bikes are found left on the street on the sidewalk for a period of time, without engaging in delivery operations, NYPD has the right to come in and remove it off of the streets. Also dot's commercial bicycle unit also has the power to issue any fines to businesses that do not properly equip their bicycles or their delivery. Cyclists with proper safety equipment, cargo bikes are fairly new to New York City, and we want to promote the use of cargo bikes for local deliveries so as a way for us to learn more about them. It's through this pilot. We require participants to provide data on their operations to get a better understanding to questions such as what neighborhoods are serving, how many trips they're making and how long an average trend is with the shared data and the frequent meetings that we have with participants. This can help DOT better understand how we plan and integrate cargo bikes in the city streetscape. So how can we improve the operations of cargo bikes by providing a safe space for bikes? Cargo bike rails can be installed through duty's bike corral program, an application based program to provide increased bike parking capacity at the curb using these bike. Racks shown in the image below these bike trails are installed where there's a high demand of bike parking and where sidewalk space can be limited. So this is this can help alleviate issues such as bike parking on street signs, fences and trees to keep the sidewalk clear. So here we're looking at an aerial view of West 124Th Street, with the curb regulations shown in color coded blocks, the yellow, representing where the truck loading is and the blue, representing where the two- hour metered parking, is so we're. Looking at is the possibility of installing a cargo bike at potentially one of these locations, as shown in the black dash line here so having dedicated bike parking available with the cargo bike, corrals not only moves bikes off of the sidewalk, but since it's conveniently located by the by a commercial quarter, West 125Th, Street and corrals, the corrals provide a free, convenient and short- term parking for all bikes. Whole foods will be maintaining this space, the cargo bike corrals to ensure that it will be clear of snow debris and will be reporting any derelict bikes. So, taking a quick look at this drawing here to show you an example of what a cargo bike rail could potentially look like the space will be marked out with bike racks, flexible bollards and markings on the curbside lane. These cargo bike corrals can fit up to six bikes on each end, secured on the bike racks and have space for multiple cargo bikes to fit in the metal. Cargo bikes are not to stick out of the marked out space or block the travel lane, so they can either park parallel or at an angle to the curb, depending on the dimensions of the bikes. So the next steps here is to see if we can explore the potential of installing a cargo bike corral late this year with continued monitoring and observations. Thank you we're here to answer any questions. Thank you Eugenia. So, just to kind of wrap up the presentation. I think if we could just turn back to slide 11 to kick off any questions. This slide shows what a typical bike corral looks like and what could be used for the cargo bike corral that's being proposed. I know that Eugenia had mentioned that there are two potential sites along the whole foods frontage on 124Th, Street, West of Lennox Avenue, and you know we're really enjoy we're really here to just present the updates on our cricoberk pilot cargo, Bike pilot and hear the board spots on. You know the potential of installing this corral here on one two, four. Thank you. I believe we do have a question already marcus. You have your hand raised. Yes, thank you Sicily. I had a question. If whole foods already has a loading dock, then why would we need to install another cargo space for their deliveries? Yeah Eugenia feel free to interrupt me at any point. The loading bay is mostly for incoming goods which come in via truck, so the larger vehicles deliver the goods to the store and are unpacked and put on the shelves, and then the outgoing deliveries are really what's happening. Now, especially with Covid-19 is a lot a lot. More people are ordering groceries on the internet, so there's no space for the cargo bikes in the loading bay itself, because that's for incoming goods, but we want to make space for the outgoing deliveries and that's what the cargo bike corral would serve Gotcha and are we do we know how many parking spaces this would take up or another question I had as well is: if I'm just a regular bike user, could I park my bike there? Is it just you know, commercial bikes that can be placed there and then like when I come back, my bike is gone yeah, so both good questions. It depends on what regulation we'd place the cargo Bike in Eugenia, a few thumb ahead. One slide, maybe or one more this one, no forward. Sorry the one with the blocked out yeah this exactly so it you know. If it were, we have two options here. If it were to go in the loading zone, it would not take any daytime parking spaces. If it were to go in the two- hour meter parking, it would take approximately five metered spaces which we would seek to replace in other locations, either directly on 124Th Street or around the corner somewhere. So it's about a hundred feet. Long, which is you know, 100 divided by 20, is five spaces. Each car takes up about 20 feet of curbside space and then to your second question about whether you could park there with your personal bike sure we welcome shoppers or just people who are visiting friends in the vicinity to park their bikes on the racks. It's it has the dual purpose of both serving the outgoing cargo bike loading operation and also providing extra bike parking to the community. Is this coming out of the dot's budget, or is this funded by the participating companies like Amazon or maybe whole foods or dhl yeah? It's part of both so they're, covering all the maintenance costs and we are covering the installation costs. Oh, I have a question. I'm sorry, I can't seem to raise my hand but we're talking about one business, which is whole foods requesting to take up additional parking spaces. So in our neighborhoods we have difficulty finding parking. So when you're talking about one store saying that they want to take a parking five spots just to ease their delivery, that's a bit much for our community and when you say you'll replace them somewhere else, I'm trying to figure out where would you actually replace them? I mean that should be part of the presentation as well, because I'm sure you know that question was coming or the statement was coming, yeah totally fair question the five spaces it would take up. If the corral landed in the existing loading zone. We see that as sort of an even trade in part, because what whole foods has stated is if they can have a bike corral here, it would allow them to switch their operations from delivery, vans to delivery, bicycles and, obviously, delivery bicycles, take up far less space and, as we've observed, the vans are already using that truck loading space and parking throughout the existing truck loading zone. If they could switch from vans to cargo bikes, they take up a lot much a lot, a lot less space immediately and that's their goal, because cargo bikes are more cost effective, more nimble, more efficient, you know, are less polluting, do not double park all of those potential advantages so from what I'm hearing Jeremy. But what are you going to do with the fire hydrant on the corner? That specific corner does have a fire hydrant, which should be not blocked at any time so for DOT to say that we're going to put a bike thing where bikes can park creates even a bigger problem. So my concern is: what are we going to do to for the safety of the residents who live in that area and they need to use that fire hiking? We have to go to the store and say move your bikes, so we would place the corral clear of the fire hydrant, giving at least 15 feet of clearance, which is the required amount. If we, if we did decide to place it in location, two that you see here, which is the one you're referencing and those spaces, we could theoretically just switch the parking from location two to location one if we wanted to put the corral in location two or we could just put the corral in location, one within the truck loading zone. But you know I say this to say that there are options, and we we're here to you- know, talk them through with you and all that right. Did you guys get any? I'm sorry one more question: did you guys get any communication like? Have you reached out to the residents in that block to the businesses in that block in regards to replacing, or is it just coming to the Community Board like? Have you done any surveys done any public hearings in regards to this? Be we have not the this is the start of the community process. We'd be happy to engage in those types of efforts at the request of the board. Whoever you wanted us to talk to, I think yeah. I think the people on that block could have things to say and we want to hear what they have to say. I think for location, two and perhaps a potential location or perhaps a potential location along Malcolm X right in front of the whole food store. The most direct constituent is whole foods because it would be in front of their store or in front of the Td Bank in location two too, but we would think I'd, say we'd think twice before putting it in front of someone else's building and we would certainly want the building owner's opinion if we were to do that, this is cheryl sorry, so I actually for position number two versus position number one: how many? How many bikes do you anticipate? I see the number of stalls, how many bikes do you and potentially anticipate being utilized, so there are, there would be six racks that would be installed and those ca. You know you could use either side of the rack to lock up. You often see bikes parked to both sides of a rack, but then the space in the middle is available for loading purposes, so lots of bikes could be lined up in the space in the middle. It's really a flex space where you could, where they could put groceries as they're loading them onto bikes and distribute them throughout the community, whoever places the delivery. At that moment. Sorry so one of the things at least just in the discussion and discussing this in my own head when you're speaking to the community on 124Th Street, their biggest issue, as the board members know right now is really the fact that there are a lot of people loitering literally on that corner of 124Th Street, but on 124Th, as well as Malcolm, X Boulevard, and I think the only reason I would be potentially part partial to two is because the busier you make that area that you'd have less loitering of people just hanging out, buying selling smoking cigarettes doing whatever, but just hanging out after they've gone to a program down the block. So I mean that would be one of the benefits I would see and put in something that's an active something. That's extremely active in position, two versus put in position, one so cheryl. You see that where position one is, I believe, that's an entrance to one of their treatment programs and as the individuals that participate in that program, get older. They are now arriving and leaving in transportation through car service. So now we create a hazard for those individuals to literally get out of their cabs blocking up the traffic in the block. I'm just trying to understand why, if whole food takes up a large space, the sidewalk is fairly large that they're talking about putting it on the street as opposed to lining it up outside their store, where their windows are right. Well, first off, that's both of you provided great background. Great context, for you know, what's happening on the neighborhood level here. So thanks for that. As far as the sidewalk versus street question, some have seen it as desirable to take that loading behavior of those bikes off the sidewalk since sidewalk space is often pretty constrained and to put it in the street in you know a corral: that's that's a regulated space, that's designated space for that particular activity. It can be seen as a more organized use of the space, but certainly the point about location, one is taking a heart and location. Two seems like just off hand to be the better option from what I'm what I'm hearing Shatik I just wanted to. I know that this was a program that was piloted on below 60th street and I just want to know what are some of the results or some of the findings that stuck out that says this is a viable initiative or something that we should consider in other neighborhoods, because right now, I do not think we have the statistics to show the cost benefits or you know the pro con. So could you speak to that a little bit sure Eugenia? Do you want to talk about the growth in numbers a little bit? I do not have those numbers off the top of my head right now, but I just want to say that, because of Covid-19 and everything that's been happening throughout this year, a lot of participants were not able to operate as the level that they wanted to or anticipated the pilot to allow them to operate and do their deliveries. So there were some challenges, but from what they can do and from all the groceries that have been happening, such as foods, they've been seeing a lot of growth in wanting in their customers wanting their groceries to be delivered by cargo books. Yeah. And to add to that you know, I do not have the exact number off hand either, but from what we understand we launched with 100 cargo bikes in December 2019. We have at least 200 cargo bikes participating in the program now and we have. We went from three participants: three participating companies to five so that a lot of a lot of companies see a lot of potential in cargo bikes. Just because of how you know, they're a good way to not get tickets they're a good way to not. You know, experience conflicts with pedestrians or double parking or other types of bad road behaviors. If you will so we have that aspect of the data, and then we have the GPS data which we could. We could share some aspects of with you, like you said, a lot of the activity so far has been focused south of 60th street, but we do not see a reason why a community like Harlem should not also be able to get their groceries by cargo bike. We think it's. We think it's a nice environmentally friendly way to deliver groceries, especially with everyone getting grocery deliveries at this time. There's a major difference: Jeremy, I'm sorry, shawty, there's a major difference below 16th street and Harlem. Many of our buildings are not 25 floors. You know we you're talking about serious high- rises below 60th street, and here in Harlem we have a typical five to seven floors buildings, and so it's more as you would say, it's dense, but it's not as dense as it is below 60th street. So yeah, it's a convenience, but I do not think because either the store or certain populations that would particularly like to have their groceries delivered means that D.O.T should take away parking because I'm a driver and we have limited parking as it is. So that's going to be one of the major pushbacks that a business came into our neighborhood and now they're, taking the parking for cargo bikes so that they can make deliveries. I think that this is a good idea in terms of the environment, but I think that in the beginning stages there's going to be an overlap where you're not going to be totally dependent on the cargo there's going to be a point where there's going to be cargo bikes and there still will be trucks and vans and where that phase is out, I do not know how long it phases out, because, as long as the cargo bikes are there in the vans, are there that's going to be a lot of congestion. We do not know if that's going to go on for six months a year. So that's that that's the first thing. The second thing like Barbara was saying, even though we're not as dense building- wise, we're very dense, people- wise on 124Th Street. I'm just going to give me one. Second, I want to share my screen just so everyone can see the Corridor 124Th Street. Also, I want you guys to keep in mind that the studio Museum is doing a construction project, that's down this block and it's going to be going for at least at least a year, so I do not know where you have planned to put the bike racks on this block, but it's very busy on this corridor, so I just I just wanted to bring up that point. Can I just also so? Are you promising, if you're removing five parking spots, that those five parking spots would be replaced in the immediate area? Yeah we could. We could switch places of those five parking spaces with you know where the truck loading zone is currently or we could place them in. We could place the corral in the truck loading zone. When I tell when we talk about parking loss directly, I want to make sure that we're understanding that the truck you know placing it in the truck loading zone should not necessarily be thought of as a loss of passenger spaces. Right that you know those spaces were never accessible to vehicles anyway, but it is. It is a switch over from trucks and vans to cargo bikes and, as Shatik was mentioning that transition, the exact nature of that transition is not is not perfectly well known, but I know that in other locations it has happened pretty fast. They have an incentive to switch over fast because it's cheaper and more efficient for them to to use cargo bikes, though right now they're using vans for their deliveries throughout Harlem. Thank you so much shatik for bringing up the actual vis visuals, because I think it's important and I am currently very concerned as when you speak to all of the local organizations and block associations, as it relates to this particular area. The busier we make this especially right at the corner of 120Th and I'm sorry 124Th and Malcolm X Boulevard, I think the better at it is for moving people along that are just sitting there. So that would be the only reason I would really push for for position two for for position two for just that reason, because it's literally at the corner- and that is the corner where we're having that is one of the corners where we're having huge issues so real, quick position, two would that be in this location before you get to the fire hydrant here correct, where this car is at yeah, be from like this light pole yeah the yeah exactly so those four cars kind of right here, one of those cars is parked where the hydrant is right, yeah right, so those four cars basically are the footprint of the of the corral before you before you reach that curb cut, which is the loading dock, and I did not hear your response to Barbara. Where is it that you would think about putting those five parking spots, because that is a huge issue, huge issue right, so it's great that we have the street view brought up here. Shatek if you could turn around- and am I saying your name correctly: yes, Sir, okay, good! So if we yeah, if you, if you could go a little further down this way, you mentioned that there's construction here, but all of this all of these spaces are currently truck loading zone that you're looking at and those you know. These are truck loading zones, sorry not on the left, but on the right, which is why you see that they're, you know they're not really occupied by cars. We do not think the truck loading zone needs to be that large, especially if we can convert some of the Van traffic to cargo bikes. So we would add it back in this location. Okay, so would you be adding more than the five spots in that location? If that's the case, I guess I I'd wait to see how the operations played out, but that I would not rule that out. So if you could get more spaces that might make it worth it because 125Th if anybody's trying to- and I suggest you to talk to that book- Block Association, 124, but also 125th- about the parking and the congestion as well. The bid Association is a good resource because I was talking to them earlier about you know what we've seen with parking is because the vendors take so much of the parking, a lot of folks that want to do business there on 125Th. They can't right Barbara. So then they're driving around they're circling around 124Th 123rd going into the residential areas to park, which means our residents can't park for folks that want to do commercial business, so it causes a big issue, so that would be a good association. I think yeah. I have a question. Thank you. I hear that you know this is this is going to just be temporary right? No, this is going to be permanent, okay right because in so far as those materials are not quite concrete right, so it's temporary in a sense it could be removed, but not temporary, as in there's a planned expiration date for what we propose. Okay and, if it's removed, is it going to be removed to another area here in Harlem? That's my question and concern yeah. I guess we we'd have to play that by ear if it was if it was causing a real issue that we all acknowledged and we got consistent complaints, then I'm not quite sure, but I think we could remove it entirely without placing it somewhere else. Jeremy is we're going into the winter months. So how realistic is it that they're going to be making deliveries on a bicycle? The two have that's bad news: why'd. You have to break it to me here. Look at the almanac. We have a rough winter coming, so our prior experience is that these operators actually continue through the winter and that the bike lanes in so far as they're cleared, are still the best place and the safest place for them to be for getting these deliveries out and getting them out fast. So I applaud the bravery of some of these individuals. I could not be one of them, but yeah. I hope I answered your question there. Real quick Jeremy. Sorry, just to add to that question. Whole foods has agreed to also shovel the space. Is that right, jeremy, so it will be accessible even during those times, so you know, we've created a space that could be used all year round. Ideally I mean where would the bikes be stored, or would they stay on the remain on the street? So we do not allow overnight bike storage as part of the pilot they can. They can only be within the corral space as long as they're loading, unloading or staging, so they have to disappear somewhere into the store, basically for overnight purposes, so the so the bikes themselves are not owned by the individual delivery person they'd be owned by the company. That's good nuance: in some cases, with some delivery providers, the the cargo bikes are biked to the site, and then trailers are attached for the cargo. That then holds the groceries, so either the bikes themselves are brought to the site or a few of them are kept in, say the basement or something like that. By the way they would not be on the street overnight. Absolutely correct. Thank you, Jeremy, Sherry and Jennifer. I know we're going to wrap this conversation up because we do have another quick presentation on historic districts, but I wanted to ask what so what are the next steps? And what do you need from us is this? A letter of support is this: do you want us to hold a conversation in the community or what do you need from us next and what's the Timeline? Oh Jennifer, did you want to handle part of that question sure? Yes, I was not able to unmute myself in time, but sicily just to speak to you, know next steps we're looking for a resolution, a letter of support. If the board you know, is supportive of one of these two locations. If there's additional outreach of you know the glock stakeholders that you're looking us to reach out to that would also be helpful to get that list. So we can start reaching up to folks now and Jeremy can speak to potential installation timelines. As you know, we would be looking to try to get this on the ground at one of the two locations so that before the winter months, kind of really hit us hard right and sherry. You- and I can talk about this offline, I suppose, but we may not have the resources to install this before the end of the year, but we still it's still in our plans. If you are all in support, so you know we we'd want. We do everything to give you what you asked for basically in as short as in as short as time frame as possible. Jeremy one question: can you tell me, can you guesstimate how many of these storage bikes would be there? I would say it varies, so you know, as some are being dispatched, some are coming back in the like a rotating blob of, say, 25 bikes. You know I could estimate our if you visited the corral at any one time and when would you need us to give you a resolution from the full board? So this is the first time we're hearing about it. I do not know, and we've got a couple of asks for you guys to do some community outreach. I do not believe that right now we are prepared to vote. We would like to hear some more from the community on this. So when do you need this from us, so it sounds like we still need to confirm. You know the availability of equipment, but just like I can circle back to you in the next week or so to kind of figure out. If that's you know, December or November, or even later than that I could I mean we can. I can kind of tell you and board members you can back me up or disagree. I mean we probably would look to give you the list of stakeholders, so you can start doing that outreach come back to us in November with that report. Let's take it to the December meeting and we'll vote on it there and we can have a resolution for you by December from a full board perspective, but that's what I would see that could be our that's our earliest time frame. I mean because I think we would want to hear from our community, and we want to put this out just in case. We get some feedback, so we can give it to you and you, and vice versa, because I do not want another situation where all the parking spaces disappear and then people are upset and then they see these bikes and then it's a whole thing. So we want to be able to get this out to as many people as we can especially 125Th Street Bid 124Th, Street, Cheryl Barbara, any other entities. Y' all are thinking of well just the businesses on the block that, like I said, a lot of the people attending those programs are arriving accessorized. You know right, hey you, even though it's a no parking thing, they use those spaces to wait for them to yeah. They should not. They should not be is not it, but I think the bigger thing is the Block Association on 124Th, which has become significantly more mobilized because of the issue around substance, use and diversion on the corner. There that's going to be a big one in terms of talking to them and Barbara. Also. I do think that majority of people that enter those programs are not coming in via assessor ride, they're really coming in via the bus or the train. But I think that block is the Block Association, I think, is the biggie that Block Association, the Block Association between Fifth and Malcolm, X, Boulevard. Okay, all right so we'll definitely send those names to you and those businesses. So you can do those outreach, especially if you could reach out to those as part of the 124 Street Block Association, but making sure that we touch base with those mental health clinics to make sure that they're aware of that increased traffic that'll be there and the amount of folks that will be taking packages in and out. We want everyone to be safe in that area with everything that's going on. It would also help that you give us some information on the previous pilot program and how it actually you know, bring us some numbers, how it's working any accidents, and you know people getting hurt by these fake carriers. So you know just bring us some information, because your pilot was to generate whether or not it's good enough to put it any place else. So please provide us with some information from that, as well, of course, so we'll regroup, the DOT team and then cicely will circle back. You know and finalize you know, presentation dates or you know, follow, updates for November and any other stakeholders that you'd like us to reach out to please you know, let us know we'll try our best. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, jennifer our team. I do not know freight mobility. I still see your name, but thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for having us talk soon good night. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on. I had a question. Oh hi. I did not see it no sherry's still on and I'm here and Jennifer. Yes, I just wanted to just wanted to say that you know the outreach I think is extremely important. I agree with all of that and I just like to find out to ask what the timeline would be in terms of outreach timeline in terms of outreach. Yes yeah, so I think once we receive the list from the board, they can send that over the Manhattan office and then Jeremy and Eugenia will start right away. We were doing a similar exercise with another community board in lower Manhattan we've. We had the meeting last week and we've already reached out to all the necessary parties, obviously still waiting to hear some feedback. But in terms of our reach I mean that's pretty it's pretty straightforward. We're used to doing this and we can roll it pretty quickly. I mean. Ideally, we want to come back to you as soon as possible because, as we had mentioned, it's difficult for us to implement this type of work in the winter, and so if we could potentially squeeze it in also depending on whether, if we have 60 degree weather you know days in the winter, then we can get this in this winter. If not, unfortunately, it's going to have to wait till the spring time when the weather warms up, so we're going to try and move as quickly as possible. Thank you yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Sherry. Thank you, Jennifer for hanging in there coming back on thanks we're going to have our next presentation. So I sent you all the committee the letter and I apologize for getting that out to you later. I thought I sent it earlier for landmarks. The land Park Preservation Committee talked to us in September, and us I mean Keith Taylor and I Keith Taylor is our vice chair of transformation. Landmarks. Keith. Are you on? I know you're having some issues talking. I see your phone number, that's the phone number. The 646632 number is actually Keith taylor if he could come on and talk, but there is a an initiative right now. If you all can look at the letter. Well chat. Do you have that letter and you can maybe share your screen about the one from landmarks? Yes and it actually talks about the historic district. Let me see- and I thought Keith would be great- to talk about it because he has been through the process so many times with the door and trick. So thank you. There's the letter for everyone who it's not on the committee, but the prop the study is of the area. I think it's on there because I want to be cured. The study area consists of two sections on either side of Frederick Douglas Boulevard between 136Th Street and West 140Th Street, and this is the property area that they're talking about. So this is the letter that actually went out to the neighborhood to the the homeowners there to invite them. To this conversation, that's supposed to take for place, October 21st, I think Keith is trying to talk. Can you hear me? Yes now we can hear you keith great okay. I've been trying to talk last couple of minutes. I had to start six. I want to say hello to everybody. As you all know, I've been on deployment since beginning of March, I'm upstate with the guard, and I anticipate I'll, be there at least until the end of the year, possibly going into next year, related to operation Covid-19, and so I I just wanted to state sicily just to take you back. What you were talking about. This will be very brief, a quick history. 10 years ago after the 125Th Street rezoning, there was an effort and concerned by community members by the board to look at landmarking to preserve the historic and cultural aspects of central Harlem proper. As we all know, the landmarking in communities of color is a lot less than other communities, and so, as a result of that effort, through meetings with Landmark Preservation Commission, the historic District Council Landmarks conservancy in 2011, the board produced the historic preservation plan and in this plan it identified nine area study areas that the board considered through consultation with historic preservationists, community members and other entities that those nine areas were worthy of preservation and over the years the you know the landmarks designation has been given to a number of them. I believe three of them, and we are now looking at an additional two being considered for designation, that being the strivers grow extension south, which is 136Th Street in 137Th Street, from 7th to 8th of Nanoclaim Powell to Frederick Douglas Boulevard and of the Doran's Brooks Historic district, which is 10436 from Saint Nicholas to frederick Douglass Boulevard. The two areas would be combined into one dorrance brook Historic, City, Landmark Historic district and would consist of approximately 260 buildings and residences. At this point, the Landmarks Preservation Commission is just at the outreach stage, just at the very beginning, they completed their survey of the area, and so they have deemed these name. These blocks worthy of historic preservation. So the outreach is next. That's to the homeowners they'll be having upcoming meetings for the homeowners at the end of the month. From there it gets hopefully calendared and then there'll be a hearing, public hearing and then they'll vote to designate and from that it'll go, as you know, to City Planning City Council for final approval. So it's an exciting time. If this area is if this historic district is landmark, it will be the first time in the history of the city that a historic district has been named after african- american dorits Brooks was a world war. One hero, Harlem Hell fighter, died in the process. The first park was named for Nurse First New York City Park named for African- American was named after donors Brooks prior for his class doran's, brooks at the square here, 135Th and Saint nicholas the entrance to the northbound b and C line. That little square is the first park in 1925 made for an african- american. So it's ironic, you know nearly 100 years later that this area will now become a city landmark historic district again named after private first class George Brooks. So this has been a layer of love for many people over the course of the past 10 years, and it is like, I said, an exciting time to finally see the recognition being given. That is due. So that is my brief presentation and share whatever you'd like me to do. If you want me to answer questions or if that's sufficient, that would be great keith. You could answer any questions that come up. Does anyone have any questions about this? Yes, I'm Karen. That's right! Congratulations! Keith! You definitely! I know you mentioned. People have been putting a labor of love in there. That would be you, but you would be one of those people, but it's all of us. It's a victory for all of us. We all worked hard. We all contributed our way, I'm just one small part of the whole process. I'm really happy for the people of Harlem, because it's a win for them, it's a win for them and it means that when people come, this is the 100th anniversary, as we all know, that of the home rental. When people come to Harlem, they will still be able to see the Harlem that was famous for the African Americans, who developed the Harlem renaissance. All that will still be well. I mean in this eight these areas will still be preserved for future generations, so it has. It has great significance- and I was skeptical frankly because of the developmental pressures, which were becoming more and more, you know apparent, and so the developers do not see you know historic brown, stones or buildings necessarily as properties. They see it as land to develop, and so that's a you know, really a hard fight, because developmental pressure can be pretty significant, as we all well know and have lived through with our experiences on this board. But I digress. I did not I'm not sure. If I answered any questions I think I was just excitedly talking about this is cheryl so Keith. I think it's amazing as the fact that I'm in a historic district as well in terms of Mount Morris, I am very excited that we're expanding our historic districts and protecting more and more of the properties in areas that need to be protected. I know that one of the things that Dr Samuel always talks about in addition to the libraries is the fact that you know we have not protected some institutions, as it relates to some buildings in the past that if we had they were landmarked that we would not be you know, we'd have different results in terms of what's in them, so I I'm, I think, it's great. So congratulations on the hard work well, but again, cheryl. It's a congratulations community board 10, because Landmarks Preservation Commission based their decisions and their what they did off of what we created as a board years ago. No, I do not know. I do remember- and I can't remember her name at the time that who was in charge of the Landmarks Betty Duvasson yeah Betty duvasson, when she presented that overall plan for multiple areas, though yeah so for nine. So this would be numbers four and five out of the nine to be made into historic districts based off of Community board 10's plan. So so it's a you know they have to go through a process, I'm not sure exactly how long it'll take there's a lot of variables, particularly operation. I mean not operations, but just the whole pandemic issue may slow things down or maybe it'll speed things up. I do not know, but you know I I'm a patient person and I will definitely see this through. I know. Thank you really quickly. I want to read some of the chats, so you'll just know how much these board members are. Appreciating you Barbara says: Keith is always your due diligence is always so worthy Donna Gill says, keep great work. Thank you for your diligence and hard work. I know Donna has a question and then we'll move to our guest Karen for comment. Donna did you want to say something yeah? My question is the naming because Striver's role has some historical significance in our in our in our district, so to rename that portion not taking anything away from you keith or anything away from Dorian Brooks. You know the african- american Gentleman, but I find that I that there might be some pushback, because the people that live in Striver's role are very partial to that particular name. So I you know I was just wondering about that yeah. I can very quickly answer that they have nothing to worry about. Their name is not changing and I should have been clear because I'm thinking you see the letter, but you do not have the map. The map is important. Strivers row extension south is not that's not currently named anything so right, it's not going to be changing their name it'll just and I I'm guessing. I can only guess, because I do not know, but I'm guessing, maybe administratively it's easier to just name it one district or to have it as one district as opposed to two. They did mention that they had another non-, contiguous historic district in sunset park Brooklyn. So I I'm guessing that you know for them. It makes sense to just combine the two since they frederick douglass the only thing that splits them up the two okay, the two areas that we had proposed, but no we're not we're not when you do the outreach that clarity needs to be to be told to the to the people that actually live in that area, because I was confused with your explanation. So when the when the letters were given out, the maps were also the letters were given out to the homeowners. The maps are also given and it shows like the red, the red two red proposed historic district. One is south of strivers row, south of that historic district. That's the one that I mentioned, that's the extension and that we called it an extension from CB10 in our historic preservation study and then there's the doran's brooks currently resort historic district. So the strivers row extension is 136 and 137 from 7th and 8th. That currently is not a historic district. It's not named anything so, but it's contiguous with it's just south of the current strivers row, so it'll in effect make that whole area from Saint, nicholas and 139Th to 136Th and 7Th Avenue that'll all be protected under landmarks, with two names: the existing strivers row and then the new Dorrance Brooks historic district, which will surround strivers row. That is that helpful. Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you. News. Well, as I said earlier in the meeting, while we are still here, was just approved for a grant to install 25 historic markers throughout Harlem and essentially, what we're looking for is the part of the community. I can't hear you Brian you're breaking up you're in taylor. We can't hear you okay. How about now? Should I speak a little louder? Is this better? Yes, this is better okay. So what I was saying was, while we are still here, we're a heritage preservation organization and we were founded in 2015 to kind of codify the history of 409 and 555 etcone avenue. But since that time, we've kind of expanded our purview to you, know more of Harlem in general, and to that end we were just approved for a grant to install 25 historic markers throughout Harlem over two years and the first year we would be called in, and there were also many other extraordinary areas as well that we would hope to cover. Through you know the market, or, for instance, Romer Fearing studio, was right on 125Th street over near where the party store is their capital one. You know what we appeared was an extraordinarily gifted artist and he's gone down, one of the world's most ordinary artists, and then we have the baby grandma, which was as well, and we even included things like the national Memorial African Bookstore that was owned by Mr Show on 125Th Street and that very important bookstore at 200 thousand titles all focused on black history throughout the african diaspora. We've also included the Atlantic's lounge, the link to duke residence on 7th Street and Marcus Garvey's universal Negro, Improvement Association. I just wanted to share with the community for that. You know we've gotten this funding and we are so extraordinarily happy that Harlem will be as a really important influential fight, including the Harlem renaissance and outside of the column. Thank you Karen. So I know. Maybe we can follow up with you for our next meeting, and so you can do a presentation, so we can hear more about what you're doing for our next meeting. Okay, thank you Karen and then maybe you'd want to connect with our Vice Chair Keith Taylor. So you can talk with him about your landmarking efforts and if there's anything that I do not know how we could help you or just get more information Keith did you hear Karen's announcement. Karen Taylor is one of our community members. Yes, yeah, that's wonderful! That is wonderful and yeah. I definitely like to talk with her about her successful efforts, because we want to replicate that there's a lot to mark yeah so much tomorrow. We we've got around 68 sites already, but you know that's kind of unmanageable at this point, so we're starting with 25.. Where did you get the funds from the Pomeroy Foundation, the Pomeroy Foundation, and we were referred to that organization through friends who is the executive director, the national Trust for historic preservation, african- american Cultural, Heritage Action fund? We actually refurb us from worthless funding and we committed an application and lo and behold they said this is wonderful, because I think people have the wrong idea of what Harlem is historically and has been historically. So you know it's really important for us to change that. Thank you, Karen Marcus, I see your hand is up. Did you want to say something? Yes, I think this is a great idea. One of my concerns. I think it was in the summer when we had a meeting with the black association from 135Th, and they had issues with markers. So I just wanted to know like who would be responsible for the upkeep of the markers after they're placed it would be the city of New, York Department of Transportation, because part of what we have to pay for is a ten thousand dollar bond for maintenance in perpetuity. We talked to the Department of Transportation Nicholas patnati, and there were probably 11 people on that call, and essentially that's one of the things that we would be required to provide. You know to the city. We have to pay a ten thousand dollar bond to New. York City got it so from what I'm understanding the city or the Department of Transportation is going to be responsible for it yeah. Okay, thank you, yeah. That was great clarification. I think we still might need to hear more about that. So we'll put that on the agenda for next time. Keith. I know that we have, as a board, voted on the historic district plan that we have, but is this initiative from Landmarks Preservation committee outside of that? Or would we with the vote that we took to support then be the same as if we were to take another vote to support now? I'm asking do we have to vote on this measure? No, it's the same. It's the same, they're, basically saying we liked what you proposed, what you, as a community board, proposed this historic district and we're acting on it. Okay. So it's nothing outside nothing new right, nothing outside what we suggested- okay, which is a beautiful thing. Okay, great and in that letter it's an October, 21st meeting. I know Keith, and I said it's virtual, so Keith and I said that we would attend board members, especially if you would like to attend and get more information so that we're all aware of everything that comes out of that meeting, including community concerns, because Keith and I will continue to raise those to LPC so that we can make sure the community is hurt on the issue. But Keith will be there spreading his expertise and easing fears, keith, you're still able to attend yeah. I cleared it with my higher up so I'll, be there virtually yes, so any of the board members that would like to attend you're welcome to Keith will be I'm not going to say, I'm not going to put him on the spot. He has to do a presentation, but I definitely want him to share his experiences with those homeowners to ease any type of discomfort they might have with the initiative. And if I may, you know that I've been the president of one of the local block associations, that's named Doran's, Brook, Block Association, and on that I've videotaped a lot of the lectures and efforts walking tours and so on that we've done over the years. My and it's the easiest way to contact me. If you remember the public is, I do not really have like business cards better, but it's just dorancebrookspora.org, which is property owners and residents association to Darnsworthpora.Org, and it talks more, not specific. Well, I include the larger preservation plan, but it talks. It speaks about the journey of Lawrence Brooks from just a neighborhood to a state and federal and now hopefully soon, city, historic district. So it's it's something I hope will be helpful with the other areas that we've identified to get them to the point where they're able to be considered for designation as well, and so it's it's a I'm nervously optimistic. There are so many things that can happen. You know with the election and the the pandemic and economic issues, but I am hopeful, I'm hopeful that we will be able to progress and become stronger and better for it. Thank you, keith. That's right! Thank you, so much so with that. If there's not any other questions on that, we can move to old business. If there is any, does anyone have any additional questions on this LPC initiative? Okay, we'll move on to old business? Is there any so really quickly? It's all business, it's district state district needs, but I wanted to send an email out and I'll do that we've been talking about district needs, calls with Josh just very quickly on Sundays Barbara. Thank you so much for being our Rep on that Barbara Nelson's, our Rep, but some of the things would be addressed and if the transportation committee or Landmarks Committee has any additional things, let me know, but some of the things we addressed is no notice. So when there are issues with transportation, we do not get proper notice of things. So we are asking the MTA to do their due diligence to keep us in the loop of any type of outages, any type of plans they may have for construction, because we get it a week ahead of time and we're not able to talk about it. Secondly, we're talking about accessibility, so I know you guys had remember when the 2:3 train. No excuse me that the Bc Train was shut down on 110 just for cosmetics, that we were also talking about accessibility, so we need proper escalators. We need elevators working all throughout Harlem and where there are no elevators and no escalators. What can be done with that money for beautification to make to put those things and then make them a reality? So those are the some type of things that we were talking about. We do have all you know. We have an a viable community, full of seniors and folks that may be disabled in some way. That could really utilize these things and have not been able to due to just the lack thereof and when there are elevators and escalators there, they're not working so especially our elevators. So those are the things that we talked about in our district needs statement. I know Karen was on that call. I do not know Barbara. I know you might have been on there for a second so or whether was there anything else that we need to raise and if anybody has anything else, just email me or Barbara, and we will raise it up to josh with a district needs statement in addition to that, sicily, from talking with Josh, he's trying to devise some sort of survey because we'd like to get the information out to not just the board members, but we're asking the board members to let other people in our communities know that this district needs. We need to know from them exactly what it is that they would like not just so much what we, as representatives of the community, know that we need so he's doing a survey. It's a Google document that should be sent out to all the board members for their participation as well. So, yes, thank you Barbara for reminding us, so that was sent out already, so you guys should have filled it out. If you did not, please take time to do that also we did try to send it out to the community in our e- blast and there is even a Qr code. So if you can't actually access the survey, there's a qr code and you can just take a picture of that and then the survey will download to your phone. But if anyone on this call needs that survey, please let me know: Shatik also has the survey as well and we can send it to you yep, it's also on our social media and our links. So if you go on the link for Instagram, for instance, you can just go into the Bio section and it'll pop right up. Okay, is there anything else, and definitely if you can't think of things here, we have another week or so to work on this, we'll have another meeting on Sunday our deadline for our internal deadline- I think, is the is next week and then our deadline officially is October 31st. Is that correct? Yes, thanks, Barbara and Shatik? Is there anything else Karen? Are you saying something? No, oh I, oh karen. What are you I'm sorry, Karen Ori? Were you saying something? Yes, I just wanted to ask. I do not. Are we still in district on district needs? Yes, Ma'am I'll, wait, I'll, wait! Oh okay, is there anything else on district needs? Okay, now Karen go ahead. I just wanted to know how was the situation with CitiBikes and and Esplanade gardens resolved thanks Shatik. I think the rack is still there. Did you hear anything else from the tenant association? No, I did not. Actually I have not heard anything from D.O.T or the Tenant association last that we left off the D.O.T said that they would take into consideration some of our recommendations, but I have not heard anything from tenants Association as of yet okay, so you only we'll follow up yeah. From my experience, if you do not hear anything, I guess that's a good thing, because when it's going really bad, they definitely call an email, so yeah. Well shouting if they reach out again and Karen. I wanted to mention that to you as well the station that they have over by a Phillip Randolph Park is always empty with bikes and it's in a pretty good location. They may even think about extending or putting more bikes there, because it's hard to get a bike because they're all gone. What part did you see over Jackie Robinson? It's between 140 really 148,147, but closer to 148 on the far side, so they decided they wanted to put more. That would be a perfect part to put it in, because a lot more people are frequenting, a good idea. Any other comments, questions on old business, okay, new business. Is there anything new business announcements, any announcements at all? You know what actually it's not necessarily transportation announcement, and I think I made an announcement at the board meeting. Maybe I did not we're having a discussion on Thursday. It was supposed to be tonight, but it was supposed to it was going to rain on Thursday about community priorities in this here in this election cycle. Marquis knows because he's going to bring some of his students so we're trying to get young people, but we want all people to come out on tues on Thursday this Thursday at 6:30. We're also going to be showing the episode, the episode that was on Blackish recently around the elections and about how the electoral process works. So, if you have not seen it come out and view it we're social distance and mast on Thursday at 6 30. and where is it exactly cheryl? So, oh sorry, that's true! It's on 120Th Street between Marcus Garvey, Park and Malcolm X Boulevard, okay. So it's really a discussion forum specifically for us to discuss our priorities around the select election cycle and it starts at six. Thirty, six. Thirty! Okay! Is there a flyer that you want us to put out I'll? Send you something? Okay, please! Thank you! That's a really great idea and it just fits into all the wonderful programming you have done on your street. So when I was over there and took part of the programming, it was great. So thank you for that. Can I just ask one quick question: are we doing a walkthrough? I understand that there because it gets back to what what I was saying previously about 124Th Street. There was something in one of the local newspapers about the elected officials, doing a walk through of this area because of the substance use that's occurring. Are we part of that? So there had been talk about that on one of the meetings I had been on and so we're shutting have you heard any definite date from that, but no, I have not heard any definite dates yet, but if we do that we'll let the board know that it's happening at least okay. Is there anything else, any other announcements? No. Okay. At this time I will entertain a motion to Adjourn motion a second okay. It's been moving, probably a second all in favor aye hearing. Now we are adjourned at 8 40.. Thank you so much for this great meeting and I will talk to you all soon. Thank you good morning. Thank you good night good night.
