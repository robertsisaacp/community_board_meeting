We want to make sure that we are able to stay active in the community and available and informed Thank you juanita and shatik for your diligence during this time and while working from home, there was a calendar for august 2020 We do want to continue to have our meetings, because really important next month will be our executive board right before we go back into our regular session We want to make sure that we are staying as again informed as available as committee chairs and committee members, as possible.
I want to thank everyone on the community board for coming out and painting our letter just a little bit about that was brought to you by harlem park to park and got to stop erica and nicola put a lot of their own time and money into that.
The mayor was there But one thing that we wanted to make sure is that when the tv cameras are not there, that people know that we are here and we are being a part of the community, and we are aware of everything going on.
There's also been talk about expanding open streets to partner with dot and parks department, so there'll be scheduled activities on the open streets, not just open the street and open a hydrant but have actual activities there maybe bring out some equipment, so people can work out some big inflatable balloons, so people so the young people could enjoy it as well, something for all ages just to keep people busy during the summer and outside, but also you know doing something productive, but also out of this came the harlem good neighbor policy, we'll send it out either today, probably after this meeting.
We are the only community board of towns that have signed it thus far because a lot of the activities and things are happening right here in our area, and we don't want to be left out So. That is just saying that it's an agreement that we are supporting our young people, that we are supporting our young adults and that we are, you know putting out guidance that will help us all enjoy the summer It's a harlem good, neighbor policy Then we I did burro board that was july 16th, where we all got together.
In the first place, Ironically, the only the only lessons that were available were in Brooklyn, so not really a central location for some of us in harlem, but that some of the young people that were riding those bikes, but they were the presents-- is cba, wanted to do an a bias project, implicit bias project that we have signed on to help out as well they'll be done within the community boards We hope to bring it out to the public as well and offer it as like a free course or a free class.
This will talk about implicit bias just in everyday life, We talk about it with police officers and in you know the workforce, but in everyday life and acknowledging those implicit biases, and so then july 18th went to another street corner resources and cb10 me went out to look at another party site that we had heard was going to be an issue at 143rd and 8th avenue, frederick douglass We went out there and talked to the young people that were having that party just to make sure that they knew that we were there to support them and that we wanted them to do it safely and to talk to the party promoter there to see when they would be wrapping that up having the music going on into 2am, not to say that there has to be violence at that point or bad things happening, but it would be safer to wrap it up around 10 or 11, and that's what we were talking to them about So. We went out there and talked to those young people.
I also did a interview on a radio show to talk about gun violence and how we, as committee board, 10, saw ourselves up in the effort of community policing and what role community boards can play to meeting with the 125th street bid and discuss those things there and how we were going to bring open streets and open dining or that concept, if in, if in any way to 125th street Those are some of the things that we have been doing had another meeting with the harlem chamber of commerce, where the met the chief of Manhattan northwest there I think her first name is kathleen and we talked to her about our issues with community policing and how the neighborhood police officers had not made themselves visible in our community, and we do not know them.
So there are signs that are interactive which that people could scan and they could get further information about the illness and the situation and updates That's a really good idea and we have been trying to partner with the elected officials and street corner resources to get out not only just mask but to continue to get out hand sanitizer and things of that nature we are trying.
I know that obscenely spoke, or we got in contact with the lawyer, who represented esplanade, gardens , We invited him in their in their group to attend our next transportation committee meeting and I also will be getting in contact with the 136th street black association The disdain for the city bike, so most of the disdain comes as far as they feel like they're taking up parking in an area that we don't You know the parking is very scarce.
Racks and you know the initiatives, because they feel that in the low-income, neighborhoods and under representative communities that they didn't have enough bikes so that part of their partnership was to bring these bikes into underserved or underrepresented communities, gardens linux avenue between 145th and 146th Other one was on adam clayton powell, between 150th and 151st street We had another on mccoom's place between 151st and 152nd, and the last one was on edge comb avenue between 150 and 155th street Also after the black lives matter, black lives matter, Mural was painted on july 4th weekend board Member terry wisdom sent me an email because she had a concern and she also reported that there was a group of bikers who went through the barricades and they were very rude and distasteful and bombarding on the mural So I reached out to the organization by email, and they said that they kind of denied on the allegations against them, and they said that there was a miscommunication since that time they did get in contact with the organizers of the mural and you know things that people were saying that was going on in portland, with the federal troops coming in I'm in a portland oregon, and there were people.
I will send an email out to the board and also send out the flyers when they become available to let everyone know in the community how they could join on this group to help clean up harlem and the last thing I just wanted to mention.
Is- is based on a conversation that I had yesterday with a second vice chair of charles powell, also chair of our housing committee, in regards to the way community board our follow-up and when we're when we're our follow-up and when we are requested to write letters of support for different rfps Right now mark 125 is a hot, but an issue and everyone there's a lot of people.
I, don't think this went to a full board, a vote You know the conversation that I have with charles powell and he can follow up and speak on if he likes, but we have to be more diligent with following up on these projects and make sure that we have a good project process when it comes to looking at these letters of support and vetting all of these type of situations My report for tonight I mean if we needed to investigate whether or not those bicyclists were using city bikes and be able to investigate that way, because I think that you know people should not be able to come into our community and vandalize So. For the first question that you raised, our statement basically said where the bike racks moved.
This is a group of people who ride bikes and probably more so, their personal bikes, but there were other people who joined in that may have been city, bikes and afraid, but this definitely I wouldn't categorize it as a city bike issue and once I spoke with them So. If there's any other information that you want to get out, actually probably get that through the organizers of the black lives matter, mural fatigue I have two questions: You mentioned pal and fresh air fund, both who have close relationships with the city, so I just want to make a point that in the same way that we want to be supportive of small businesses in our community, there are lots of not-for-profits who have been existing in the community a play street and the second question has to do with the bikes.
But that's not what happened and for them as a community organization that supports businesses to pay for it and it to be fair game to be attacked like that and I commend park depart because they're very humble and they were resilient and I agree with you, you know initially, when the city you know proposed to do the black lives matter, murals I think that they said that they would put one in each borough and the one from Manhattan was the one that was I, guess in front of trump plaza, and they had nothing to do with this.
That I believe is city funded as well in front of the court The point is that this is our community, whether it was paid for by the city, but particularly because it was the community that volunteered harlem artists when things happen, there's supposed to be some kind of legal, something that happens to someone that does something like this, not that we could stop any random people, but I feel like there should be some kind of position, because when this happened-- and it could be because of the police, slow down, but no police were in sight, The news didn't cover that at all they kept talking about a mural in Brooklyn that had pain on the But this was more than just the letters black lives matters.
If, not, then you would want to speak to like shitty and he might be able to direct you to some people who are proof city vendors, so that they can actually use the funds that we have Probably in the executive committee meetings.
I'm still not sure about that we have to figure out, is the personnel budget, and if this, how long this hiring freeze will be in effect, because we were planning to hire an additional staff member and that got put on hold with everything that transpired and it's going to be a challenge just to even train a new employee and a virtual situation right now, So I would I would think somewhere by either august or the latest in september, but we can start the vetting process or continue where we left off this coming month.
But what about our seniors or people who are identify as disabled and Where there'll be an assessor ride situation where we can, where they can utilize that or even around allow green calves or the yellow calves or some ubers to go up and down fdba f, frederick douglas boulevard We do want to support our businesses, we're hopeful and there for them at the same time, but we want to be able to con support our whole community and that does include seniors and that does include the disabled So. We wanted to make sure that happened, but that's all I have for transportation We have we still have an opportunity to provide feedback to the department of new york state department of environmental conservation on a brownfield cleanup program which would deal with land reuse so that site is at 280 west 155th street and then so we have an opportunity to provide feedback for that.
Thank you chanel for that idea in that very contentious community board meeting that night You know there's a lot of feelings, but now to see it coming to this fruition as we bring the community together.
We probably would want to hold a watch and discuss either right before or right after that event to allow the community to provide what they you know feel and not necessarily it be a panel where the community is listening to what you know It's an opportunity for the community to get on a call, and It's just a way to hear from the community a lot of times, That's why I created what we call these watch and discuss on like a sunday evening, so people could be in their homes, and you know talk about things that we don't have the time and committee to speak about it.
It was not good for us at that time, so I don't want to spare space works and all that they've done in Brooklyn, but it wasn't the right fit for harlem and we don't have to start all over with somebody new that gets into that office.
Now we have the data, so it wasn't just me on the call you know saying: things: the last public safety meeting I think we should take a look at that and try to see if we can get some sort of police community agreement in terms of them, making sure that they make sure that their workers are not cursing at the public.
