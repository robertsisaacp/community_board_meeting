I know that a lot of what we're used to not meeting over the summer, but I believe a lot of the community boards are continuing to meet, especially this year.
We want to make sure that we are able to stay active in the community and available and informed Thank you juanita and shatik for your diligence during this time and while working from home, there was a calendar for august 2020.
But one thing that we wanted to make sure is that when the tv cameras are not there, that people know that we are here and we are being a part of the community, and we are aware of everything going on.
Violence calls with the police, community police chief maldry and how we, as harlem knights, can come together and care for our young people, talk to our young people and try to understand where they're coming from with wanting to get out because we're all So you know, cooped up and want to enjoy the summer, but at the same time, do it.
Some big inflatable balloons, so people, so the young people could enjoy it as well, something for all ages just to keep people busy during the summer and outside, but also you know doing something productive, but also out of this came the harlem good neighbor policy We'll, send it out either today, probably after this meeting.
We are the only community board of towns that have signed it thus far because a lot of the activities and things are happening right here in our area, and we don't want to be left out.
You know rebel has been stopped and suspended service because of the deaths that have occurred on those bikes, and there were a lot of concerns even on July 16th, we're talking about helmets and how are they going to make helmets safe, not only just safe to wear on the street but safe from coronavirus and any type of disease that might come from that.
The only the only lessons that were available were in Brooklyn, so not really a central location for some of us in harlem, but That some of the young people that were riding those bikes, but they were the presents- Is cba, wanted to do an a bias, project, implicit bias project that we have signed on to help out as well they'll be done within the community boards.
We went out there and talked to the young people that were having that party just to make sure that they knew that we were there to support them and that we wanted them to do it safely and to talk to the party promoter there to see when they would be wrapping that up having the music going on into 2am, not to say that there has to be violence at that point or bad things happening, but it would be safer to wrap it up around 10 or 11, and that's what we were talking to them.
I also did a interview on a radio show to talk about gun violence and how we, as committee board, 10, saw ourselves up in the effort of community policing and what role community boards can play to meeting with the 125th street bid and discuss those things there and how we were going to bring open streets and open dining or that concept, if in, if in any way to 125th street.
I. Think her first name is kathleen and we talked to her about our issues with community policing and How. The neighborhood police officers had not made themselves visible in our community, and we do not know them the whole thing about coming out and giving your cards to the young people and just the citizens, constituents that has not happened, and that has not happened in a long time.
I just wanted to follow up with karen, because it what's really present is that young people aren't wearing masks and just an idea that we might want to think about activities that we've used with dycd and working with youth groups is to provide incentives.
A lot of the city budget thus far has gone to cover 19 efforts, you know, and rightfully so, but because of that and the replenishment that is not coming from washington right.
I might have brought up some of the issues that were you know that we've been dealing with in our community as far as the unpermitted street activities- And I just want to thank the 30-second precinct for doing a good job at the at the at the streets that we were at the locations.
Omni said that the perpetrator stood over her body and kept shooting until there was no bullets left and this person is has yet to be apprehended, and this made the front page of the daily news, because they were saying that she, basically, you know, were following the orders of us trying to be a good community neighbor, but we also want to recognize that being a good community.
So I think that when we're having the conversation on city, bike, I think that would be good to know the loop, the boys and girls club of harlem and in the discussion, because they are working hand in hand with city bike and they are partly responsible for helping to usher in the bike.
There's a lot of trash and litter being left around the streets, so community members are coming together as far as a block by black initiative to try to clean up to clean up.
I will send an email out to the board and also send out the flyers when they become available to let everyone know in the community how they could join on this group to help clean up harlem, and the last thing I just wanted to mention.
Is- is based on a conversation that I had yesterday with a second vice chair of charles powell, also chair of our housing committee, in regards to the way community board our follow-up When we're, when we're our follow-up and when we are requested to write letters of support for different rfps.
And what we have to do is because a lot of times they look for the community board to get behind and support their projects.
I. Don't think this went to a full board, a vote, but I just under our recommendation- You know the conversation that I have with charles powell He can follow up and speak on if he likes, but we have to be more diligent with following up on these projects and make sure that we have a good project process when it comes to looking at these letters of support and vetting all of these type of situations.
I mean if we needed to investigate whether or not those bicyclists were using city bikes and be able to investigate that way, because I think that you know people should not be able to come into our community and vandalize.
This is a group of people who ride bikes and probably more so, their personal bikes, but there were other people who joined in that may have been city, bikes and afraid, but this definitely I wouldn't categorize it as a city bike issue and once I spoke with them So. If there's any other information that you want to get out, actually probably get that through the organizers of the black lives, matter, mural fatigue, I have two questions.
I. Think I saw three dozen young people on those city , bikes riding around the park, so I thought we had maybe talked about what was there a program that allowed those kids to access those bikes at a discount or with some kind of coupon program?
On social media which went viral I saw the park the park, people on sunday, but honestly, when I asked them, what is going on, I, don't think the police were investigating this or doing anything, and maybe because it was like public art that the city wasn't paid for, but I think it's outrageous.
Last sunday, But I, just don't think that things like that should be allowed in our community, because the city did not pay for that and probably should have paid for something in harlem.
She wanted to do like a community day of you, know.
We don't have that budget at all this year, but we did get an additional 1 000, which can be used, which is which was allocated basically to to assist community boards and getting an urban planner to do studies etc on land use, which I don't think is enough quite to be frank, and then we got another five thousand dollars to support other land, use, studies, etc.
, You want to find out with the person that you're going to be procuring the goods or services from that they are a city vendor, so that you know that you can work with this person.
If we do return to you, know, in-person meetings with sisley mentioned at the top, is a city providing like PPE or is that something that boards are responsible for providing on their own?
We be you know the state office here, thinking of the harlem did office building still be our venue As far as the as far as the PPE equipment, one thing that they a couple of things that they're mentioning as masks as one two as hand, sanitizers or sanitizer stations, and the third would be like the digital thermometer to take people's temperature before they come in.
You already updated a lot of people on the city bike issue, but please come out to our transportation meeting because we will be talking to d.o.t about city bike and we have invited espionage gardens to express their displeasure in that city by station.
You know, there's a lot of feelings, but now to see it coming to this fruition as we bring the community together.
On top of putting and organizing everything like she brings all of her people in from different agencies, and But most of the work You know she does a lot of the work.
But I think that you got some excellent panelists who had information that we can look at, and you know morph it to our needs, and I, am in agreement with you, sicily, that we have to keep our vision and our intention, because, especially at this time and what the central park exonerated represents, it's very critical that it is done with our intention, because that is what will make a difference as we move into the future And You know just seeing the models that people went through To say, we have a projected timeline for deadline for december.
If anyone have any ideas on how we can you know somehow support small businesses or support the community or figure out a way to bring that number down.
It was very miniscule, but because it's a harlem newspaper, we, it was the focus because it's close to home And, you know changing regulations, but some of the things that we're talking about are basic, like you, know, people being six feet on the line that doesn't cost money.
So I think that you know that's a place where we as a small community can really show- You know helping people to not get sick.
When the committee members view the documents they can also view those reports, I just got one question for you: We want to hold off until we get some updates on what's happening with that, because the watch and discuss are really for community input.
We want to know you know: What does the community feel so that we can take that information to those meetings?
That's why I created what we call these watch and discuss on like a sunday evening, so people could be in their homes and You know talk about things that we don't have the time and committee to speak about it.
Now we have the data, so it wasn't just me on the call you know: Saying things, the last public safety meeting I think we should take a look at that and try to see if we can get some sort of police community agreement in terms of them making sure that they make sure that their workers are not cursing at the public.
If people have been noticing that- Or, you know where we are with that- because there's a lot more homeless people living on the street, like with all their belongings that I have noticed.
