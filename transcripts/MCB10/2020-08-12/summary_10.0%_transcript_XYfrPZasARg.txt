I know that a lot of what we're used to not meeting over the summer, but I believe a lot of the community boards are continuing to meet, especially this year.
We want to make sure that we are able to stay active in the community and available and informed During this time and while working from home, there was a calendar for August 2020.
But one thing that we wanted to make sure is that when the TV cameras are not there, that people know that we are here and we are being a part of the community, and we are aware of everything going on.
Violence calls with the police, community, Police chief maldry and How. We as Harlem knights, can come together and care for our young people, talk to our young people and try to understand where they're coming from with wanting to get out because we're all So you know, cooped up and want to enjoy the summer, but at the same time, do it.
Some big inflatable balloons, so people, so the young people could enjoy it as well, something for all ages just to keep people busy during the summer and outside, but also you know doing something productive, but also out of this came The Harlem good, neighbor policy It's something that all the elected officials have signed on community board.
We are the only Community Board of towns that have signed it thus far because a lot of the activities and things are happening right here in our area That is just saying that it's an agreement that we are supporting our young people, that we are supporting our young adults and that we are, you know, putting out guidance that will help us all enjoy the summer.
You know rebel has been stopped and suspended service because of the deaths that have occurred on those bikes, and there were a lot of concerns even on July 16th, we're talking about helmets and how are they going to make helmets safe, not only just safe to wear on the street but safe from Coronavirus and any type of disease that might come from that They were going to do a 50 off helmet purchase.
The only the only lessons that were available were in Brooklyn, so not really a central location for some of us in Harlem, but That some of the young people that were riding those bikes, but they were the presents, also there's a lot of good events that came out of that one such Cba wanted to do an a bias.
So then, July 18th went to another street corner resources and CB10 me went out to look at another party site that we had heard was going to be an issue at 143Rd and 8Th Avenue Frederick Douglass.
We went out there and talked to the young people that were having that party just to make sure that they knew that we were there to support them and that we wanted them to do it safely and to talk to the party promoter there to see when they would be wrapping that up having the music going on into 2 Am, not to say that there has to be violence at that point or bad things happening.
I also did a interview on a radio show to talk about gun violence and how we, as committee board 10, saw ourselves up in the effort of community policing and what role community boards can play to meeting with the 125Th Street bid and discuss those things there and how we were going to bring open streets and open dining or that concept, if in, if in any way to 125Th Street.
I, think her first name is Kathleen and we talked to her about our issues with community policing and How. The neighborhood police officers had not made themselves visible in our community, and we do not know them the whole thing about coming out and giving your cards to the young people and just the citizens, constituents.
I. Just wanted to follow up with Karen, because it what's really present is that young people are not wearing masks and just an idea that we might want to think about activities that we've used with DYCD and working with youth groups is to provide incentives.
A lot of the city budget thus far has gone to cover 19 efforts, you know, and rightfully so, but because of that and the replenishment that is not coming from Washington right.
You know a lot of the things that I you know I dealt with from dealing with the agencies, elected officials, as well as on constituent issues and concerns on the assistant, district, attorney's, community forum.
I might have brought up some of the issues that were you know that we've been dealing with in our community as far as the unpermitted street activities- And I just want to thank the 30-second precinct for doing a good job at the at the at the streets that we were at the locations , The party or the event started at 6.
And I also will be getting in contact with the 136Th Street Black Association The disdain for the CitiBike, so most of the disdain comes as far as they feel like they're, taking up parking in an area that we do not.
So I think that when we're having the conversation on CitiBike, I think that would be good to know the loop, the boys and girls club of Harlem and in the discussion, because they are working hand in hand with CitiBike They are partly responsible for helping to usher in the bike.
You know if they were coming to the city, so I just wanted to announce for those who did not know that mayor De Blasio sent a letter to U.S attorney General Bill, Barr and Acting Secretary Wolf are responding to recent threats by President Trump to send federal agents to New York City.
There's a lot of trash and litter being left around the streets, so community members are coming together as far as a block by black initiative to try to clean up to clean up.
I will send an email out to the board and also send out the flyers when they become available to let everyone know in the community how they could join on this group to help clean up Harlem, and the last thing I just wanted to mention is- is based on a conversation that I had yesterday with a second vice chair of Charles Powell, also chair of our housing committee, in regards to the way community board our follow- up and when we're when we're our follow- up and when we are requested to write letters of support for different rfps, for instance.
And what we have to do is because a lot of times they look for the community board to get behind and support their projects, and then.
I. Do not think this went to a full board, a vote, but I just under our recommendation- You know the conversation that I have with Charles Powell He can follow up and speak on if he likes, but we have to be more diligent with following up on these projects and make sure that we have a good project process when it comes to looking at these letters of support and vetting all of these type of situations.
I mean if we needed to investigate whether or not those bicyclists were using CitiBikes and be able to investigate that way, because I think that you know people should not be able to come into our community and vandalize.
This definitely I would not categorize it as a CitiBike issue and once I spoke with them So. If there's any other information that you want to get out actually probably get that through the organizers of the black lives, matter, Mural Fatigue, I have two questions.
There are lots of not- for- profits who have been existing in the community, would love to know if they had an opportunity to bid for the opportunity to operate a price, a play street, and the second question has to do with the bikes on Sunday.
I saw the park the park, people on Sunday, but honestly, when I asked them what is going on, I do not think the police were investigating this or doing anything, and maybe because it was like public art that the city was not paid for, but I.
Last Sunday, But I just do not think that things like that should be allowed in our community, because the city did not pay for that and probably should have paid for something in Harlem, but that's not what happened and for them as a community organization that supports businesses to pay for it and it to be fair game to be attacked like that.
The point is that this is our community, whether it was paid for by the city, but particularly because it was the community that volunteered Harlem artists when things happen, there's supposed to be some kind of legal, something that happens to someone that does something like this, not that we could stop any random people, but I feel like there should be some kind of position, because when this happened-- and it could be because of the police slow down, But no police were in sight- They kept talking about a mural in Brooklyn that had pain on the You know got thrown pain.
And just the last final word on the black lives matter: Okay, how we're going to be sustaining it in the future, as the street is opening up on Friday, so the street has been closed, right, Saturday should be open, She wanted to do like a community day of you, know, cleaning it and repainting it and making it kind of.
We do not have that budget at all this year, but we did get an additional 1,000 which can be used, which is which was allocated basically to to assist community boards and getting an urban planner to do studies etc on land use, which I do not think is enough.
Then you submit it and then simple and clean just like that , Probably in the executive committee meetings, the requests to make sure that you know everybody's aware of it, it's pretty transparent and that's about all.
We be you know the state office here, thinking of the Harlem did office building still be our venue As far as the as far as the PPE equipment, one thing that they a couple of things that they're mentioning as masks as one two as hand, sanitizers or sanitizer stations, and the third would be like the digital thermometer to take people's temperature before they come in.
As we bring the community together, we can not lose sight of our vision for this, because this is very popular and a lot of people want to.
On top of putting and organizing everything like she brings all of her people in from different agencies, and But most of the work You know she does a lot of the work.
But I think that you got some excellent panelists who had information that we can look at, and you know morph it to our needs, and I, am in agreement with you, sicily, that we have to keep our vision and our intention, because, especially at this time and what the central park exonerated represents.
The article was specifically about the citations in Harlem If anyone have any ideas on how we can you know somehow support small businesses or support the community or figure out a way to bring that number down.
So I'm, definitely open to having a conversation, I think that somehow, with the ambassadors or whoever it is, we should be trying to see, or at least have a position paper of what we think should happen, because you know some of even on Lenox Avenue, like I mean Quantum, Social was out of control, I mean way out of control, and I.
So I do not think it's something that we play with lightly and if there's ambassadors- Or you know the mayor or whoever can be appealed to like people, should be the same way that they're going on the corner to stop the violence, because that kills people you know.
It's, not good, and it's more than just the people in the restaurant, because they're going back into the whole community.
It was very miniscule, but because it's a Harlem newspaper we It was the focus because it's close to home And, you know changing regulations, but some of the things that we're talking about are basic people being six feet on the line that does not cost money.
So I think that you know that's a place where we as a small community can really show- You know helping people to not get sick.
So people could be in their homes and You know talk about things that we do not have the time and committee to speak about it.
She's have they're going to have these community meetings to kind of guide and craft the RFP into something that we can't see and support If because they never really executed that contract, I know before it was like, like 18 million dollars for the site.
You know this administration has been supportive of our vision and trying to talk to the community.
You know saying things the last public safety meeting I think we should take a look at that and try to see if we can get some sort of police community agreement in terms of them making sure that they make sure that their workers are not cursing at the public.
