The first The intent here, is to simply move the docking stations across the street because the emergency vehicles and accessories pull up on the sidewalk along esplanade's property and there's no other place for them to go.
What we're asking is to free up that space, so the accessorized vehicles, police, cars and fire trucks can do what they've done historically and planted a sidewalk, and the docking stations can simply be in the other side of the street.
Well further complicated, of course, is the fact that we have all this construction going on at esplanade This is no place for these emergency vehicles and accessories to go other than where they went other than to block the street.
Commissioner, at the new york city department of transportation- You know I was made aware of this relocation request when it first came through our office and one of the things that I think you know But I did want to first put forth on the table that you know.
We worked closely with the community boards and other stakeholders to really decide how we would approach city bike expansion in community board 10, and our focus here was to really try to prioritize sidewalk locations where we could find them if they were feasible so that you know there would be minimal impact to you know residential parking across the district, and so you know, I'm, looking forward to discussing a little bit more to understanding what we could do at this particular location.
This likely would have been avoided, but the problem in the problem, in a nutshell, is that, because the docking station is located where it is, there's no place for the police cars to fire, the fire trucks, but more commonly the accessories to pull up on the sidewalk to get people.
And it's literally across the street, and nothing happens across the street Just looking at google street view right, now, Like, it's a relatively narrow sidewalk with a lot of different utilities and unfortunately.
I, don't quite understand where exactly the access point is because if there is a way for us to, you know shift the station on the sidewalk where it's not blocking vehicular access, then we could look at that.
That is a driveway which is now covered with scaffolding, because the dlb deemed the buildings unsafe because we're doing the terrace work so literally, there's no other place to put the bike station on that street.
You got a bus, stop there, the train station in the in the open street right on 7th avenue between 148th and 149th street.
We have no other place and when you mention the stairwell, even the stairs on our property on seventh avenue, it's covered with scaffolding, You know, And we even have some community board.
I. Think the phrasing of a perfect space across the across the way on the south side of 147th street isn't the right phrasing, So I, don't believe just you know my glancing on street view, because I'm, not in the field with my measuring wheel, Is, that it's not feasible there, because there's a number of different tree pits and sidewalk or utilities on the actual sidewalk.
That would so you know like a manhole right like we can't install a station on top of a manhole, because the utility companies would need to access that or if the three pits are too close, together, we wouldn't be able to bridge every single tree, pit.
I think, what's installed currently on the north side of the street, and we like to have a couple of plates of the station.
You know an interesting route to take, but I do just kind of want to better understand how we could potentially adjust the station in its current location so that it is not in the way of emergency, vehicles, jennifer, honestly If you it's against the gate, which, even with gardening and taking care of that area, cleaning.
It does sound, like the scaffolding is presenting a little bit because you're used to having a 30-foot wide sidewalk, right, and I.
Our buildings all have been deemed unsafe, and this bad part about this city bike thing is that these people, the users are, could possibly put them be placed in jeopardy because of the conditions in which you're placing these bikes at, if you're putting it in the middle of it like a construction war zone, where there's that we can have emergency vehicles in addition to all the work and The sampling is on one on the corner of 7th avenue.
We need to make sure that there's enough pedestrian clearance around the station Like I mentioned before here in cb10, we tried to prioritize locations on the sidewalk so that we would minimize parking impact, and so that's kind of why you might see some of the stations spread out a little bit more closely.
Something to consider is the context of the neighborhood and what right and like the adjacent, Okay, so I've noticed a lot like jack just mentioned about those bike stations being in the street close to the curve.
I mean it is possible, but what I was going to say earlier is that before we expand into any new neighborhood, what we do is we have field staff that canvas all of the new areas, and So, like they're, siting at the different sidewalks locations, as well as the different street spaces.
You know what stations look like around the city and around the neighborhood.
, In juniper, there's the river houses literally on the right hand, side of 148th street train station and, like I, told you on that side of the there's.
Nothing there's a lot of open space right there around the corner, one block over- You just put a station literally on 146th street and linux avenue There's, a bike station and one on 146, and then you have one on 147th, street.
I in meetings have advocated more thorough outreach to the community, so I just like to know just what was done in terms of outreach and also does esplanade gardens have a petition to the effect of what their position is.
We've received a number of requests across the city from schools that are interested in kind of expanding their school space onto the streets, particularly Or. You know really just at this time and with the impending school year.
I'd just like to ask what outreach have you done to other organizations or residents on in the area so that you know when the street is?
