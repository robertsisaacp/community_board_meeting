That means fire department, the ambulance and, as I mentioned in on the onset of my discussion, we have an aging population that has accessories day program, buses and there's literally only one access point for three of our buildings, and we have scaffolding of literally from one to six from seventh avenue to linux avenue we have scaffolding up You can't get to that area where they're at and right across the street is the transit, the bus depot and on that side of the street, there's more than enough room to accommodate those bicycles, and it would be out of the way but esplanade They can't get on and off vehicles.
And if we have a fire, we have a fight, the fire truck, there's one access point and they have to pass a string of bikes This bicycle station at, but where they put it, it's extremely problematic for the co-op My phone does not stop ringing from my shareholders about these bikes sitting there and they just set up another bike station literally across the street, from building five and six, so they have bike stations within a block or two within each other You know we respectfully request the community boards 10 assistance with having these bike.
We worked closely with the community boards and other stakeholders to really decide how we would approach city bike expansion in community board 10, and our focus here was to really try to prioritize sidewalk locations where we could find them if they were feasible so that you know there would be minimal impact to you know residential parking across the district, and so you know I'm, looking forward to discussing a little bit more to understanding what we could do at this particular location My understanding that it's a relatively wide sidewalk right, one of the wider sidewalks in the area- Where exactly is the access point?
I got to get my things together, so there's literally one way that all of these vehicles can access the property and in between that one way is a city bike track a few feet away from where the bikes are so at one point, we had two access points there to get on and off the property Don't even have that anymore, so save for car double parks in a specific area, So the concern, because the concern is that wide sidewalk turns into an area for emergency vehicles to pull up and park and I, don't think the dot could have known that Unfortunately, the property manager for esplanade gardens had a very bad car accident and has not was not at the office at the relevant times.
You have more people walking their dogs on that side of the street, because they're there's not high pedestrian traffic On, that side of the street and it's literally across the street and nothing happens across the street Just looking at google street view right now, like it's a relatively narrow sidewalk, with a lot of different utilities and unfortunately, when there's too many tree pits or lamp posts, there looks like they're surface grit like surface utility caps as well.
Past That is a driveway which is now covered with scaffolding, because the dlb deemed the buildings unsafe because we're doing the terrace work so literally, there's no other place to put the bike station on that street One on that block.
The train station in the in the open street right on 7th avenue between 148th and 149th street We have no other place and when you mention the stairwell, even the stairs on our property on seventh avenue, it's covered with scaffolding, You know, and we even have some community board members.
If you have a fire department, the ambulance and the coming at once, they all have to come up one street, possibly behind the buses to get on a sidewalk jennifer The problem is that is that it says, in essence, is a de facto parking lot for emergency vehicles, and accessories I mean this is a public sidewalk right, so it shouldn't be used as such I will put that out there, but you know for an emergency lane with any of our other streetscape projects across Manhattan across the city.
, Our buildings all have been deemed unsafe, and this bad part about this city bike thing is that these people, the users are, could possibly put them be placed in jeopardy because of the conditions in which you're placing these bikes at if you're putting it in the middle of it like a construction war zone, where there's that we can have emergency vehicles, in addition to all the work and the sampling is on one on the corner of 7th avenue That means that an emergency vehicle can get on the sidewalk at seven batteries and they still would have to travel the same way path to get on the property When our contractor lyft spoke to one of the assistant property managers before the station installation Let me see- whether it be on the sidewalk or in the parking lane.
No emergency vehicle can get on the sidewalk there, so they have to get on the sidewalk in between the block near the swimming pool, Next bike station from linux, savvy news site, and now we have the bikes there I'm looking at the street map You know I go to Brooklyn in different areas, In the barrels and most of these bike stations they usually will put them in the or on the sidewalk, where, like when I was in Brooklyn, it's on the side of a building where there's no businesses, it's not impacting anyone.
You know a huge just like record that we broke and this it means a lot to me because before I became the deputy borough commissioner It's about six feet, We need to make sure that there's enough pedestrian clearance around the station Here in cb10, we tried to prioritize locations on the sidewalk so that we would minimize parking impact, and so that's kind of why you might see some of the stations spread out a little bit more closely together, saying it's a possibility to have placement on the street, but on the other side of the street as well.
You know the rest of harlem, which is another 10 blocks at best You know it's not a high traffic bus station bus I'm, trying to strategically help to plan an adequate place to put them across the street There's another bus stop of residential areas, which, unfortunately, you have a bunch of people who just seem to loiter over in those areas that it's literally right across the street The street from esplanade There are buildings across the street , Why not put them across the street absolutely, and so before we expand into any new neighborhood I'm, just looking at street view now around the corner in front of pioneer supermarket.
It actually is success for a very small corner on 117 , it's like a garden and then a building that goes on to 117, but we do span most of the block, except for the restaurant across the street and I believe there's also some kind of community building across the street The restaurant has been a very good friend to the school, so we feel like if we went to them they'd be comfortable working with us, understood So. We've received a number of requests across the city from schools that are interested in kind of expanding their school space onto the streets, particularly or you know really just at this time and with the impending school year.
