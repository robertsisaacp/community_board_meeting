Actually, hi jack, how are you I know? I appreciate you. I appreciate you we're very fortunate. We are all right. You have the pictures in case anyone wants to see a picture. I email them not to me, but as long as you haven't it's okay, I do. Let me see if I downloaded them most likely, I probably had to download them. We started dealing with this in the beginning of July right, maybe jump yeah. I have all the pictures yeah. It was July the 1st yep. Okay, are we first on the agenda or I don't know so- hey jack and ms davis? How are you hello? How are you I'm shatik, I'm about to put my name up here now, so you guys can see. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, put it up right now. I just spoke with the chair of the committee and the chair of our boy. Miss cicely harris she'll be joining the call in approximately one to two minutes, so sorry to keep you guys, I'm waiting, but I'm different. Okay. We appreciate the opportunity, of course, no problem. Everyone calls me mj. Okay, I got your mj, I'm jackie roo calls me jack nice suit jack. Don't ask me to stand up. I know I see I see you, I see you in the mirror, yeah, you got it you're right, close that all right have a friend in sweden and he was giving a public discourse on zoom and he sends me a picture of him from the waist down he's in his hawaiian shorts. It was so funny he's like. Oh, you know, look at that. It was just funny because this whole pandemic has changed the way we function interact, function and, to be quite honest, I think when it so somewhat subside, I think we're going to be doing more remote things. You know, yeah we've learned, we've all been educated yeah. I wish I would invest in the zoom stock just through the roof, I'm so angry hello. Everyone nicely, I remember you. I came to your meeting at the state building. I think it was my first year being president of esplanade yeah. Yes, we have met, we have max. Yes, how have you been? I'm okay? I am healthy. My dad just had knee surgery so we're taking we're bringing him home from the hospital now so it just all kinds of stuff is happening, but where is people so he is in indiana, so indiana indianapolis indiana. So I drove out here, oh lord, to help okay. So that's what I'm doing I am listening. I just and that's why I'm late, because we're just getting him home from the hospital well, thank you for coming and he'll be in our thoughts and prayers. Okay, thank you. Thank you and thank you for joining us for the transportation meeting. Thank you. I'm glad that you're having us allowing us the opportunity to discuss this, because it's really a problem here, great. So, let's I can go ahead and call the meeting to order again. My name is sicily harris. I am the chair of community ward 10, but I'm also the chair of transportation. So welcome to our august meeting. We can go ahead and get started. I believe everyone has the agenda. I'm sorry! So we're gonna go ahead and get started with that. Our first person, oh, you don't have the agenda. It's okay! I just I'm not, I was I apologize. I don't have a copy of the agenda. Okay. Is there a way to share it? I don't know if he can share his screen. Really, don't worry, no worries, no worries. I'm sure I can follow the item on the agenda and that's the esplanade gardens. Yes, we have esplanade gardens today and I believe someone is going to speak to us from the black lives matter mural, but first let us get into the esme gardens issue. Did you did the president of espionage want to talk first about what their issue is? Yeah, please. Thank you. I just want to really thank everyone for allowing us this opportunity to have this discussion in regards to the issues that we're facing here. My name is maureen davis, I'm the board president at espana gardens and I represent over 1900, michelangelo families. We have a large block of people at least three to four thousand people that reside here so therefore, on behalf of at least 5 000 residents. I want to thank you for this opportunity. In addition to that, I just want to add that we have a an aging population in esplanade. We have a lot of seniors. We have a lot of civil rights activists who have been very active throughout their lives. Espionage been here 54 years, so our aging population is one of the groups that concern me the most currently, and it's not that we do not support city bike. You know they're doing a good thing throughout the city. However, the location of these bikes on esplanade gardens property is definitely problematic. For several reasons. We are underway of a hundred and twenty thirty million dollar project renovation project, where the city bikes are currently located, they're literally a few feet away from our pool area, which is going to be renovated as well, and we're going to have heavy machinery, that's going to be there. The block is literally in between two bus stops. There's only one way to get on and off the property for emergency vehicles. That means fire department, the ambulance and, as I mentioned in on the onset of my discussion, we have an aging population that has accessories day, program, buses and there's literally only one access point for three of our buildings, and we have scaffolding of literally from one to six from seventh avenue to linux avenue we have scaffolding up, and you know I was very shocked to see you know the city bikes with their trucks. You know setting up shop there. In addition, it presents you know, problems with our maintenance. You can't get to that area where they're at and right across the street is the transit, the bus depot and on that side of the street, there's more than enough room to accommodate those bicycles, and it would be out of the way but esplanade just you know it's very problematic the shareholders. They can't get on and off vehicles, and if we have a fire, we have a fight, the fire truck, there's one access point and they have to pass a string of bikes. You know it was it's just you know, there's a lot of other areas that they could place these. This bicycle station at, but where they put it, it's extremely problematic for the co-op and I'm getting. My phone does not stop ringing from my shareholders about these bikes sitting there and they just set up another bike station literally across the street, from building five and six, so they have bike stations within a block or two within each other. So you know we respectfully request the community boards 10 assistance with having these bike this bike station removed. You know as soon as possible, immediately if possible, it's been here since July the first and it's been nothing but problems. You know and my shield is, I don't even know what to tell them harrison for clarity for everyone's benefit. The intent here is to simply move the docking stations across the street because the emergency vehicles and accessories pull up on the sidewalk along esplanade's property and there's no other place for them to go. So what we're asking is to free up that space, so the accessorized vehicles, police, cars and fire trucks can do what they've done historically and planted a sidewalk, and the docking stations can simply be in the other side of the street 147.. That's really the substance of the of the request. Well further complicated, of course, is the fact that we have all this construction going on at esplanade and there's no room anywhere, so this is no place for these emergency vehicles and accessories to go other than where they went other than to block the street all right. So that's the essence of the request. Yes, so far and jack, I see we have jennifer here from D.O.T. Thank you so much for responding. I do have to say that when we have asked D.O.T to come out, you always have so thank you for coming to this community forum just to hear aspinat gardens and their concerns. Jennifer. Do you have anything to say, or is there anything that you could offer esplanade at this time? Absolutely thanks! Cecily thanks shatik for having us lyla, and I were just discussing a little bit of the background of this history and the station relocation request today. So he's also on as well just to introduce myself I'm jennifer, something as I'm the Manhattan deputy borough. Commissioner, at the new york city department of transportation- and you know I was made aware of this relocation request when it first came through our office and one of the things that I think you know, I do have a couple of questions that I'm hoping we could all discuss. But I did want to first put forth on the table that you know we worked closely with the community boards and other stakeholders to really decide how we would approach city bike expansion in community board 10, and our focus here was to really try to prioritize sidewalk locations where we could find them if they were feasible so that you know there would be minimal impact to you know residential parking across the district, and so you know I'm looking forward to discussing a little bit more to understanding what we could do at this particular location. It's my understanding that it's a relatively wide sidewalk right, one of the wider sidewalks in the area- and I think mj- was hoping to kind of better understand. Where exactly is the access point? It's not at the stairwell correct. It's further mid-block, where there's like a little plaza area with trees. Is that it so there isn't a stairwell over there and from my understanding, initially city bike, they were going to put that station on 7th avenue near the mta, the train station, because that's a that's a an open area that wouldn't obstruct people as it were. They put it between one, it's 147 between linux and seventh avenue. Yes, it is a wide street. However. Prior to the scaffolding being erected, emergency vehicles were able to get onto the sidewalk from 7th avenue. They can't do that anymore because we had the scaffolding up. That was, you know, issued because of the D.O.T. Well, the DOB. I got to get my things together, so there's literally one way that all of these vehicles can access the property and in between that one way is a city bike track and that's all we have not to mention we're getting ready to have the heavy machinery for the swimming pool, which is literally a few feet away from where the bikes are so at one point, we had two access points there to get on and off the property. We don't even have that anymore, so save for car double parks in a specific area. They will not even be able to get onto the property, it makes it even difficult. So the concern, because the concern is that wide sidewalk turns into an area for emergency vehicles to pull up and park, and I don't think the D.O.T could have known that. No, because that's it's not how it's written, but that's how it's practically been done. So no one would have been aware of that and no one was sensitive to what was going to happen until after these things were installed. Unfortunately, the property manager for esplanade gardens had a very bad car accident and has not was not at the office at the relevant times. Otherwise this likely would have been avoided, but the problem in the problem, in a nutshell, is that, because the docking station is located where it is, there's no place for the police cars to fire, the fire trucks, but more commonly the accessories to pull up on the sidewalk to get people. That's real and the question is: there's a fairly sizable sidewalk across the street that no one trafficks, so it just seems to make common sense to simply put it literally across the street, it'll be just as available to people, and it won't cause the problem that now exists and across the street literally directly across the street, the bus depot there's no entrance or exit. It's just. You know solid wall, no one's there, it's very little foot traffic. To be quite honest, you have more people walking their dogs on that side of the street, because they're there's not high pedestrian traffic. On that side of the street. You know I did my best to try to find the solution to the problem and not just come to say it's a problem for us. I you know I've taken pictures, I've had my crew take pictures and it's literally across the street, and nothing happens across the street understood and I'm just looking at google street view right now, and I do appreciate all of the suggestions for alternate locations because we welcome those. I just you know, I can't make a determination over the internet, but it does look like it's a relatively narrow sidewalk with a lot of different utilities and unfortunately, when there's too many tree pits or lamp posts, there looks like they're surface grit like surface utility caps as well. It might not be feasible. The other alternate would be. I think it was also discussed, but like there if the sidewalk doesn't work, even though we do think that the existing sidewalk, you know, meets all of our criteria. Granted that there's scaffolding in the way and there's other you know it's just it's different conditions than what normally would be you know on the ground is moving the station into the parking lane, which I don't believe was something that we were hoping to do in the first place, because we had heard a lot of concerns about parking removal so and I'm sorry, I just want to go back to my first question: mj and jack. I don't quite understand where exactly the access point is because if there is a way for us to, you know shift the station on the sidewalk where it's not blocking vehicular access, then we could look at that. Okay, so there's literally only one entryway one to the right of the bicycles and to the left is a staircase for my shareholders to get to building one and two to the right. It's in between it's it, that's the oh, the largest opening, which allows us to at least get a fire truck to possibly put out a fire. If it's between buildings, one two and three further to the right, is our swimming pool, which we're under 120 plus million dollar capital project which we're demoing, which we will need to have heavy machinery and other equipment that will have to go, get on and off of the property past. That is a driveway which is now covered with scaffolding, because the dlb deemed the buildings unsafe because we're doing the terrace work so literally, there's no other place to put the bike station on that street. One on that block. I understand they said. Oh it's a wide street, but it's a narrow street in comparison to the usage. It's the only place. We have there's no alternative, they don't even have it. The sad part is that the fire trucks cannot even get on from 7th avenue. They literally have to go around to linux avenue, not to mention it's two bus stations on the block as well. So now you have bikes two bus stations and they have to for the emergency vehicles. They have to literally come around because of the scaffolding on seven to even get on the property, and now I have bicycles to worry about that's helping to obstruct so I get across the street may not be the perfect place and it may not be as wide as directly across the street, but that side of the street has nothing going on. You know no one's trying to put out a fire to save thousands of lives across the street. You know initially when they brought this to esplanade. It was a buzz. Oh they're, going to put it on transit's property, because the train station is on 148th street between 149th street there's, nothing but a sidewalk in a train station. If they wanted to relocate the bike station there, you know what are they going to do? You know it's the bus station. You got a bus, stop there, the train station in the in the open street right on 7th avenue between 148th and 149th street. So there's a couple of options. You know, outside of it being smack dead in the middle of the thorough way of esplanade. We have no other place and when you mention the stairwell, even the stairs on our property on seventh avenue, it's covered with scaffolding, now it it's just, you know it and it could not have happened at a worse time. This is the like the worst time for it to even happen. My phone does not stop ringing. Shareholders are waiting to hear what is going on. You know, and we even have some community board members. That's a part of cb10 who even reside here, they're even complaining. So I think if you don't want to do it directly across the street, 148th 149th street, that's another prime. It's nothing but a street there, nothing in front of it. No buildings, it's just the train station, so I do just want to clarify one point, and I appreciate all of the comments that you're bringing to the table, because it should be a dialogue right now right and I think we have the space. So thank you again, cv10 for offering it to us. I think the phrasing of a perfect space across the across the way on the south side of 147th street isn't the right phrasing, because, even if it's not perfect, it has to be feasible and it has to be. You know like the right dimensions to fit the actual station. So I don't believe just you know my glancing on street view, because I'm not in the field with my measuring wheel is that it's not feasible there because there's a number of different tree pits and sidewalk or utilities on the actual sidewalk. That would so you know like a manhole right like we can't install a station on top of a manhole, because the utility companies would need to access that or if the three pits are too close together, we wouldn't be able to bridge every single tree pit. That's just not how our equipment can function. Does it have to be contiguous, I'm sorry contiguous or could it be like? Could it be broken up? It can be, but only to a certain degree. This is like a 25 doc station. I think, what's installed currently on the north side of the street, and we like to have a couple of plates of the station in between the tree pits granted it just doesn't look, you know it doesn't seem like it could be feasible. There also needs to be a minimum amount of pedestrian clearance. From the back of the bike to the tree pit. It looks tight on the across the street and I'll just you know if we could leave it at that for now, I think going back to the other alternates that could be. You know an interesting route to take, but I do just kind of want to better understand how we could potentially adjust the station in its current location so that it is not in the way of emergency vehicles, jennifer, honestly, there's no way to where it is seriously. If you it's against the gate which, even with gardening and taking care of that area, cleaning wise, that's enough. I didn't even bring that up, because I'm more concerned about the safety hazard issue that it's presented, if you relocate it anywhere on that sidewalk, it's problematic. It's problematic. That is the only place esplanade has for three buildings: 27 story, buildings multiplied by three: that's how many shareholders are with if emergency vehicles, the day vehicles seniors coming back and forth, not- and I didn't bring up the fact that my maintenance crew got the whole garbage and large items with tractor trailers in trucks to bring them over to the bins closer to the river. They travel that way and they have to try to travel in the street, because the scaffolding also presents more problems for us, and one of my business can't even use the contact room because the guys can't get the truck or the lift the forklift under the scaffold. So we've even had to get creative in pulling the garbage from building four and then I have bikes in the middle of the only place we have I've seen the city, bikes and streets in some neighborhoods. I've seen them. You know I've seen, businesses have them removed, but this is really a problem. If it wasn't a problem, I wouldn't be here it it's a huge problem. You know you're saying you know tree pits across the street. We have tree pits too, of course, you know, and by espenor, which they just came and made more treatment. You know, I didn't know they, we came one day and they were planting trees, but this is just you know, and I would hate for a catastrophe then, and oh because we had the bikes there, so I lost a couple of hundred people because they burned up in their apartment or, unfortunately, the ambulance in the fire truck couldn't get past, because these two can't get on the side and we have to come around it. It's just it's just such a problem. It does sound like the scaffolding is presenting a little bit because you're used to having a 30-foot wide sidewalk right, and I think if the scaffolding wasn't currently up, I don't think we would be having this discussion. I will say, I'm sorry mj. It would not be as a big of a problem because at least we may have had two ways on the street exactly no other way. One way, if you have a fire department, the ambulance and the coming at once, they all have to come up one street, possibly behind the buses to get on a sidewalk jennifer. The problem is that is that it says, in essence, is a de facto parking lot for emergency vehicles, and accessories I mean this is a public sidewalk right, so it shouldn't be used as such. I will put that out there, but you know for an emergency lane with any of our other streetscape projects across Manhattan across the city. Typically, we need to allow about. You know between 10 to 15 feet for an emergency vehicle. If the scaffolding wasn't up here, we would have you know plenty of space. So I'm not sure you know I'm. I I'm hoping that. Maybe I don't know if you can take pictures of the of the station configuration I can ask to see. If any of you know, the D.O.T team can do that as well. I kind of just want to better understand exactly what could be done here. I know that you had brought up the upcoming construction on the pool. Oh, the construction is underway is that the construction issue is going to intensify. Can we possibly meet you? We possibly meet you there and walk it with you that that's something I will have to double check we're not particularly doing a lot of on-site visits at the moment I just want. I mean it's, it is what it is right, jack. I'm sorry. I saw the eye roll, but it's unfortunate that like we also want to make sure that our staff is safe, but that is something that I can double check on, and so one thing to do is you know, potentially look at other alternatives in jennifer. Let me just add this. I just want to say our we have some of this scaffolding up because the buildings were deemed unsafe. You know we don't want to be on the news for terrorists falling on someone. Our buildings all have been deemed unsafe, and this bad part about this city bike thing is that these people, the users are, could possibly put them be placed in jeopardy because of the conditions in which you're placing these bikes at, if you're putting it in the middle of it like a construction war zone, where there's that we can have emergency vehicles in addition to all the work and the sampling is on one on the corner of 7th avenue. If that scaffolding was not there right, that means that an emergency vehicle can get on the sidewalk at seven batteries and they still would have to travel the same way path to get on the property. Let's hear the alternatives, possibly so that's something that I did want to get into a little bit. So when our contractor lyft spoke to one of the assistant property managers before the station installation, I think miss kittens had mentioned that the construction would start, let me see- or at least it wouldn't start fully for another two years. So that's what I'm just gonna double check on. It sounds like that right. It sounds like there's. Some misinformation. Miscommunication, it sounds like the construction is already underway last year, understood and so for all of our city bike station installations, whether it be on the sidewalk or in the parking lane. We work very closely with our construction permits office, so whenever there is upcoming impending work, whether it be staging or actual construction in that area, we work to temporarily pick up and relocate the station to a nearby site and then once construction and that work clears. We verify that the original site still works, and then we will replace the station at its original initial home, and so that is something that if there is upcoming construction with any potential conflict and overlap, we would work to address relocating the station during the time that the work was underway. So I just you know it. I I'm not. I I'm just trying to kind of fully understand what other what else goes on this sidewalk here to figure out where we could potentially look to adjust the station, and I will say I think mj you mentioned, that there were some like gardening maintenance access concerns. I could you talk a little bit more about that. Well, right, where you have those city bikes, it's our grassy area, our trees, there's a fencing up and now with the city we have garbage in between the guys, can't even really get over there to clean and now they're kind of maintaining the city bike station and trying to take care of the property the grounds the bike is literally against the gate. I think there's a few inches between the plate and the gate. You know in certain situations if folks need access to trim the hedges at some locations, we've pushed the station a little bit back to allow access. I don't think that's needed here. It also sounds like we might even consider pushing the station flush to the fence here, so that it would allow that extra six inches on the actual sidewalk, but the contractor is obligated under a contract that they have with the city to visit the station and clean the station. We also have some DOT inspections that happen as well, and so, if you do see any buildup of trash or garbage around the station, please your maintenance crews are not obligated to handle that our contractor is so you there's a phone number on the on the bike on the station itself. You can also email me and lyle because we coordinate with our bikeshare team every day. All primary concern is over the maintenance of the cleanliness of the area. It's about accessibility for seniors emergency vehicles. I haven't been to the location, so I haven't seen the city bike so jack. I would be willing to do a site visit. I'm gonna go as early as tomorrow to check it out, but because I am familiar with that street, could you let me know if the bike rack? Is it closer to adam clinton, power or closer to malcolm x? It's close to adam clayton powell, and you know that gate between the swimming pool and building one that gate where the trees are. It's only one gate prior to getting a stairwell, it's along the whole game. Okay right, I get what you're saying and I definitely will come up so you're, saying because it's on that gate and that pathway is a emergency vehicle, sometimes go correct. That's the only way they can get on the property literally the only way, and it's and that's been the only entry point. However, they've been they've been able to get onto the sidewalk, because that's another issue to literally be able to get on to the sidewalk if a car is blocking the abraham, the abraham, lincoln the martin luther king bus statue, if a car is blocking there, it literally the fire truck, would have to wait because you have the scaffolding up by the driveway by the pool. So that's a no-go. No emergency vehicle can get on the sidewalk there, so they have to get on the sidewalk in between the block near the swimming pool. Next bike station from linux, savvy news site, and now we have the bikes there, I'm looking at the street map. How does that even work? You know, listen, okay, I get it and the bikes are nice. You know I go to Brooklyn in different areas. In the barrels and most of these bike stations, they usually will put them in the or on the sidewalk, where, like when I was in Brooklyn, it's on the side of a building where there's no businesses, it's not impacting anyone. Let me ask you this: it's the only street. We have for everything for everything. So if you were coming at 147 from adam clayton powell's side, there's a there's one like stairway, the first stairway that goes down right, then there's a little battling down. Yeah go ahead, go ahead, there's one stairway down, and then there seems it's like a long like a gate until it comes to the next entryway right yeah. If the city bikes were along that gate, would you have a problem? That's that that's where they are right there yeah, that's where they are. Okay, all right here they are okay, so I'll, definitely like I I'm able to meet as soon as tomorrow, or so you guys, just let me know- and I also like to see where you think would be feasible like for them to go on, and I can. I can make myself available to meet with. You should seek what time you let me know, I'm looking at my calendar right now, I'll drive in okay tomorrow, I'm not available. Unfortunately. Well, if jennifer, if you'd be willing to work this out I'll make the trip it will work if it's a campus, we'll try to accommodate your schedule. That is our borough, commissioner, is on paternity leave. So I am also kind of juggling two jobs at the moment, but I hear you, I think if you are all available to meet tomorrow and shatika, I also defer to you, if you're ready, to discuss this more like quickly, I'm happy to regroup with you and see what alternates are brought to the table and then potentially find another time when I could come into come into the city right and when I you know, when I do the group visit, I will actually take pictures as well as video to help you visualize. Thank you. What's what time works for you tomorrow, give me one. Second, let me just take some I'll rearrange my schedule by the way, the amount of time you're giving us is extraordinary. Thank you. I'm available before noon. You know how long does it take you to get into the city I'll, be there six in the morning? If you want me there six in the morning, you tell me what time, what's he does nine o'clock work for you, nine thirty, nine o'clock. Nine o'clock is fine and it'll be cooler than I think it'll be before the rain mj. Is that okay? Is that too early part of me? You know I'm not a morning person. Well guys. I want to keep my job. Listen, whatever works, for you too I'll make myself available how about a 10 or 11.. I've got a call with the city. I've got another call at the city, it's an important call from about 10 15 to about 11 15.. Now I could do that call from my car. Does it let does it look? Does 11 30 work sure I think one thing also to keep in mind and I'm sorry that I won't be able to you know kind of narrate. This during tomorrow's site visit is that we were tasked to triple the bike fleet as well as double the size of the city bike program. You know with this new infusion there was a capital investment of 100 million dollars from lyft the city's contractor two years ago, and so we're currently in what's called phase three expansion. This is what's happening here in cbs, 9, 10 and 11, we're moving north of 155th street and now into community board 12, as well as into new neighborhoods of the Bronx, and so the system has been extremely successful since it launched in 2013. we've reached over 100 million rides. That was a huge. You know a huge just like record that we broke and this it means a lot to me because before I became the deputy borough, commissioner, I was also you know the director of planning for the bikeshare team, so I do know a lot about city bike and the intricacies of the network planning when you're walking around tomorrow. One thing to note is you know the dimensions of the station you'll see that you know from the front of the bike to the back of the bike. It's about six feet. We need to make sure that there's enough pedestrian clearance around the station and it can't really move too far from where it's currently installed, because in order for the system to be successful, there needs to be a dense network of walkable stations. So each station is about three to five minutes away from the next, and, like I mentioned before here in cb10, we tried to prioritize locations on the sidewalk so that we would minimize parking impact, and so that's kind of why you might see some of the stations spread out a little bit more closely together. But it's still it's still within that network that we're trying that density of stations and network that we're trying to maintain. So that's something to just keep in mind for tomorrow saying it's a possibility to have placement on the street, but on the other side of the street as well. That would dislocate some parking, but that's a possibility. I mean I'm not sure if it's feasible, I'm not sure. If the road bed is feasible right, there might be utilities underneath vehicles as well, but that is you know. Something to consider is the context of the neighborhood and what right and like the adjacent properties- and this is exactly I know- mj it's you know- that's also. One of the reasons why we're having this discussion is because the adjacent property here is unhappy with the station placement, so you know we're just continuing to discuss what could be done. Okay, so I've noticed a lot like jack just mentioned about those bike stations being in the street close to the curve, the sidewalks right. You have stock on seventh avenue, which it's right, the regular size. But it's you know that part that stops there. It's not a high traffic bus stops with a multitude of different buses coming in it's one bus that stops at that station on 147th street in the corner. Why not use some of that corner? You know you can put the bike station there. Are you just talking about around the corner on adam clayton around the corner right there is the bus stop yep and the bus that stops. There is not like the Bronx bus with the double accordion bus. It's a it's a little bus that goes there. That goes, you know the rest of harlem, which is another 10 blocks at best. You know it's not a high traffic bus station bus. Stop. You know I'm trying to think of solutions for you guys, I'm not just here to say I want the more from esplanade's property, I'm trying to strategically help to plan an adequate place to put them across the street. There's another bus stop of residential areas, which, unfortunately, you have a bunch of people who just seem to loiter over in those areas that it's literally right across the street and I'm assuming that it's convenience and utilization that you're looking for so right, the street from esplanade. There are buildings across the street. Why not put them across the street absolutely and so before we expand into any new neighborhood, I'm just looking at street view now around the corner in front of pioneer supermarket. In addition, well, we have the scaffolding of I had scaffolding around esplanade the whole esplanade. You can walk from building one to six covered in scaffolding, with the exception, the a train yard there's a brief period where there's no scaffolding, because our buildings aren't there and you're back under this scaffolding literally from building one store, is a possibility. You know nothing is a possibility really, because I you know, I'm not I'm not worried about it right absolutely, I mean it is possible, but what I was going to say earlier is that before we expand into any new neighborhood, what we do is we have field staff that canvas all of the new areas, and so- and let me finish- and so I will- I will say right so, like they're siting at the different sidewalks locations, as well as the different street spaces, it's possible that we do miss things. Also conditions change between when the station some sometimes conditions change between when the station gets installed to when it was first preliminary. You know surveyed, but that's just you know it's all something. To keep in mind. We don't install stations that block bus stops that block entrance ways. I think you're all familiar with. You know what stations look like around the city and around the neighborhood, so you can just imagine where it could potentially be placed here, but okay in juniper there's the river houses literally on the right hand, side of 148th street train station and, like I told you on that side of the there's, nothing there's a lot of open space right there around the corner, one block over- and you just put a station literally on 146th street and linux avenue right there there's a there's, a bike station and one on 146, and then you have one on 147th street. You know in the thorough way of where our emergency vehicles and everything else has to get on and off the property. And then you have the train station right in front of the train station. There's nothing but a sidewalk! There's no building! There's no bus, stop! There's nothing! They can put it in the sidewalk is wide nothing. It obstructs nothing and then a few feet away. When you have the harlem river houses, where they just had benches, that sits inside where the whole sidewalk is open and if you go across the street on the downtown side of 7th avenue, there's sidewalks over there six-story walk-up buildings. I have a question for jack. I know jack, you represent the shareholders at esplanade. Have you been on contact, I'm with the property management? I'm company and are they? Are they? Do they share your sentiment? Are you they're standing in alliance with the shareholders? Yes, I'm the voice president. We paid them yes yeah. So my comment would be that this is not a michelangelo rental. This is a michelangelo cooperative, so the boss is on this is on this in this meeting with us right, because the because the letter said that they reached out to the property manager and the problem was yeah. That was the assistant manager because the person that's in management was in a horrific car accident just before I don't think she appreciated what was being asked of her okay, all right, I don't think she understood okay, yeah, unfortunately, and it had she had bro directors for discussion, because when they set up these bikes, we have a text thread with the board members. Just in case you know emergency things. The pictures were flowing. The board is in the uproar what's going on and nobody knew that I have the pictures from when I can show you the truck that was setting up the bikes that, because my shareholders are sending building, but tomorrow, when I come out, you'll give me all of that information. I'll see you pictures no problem. Now, I'm cecily. I know that we have some questions from some people in the chat and they're not all relating to esplanade, but I know that since D.O.T is on the line, you want to make use of them. So I don't know if there's anyone who has questions in regards to esplanade or has questions in regards to this conversation, I see karen ori has her hand raised board member karen orrin I'll. Take your yes, hello. Everyone. I just like to say that the gen esplanade gardens is an 1800 unit development and there are a lot of there's a large population of seniors in the development and to place a structure there. That is obstructing emergency vehicles in the midst of a pandemic is just unconscionable, and I just like to know what outreach was done. I in meetings have advocated more thorough outreach to the community, so I just like to know just what was done in terms of outreach and also does esplanade gardens have a petition to the effect of what their position is miss. We have not gotten a petition because we've gotten our corporate council involved. However, if a petition is required completely the numbers, the signatures would be overwhelming. So if cb10 is requesting that type that, if we do that believe me by next week, I can have a stack of petitions, because the phone calls are ridiculous. I can literally have shareholders set up each building and people will sign a petition, it's that overwhelming and problematic. Yes, it definitely is on topic. I know, like you mentioned earlier, ms davis, you know we had a couple of community board, 10 members who reside and espionage who brought this up to my attention before the meeting. So I know this is definitely something a priority and a high concern to the residents there. So definitely something that we need to look into, and I just to jennifer what was the outreach that was done. Yeah hi, karen hi. I did just want to clarify so in addition to going to the cb10 transportation committee, as well as the full board a couple months ago, our lift our lift, our contractor lyft does all of the you know like non-city. You know notifications, so DOT does all you know we reach out to our partner agencies to let them know about an impending station installation, but our contractor lift as jack and shatik had mentioned before had reached out. You know to speak to the assistant general property manager, which it sounds like you know they weren't talking to the actual director or the property manager who unfortunately, was in a in a collision prior to the notification, so that was the notification karen. That was done to the gardens. Okay, because I know I personally did ask that outreach be done to these major developments. You could attend their board meetings and, as opposed to just speaking, to a single individual. You know that was suggested. I can personally say at meetings and there's when we are asked to do that. We try to attend like for, like tenants, associations for NYCHA campuses. If there is that request made, we will come to present if there is are multiple stations that are planned for you know adjacent to those properties. I hear you, karen okay, before we I'll move to the next question, cicely. If it's all right with you, we have another question: that's not regarding esplanade garden, so I just want to give anyone an opportunity if they want to make a statement or they have any question for D.O.T or jack or mj. In regards to esplanade garden at this point to either rate, you know, raise a hand and say so, if not, we will move on to the next question for D.O.T. We will see you tomorrow. We thank you very much, all of you and everyone else for listening to us and having patience with us say. Thank you on behalf of my shareholders, and I have strong faith that jennifer you're going to take care of this and understand our position, and I'm going to thank you for your understanding and assistance with this. Thank you. Everyone have a good night. Everyone stay well and safe. Thank you same see you tomorrow, bye-bye all right. So that leads us to. We have a question in regards to open play street for the harlem hebrew charter: school. Okay. I think vanessa you're on the line. Yes hi. Thank you so much for taking my question and I hope that this is appropriate. My name is vanessa goldberg jossman. I am a board member and a parent at harlem hebrew and we have limited play space for our school, especially given. What's going on with Covid-19 several years ago, we did a petition to try to close the space to the right of the school, and we are interested in trying to see if the time is right to close the space on saint nicholas between 117 and 118 for several hours a day, so that we're able to give our children the opportunity to go outside and have safe space, because we'd spent so much time last time and had failed. We didn't want to go through all of the trouble without coming to all of you first to see if this was even something that you had an appetite for at this time and if so, what the process would be so that we do it correctly and in a timely manner, understood hi vanessa good evening nice to meet you. Should I consistently? Is it okay? If I just respond or okay thank you, and so, while I just want to pull up one thing on google's three years, so there's no parking garage there. We need shore, we know, there's a parking garage on the other street, and so that was one of the major factors in terms of you know, one of the reasons why we were asking for st nicholas. Oh I see so the request would be for the street closure on saint nick between 117th and 118th, correct, exactly understood, and just for my own benefit. Does the campus actually extend to boat like it's the whole block right? Yes, it actually is success for a very small corner on 117., it's like a garden and then a building that goes on to 117, but we do span most of the block, except for the restaurant across the street and, I believe, there's also some kind of community building across the street. But the restaurant has been a very good friend to the school, so we feel like if we went to them they'd be comfortable working with us understood. So, as you all would guess, we've received a number of requests across the city from schools that are interested in kind of expanding their school space onto the streets, particularly or you know really just at this time and with the impending school year. So these are discussions that we're still having internally we're trying to figure out what could be feasible here so vanessa, is it possible? Can you send myself and lyle a request sure you know with the specific location informations you said there was a time of day sure yes, looking for the play street type treatment. That would be the most useful and then we can share that with our colleagues and then circle back to you. If there is, you know a path forward here, could I get your email addresses? I apologize for lyles, it's a little bit easier, so it's l, blackwood and if you see, if you'll see the spelling of both of our names on the screens and it's like l blackwood at dot.nyc.gov- oh blackboard, I can also just put it in the chat. Thank you. I appreciate that sorry. Is there any kind of other additional work we have to do in terms of petitions or things like that would be necessary at this point vanessa, I think just sent us the request. I'm guessing there will be some. You know there. Of course it's supported by parents, so I understand that you're bringing this forth from you know as a parent from someone at the harlem hebrew academy, so I'm also a board member okay, I serve on not the pto like the real board, I'm one of the real board members and I'm a parent. So that's why they sent me today- yeah of course, yeah, and so we'll just continue to talk about that and then for cb10. If there are other locations that, where you're hearing interested parties just please send them to lyle and myself, as I said, it's still an ongoing discussion, there's right now, you know we really there's no other information that we can provide, but as one would guess it is, people are looking to see how we could help them during this time. Well, I appreciate your proactiveness and I will follow up as soon as possible. Thank you good to meet you and thank you all for letting me ask the question. Okay, thank you and our agenda items. Unless anyone has any other questions or no, I think we covered everything, but I just had a quick question with the open streets and just something for, and I know we want to always be inclusive, so when organizations request to close the streets at that point, it is public access to that closed street. Is that correct? I just want to make sure that everyone's clear with that. Yes, we're clear with that, I mean we would have teachers there, but from what I understand is that look. The truth of the matter is that corner is a tough corner, because that's also by that little triangle park, but we recognize what we're up against, but the idea of having nothing for the kids is much worse than having it watched well for the kids and we'll do our best to keep them toward the 118th side of that street. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I we we're well aware of the of the up. I don't want to call it an obstacle. It's just a challenge, but we legitimately don't have room to bring the kids outside and we think that, given especially the tenor of, what's going on it's critical, we find some place to let those kids have a moment to be. You know to breathe. Thank you, okay and cecily. I did want to clarify too sorry. Just before we wrap this item up you had mentioned. You know there is an open street on 117th street here, but D.O.T is really being tasked and the administration is being like heavily tasked right now to figure out how to come up with creative solutions for Covid-19 recovery. So right we have open streets, there's the open restaurants as you're, also aware, but then there's also something called open streets play, which you know. One of the reasons why I brought up google maps was to just kind of check exactly where the academy you know was placed in terms of the open street so for open streets play. If there's a school that is already on an open street. There is some there's a little bit more flexibility that we could have there to allow. You know the school to utilize some of that space, but vanessa will take all of that into consideration when we receive the request. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Are you saying that 117 already has some open streets play? There is an open street on 117th street, so that's right. An open streets play if you, if you just go to nyc.gov open streets, that will have a little bit more information all right and we'll take it forward vanessa, but it has been a little bit difficult to control. So sometimes it's closed, and sometimes it's not because that organization that was sponsoring had a little bit of trouble kind of controlling that area. So that's one thing where we're trying to make sure that the organizations that are sponsoring the open streets are fully aware of the responsibility. We are aware of the responsibility and I specifically had asked if we were going to have the coverage to be able to handle it and they feel very comfortable based on the number of kids we'll be having and how many classes at a time will be down there, that it would be managed responsibly and obviously, if it doesn't work, we'd have to revisit that, but the idea of getting to try it has been long on the list for the school. So we figured the time was right to try again. Okay, all right. Thank you. Is there anything else shatique. I just see that miss board member karen ori has her hand raised. I don't know if she had it for the last segment or she has a question about her harlem hebrew charter. Yes, I do have a question for harlem hebrew charter vanessa. I'd just like to ask what outreach have you done to other organizations or residents on in the area so that you know when the street is? If the street is closed, it won't be a surprise that you have the buy-in from the community to be truthful. We have not we several years ago, we did it on 117 and we had petitions and that didn't work out well, because I think 117 was different. We've never done it on st nicholas, but our first step was to even see if this group was open to it and if the city was open to it, because so much effort was put against it last time, and so many parents took the time to petition. So we wanted to start with this group and just make sure that there was even an opening for us before we began that phase. But if that's something that we need to do and we need to speak with more community leaders. I am more than happy to put those people into in touch with the right people and knock on those doors and put that into full effect. But this was really our. I was pretty much the person thrown out tonight to start the process and see if there was even a reality check here, and I think just because of the time that we're in with everything that's going on with Covid-19, and you know just keeping that in mind. I think sometimes the process has been superseded, whereas you know organizations had to get petitions and you know reach out to civic organizations but because of the times that we're in even if you look at what happened with open streets things happen. You know so quick in this in this type of situation. So we're glad that we're having a discussion here and then the conversation will, you know, continue as we go on and we'll you know, keep in loop with the kind with the emails and you know, keep everyone up to date on the process on how it's how it's going. But if this group would be more comfortable with us getting certain sign offs from the neighbors, that's absolutely a step, we're ready and willing to take well. Thank you so much vanessa because, as you probably know, and as shatik said, it is not required for folks to come to the community board for open streets. So we are very, you know, happy that you did that and let us know- and so we can start having those conversations and be more intimately involved in the open streets. So you can go ahead and do a petition, but it is important just for you to kind of go around and inform those businesses and residents around there, so they'll be aware of it. So that's what like you totally? We will we'll make that one of our action items in addition to writing the email to the DOT, and if you want me to come to the next meeting, I'm more than happy to be put on a list. So I can give you an update we're in august, so you know. Look I live in new york city. I know things don't usually happen that fast, but our school physically won't be opening until September 18th, I believe, for the children or about the third week in September. So I believe you do have another board meeting before that, so I'm more than happy to put it on my calendar, if I can get the zoom and give you guys an update, then thank you. Thank you. We appreciate it no problem. I appreciate all of this and I appreciate the time that you've given me because to go through what we went through several years ago was just really frustrating and we kind of wanted to make sure we were putting our energy in the right. Thank places. Jennifer thank you and lyle, and karen for your question and all of you for allowing me to participate thanks, vanessa. Okay! Is there anything else? No more agenda items might want to go to old business new business. Yes, is there any old business, any new business? Okay, I will say this jennifer, I'm gonna reach out to you about a question I had about some upcoming open streets, so we can have that conversation. It doesn't really reside with community board 10, but some of the things that we are partnering with some other organizations on. So I just want to make sure that those are clear with you guys so I'll, send you that email we can talk offline. So at this time I will entertain a motion to adjourn so moved a second the motion. Thank you karen and thank you lyle. For coming. I see we have board members marcus and lashonda on as well. So thank you all for coming. We do have another meeting. The next time we meet will be official in September, so one of our official board transportation board meetings, but with that motion has been moved and properly seconded, we are adjourned at 7. 40 p.m. Have a nice night! Everyone thank you guys have a good night good night stay cool, take care good night.
