We're going to start with my report, so I have continued to stay busy, And I'm, so glad to see that so many people are making it to the meetings and that the board as a whole has stayed active.
Manhattan bro president gail brewer was right, along with all the chairs and the community, with equal, concern, so I think going forward.
If you are able to come out and help out with any social distancing efforts on those streets or with those young people, you're encouraged to do so, especially this saturday, from 12 to six and when any of those locations.
We came together and decided that since we weren't able to have the events that we that we had anticipated on having throughout the summer, we would use our remaining budget to basically purchase things in advance for the upcoming fiscal year.
You all recall that so some of the things that we spent money on during this pandemic was a live streaming camera to basically assist our office in live streaming, events etc and having and making sure that our meetings can be you know, distributed across social media.
So that way they can store documents that they may need on the external hard drive and still be able to access them remotely from home, an air purifier for the office for safety, when the staff does return to the office to work and If constituents return to the office instead of us, so that you know, we make sure that we have some sort of ventilation in there.
Basically, a budget request form for committee chairs and board members to complete in case they need to.
Aside from that, I'm, not aware of any other expenses that we made in this new budget You know wi-fi phone service for the office and also the rent is paid up through august right and that lease payment is a thousand dollars.
You, know, I'm excited that you did this report That's why I really wanted you to do this report, because I think it's important for the board members to hear the difference of amount of money we had last year and what we have this year.
You know that's going to cut down on the cost, but You know it's important for us to even reevaluate our partnerships that we have with different agencies so that we can, if we do decide to do something that we'll be able to maximize that potential and not spend a lot of money on those things, because joshua, I think committee chairs are used to having the 1500 per committee.
You know we have a lot of committees that sort of intersect with each other like land use and housing and landmarks and preservation.
You know the budget talk I'm still working remotely and we're not in the office.
Second present, so They discussed some of the issues on one of the issues that they said that they had concern concerns about the nonprofits that were serving the harlem community and with the current economic state, and what's going on with Covid-19, they were just wondering how you know: they're good, because they've been around for a long time, but then there's other nonprofits that doesn't you know the legacy that they do They were just wondering how would be able to survive this covert because those non-profits you know I've, been as a collective they've, been version of the community in our district.
That's come up and our committees were on public safety, but I just wanted to you know , let everyone know that their headquarters has moved to 124th street and children's aid.
You know our community members have come out with initiatives to help clean up harlem and everyone's been chipping in and doing their part, because if you know we don't have the budget, we're not just going to sit around and the job not get done.
I, know, I, think I, think gregory and a fella randolph does this every tuesday morning or something like that, but just want to thank everybody in the community for coming together.
116Th street, you know going door-to-door speaking with the small businesses and it was good to see on the borough president out, there, And, you know just the business owners were able to tell her firsthand some of the troubles and issues that they were experiencing.
Everything from department of building, liens and summons that people received to you know they weren't able to get a loan or they were able to get a loan or compliance issues with social distance.
She got a chance to see firsthand all of the crowds that are mass on that corner, 124th 325th street, and she said that you know she would recommend that we actually set up a meeting with son of with some of the facilities on the treatment.
Oh, they seem it's an open drug market, a lot of drug use Street, So, something that we gonna have to look into with our public safety committee as well, and then have that meeting with them, as well as the 28th president.
It's like a one-stop shop, now, okay, Once again this at 117, west 124th street, and if you need any contact, information, I'll put my email in it to chat, and you can email me We're going to go ahead and move to our standing committee and task force.
Thank, you so much for sending me the two letters from our borough president, which I think will be very helpful in us finishing our letter that we're going to add there is a meeting tomorrow night face is having a meeting around school.
If anyone wants to register to hear the latest on, what's going on in school, openings with you know, outdoor learning, and all of that, you can find that on that meeting tomorrow, night.
Secondly, around the back to school event at the end of the board, year, I did work with shatik metro, because there was a lot of discussion around there, not being as much money.
If you want to you, can chime in that there should be a nurse in each school that can handle these kinds of things when the school year opens marquis Why her question was she had heard that parents are being asked to take their own children's temperature before they come to school?
You know for high school students who have individualized programs Okay, we're going to move on to health with dr hazel dukes reporting on nursing, homes.
We looked at the sanitation at how dirty the streets, was, and then I, don't know whether dr smith is on or not, but for the program that they're doing the three women at mount morris park, that is doing fresh vegetables and for their community.
Talking about requests for support from linux court hdfc, I have been communicating with latoya and emphasized to her that this is our executive committee meeting tonight.
I certainly want to make sure that this is on the agenda for the housing committee in september We will continue to address whatever concerns or issues that this particular hdfc may have and certainly would be prepared to fulfill a commitment I made in that meeting with the task force and that is to assist in outreach to you, know, elected officials.
You know people like vern ballard I just want to thank you and thank all the members of the executive committee for giving us an opportunity to really share the challenge that we are we're facing and putting us on your agenda.
You know we'll Look at that question, but certainly welcome the opportunity for us to address that in our housing committee meeting in september to clarify what karen is talking.
Their rent will be not going down because that has already happened a couple years ago for that, for that class, So, some people are getting like twenty five hundred dollars.
I just would like to know what other buildings in our developments in cb10 are affected, and I think that same situation came up with devoid park a few years, ago.
I. Don't know if you've read the article where the mayor has said that that the that the europe applications will be directed at communities that are greatly affected by Covid-19, and so I'm, anticipating a lot of rapid development beyond, what's already going on in the district as a justification for creating jobs and other things of that nature.
So I'd like to ask the committee to vote on going forward with this project.
If you wanted to give people a chance- Can, you circulate this to the board now or on the entire board, tonight, or either first thing tomorrow morning Has this letter and they're able to either even develop questions in advance?
Probably, since it's national, they travel around the country and do studies, but I just feel that in this environment and in our community, I'm always concerned like as people are coming, what is what are they going to report?
You know questioning people and turning out some paperwork and some of what I heard And I have to read: everything, But I, just don't want our community to be like guinea pigs for anybody, and I just use that in quotes that may sound harsh.
So I to me, personally, I would like to really read understand there are you know, And, like you said, if they're gonna help to clear and clean and plan and organize, but I'm, you know just think that there are many people who are in tune and in touch, and maybe the resources are not there, but who are in tune and in touch with our community to get some comprehensive thing going, but I would have to read it and the way you explained it, but I'm just concerned in terms of what reports are going to go, whether out about us with people who may not have the sensitivities and understanding.
We did address some of the issues that are going on 124th street, so we will circle back, and that means bringing in our health committee and dr dukes and starting those conversations that we had before about how to clean those streets and dealing with those facilities that are there.
If people are just not complaining up here or don't know how to report, it I missed the thing you said before that we're talking about the open, streets, open restaurants and the loud music.
Having gathering too many people, no social distancing, no mass, like you, know, I, think that there's been more complaints about that than the noise because of just the general safety of the community, because those people that want to gather and be like that can go and infect other people.
I, don't know if y'all work on that side with community board, but they really need to be informed.
They are going to get random pop-ups, because that's what the city does the liquor authorities and all of them But I, think it would be good if we had some position paper or just talking to people so that they're, adhering and knowing about being safe But I mean at 145th and and lennox avenue, where they have that free thing.
I know deborah, is working with her contacts, cc5 and cdc3 to write the letter, but she's also going to circulate it with the board and our committees.
