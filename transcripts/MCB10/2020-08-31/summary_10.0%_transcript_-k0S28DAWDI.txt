just in case people can't see it We're going to start with my report, so I have continued to stay busy and I'm so glad to see that so many people are making it to the meetings and that the board as a whole has stayed active that when we, when I, do talk to other community board chairs and go to the borough board, meetings- and I think it's important to tell you all, especially as the leaders of this board.
President We were he'll, be able to maybe have a session with our community It's, not as impactful when you have such a large group, but we want it just to start that conversation You know it's important, especially at a time like this to look inside and and explore our own biases and how those manifest So. We want to be able to do that, but secondly there is an ongoing conversation about the next step and what that might be plus for 30 bucks for boards to come together and then I will hopefully, in september, be able to come back to the exec board, with a proposal that all the boards will be involved in a project coming up soon.
For the upcoming fiscal year, Under the you know, knowing that we might not have the same budget, because we actually ended up expending our entire budget for the previous year, but we are able to get some additional funds allocated to our budget after we let a staff member go If. You all recall that so some of the things that we spent money on during this pandemic was a live streaming camera to basically assist our office in live streaming, events etc and having and making sure that our meetings can be.
So, please I'm sure our education committee chair will share more on that At the end of it all, we ended up spending that entire 23 000 budget, less three thousand dollars, We weren't able to use the city council's budget because pretty much it's only so it was only available for leasing for events or for technology upgrades We weren't really able to utilize that budget The way that we would have liked to so going into our new fiscal year, which began july.
We also have an additional one thousand dollar budget, which is set aside for urban planning or tech assistance So due to these financial constraints, as you, if you can recall from the previous meeting, I presented a budget Basically, a budget request form for committee chairs and board members to complete in case they need to You, know need money for an event or some sort of advocacy or technical or professional expertise that they need to procure so that way that we can better track our spending and make sure that the limited funds that we do have available is distributed evenly across all the committees.
You know that's going to cut down on the cost, but you know it's important for us to even reevaluate our partnerships that we have with different agencies so that we can, if we do decide to do something that we'll be able to maximize that potential and not spend a lot of money on those things, because joshua I think committee chairs are used to having the 1500 per committee.
It's really going to be on a first come first serve, but we're also going to be very cognizant that we're not we're not allowing one or two or three committees to eat up the entire budget So. You also want to be very efficient in your planning and making sure that you know you're getting the best deal, you're very you're, being very I would say very vigilant and how you spend the money and plan them and plan the event.
I. Think it's important for we have to collaborate So. You know we have a lot of committees that sort of intersect with each other, like land use and housing and landmarks and preservation, So I definitely think collaboration would be a good way to limit expenses for everybody and to make sure that all the committees are being active and getting a piece of on the budget.
This year, Shatik, hey everyone, jatik mitchell, here, district manager, community board, 10 I just want to follow up on You know the budget talk I'm still working remotely and we're not in the office.
That's opened up 135th street, it's actually right across the street from the 30 I'm second present, so They discussed some of the issues on one of the issues that they said that they had concern concerns about the nonprofits that were serving the harlem community and with the current economic state, and what's going on with Covid-19, they were just wondering how you know: they're good, because they've been around for a long time, but then there's other nonprofits that doesn't you know the legacy that they do and they were just wondering how would be able to survive this covert because those non-profits you know I've, been as a collective they've, been version of the community in our district?
Since, then they've been cut down and I've heard that, though the tree scraps have been turned into mulch They invited us after they came to our transportation meeting, because they had a concern about the city bike placement on at esplanade gardens and the main objection to the bikes being at this location is that they were concerned that emergency vehicles, including ems, fdny and NYPD, also accessorized, and would have issues coming up onto the sidewalk in case of emergency, and they said that they want them across the street?
Interesting enough people from esplanade, gardens, They, weren't well, the people I spoke with They said that they would not be opposed to if the bike racks were actually on the street, which was something which was a first You know, hearing it from community members, because, most of the time, we're always complaining about lack of parking.
You know our community members have come out with initiatives to help clean up harlem and everyone's been chipping in and doing their part, because if you know we don't have the budget, we're not just going to sit around and the job not get done , I know I, think I, think gregory and a fella randolph does this every tuesday morning or something like that, but just want to thank everybody in the community for coming together.
So just want to thank the community members Also for speaking up about that, because as much as we've spoken, it was like we were leaving it up to the police, the kind of police themselves and they weren't doing the job Once the mayor's office got involved and it became this big thing bigger than harlem because it was on new york, one news, everyone reacted and the good news is now that the NYPD vehicles are no longer blocking the bus stops.
Oh, they seem it's an open drug market, a lot of drug use , it's a lot going on linux, boulevard and 125th street, so something that we gonna have to look into with our public safety committee as well and then have that meeting with them, as well as We get the information on the status of post office boxes in our area?
We had the chairs of cec-3 and cec-5, who gave us some insight on what's going on with parents and their concerns in our community Our own marquis harrison who our first vice chair gave us some really good information, because he is, he teaches in our schools here in harlem, as well as being an active member of the united federation of teachers, union and so out of that meeting came that we would lend our voices to the voices that are out there already around letters to the mayor and the governor regarding the status or lack thereof of preparedness for our students to go back to school and I, put together a draft of a letter to him and, Thank you so much for sending me the two letters from our borough president, which I think will be very helpful in us finishing our letter.
I just put the link in the chat so that if anyone wants to register to hear the latest on what's going on in school openings with you know, outdoor learning and all of that, you can find that on that meeting tomorrow, night Secondly around the back to school event at the end of the board year , I did work with shatik metro, because there was a lot of discussion around there, not being as much money This four years there were was last slash, I wish to take so that we ordered book bags and enough materials for 200 to give to 200 students So. We are in the middle of planning an event so that we will give these 200 book bags out.
I certainly want to make sure that this is on the agenda for the housing committee in september, and we will continue to address whatever concerns or issues that this particular hdfc may have and certainly would be prepared to fulfill a commitment I made in that meeting with the task force and that is to assist in outreach to you know, elected officials, and you know, because I know that this is a tight agenda for today.
You know people like vern ballard First I just want to thank you and thank all the members of the executive committee for giving us an opportunity to really share the challenge that we are we're facing and putting us on your agenda That's not just about lennox court hdfc.
You know we'll Look at that question, but certainly welcome the opportunity for us to address that in our housing committee meeting in september to clarify what karen is talking about.
As joshua said regarding our september meeting, just a point of clarification: the folks in the class they will not be their rent Will, their rent will be not going down because that has already happened a couple years ago for that for that class So, some people are getting like twenty five hundred dollars.
I, don't know if you've read the article where the mayor has said that that the that the europe applications will be directed at communities that are greatly affected by Covid-19 and so I'm, anticipating a lot of rapid development beyond, what's already going on in the district as a justification for creating jobs and other things of that nature, so community planning and thinking about how to find enforceable community benefits will be very important in this sort of coast and I need to reconnect with city college to help us with thinking about the type of community planning that you and I discussed and I.
Our first meeting is next month, not next month next week september next wednesday If you wanted to give people a chance- Can, you circulate this to the board now or on the entire board tonight, or either first thing tomorrow morning You know: has this letter and they're able to either even develop questions in advance?
Did, you want to wrap this conversation up right, now?, probably since it's national, they travel around the country and do studies, but I just feel that in this environment and in our community I'm always concerned like as people are coming, what is what are they going to report?
You have the report right aaron that karen talking but like the for the report to the can send the chairs The only thing is the report is You can't do a data search because we've done this in the past years in the past and then I always get the district needs It's still like a few of a lot of people, but I think there was an email about committee assignments that went out Thank you for all for checking that and making sure that you're on at least two committees, and when you look at the september calendar, that's where the committee meetings fall so just make sure you can't attend those right now, we'll virtual probably be virtual to the end of the year, not sure when we're coming back to pert to in-person meetings, but just make sure that you can attend those because attendance is really important.
