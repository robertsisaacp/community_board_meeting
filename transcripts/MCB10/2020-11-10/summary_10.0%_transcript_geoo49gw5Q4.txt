I, do not know what you're talking about we'll see we'll see how, if these pain pills hold up, if I, if they do not, I'm going to have to like depend on you.
I meant to reach out to her, but I'm, going to put her on the spot and ask her to talk about that, because I think that I think that those things are important and then we'll see where we go from there.
You, know now and then have sort of like a public forum to chime in which I think is awesome.
Needs statement, because once we get started in about five minutes, I really do want to have like a really good discussion.
I would say: I, quick, read it so, but I'm ready because I, you know, I'm, pretty sure we can assess the needs based on what we see in here from people in the community.
Okay, I know that I'm thinking that Google the Google document that we've been working on every sunday that one that is the current one.
Needs statement that we're putting together, which is a statement that talks about the needs in our community when it comes to education, youth and libraries, and our board member and Committee member Stephanie palmer agreed to spearhead this, and she has been talking to stakeholders in our community to get a sense of what that need, might be, and I'm going to, and we of course sent it out to the committee and asked them to read it so that they could discuss it.
What, you guys might remember, just to give a brief overview is that our chairperson sent out a correspondence at the end of September, announcing that we were engaged in developing district needs and budget priorities for the city.
Among them Ken watson, who was the president of the Community school district, who was very helpful, so our external experts, in addition, citizens Committee for children.
The library submitted their own request in terms of capital expenses, and we will include those as looking at the policy area from youth, education, libraries and child welfare.
Right, here, right, here, okay, so clearly one of the things that the organization at the city who provided the training for those of us who wanted who were involved in this project, said that we really should think about how Covid-19 has impacted our request.
That was one of our requests and we figured out it's about two million dollars to provide a full-time nurse in our 28 schools in our districts.
We've heard lots of comments from parents who do not understand Google Classroom or some of the other platforms that they're using to provide education, and they lack the support to basically get their young people.
One of the things that Deborah and I had heard earlier this year was that if a parents were not able to successfully log in for two days straight that they opened the case at the administration for children's services, and we thought that that's just criminal, you know it's, you know, sort of victimizing the victim and so for the need to have support for parents through the idea of a virtual learning.
Support team is a great idea and would deal with some of the stress associated with having maybe three children under the age of 10, with three different teachers being virtually educated in your living room or dining room.
Yeah staffing for nurses, silicone Harlem, working with an organization like them to deal with our technological challenges and the development of a virtual support, team, a virtual learning support team in each school.
So I think we need to put into the district.
Needs statement that there should be more knowledge or promotion, or you know you know, get the word out to the parents about these programs, because I do not think that they're, widely known and I, think a lot of parents felt like they were on their own during this time and just some of them.
Think, that's also something that we can look at putting into the district needs.
We do not want to forget that those points that you know happened over this time and just make sure that children have their basic needs met, and that includes making sure that they're not enduring trauma within their homes and having someone that can you know, stop in check in on them like there has to be some kind of programs that are available for those kind of needs, as Milan pointed out.
Of course, people like Elizabeth, to be a part of our meetings every month for people who are not, you know who are hearing it for the first time and may have some questions and Elizabeth.
There were very few programs under the child welfare with you, know, ACS or DYCD that really looked at addressing this problem and really felt that this was an opportunity to ask the city to identify 10 million dollars.
Do not I, want to read to you, but clearly the impact when we think about education, that exposure to violence has an impact on their ability to learn.
It's like dealing with all of the issues that become impediments to being able to prepare our kids effectively in terms of education needs.
And I think there maybe were five community districts where the unemployment rate was exceeded, 20 and so for us, when the city begins to talk about cutting Syep, and we saw the efforts we made this past year.
I just want to point out that I did put the information in the chat for a dollar teacher, because I know.
I know that they're doing a lot of things around parents and how they're dealing with Covid-19.
You know if they're going to be dealing with any issues around technology and helping parents better access, better, be better able to access that technology from home.
I think it will be at least an outlet for parents to express if they need help and then for them to maybe follow up and get resources.
I mean I've actually seen that happening in a few schools where you know the parent coordinators have really been trying to help the parents and following up with the DOE central.
You can follow up with, but I do remember that the mayor, after a bid, said that students who have special needs who are not in district schools could then apply for the ipads.
You know the need for support.
And, you know, I think we can ask Jamila.
The total amount that we're asking in our request for district needs.
I mean I, know, there's a schedule for it, but it looks like we're behind schedule for that.
There was an extension to submit the final document and I think that Joshua was going to check with you.
Think you reached out a lot of us reached out, but you know I'm going to defer to the chair.
And I think we do not want to look like it's.
