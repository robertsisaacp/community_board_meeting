Okay we'd like to welcome everyone, good evening, we'll get started, and if we could just go around and introduce ourselves, could you should I call people's names or so do you want to start with the board members.
When I looked down into the park, I looked at the rooftop of the Jackie Robinson Recreation Center and I saw a lot of outgrowth of for me.
It looked like weeds and there was a lot of space, but the weeds were, you know, coming out off top.
So I thought that this space could be utilized, for you know something productive, so I reached out to Tony Hillary who's, the executive director of Harlem, grown.
They could make use of the rooftop space at Jackie, Robinson Recreation Center, I'm, going to share my screen just so you guys can see on picture what the rooftop actually looks like give me.
I know that Karen reached out to the parks, Department yesterday.
I think this is a fantastic idea, as Shatik said, and would be a great way to engage the youth in the community and a lot of our kids do not get exposed to farm and agriculture or activities like around that.
And I'm, not saying it can't work, I'm only going by what I know.
Our main hub is at Colonel Young Miss Aria I could probably connect with LPC to see exactly what is landmark because I know I believe the fences that are surrounding Jackie Robinson Park are Landmark.
You know, speak out of term on that, because I'm really not familiarize with all of the terms of recreation, even though most people would think we are.
Okay, because I know that marcus Garvey Park had a basketball court.
I really do not know, okay, because I'm just thinking in that area, if we could get outside funding, you've got starbucks.
We can draft a letter to send over to to park to find out whether or not this is something that we could work with, so that we could make it accessible for youth as a positive sign that miss Kaufman suggested that it was formerly used as a some sort of green space.
And I know that also department of parks and recreation has initiatives called green roofs where they do sustainability.
I know from just visiting the center that you know, like Sheena, said, there's some work that was needed to be done.
There, but I do not know if it's even sustainable to think about putting something up.
I would think, and we were in the middle of a of the most would love someone like to second, the motion.
Everything is like on standstill with you know, with all this Covid-19 stuff going on, but I believe that was supposed to go.
Yes, Marcus, Wilson, New, Board, member and Parks and recreation committee member, as well as transportation.
And I'm, a member of Community Board parks and recreation and public safety, and I'm happy to be here.
We get emails and calls all the time from residents who are kind of angry that the drugs is no longer in the park, but kind of now spread out in the community to have you advise public safety about that gregory I need to be honest, with you, karen, you know, I was on the bandwagon and at the end of the day.
You know arresting people who will be back out in the street overnight, so I have not been on the public safety bandwagon as much as I have been in on the in the past, because one of the things we've learned is that if you actually interact with the people who are using drugs in the community, that is to say, if you treat them as if they're part of the community, they tend to go somewhere else to do.
If, you actually, you know, say good morning to people or offer them a cup of coffee, or you know just kind of create a little bit of some sort of relationship where it pricks their consciousness, that maybe they should go somewhere else to do what they are doing, but but no I have not really gotten on that.
Some of the hammering away at the thing that we all know about is not always that effective, and, quite frankly, like I, said, the community has managed to respond to the people sitting on their stoops in a way that people really do not sit on the stoops of people who extend them some respect, and maybe that's a lesson that the people at Graham Court need to learn.
You know, there's drugs being sold at 117Th, Street right near the park.
It really has to be addressed and potentially I do not know where the money is going or what is happening, but the mayor's Commission on mental health.
Some of that money needs to be appropriated, not just you know, in mindset or make-believe, but to really get a task force on drugs here in Harlem, with some real people that can kind of try to help the situation, because that situation is impactful to every single committee that we have and the quality of life and the safety as people are getting shot.
Okay, the three drug you know, rehabs or centers on that block.
So, again, I think our area is being used as kind of a dumping ground and people feel because some of these already exist that all of them should be there and then also.
Look like I think that would be a recommendation.
You know: I think that we're getting away from parks and recs.
Okay, I apologize for going long, but I think it does impact parks and rec, because all the drug people are in the park.
We need to know what kind of plants we're going to buy so that we can have some idea of how much money it is we're talking.
They will work with you with you with your organization, along with other stakeholders within the community, to develop you know.
I do not know if they now have different people, but it would that it would be really good if they would partner with us the all of the block.
We wanted to look like park.
So that goes to be the part of the development, because you know when I come to community board, I get real crazy when people say 7Th. Avenue did I say that.
Or I, do not know like I'm just wondering if we can brainstorm here, that'd be great.
That I think the waterfront will be much more and much easier to get people involved in, as opposed to trying to do that in an area.
I think that area is something you might want to look at.
I think it's from P.S 175, where they did a painting on the wall, and I'm going wonder if these kids still come back to this area.
So I think you know we can get some learning opportunities out of this natural resource.
Think if we fix you know, do some things in that park, because I think I had mentioned that there was a big art project that people bid for to do and about 10 different artists through the Harlem bid.
Think as we engage people and we begin to do these projects with different stakeholders at the table, that other ideas will come out of that as well.
We had a presentation from parks in the mayor's office, so I do not know that I do not.
Ideas, I think that the suggestion to look at the fish nurseries and doing some project around developing some kind of ecological study area in Holland River Park, is something that is a suggestion that we can make.
I wanted to know exactly what the ask was to the conservancy.
It was a September borough board meeting from Manhattan, so I think it was the 17th, but I'm not sure, but if people google it, you will see, it.
I know new business people hate new business, but I just wanted to ask Miss Kaufman.
And I know that the Parks Department is going through some renaming of areas to honor black figures.
I think we need to take a look at that.
And I, do not know if it already exists because I'm new, but is there like a list of all the parks that are in coming.
Okay, I, do not know all the parks and malls in our community I can provide the list of parts.
I, know the parks Department sent over like some flowers and plants and the sanitation department sent over some materials as well.
We developed some scope of work that we will bring to them and let them know around.
Do, not know if they're going to have a ceremony because all of the Covid-19 stuff, but they might have a few like they've, been doing.
