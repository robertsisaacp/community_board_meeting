We have special guests that that are going to be doing a presentation, domestic violence, presentation by the Manhattan Da's office, Mr, Mark Monaco and miss paredes.
So, as I mentioned, I work as an assistant district attorney here at the Manhattan office and I wanted.
We wanted to come and speak to you tonight about domestic violence and the relationship with the criminal justice process and there's a few goals for today's presentation, one being to provide you with a basic overview of how domestic violence cases are treated in the criminal justice system.
The point of arrest to the point of disposition, as well as explaining our role here at danny, the district attorney's office, as well as the New York City, Police Department, and the role in these cases between my office and our Witness, Aid, Services, Unit and.
As best I can I apologize, I just checking one email from one of my supervisors, but feel free to interrupt me at any time, and I will answer questions as best I can so just to start the quick note about jurisdiction, so jurisdiction, meaning whether or not we have the ability to prosecute a case here in Manhattan.
There are domestic violence officers assigned to every precinct in New York City, so they can also report it directly to my office to the district.
The city has family justice centers that we work very closely with there's one here at the downtown office at 80, Center street, and so they can also make reports there to the social workers that work there or any of the support staff as well as third party calls.
If it's an emergency to the police, if it's just reporting a crime that had occurred in the past, notifying either the NYPD or our office and then.
If the victim does choose to call 911 as their route of reporting the crime, what will happen is NYPD will send officers to the location.
What goes on that domestic incident report that the NYPD is required to have the reporter fill out any time a domestic violence call is made it's the officer's job at that point, to determine who was the primary aggressor.
It's going to make the paperwork with the officer to come report.
Once in ECAB, the case will be assigned to a prosecutor and then the police officer will be interviewed by the prosecutor and then the prosecutor will reach out to the victim to speak to them.
You, know I'll call and apologize for the late hour, but we do think it's important to reach out right away to let the victim know that there's someone looking into this and that there is someone determining what the appropriate next steps are.
We, send it from the complaint room to the arraignment court for the defendant to be arraigned by the judge, so most charge, DV crimes, the most common charges we see are assaults, criminal contempt, which are violations typically of violations of the order of protection and aggravated harassment, stalking, charges, criminal obstruction of breathing or strangulation.
Everyone is appointed a court appointed attorney, who will then represent the defendant during that arraignment process and possibly through the life of the case, but at the very least for the arraignment, a bail application may be made by a prosecutor if it's a bail eligible charge and then the defense counsel also has the ability at that point, to make an argument for against bail.
Ultimately, it will be the judge that will evaluate that bail determination based on the likelihood of the defendant, to return to court as well as past domestic violence.
There's, always the ability later on, to make change things, whether it's charging, whether or not we need to do it to dismiss a case or make changes to orders of protection.
Protection, which is the judge ordering the defendant to have no contact with the victim at all.
So, based on the facts in the complaint and the information provided by the ADA at the time of the arraignment, we make the requests for the full or limited temporary order of protection.
While the case is pending, they're described as temporary, because they are in fact just that temporary until there's a final disposition and then, depending on the disposition, there will usually be a final order of protection that can last anywhere from six months to many years, and those final orders, just like the temporary ones, can be full stay away as I described or limited, and the limited being that they can have contact with that.
They just essentially can not commit a crime against that person, which is something they're barred from doing anyway, but it's just an additional layer of protection or security that you may describe it as to ensure that the defendant is abiding by that order.
The IDAS who've been trained on domestic violence, cases will then contact the victims in ECAB, as we've discussed they, but afterwards they'll try to meet with the victim in pre-Covid, times.
To just put faces to names and just to speak to that person face to face, even if it is through a computer screen right now, but we think that that's very important, but also because when we bring someone down to the office, we're able to connect them to resources.
Even now, I think there are some people in the office to meet with victims, to connect them to resources, to provide the copy of that order of protection to explain it to talk to them about whether or not bail was said and what that means, or when the defendant was released, to talk about what's happening with the case, but also to get what's called a supporting deposition or a corroborating affidavit signed with, which is the victim swearing to the authenticity or the veracity or the truth of the information they provided to the police.
What I've told the district attorney's office is true and that's the defendant has the right to be released.
And if we do not, the case would be dismissed on a b misdemeanor case is charged by only up to six months in jail, so attempted assault is a classic be misdemeanor after domestic violence cases that time period is only 60, days, so felony cases same thing.
We need to present it to a grand jury within six days for a grand jury to hear testimony and make a decision on whether or not we've presented enough evidence to move forward on felony charges against the defendant and similarly, like misdemeanors.
If, it's a violation which is not a criminal conviction, so that harassment charge that we talked about, which can just be verbal threats or those can be covered with by orders of protection by up to two years and actually can result in jail time of up to 15.
There is a special victims, bureau, which is dedicated to domestic violence, elder abuse, human trafficking, sex crimes, child abuse cases, as well as the witness aid service, unit.
The goal is to enhance the prosecution of cases by assisting the IDAS on their investigation of the case, as well as by providing support to victims to rebuild their lives, and so the Harlem office.
I'll look at the chat, but if anybody wants to unmute themselves to ask any questions, I'm happy to provide some answers.
Things like that, NYPD will still have that document of the report being made, but they'll also have the information that the case was dismissed.
I, think they responded back so and also to let everyone know who's participating in the the meeting today.
I, know mark touched on it, but primarily we like to discuss the safety with our clients, making sure they're doing everything to maintain their safety as well as assisting them with any safety transfers or advocacy that they might need in the community or to get away from the community.
He was sentenced to 31 years to life, for possession of a cro, controlled substance and murder in the second degree of a police officer and he's spent four decades in prison for those acts and during that time, in prison.
Given that he can't he reflects on the seriousness of his crime that he took someone's life and that he took someone's father like a father away from their children, which really haunts him, because he never got to know his own father.
Once if you decide that you do need to or would like to write a letter on his behalf, then we'll share that information with you.
But we know that a lot of that opposition comes from sort of form, letters that have been sent out from from these websites from the police, Benevolent, Association and.
So again, board members asked we'll circulate that email correspondence that was sent to district office and was I was included as well and as well as the other chairs that are on this call.
We have I'm actually not sure, because we have several teams working on like reaching out for letters, but one of the reasons that we reached out to Community Board 10 is that I believe this is in the area.
If you can give any insight on, you know what the precinct is doing in response to package thefts and how constituents might get some action on investigations for police reports.
Well, officers are responding swiftly to police reports being called in.
I know this firsthand from a number of people that have filed police reports, like you said within the last like month, and a half, but one residents in particular has had numerous police reports filed over the last four years, and the 28th precinct has not been responsive to these reports.
I, can't speak 100 intelligently as to how they prioritize petty larcenies, which is most likely what these reports are generated, as but in terms of felonies versus misdemeanors, which is what you know, federal Larceny is those things are less prior I do not want to say less important, but in terms of priority order, you know the detectives contending with you know a spike in violent, crimes.
You know that's within the purview of the district attorney's office, but we make arrests over there.
If any questions from the community or board members, please just like I, said shoot them in a chat or if you want to like I, said, shoot it in a compiled email and what we'll do is we'll make sure that it's sent over to the NCO.
I did not know if you wanted to just make a just a quick response regarding the announcement for the the public advocate letter and support for our CB10 resolution.
I just want to let the board members who are on know that we have general elections coming up, November, 4th.
The flyer that is to be created is still in process, but once we receive that we'll make sure that the district office receives it and can circulate it amongst the community.
We'll also make sure that it gets circulated from the District office and Kevin like I said.
