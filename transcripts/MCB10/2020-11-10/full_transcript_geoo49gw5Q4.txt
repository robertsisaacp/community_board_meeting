Good evening, good evening, hi Shatik, how are you I'm good? Thank you. There you are going to connect us to live on facebook. You see when the upper left hand corner where it says it's preparing. No, you do not see that on the screen. It says: preparing live next to the record button. I do not have anything in the in the upper left hand corner of my screen. It just says, recording right and you do not see where it says, live preparing next, to that, no there's nothing! Next! To that yeah, I'm trying to prepare the live. It's not logging on! If it does not stream live because you're the host huh, you probably see it because you're the host okay yeah for some reason it's not allowing us to connect, but we'll have the recording it's just not going to be stream live to facebook, because this I'll try it again. But it's not going live. That's fine! The way I'm feeling I do not need to be on Facebook anyway, hi Stephanie you're on mute, darling, I said you look lovely to me. I do not know what you're talking about we'll see we'll see how, if these pain pills hold up, if I, if they do not, I'm going to have to like depend on you to kind of sort of like finish it I hear you just say: I waited I, waited until six to take them so that they would last. Let's just hope that everything works out. Let's be quick, let's just hope everything worked out, so you know we'll give everyone. You know like 10 minutes, okay, dear plan to start around 6:40, and then I really want to do a dive into the district needs first and then just sort of talk about I think that we should talk about. You know some resources that are available. I see that on the board of the website, they finally put up some sites for bridges which are some of the sites where, if you need child care, you can contact them and a lot of the quite a few of them in our in our area. So I'm going to put that link in the excellent in the chat and also I think that we should continue to talk about the resources that are available, the public library. You know they do offer free tutoring services and I think that I do not know if crystal was coming on. I meant to reach out to her, but I'm going to put her on the spot and ask her to talk about that, because I think that I think that those things are important and then we'll see where we go from there district needs is important, though I mean you've done some great work on it. Thank you again, and hopefully we can have a great discussion around it. Hopefully, Joshua comes in yeah I like the fact that he's trying to get it done. You know now and then have sort of like a public forum to chime in which I think is awesome. So we can, you know, I want to do a deep dive into the district needs statement, so hopefully people have read it and have and can comment one way or the other. So again we will look to start around 6:40 to give people around 10 minutes to log in and and we'll go from there. Okay, all right, wow, hi, marion, hi, Milan I hope that you guys had an opportunity to go over the district needs statement, because once we get started in about five minutes, I really do want to have like a really good discussion around that. Thank you, hello, I did read it I glanced over it I would say: I, quick, read it so, but I'm ready because I you know, I'm pretty sure we can assess the needs based on what we see in here from people in the community. Well Stephanie's going to do sort of a presentation around it: okay and then, and then you know, because she was so generous enough with her time to put it together and has really spent a lot of time talking to some people in our community about what those needs are, and she can elaborate a bit more on that when she gives a presentation. But she really has put some time into this reaching out to different organizations and talking to people about what that community need actually is so again when we start in about five minutes, she can go deeper into you know what we have and how she came to those things, but she has. She really did put some time. She put some time in talking to a lot of different people. Okay sounds good yeah, it sounds good I. Am I've, read it I'm ready and excited to talk more excellent, hi Tamara hi Deborah? How are you I'm well? Thank you. Marquise is on another call. He said he'll join around seven, but we're going to get started at 6:40. Deborah can shatik put up the district needs statement. Is he able to do that? Hello? What would you say Stephanie, Hi shatik? Are you able to put up the district needs statement? The one from this past year, the Google doc that we're working on? Oh give me one. Second, I'll still pick up sure, I'm going to should think I'm going to start the meeting at six in two minutes at 6:40 and then sort of do a short intro and then let Stephanie do a short intro on district needs and then she'll ask you, after that, if you could put the district needs statement up. So if you, if you could just cue it, that would be really great thanks, stephanie, that's a great idea: yeah, I'm not good at the technology piece but hold up. There's two different things hold up: you're asking for the statement itself or the Google Doc that's been submitted to Josh Google Doc that we've been working on. Okay, not the district needs statement itself. Okay, I know that I'm thinking that Google the Google document that we've been working on every sunday that one that is the current one yeah. But that's not the statement. That's a working document of right! That's our response to request a request budget yeah, exactly all right, unless you think there's something else that we should put up. That I did not think of no I'm going to I'm going to see. If Josh updated, it should be updated and then I'll I'll pull it up. Thank you all right. Okay, we're going to get started in one more minute at exactly 6:40 like one more minute, I want to hold people and people will join when they join. Here. Comes sicily, hi, cicely, hi Deborah. How are you all good we're going to start in one at 6:40. and then we're going to start by doing a deep dive into the district needs statement? Shattuck is going to put it up and Stephanie's going to talk about it and we're going to see where we go from there. Oh, it's 6:40. so good after good evening, everyone, my name, is Deborah Yates, I'm chair of education, youth and libraries. I was just speaking to our chair, Cicely Harris, who is chair of the board. Thank you cicely for joining us. We have several members of our committee that are on the call Stephanie Palmer Milan, Re, Mari Moss and Tamara Martin, as well as Shatika Mitchell, who is our district manager? We're going to start our meeting tonight by talking about the district needs statement that we're putting together, which is a statement that talks about the needs in our community when it comes to education, youth and libraries, and our board member and Committee member Stephanie palmer agreed to spearhead this, and she has been talking to stakeholders in our community to get a sense of what that need, might be, and I'm going to, and we of course sent it out to the committee and asked them to read it so that they could discuss it tonight. Hopefully, Josh will Joshua Clinton will join a little later, but I'm going to turn it over to Stephanie and I want to just thank her again for taking this over and she's been copying me on all the emails and she's been talking to so many different stakeholders in our community to really get a sense of what that need is so that we can put forth a document to the city and hopefully get back some resources for us. So thank you stephanie! It's all yours! Thank you. Deborah I had the way I got involved in this is I had such a great time working with Deborah on our backpack project. That I was so inspired, I volunteered. So thank you again for that opportunity. Deborah it was. It was an incredible project for us. What you guys might remember, just to give a brief overview is that our chairperson sent out a correspondence at the end of September, announcing that we were engaged in developing district needs and budget priorities for the city. Cicely mentioned that it's probably one of the most important activities that we do. We do it annually and, as Deborah mentioned, our budget requests really go to influence the city budget and spending. What we also did was to ask everybody on the board to fill out a survey to get a sense from you guys what you thought. The budget priorities were in addition to the board. We also sent that survey out to advocates to officials elected officials. We also sent it to organizations, many of whom had spoken to us throughout the year to get a sense from them what they thought our community needs were as well and again also shatek and the staff from our district office part of who's, their job is to basically document when folks come into the office. Why they're coming in? What are their needs are what are they their concerns? So all of this information went together to allow us to begin to address district needs again. Our chairperson also announced that we were going to have a task force established and our own, which is really great one of our own committee members. Joshua, was ahead of the task force, so we had sort of a bird's eye view of what was going on in the process, which was kind of nice. In addition to the task force that task force met every Sunday, we have been meeting every Sunday to begin to look at developing the document. The district needs document, which is due at the end of the month. We've had three meetings and one of the meetings. The next meeting will be a public forum to get feedback and to basically share that document with the public before we turn it. In addition to that, I also want to say that there were lots of discussions with in experts, both internal and ex and external Debra identified education experts, among them Ken watson, who was the president of the Community school district, who was very helpful, so our external experts, in addition, citizens Committee for children. We spoke to about what some of the issues were, especially in our district. So those were some of and Clayton banks from silicon Harlem to begin to look at those issues, and those are just the external experts. I also want to say that we had a lot of internal experts who were helpful. Karen Dixon, who is president and CEO of Harlem darling, West side dominant predominant child welfare agency, met with us and gave her time. Mari also met with us to talk about what some of the issues were from her perspective and, as somebody who's been sitting on the board for a while and I, think that that's kind of it in terms of the internal and external experts that we talked with so I think that we were able from those discussions to come up with the context for our priorities. I think what was interesting this year, as opposed to last year, for us as a committee, is that education was one of our pressing priorities in the development of the district needs. You have to identify your pressing priorities and they ask for your top three and for this year, education is one of our top three. In addition to providing support for that request, we also looked at other priorities within education, youth and child welfare. The library submitted and I sent it under separate cover. The library submitted their own request in terms of capital expenses, and we will include those as looking at the policy area from youth, education, libraries and child welfare. So if we put them up, I can go over what they are take, or do you want me to just send it? Ah, thank you. Thank you. So this document represents the whole universe. So it's not just our committee, it's the other committees as well, but we're going to focus on just ours for this evening, because part of the responsibility as the representative to the task force is to bring this information back to our committee and to see to get your input and feedback or other inclusions or things that you agree with or do not agree with. So the first one had to do with. Oh, this is I. Think. Could you that's not where I want to start further back yeah further down you're going to go back to too far I wish it was. It starts with then I'll tell you right here right here, right here: okay, so clearly one of the things that the organization at the city who provided the training for those of us who wanted who were involved in this project, said that we really should think about how Covid-19 has impacted our request. How has it changed? What we're asking for and I really do believe? That's how education became a huge major priority for us. The k, our kids are being the whole idea of virtual learning has become a huge issue in our community, and so that was one of the things that sort of stood out for us. In addition to it says it happens. What does it say here? I think some of our research talks about the numbers of kids who are engaged in virtual learning, and so that raised a few things for us. One of them had to do with nurses. We've heard a lot of conversation about the fact that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected people of color and people in our communities, and as a result of that, we felt that the 28 schools and we know, there's a shortage of nurses, but we thought we could make a very compelling case for our 28 schools in our district, each one of them having a nurse if, in fact, we've been disproportionately affected, if, in fact we are more vulnerable, it makes an awful lot of sense that we have a nurse in every school. So that was one of our requests and we figured out it's about two million dollars to provide a full-time nurse in our 28 schools in our districts. Okay, the other one. Could you? Okay, yeah? One of the things we also thought about was a virtual support team. The development of a virtual support team in every school we've heard lots of comments from parents who do not understand Google Classroom or some of the other platforms that they're using to provide education, and they lack the support to basically get their young people online. And one of the things that Deborah and I had heard earlier this year was that if a parents were not able to successfully log in for two days straight that they opened the case at the administration for children's services, and we thought that that's just criminal, you know it's, you know, sort of victimizing the victim and so for the need to have support for parents through the idea of a virtual learning. Support team is a great idea and would deal with some of the stress associated with having maybe three children under the age of 10, with three different teachers being virtually educated in your living room or dining room. So that was a big one for us. Also. The idea- and this was something that came from Kim Wat Kim Watkins- this real concern about the technology, the technology, the technological challenges in the school building that many of our schools are do not have wideband. They are not able to really support the platforms themselves and that those schools needed to be sort of outfitted. It first of all, evaluated and assessed for the capability to be outfitted and then have them outfitted, and we came up with that's a big. That's a big ask at 22 million dollars, but we feel it goes together with virtual learning and also asking for staffing. If it's not going to happen, you know the disparity will continue to exist, so those were did I get the three yeah staffing for nurses, silicone Harlem, working with an organization like them to deal with our technological challenges and the development of a virtual support team, a virtual learning support team in each school. Any questions about those- that's that is our pressing need, as it relates to education of our three pressing big needs, any thoughts, feedback on that hi stephanie. This is Mari Moss I just wanted to tap in with I think we had also talked about homework, help or homework assistance programs for parents did we cover that I thought. We had discussed that a little bit on that one of those days that we were covering district needs. No I. Do not I'm sorry, honestly. Mari I do not remember as I'd say. That did not happen. I just do not remember, but that is definitely something you want to talk a little bit about it and why it's important, just so I can steal your language to include it. Mari hi, yeah I, think that we had this discussion in one of the previous education, youth and library committee meetings. Before the district needs statements meeting. It's basically that we have a lot of parents. As you pointed out in this district needs statement, we have a lot of parents who are having issues with the technology, a lot of parents who are not able to help their children. As you know, because of clovid19 parents were at home, they were literally trying to work from home while helping their children do their work, and there were a lot of challenges there. So having you know, homework assistance, programs or virtual help. There was usually a help line that you could call like a 1-800 homework helpline. There still is the 1,800 teacher is up and running. Okay, you can that you can use and also in your right, we did discuss it in a prior education meeting. We talked about some of the services that are offered by for free by the Library New York public library. You can and I put the links in in the chats that they have. You can call and you can get a group help and you can also get individual help for your child. The New York public library offers a series of homework help for students and it's absolutely free if you go to their website Nypl.Org. Thank you, awesome, yeah. Thank you, Deborah, that's what I was recalling so I think we need to put into the district needs statement that there should be more knowledge or promotion, or you know you know, get the word out to the parents about these programs, because I do not think that they're, widely known and I, think a lot of parents felt like they were on their own during this time and just some of them probably really felt helpless. We have. We have parents in our community that are english. Second language I mean Esl was a major problem for Ps 175. When I was chair of the school leadership team, then so I can only imagine that it probably grew from that, especially during copic 19. so I think that's also something that we can look at putting into the district needs statement. Elizabeth Graham, thank you, has Mccombs Bridge library has put in on the chat about a program. The New York public library has called brain fuse that connects students to live tutors. That's also on the Nypl.Org website. Thank you Elizabeth and a question elizabeth about that are the tutors offered in multiple languages Elizabeth to Mari's point. Thank you. That is an excellent question. I can actually look that up for you right now. I do not believe they are, but I will double check. That's interesting! Considering our student base. Yes, it's available in English and spanish, okay, there you have it. Thank you for that Elizabeth and thank you for bringing that up mari. Are there any other I mean to Stephanie's point. Does anyone else have any other comments? Yeah? This is Milan, hello, I would just add. I think this is all great and right on point. I would add early childhood to the report, just making sure that our you know, community-based organizations who are leading our early childhood programs are mentioned as a outside of the school, so oftentimes schools will, you know, refer to a district school, a traditional district school, but just want to make sure that our community based organization, mom and pop shops that run our early childhood programs in Harlem are also a part of this report and so Milan just following up. So in what is it? Is it a question of resources, yeah I would say, resources around remote learning for sure, making sure that they're included and the trauma informed care specifically for young children under five those two areas, I think there were a couple of areas shatika, you could just scroll up. I! Think yes, keep going. Thank you for sure for remote learning, resources for staffing and then in the 28 schools that you mentioned I would just say like, and our early childhood programs within Harlem, I'm not sure how many we have, but I do know. We do have quite a few like head start and other mom and pop. You know led early childhood programs serving our children under five, so just including them and that's an adding lichen and our early childhood programs that got it. I think that would be helpful. Got it great idea. Thank you, yeah, no problem, okay and a follow-up for Umari again. Is it a resource? I'm sorry, I've got like a phones going off I apologize. Is it a question of resources that we need to include more resources in the homework, help, assistance, area, resources and knowledge of the programs? I do not think a lot of the parents are aware of what's available to them and I want to follow up on Milan's last point, which was excellent, especially regarding trauma. This is domestic violence awareness month and during Covid-19. One of my greatest concerns were parents who you know were quarantined in a unhealthy home life situation, and that goes the same for the children. I noticed that our superintendent had sent out surveys to families just to check in with them, but also to ensure that children are safe, because a lot of children were going into the school building to be safe and to get meals. So we do not want to forget that those points that you know happened over this time and just make sure that children have their basic needs met, and that includes making sure that they're not enduring trauma within their homes and having someone that can you know, stop in check in on them like there has to be some kind of programs that are available for those kind of needs, as Milan pointed out so I just want to no I think those are I'm sorry, I think those are both excellent points. I keep asking about resources because, as I've been working on this project, what's really key is really about expense or capital budget items and so we're being pushed towards identifying dollars. What has been interesting is when issues like marketing of programs or parents, not knowing enough about programs I call it this overarching policy areas that where's satique knows that we had this conversation. Where is the home for those things, so that we can be effective in making sure they happen? I'm not sure that the home for those is the district needs statement as it exists. Right now got it I hear what you're saying like how what is the best vehicle for parents to be able to get that information? So I do not know what programs outside of you know. Just the schools sharing that information, or just the community board sharing that information, but there has to be other ways and I'm not sure what those ways and means are I would I would love to venture to say that and to ask our chair of our committee that it would be an ongoing agenda item for us to begin to look at where that, where where's the home. For that, because I totally agree with you, a lot of it is just lack of knowledge and no I did not know about brain fuse. It sounds like an incredible program. You know how we begin to get it out there. We actually have mentioned that a couple of times on our meetings and I agree with all what, with what all of you have said, is that it needs to be. We need to have it on our agenda every month and we need to talk about the services that the New York public library offers, because they do offer a lot of programs for free, as well as whatever services that New York Department of Education offers. And so maybe what is what we need to do is that you know every month after our meeting like we should make sure and I'll have to try to put something together that we advertise, maybe just a list of things that the New York public like or maybe we should do it on a continual basis that it goes out in the board e-blast that we advertise or separately because people sometimes people do not read the glass I think that the board office has been doing a really good job on social media. And so, if we can just maybe put together a flyer that talks about the resources that the public library offers and maybe some other organizations, and maybe if it's something that we can just periodically post on our social media, maybe every other week or something like that. So that people and then of course mention it every month at our meetings and put the links in our chats and continue to do that and invite. Of course, people like Elizabeth to be a part of our meetings every month for people who are not, you know who are hearing it for the first time and may have some questions and Elizabeth. Would you mind elaborating on that program for us so that just so that we know exactly what it entails? Yes, okay! Sorry about that, I'm having some technical! Do I'm sorry, I'm having technical difficulties at the moment, but yes, so when it comes to brain fuse, brain fuse is a free online tutoring platform. Students can get free homework, help one-on-one daily from 2 to 11 pm it's available in both english and spanish, and they offer help from a range from early elementary to high school through core subject areas: they cover math science reading and writing social studies, foreign language, spanish English as a second language, writing and essay feedback and assistance and academic skills building. They also do have a test. Prep and career services for older students sounds like a great program, and do you know just and if you do not know it's? Okay, do you know if that's a program, that's really utilized in our community, I mean I. Do not know. If that's something you would know, I'm afraid I do not know the stats of how many people use it. So I'm afraid I can't answer. No, that's, okay! It's kind of putting you on the spot, but it does sound like a great program. It is absolutely free and it is something that we should continually mention so that our community is aware that they can access that. Thank you, Stephanie yeah question. Just a question about the lot. How we use the libraries I know that I've taken classes in the library in my neighborhood on technology. Is it possible to explore whether or not parents could get assistance from the public library, as it looks at dealing with things like Google Class or how you know log in or how you begin to structure a schedule for your children who are on who are being virtually engaged in virtual learning? That is a good question. The library previously before the pandemic had a variety of adult education classes. Since everything has been moved online, they have I'm not sure if they have anything focused precisely on that they have classes on personal finance, online financial resources. They have resources for small businesses, but let me see what sort of technology classes we may have online. We do have virtual ones, but they are more about programming file management, basics. It's not really anything that of the nature that we're discussing. Thank you, I would love to know it. You know just I think it's a possibility to begin to explore because I can I if they were offered. I can only imagine that they would be over subscribed by parents who are pulling their hair out right about now in terms of how do they do this in a way that does not make them crazy or their kids crazy? No, okay! We can. We can go on shatik in terms of moving okay, great. So under you back down yeah down further, I'm sorry right there, great so under youth education and child welfare. This first one, the need, is innovative programming to address the trauma experienced by children and youth in our community due to exposure to violence. I've been carrying around this stat with me for years that talked about children in Harlem being four times more likely to be involved in or witnessing a violent incident compared to children in other parts of the city and research by citizens Committee for children beared it out that, in fact, that is the reality and, in speaking with Karen Dixon, you know we both sort of figured out. There were very few programs under the child welfare with you know, ACS or DYCD that really looked at addressing this problem and really felt that this was an opportunity to ask the city to identify 10 million dollars to begin to look at innovative programs that deal with this issue in our community and again I. Do not I want to read to you, but clearly the impact when we think about education, that exposure to violence has an impact on their ability to learn. So for us, it's like dealing with all of the issues that become impediments to being able to prepare our kids effectively in terms of education needs, so that was one of the ones that we had moving further down. We talked about Workforce, Development and Syep. We really sort of tried to look at the data in Harlem as it related to how we are faring based on other communities in the city and youth. Employment was a huge one. We were one of a few and I think there maybe were five community districts where the unemployment rate was exceeded, 20 and so for us when the city begins to talk about cutting Syep, and we saw the efforts we made this past year Deborah in terms of looking at how we support and efforts to support that program. This stood out for us. If you cut us, you know across the board, if you're cutting Syep across the board in the city, it has a more serious impact on us, given the levels of unemployment in our community. So this was a huge one for us. I think go down, I think I missed. Ah, thank you and one of the things that was very interesting that came from the community. Was this idea about a lack of after-school programming and I sort of tried to do research to see you know where that was the city has, you know, invested a lot of money in beacon programs and cornerstone programs and moving after school programs into school buildings. So I was not really quite sure where this was coming from and talking to Karen Dixon. We discovered that maybe one of the areas they're talking about is after school program as it relates to middle-aged kids 10 to 13, who sort of age out of traditional after-school programs. They think they're too old to go to traditional after-school programs, but there are not sort of programs designed to sort of capture their interests, but also the fact that 13 year olds are no longer a captive audience, so you know getting them to come to a program five days a week is probably not going to happen unless you can basically figure out innovative ideas to capture their attention. So again we asked our request is to allocate dollars 6.5 million. To look at innovative, after-school programs for that age group 10 to 13. and then I think this la I'm just not knowing that this is the last one, but we were meeting on Sunday and one of the things that the task force was meeting on Sunday one of the most interesting things that came out of it was this whole idea of arts education. We were trying to identify pressing needs for the arts community and one of the things that we thought about was how do we combine those goals? Then arts and culture with educational goals in our in our committee and one of the things we thought about was this visiting artist program that there are so many artists in Harlem who are not working and that we begin to look at the impact of arts education on our kids in education? In fact that you know it's cut, it's probably been cut more than ever it's going to be cut more than ever this year, and how do we begin to address that so thinking even of a virtual artist support program, virtual program? That would at some point when we're back to normal, whatever normal looks like having artists actually in the schools at our 28 schools visiting and teaching supporting teachers and conducting art programs. So we ask for three million dollars. We know it's probably sort of a special program, a special allocation, but we think it's a great place. It would benefit artists and also benefit our kids and then I think the last one was something: I came out of the task force as well working with looking at seniors and what our goals are there in terms of working with seniors and how they could relate to education, and one of the things that we thought made an awful lot of sense and also preparing young people to work is having them assist. Seniors in dealing with technology that Deborah gilliard had said. Many of our seniors in our community are isolated, the senior citizen, the seniors, seen the senior centers are closed, and so that social, media and technology has become really important for them and able to connect to the community. But they do not know how to use it, and we found that many kids find that many seniors, including myself, learn about technology from their grandchildren and their children, and so we thought about a formalized program that would have maybe high school seniors working with seniors to basically build a capacity in terms of knowledge of technology and again a small program. So we asked for two million from to be allocated to look at innovative programs and I. Think that that's it deborah those were ideas. I definitely will include and work with the ideas that came from Mari and Milan in terms of including early childhood, and also more resources for homework support as we do revisions. Thank you. Any other comments. I see that we now have marquis and jamila on the call from our committee. Did you guys have an opportunity, and tomorrow we have not heard from you: did you guys have an opportunity to go over the the district needs statement? And if you have do you have any comments, marquise jamila Tamara? They do not speak it once I reviewed it and I was here for a good chunk of the conversation. Okay at this point, I did not really have any recommendations yeah if anything I would send I'll send I. I'm I thought about a lot of things, but I did not really have any recommendations to change. I think what the board was advocating for, or at least was best for at this moment. Marquis. If you have any follow-up ideas, please send them to me right away and I'll make sure we incorporate them. Gotcha, okay and Jemela has put in the chat. She has no comment and tamara. What about you? No comments at this time, if I think of anything else that should be added, let's definitely know immediately I. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay, thanks Stephanie, of course, we know this is a working document and we'll see how we move forward with that. I just want to point out that I did put the information in the chat for a dollar teacher, because I know that was something that you guys were asking about before. Also, there are some town halls that are coming up with the chancellor Cec-5, which is in our area, is having one on October 26th. Also, there are some comcast and spectrum you know are offering free internet service for 60 days and that you can reach out to them to see if you qualify for that. Also, the U of T is having a citywide parent and family virtual conference that is coming up on November 7th that you might want to register for to see. I know that they're doing a lot of things around parents and how they're dealing with Covid-19 and so I do not know marquis. Do you know if they're going to be dealing with any issues around technology and helping parents better access, better, be better able to access that technology from home? And do you know if that conference will deal with that at all or, and secondly, do if they're not do you know of any programs for the uft or the border that may be dealing with that so I? My understanding is the parent engagement person for Manhattan is going to have some discussion about technology. I think it will be at least an outlet for parents to express if they need help and then for them to maybe follow up and get resources. There may be there's supposed to be someone there I think from the DOE. Who will talk about like what you can do if you have problems so on and so forth, so at best there will be some resources. I can't say how thorough it will be, but I know that there they will have. There will be somebody at some point there to answer questions about technology and problems with that I see jamella put in the the chat she had a question about the ipads and I know before that. They were saying that if you had a question you could call 311. Is that still the is that still the case marquis yeah? You can call 3-1 or you can directly rep contact this child's school if they have a problem with ipads. You were saying one was requested and not received yeah, so you could directly honestly, you should be directly calling even to not call 311 actually I would encourage you to call you can call 311, but you're actually encouraged to call contact the school. Who does not have any information they're saying we need to reach out to the dlc I'm just reading what Jamil is putting on okay, I'm sorry, she's, saying they've reached out to the school and the school is saying they do not have any information and that, apparently, in that case you can call 311. But what really should be happening is that there are liaisons within each school building so that when someone does not have the technology or has not gotten received what the DOE was supposed to have sent them, there should be a parent coordinator, somebody calling down to a central number where they could. You know move that process along, but if they are not at the school is saying they have no idea, then I would call 311. So in theory, that's what's supposed to happen in actuality, it does not seem like that's what's actually happening. Yeah I mean I've actually seen that happening in a few schools where you know the parent coordinators have really been trying to help the parents and following up with the DOE central. So if anyone's been complaining, it's been more the parent coordinators that they're not getting back to me, but it should not have been that the parent reached out to the school and they're like we have no clue exactly. Can I just can I just add a caveat. So there are a lot of schools for children with special needs that are like therapeutic nurseries that do three to five year. Olds that have also been included are supposed to be included in this technology disbursement through DOE. What's happening with a lot of these schools and that's I've had I have the issue as a parent and I have had a lot of parents in these similar situations, reach out and they're asking because those schools they're not sending the ipads to those schools. What they're being told is they're going to send them to the child's own school, even though the child does not attend the zone school, so then you reach out to the zone School and the zone school wants to know. Why are you asking me about an ipad for a kid who does not go too much I see, but then you go back to the to the first school and they're, like we literally have no information doing that you have to contact the zone school and so parents I mean you know still without ipads. One of my kids is in that boat as well, but with no one to follow up with and when you register, there's no follow-up number. There's no follow-up number! You just follow-up email, you just submit the registration form online and there's like it goes into the abyss somewhere. There's no one! You can follow up with, but I do remember that the mayor, after a bid, said that students who have special needs who are not in district schools could then apply for the ipads Milan Reed has put something in the chat that she's saying that you could submit a ticket at this particular link. If you could look at that jamila, and maybe that might be something that would be helpful to you yeah so again, I for those situations, those are very special situations. I would I would definitely maybe put the ticket in the ticket will take forever. But I would, if you know to x, maybe put some more do the three one and I also might right. I would do three one, because you want to document. You know you also want to say I've called three one make sure you get some kind of ticket number or something you Wanna make sure, because they're going to Wanna know you know who you called how many times you called you know, then they asked for stuff like that. You say: listen, I, call, 311. and I have not gotten any response, so yeah I agree with yeah, and maybe we came out to the district office of the dish of the so of the zone school. So that's to if it's difficult or district 5, they may be princess. The superintendent's office may be able to. If you explain what the situation is, they may be able to quickly get answers and then call contact that zone school to say, listen, allocate this and put it aside and just kind of make it happen, the district office or the superintendent. Is that the same thing? It's the same thing usually the same thing yeah so district 3 or district 5? Usually, if it's our area contact their super contact, the superintendent's office and jamila, if you can send me on the information with the specifics, I'll get in touch with them as well. Okay, thank you, Chatzi. Thank you. Deborah can I ask Milana, follow a question. She had put a link in for the technical support for families right you talk about what that is, and what do you know if the experience of parents have been with that I do not know what the that has been, but this is a link. That's on the nycdoe website, yeah I just clicked on it and it asks you. What are your issues so at least it's a good place to start right. It's another place to you know add in you know the need for support. It would be a great idea if just to test it out to see like what happens, and maybe that information might help inform us in terms of what the needs are well. I think that what we should- and you know I think we can ask Jamila. You know, since you have a real issue, if you will, you know if you're going to use the link that Milan put in please let us know what your experience is with that how it goes through if there's a response and I think all of that you know, once you do, you did you did that already. I did so what happened so main topic I put in status of ipad requests right, because that's what I want you did it just now or you did it before just now, uh-huh and then, when it says, issue details I put in I submitted a request. This is the drop-down. You have to pick from their pre-selected categories, so I selected the I submitted a request for an ipad, but I have not heard from the DOE. How can I find out the status of my request, and it gives me a an answer where it says when you submitted your request, you should have received a confirmation, email or text. When your ipad is ready for delivery, you will receive a call from Nct data to confirm shipping address and schedule. The delivery can take up to three days to be completed and that's it. I can't submit anything so and we know that information is outdated because they're not sending them to families anymore. That was changed once like over a couple of thousand of them got stolen. So this is not even up to date in terms of what the process is and but yeah it does not. Let me it's just like a it's not for submission. I guess it's like, so those are just stocked answers that they have and there's no one that you really can talk to. It's like I said just send me yeah, send me the request and I'll handle it for you. Thank you and also call 311 just to get it on record. I will. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Milan. Thank you. Stephanie again, you know, I put those things in the chat. Does anyone else have anything I mean I wanted to spend the majority of time on the district needs statement, and then talking about some resources that are in the community, and we have done that. Do we have any other comments or additions from anyone else on the call Deborah Amari had a question in the name. Sorry, I'm sorry sure it was about the total. The total cost. I think it. What is the total request? Expenditure right, the total amount that we're asking in our request for district needs. For the district needs statement, how much are we requesting because I heard 3.5 million and I just wanted to know what the total amount yeah for us I do not know. I do not have the I do not have the total for the total statement that includes all of the policy areas, but for our policy area it comes to 52 million and got it okay, yeah, and if anybody has any ideas, what I did the 22 is our big ticket item and that's the sort of working with evaluating and assessing the schools for their ability to connect. The nurses was easy because you could sort of look at what nurses get a year in New York City, so that was an easy one for us. That's a pretty accurate one. The programming I used to I looked at dycd's orps and the amount of dollars that they sort of issued for competition in terms of programs and that's where I got those numbers. But if anybody has any information, more specific information for dollar amounts. I'd love to hear your comments or feedback. And again, you know there is going to be sort of a public forum. Once you know we incorporate you the inputs from this committee. There is going to be a public forum to discuss all the areas, not just education, so that the community will have an opportunity to give their input and so between. When is that supposed to happen? Stephanie do you know? Is it next week it's supposed to be a next week's meeting, I think it's the lat, the 20. This is the 20th I. Think it's not this Sunday, but the following Sunday I could be wrong. I had a question about that stephanie, because the district needs statement is due on the 31st. So I'm not sure when you guys were supposed to have a public forum. I mean I, know, there's a schedule for it, but it looks like we're behind schedule for that forum, so yeah, no you're, absolutely right and I spoke to to Joshua about it, he's pretty committed to getting it done before. We turn it in that final document and I think he I think somebody asked about extensions on the task force on Sunday's meeting. If there was an extension to submit the final document and I think that Joshua was going to check with you Shatik to see, if there's any precedent for that happening in the past, it's not required. It's not a requirement in terms of the steps that we were informed about in training, but again, I. Think Josh feels that you know. If we're going to have any credibility, you know you want to get it out before the final document is there, because if not, you know, why are you sharing it with me? That's his point of view. You know why are you sharing what it's so the idea that he thinks the public should have a chance to comment before we turn in the final document, because if you do it after we've turned in the final document, you know he feels that people may feel well. Why are you asking now at this point it's already in I, get that I'm just saying from the schedule that we originally had it's that's. Why right I did not you know, listen I did not agree. I think that we've done a really good job and getting public feedback and comment. You know what I'm saying I think we did. The survey I think you reached out a lot of us reached out, but you know I'm going to defer to the chair. You know no yeah, you mean Chair Joshua, Chair, Joshua yeah. Do you know what I mean I mean I understand Shitty's point I mean this saturday is the 24th. The following Saturday is the 31st, and so it would and do not. You have to put it into some kind of thing yeah after actually submitted. The agency is going past. My head right now, Department of City planner, submit it to department of city planning, but once they give you the document that they put together, can you just cut and paste what they give you or do you have to put it in a specific kind of format? Yes, in a specific format, so you need at least a day or two yeah. Just as just a day, you know all night. All I need is a day all right. Everything needs to be done by next Thursday next week. Right last year, I was having a little difficulty, I'm with it so I actually went down to the Dcp's office and I submitted it physically down. I went downtown. We can't do that this year. So if you give me two days, if I have issues on the first day at least I can get support help from DCP. So that means that everything needs to be complete no later than Wednesday next week. Yeah, but I do not think that's I do not think that's going to happen because people are saying we should do a forum. So what's the response to whether or not we can get an extension and if we ask for an extension, how does that affect what it is? We're asking for I will I'll definitely provide this feedback to Joshua I. Think the other, in addition to shatik being able to put it into the template is editing. We need at least two days for editing because you've had several. You know it's been lots of voices contributing to the document and I think we do not want to look like it's. You know five different voices. How do we look like it's one sort of consolidated document, so I'll? Let Josh know that we're concerned about the time frame and what happened with his inquiries about an extension, deborah I'll. Let you know I'll follow up okay, so we will wait and see what the outcome of that is. Is there anything else? Anyone else have any comments or have anything to add that is on this call. At this time I see we have jackaroonel on the call. Do you have anything that you need to add hi good evening? Everyone? Thank you. Deborah I was putting my notes. The only thing that I really wanted to announce is that, in honor of domestic violence awareness month, our office is having presentations throughout the community, we're having a presentation with Senator Al, Taylor Assemblyman Altera's office, we're also having one with the public Safety Committee tomorrow evening and I definitely wanted to share that opportunity with the education community we've you know with these presentations. There's really. No limit on how we can cultivate them, so we've done things like work with domestic violence, presentations and elder abuse or paired that up with teen dating violence. So you know I'll share my information in the chat box. If anyone would be interested in having that presentation either for the community or a school or another youth-based organization out in the community, I can connect folks with our education team who works on things like finding a assistant attorney to talk about the process and also a counselor from our wasu unit to talk about the types of victim services that our office provides. Could you send that information into the board office to Shatek and then he can disseminate it too? Yes, I can share flyer with Shitty. Thank you thanks a lot. Thank you. Jeff I appreciate that anybody else have any announcements or comments on anything this evening. All minds are clear. If so, then I'm going to say again thank you Stephanie for the great work that you've done on this district me statement. I, really appreciate it and we're going to call it a night good night. Everyone. Thank you. So much for tuning in and we'll see you all thanks again shatik as well, for all your help good night, good night Deborah. Thank you! Well done! Good night good night, everybody.
