Everyone, welcome to community board tens arts and culture committee meeting this evening.
But I'd like to first start by having our CB10 members and arts and culture committee members go around and introduce themselves briefly, and then we can have our guests introduce themselves as well.
I'm trying to get this debate, but I'm Derek Perkinson, a community board member I sit on two committees: talks and safety and health and land.
Can you introduce yourself hi, everyone, Shadon, Smith, Community, Board, 10 member and also I'm a newly appointed member to the arts and cultural committee.
So we do want to be conscious, folks, time, but our one agenda item for discussion is the the arts and culture museum resource calendar that our board member Tiffany Reeves has been working on.
It actually came as a result of one of our previous committee meetings and recognizing in these challenging times with cover 19 and the pandemic, that a lot of our arts institutions are really having to adapt, whether it's that changing their working hours and social distancing to really moving into a more virtual space in order to share their exhibits and their work.
The arts and culture committee would like to do and is working on really gathering and information on a lot of our museums in the area and obviously in the Manhattan and upper Manhattan area, so that we can share that information via our website and use it use it as a tool and a guide, for you know just members of the community so that they can still find creative ways to enjoy art.
But I want to share it with the committee and with the community members just to kind of understand where we are with it.
You are feel comfortable, going out right now and doing something in a socially distant manner or if you do not, and you want to stay home, we want to still offer the arts and cultures in this.
I'm sorry, our community members to see or flag any museums that they think we should add that we may not have on this sheet excellent.
I just wanted to make sure like if we're just going to focus on museums and not to offer other places.
I think the apollo is great, so you know I would suggest we add it.
The list to other arts related or cultural centers, beyond museums, and so you just I, just want to open the floor for discussion.
You have any additional recommendations for museums or other cultural places that we can add to this calendar folks that you think it would be worthwhile to you know, elevate and raise up for our community.
I think it should just expand to the needs of the community, and if you know other resources from other institutions are or are wanted, we should definitely add them to the list.
And I also think too, it can just be an ever evolving list like we could put it out and then say you know, we'll update it in real time and be able to just push that resource out to the community as we get updates so tiffany.
We've discussed the holiday lights activity or event this year in any great detail, but I do not know if you are on you're able to speak.
So, an idea I was having I had, was that maybe we can upload pictures from last year and that the individual folks of the arts and culture committee you all can do like one or thirty second videos.
This year, there'll be little spots throughout Harlem, where we could place community board members and we can kind of like broedcast a live from that area, and we just have to work that out with how we would dial into zoom.
There may not be any, but I do not know if there's any CB10 swag or anything that we might be able to share out at any of the places where we'll have board members that are not on the float, just a thought or idea as we're trying to spread the word about the community.
If the community board is aware of these open culture bills that are before the New, York City Council and if that's been discussed in any way and if there's been any thoughts shared about those bills.
And we obviously, as arts and culture committee, do not want to miss anything.
