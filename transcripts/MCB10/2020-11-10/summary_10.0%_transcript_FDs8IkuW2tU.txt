I'm the chair of the housing committee, Manhattan, Community, board, 10 and just want to welcome each of you.
As, our you know, housing Committee, continues to progress and identify issues that we should be very proactive, about, or at least aware of and taking some interest in or taking some action on behalf of.
I thought it was a good idea to have some of our representatives of elected officials to join the call for some brief comments to offer guidance later on in the meeting you're going to hear from Delsenia Glover as to the work that you know, community, Board 10 is doing on district needs, which will help.
You know also give our elected officials some feedback from us on things that we've been addressing, especially on housing and also on land use and economic.
So without further ado, I believe you know satique and by the way presentations as you can see, we're going to have.
We already talked about the district needs statement, we're very happy that we're going to be talking about the you know, the espionage, gardens.
Okay, so I'm going to call upon I, see Shauna harmongoff from the you know, Office of State Senator, Brian, Benjamin and happy that you've joined us for some remarks.
And I know we're going to hear from Mina White from Assemblyman Al Taylor's office, whether or not between now and next.
That folks have said they've yet to hear so I'd like to hear you know from anyone else as this as this meeting progresses as to whether there are any other comments.
Know, get your help in identifying some data and some statistics as to just how beneficial that program has been in providing much needed, rent relief.
Because of you know that fear, and just like what do you mean it's going to happen in 30 days or less than 30 days.
Let me just have you pause for a moment, because I just want to make sure that everyone on the call knows we do have that as an agenda item.
You know, requested increases in the maximum rents that could be charged within the development.
The concern was whether or not there would be any increases in portions of the rent that section eight residents will have to pay.
Know, increases in the maximum rents for the units there at 95, linux.
This is responsive to make improvements to apartments, specifically kitchens and bathrooms and, as I said, to Charles Robert Horsford Apex, a local company of a fellow I know for many years is going to do the work.
Hud is taking a while to approve to review and approve once the contract is approved, we will begin the process of beginning and what do I mean by that folks are going to continue to live in their apartments.
The that is this as I say, the rent out of their pocket will not change, but the building will collect more from the government, and the purpose of those collections is to fulfill that you did a physical needs assessment in all of the units and is that to fulfill the upgrades to kitchens and bathrooms that I believe the tenants are very desirous of yes, absolutely 100, okay.
Let's go just to the third point, then I'm, going to open it up to committee members and board members and community with any further questions.
You know, when folks are not getting lease renewals and they see a letter from HUD to say that you're looking to you, know, get overall increases and the maximum rents to be charged.
I mean everybody understands that this is not something where you know our housing committee or our district office is being asked for a position but certainly being asked for our assistance.
Let me just see if any of our committee members first or board members in that community have any questions or concerns they'd like to express at this time, so we're good Miss, house.
If per say, the person gets off of section 8, there's no way that these people are going to be able to afford that amount of rent, so I need to know those rental.
Though you know you have assured them that their rents will not be increased, but I'm thinking about the community and our people getting into those apartments at those prices which seems to me to be exorbitant.
I understand what you're saying I guess another way of talking about it may be the word gentrification, which I do not think applies, but to improve the building which we want to do.
No one is saying it does not need rent increases to improve the building, we're just talking about the amounts.
Maybe, that information would be helpful, but I do understand what you're saying this is not you know any sort of you know of pass along if I understand correctly, for whatever the level of improvements it's not going to change.
You know I'm not saying that you're going to do that, but four thousand dollars for a two bedroom apartment, whether it's renovated or not, is even above market value.
Trying to you, know renovate, but I think that there should be like breakdowns and ceilings, because in many instances you know whatever is being done to improve is a bit inflated, not a bit, but in some instances a lot inflated and the courts are filled with that.
So I think that's something to look at, but in this environment in Harlem, making any apartments that are renovated, where people actually have been living and have been in a community for many years, four thousand dollars, I think it's outrageous.
So I just want folks to know the distinction between a project based section, a which is 95 Lenox Avenue, which means Karen that apartment will still stay section, a regulated.
That's, the distinction between what happens, sometimes in other rent, stabilized scenarios, where you will have tenants who will bring their section eight eligibility into the you know to the particular you know project, but not necessarily have that unit.
You know section eight projects, okay, hello, I've heard that I say can I just say one more thing: I just this is Donna gill.
So, that's my concern with when the time is up what happens to these four thousand dollar apartments or these people that are on section, eight.
We need to do is just stay vigilant and make sure that when we have Lisa may not be there, but let's just you know, say, none of us will probably be on a community.
We can talk to our elected officials about conversations with you, know, HPD, in the city of New York and in their negotiations with the federal government.
I just want to know is the building completely filled like 100 filled as of right now, or are there units that are available.
Now we do, but I do not know the number right now, but we also, but that still goes back to there's a lot of tenants in here that the leases are not signed.
The exact number I do not know the answer, but it's within our interest, as you can imagine, to keep the building rented all right.
Everybody we're going to move the agenda as I know.
So I know that there are representatives of espionage, gardens and we'll hear from you, but shati can you put up the other fact sheet, which I did not want to go to meena white, because I think that mina.
If I can't afford this maintenance increase, and it then refers to scree, which we heard Mina referred to in terms of people who have applied for it and then section 8, rental, housing, assistance.
I think the biggest thing is because we were supposed to get the increase last year, but a lot of the issues that we've been seeing.
If that's something that maybe can be done, because a lot of people have lost their jobs and are trying to figure out where money is going to come.
So, this increase right now seems to be a lot of people have issues with these, with the rent increase, going.
Now we do know that the rent increase needs to take place.
Are we're going to go to board members first and then Miss Reddick we'll come to you.
My question: You really touched upon what my question was going to be, which is why do these capital improvements have to come from increases from the co-op shareholders.
The economy is dead for most part, so it's senseless to bring about an increase when the majority of the people who have no jobs, look like most of us in this zoom conference, which means we'll become homeless.
They are the ones who know what the capital improvement costs are, and we can't ask them those questions.
We are going to have increases in health bills, and so all of this is of concern to us, and if we could look at the Aia, the Aia would tell us a lot.
No I think Miss reddick you're, giving us all of the things that we need to address and the fact of the matter.
It is clear that this issue is not going to wait until the November housing committee.
You, know meeting the latter part of November that we need to be in contact with each other, so I'm going to recommend if there's any other board members that want to join.
I know this is not a voting item for housing Committee, but it is not.
You know comment, I, think that's an important point.
Because I know she has a time frame on our agenda just for Delsenia Glover to give the housing committee and board members in the community a quick update on what we're doing with our district needs.
Let me go back to my sheet, so we representatives from over the past several weeks, representatives from several of the community board committees, have been meeting weekly on sundays to prepare our yearly district needs statement and which includes budget budgetary items.
We also did a community survey for what folks in the community and on the board, thinks, are important things for us to be asking for, and we got about 50 responses and we included those recommendations were feasible.
You know we also want to acknowledge Joshua Clinton, who presented at our last meeting and all the work that he's been doing and gathering folks together on Sunday afternoon.
You know the agenda along I put in something about NYCHA, because I believe that this committee has not.
I'd really like for committee members to really think about how we can be a little bit more attentive and intentional about NYCHA.
There are any questions from housing committee members or board members or community.
You know members and again the time permits for you guys that would come back and do a more detailed presentation in our November meeting.
You know for these things, so yes, I'm, going to ask that you give any information about that from shatek and will absolutely help facilitate identifying.
I also want to know what percentage of people that will prior living in this community are currently returning to this community that that's, the question.
You know, put your number in there or even if it's in the private chat thing, because I have someone I need to call you.
