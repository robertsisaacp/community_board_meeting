That I have to be doing. Thank you for making the time. Who else do we have here? Thank you so much marie. How you doing Miss little John, it's good, to hear your voice. Hi Greg thanks Karen Gregory bagging, a for the Randolph Square. Thank you. Everyone I think we covered everyone. We have janae vidal. Who is our captioner is that right is delay our captioner? Yes, hi, I'm danae, I'm the captioner! Oh thank you. Okay, so I think we have covered everyone, so my name is Karen Rory, I'm chair of parks and recreation committee and welcome everyone, and with that we will open the agenda. So our first item is Jackie Robinson, Recreation, Center, Rooftop garden. This is a proposal at this point, and would you like to speak to this at all sure, so this Jackie Robinson Park is actually in the neighborhood. You know that I live and when I was doing, my walks, I was walking along edgecomb and I had looked at, Edgecombe Avenue actually sits on top of the park. So when I looked down into the park, I looked at the rooftop of the Jackie Robinson Recreation Center and I saw a lot of outgrowth of for me. From my vantage point, it looked like weeds and there was a lot of space, but the weeds were, you know, coming out off top, so I thought that this space could be utilized, for you know something productive, so I reached out to Tony Hillary who's, the executive director of Harlem, grown and I pitched on my idea of maybe using the rooftop space for community use, and you know they had what a Harlem grown already does in the community gardens around Harlem I thought. Maybe they could make use of the rooftop space at Jackie, Robinson Recreation Center, I'm going to share my screen just so you guys can see on picture what the rooftop actually looks like give me one. Second, okay, so you guys can see it a little bit. You say: Clear, Carey, okay, so this is just some pictures. I took off my camera phone. This is a little expanded, so you see a lot of like weeds or shrubbery here and there's a lot of space over here as well. I could not get a lot of clear shots because the trees were blocking my vantage point, but I guess you guys can see it here. So when I reached out to him, he said this looks like an amazing space. He said that if he wanted to put to do the type of programming that he went for would want for kids, he noticed that you have to have some type of infrastructure put in as far as gates, because, as you see here, there's no gates I do not. Maybe it would need to be a cage or something like that- I'm not really sure but definitely seems like a idea. He was interested in I know that Karen reached out to the parks Department yesterday and I know it was very short notice. I sent Mr Hillary the link, but he did not I do not think he joined the call he's not on the call he did not confirm, but this is just the idea, I'm just saying what we could do do with it, if it's feasible at all. So that's that was just my thoughts and then I reached out to Karen. You know I asked her what her thoughts was and she thought it was a good idea. So I do not know what's actually going on in the roof. I do not know what plans the recreation center has for the roof at all. It was just something I thought of one day when I was walking, so you know we're just here to discuss the options at this point. I can't hear you karen I think this is a fantastic idea, as Shatik said, and would be a great way to engage the youth in the community and a lot of our kids do not get exposed to farm and agriculture or activities like around that. So yes, I'm very much supportive of this and I think you should look into it and sheena. If you could I think you could share a little bit of with us about what's happening with that situation. Oh yes, so I, just text Ken and he's at a family function. So that's why he could not make it. You know to the meeting what he did tell me. What he said was that the roof is already being utilized. Let me let me read what he said first and then he said that there's already a green roof there and I believe that that's that was done some time ago, when back when I was a supervisor there they were, you know, fixing the roof. So I'm not quite sure what they're doing on here now, because it's under you know that building is under recreation and that's primarily, you know, you know, belongs to them. So I do not want to speak out a term and say what's going on or what's not going on and what could what could happen or what could not happen? So he just told me that it's already a green roof there, that's all he said. Maybe I can send him an email regarding the area, and maybe he can give you some. You know some more information about how the green roof is being run and who would that email go to it would go to it would go to. Can it would go to Ken, conyers and Ken Mcneal and Kid Mcneil right, and they will be able to give you some. You know a better understanding of. What's going on up there than I would but I remember it when they started it out. Our agency had built that green roof up there and I do not know what happened after that, because I left Sheena do you know approximately how many years ago that was that was some time ago that was a while ago. That was because I have not been there. I, I'm going to say maybe six years. Okay, I'm going to say maybe six years it could be longer, it could have been longer, but I'm not quite sure, but it's like a couple of other entities about that as well because of the and I'm not saying it can't work, I'm only going by what I know when I last was there that the building was given what you call that brain freeze down landmark status, and it was because we could not even change a door there without you have to go through a whole. Lot of you know red tape, just to fix the door, so I know it became landmarks. That's why I was there before I left. They they did that with the center, and there were some other things that they wanted to get done, that they had to wait on. So I'm not quite sure if anything else was added because then I left, but can conyers and Ken Mcneil can give you much more Bobby Marcel Kim Mcneal, because Kim Mcneil has been here. The longest she's been the chief the longest in this barrel for recreation, so we need to. We would need to address a letter, and, and so what do you think funds would be available? The parts would be interested in doing something like this, or could we bring in outside organizations to help with funding? If we had the okay to do the rooftop I do not know what the policy of recreation they have a lot of different policies on, you know even entering in a building. You have to be a member and they have a lot of federal. You know regulations that they have going on there, so I'm not quite sure so. I, do not want to speak really out of trouble because I really am not familiarized with their with all of their policies. With that I noticed when I was there, the roof was horrible. The roof was like not in great shape. You know there were leaks all over the place all over the building. You know and I do not know if that was a reason why they stopped Sheena. Yes, did you say that the building did you did I hear you say that the building had landmark status? Yes, it does before I left here many years ago. They made it a landmark stats. Yes, which was crazy. You know, because we were trying to get things fixed and we could not even fix the door they when they broke into on the side door. It was very difficult trying to get to get it so Gina with the facade work that was done. That would not have included the roof or there was no way I. Cuz I saw some recent facade work. That was done. That probably was in the making already prior to that, I'm not quite sure. I really do not know, you know, because I have not been, you know involved with the center they. You know we used to be in the center and then they moved our office out of the center. That's why we're at Colonel Young, so we do not have we have very little to do with the center. Usually that was our home base direct center. You we used to work out of there, but we only have like two to three people working out of the wrecks: they're, not even working at the Rec center they're on the side door. So I do not. We really do not go in there. Our main hub is at Colonel Young Miss Aria I could probably connect with LPC to see exactly what is landmark because I know I believe the fences that are surrounding Jackie Robinson Park are Landmark. The ones are on 145Th Street, the big ones. Okay, those big columns, yeah painted red, so sheena I just wanted to ask: are there any other parts that have used outside funds to to work with their part? You know with the parks to do well, yeah and for me on a maintenance operation part we we have I can't speak on what recreation does I do not even know how their funding and expenses are done. I did not even know you know. It was like crazy. When I found out that you know some of these centers. You know you got ta, you need all these background checks and things in order to enter them. So it was strange that you have to do that. So I'm not quite sure so. I do not want to mean. You know, speak out of term on that, because I'm really not familiarize with all of the terms of recreation, even though most people would think we are. But you know when you work in maintenance a lot. You know we only go there to help recreation on things that they access to. We do not really get involved with their day-to-day operation or how they run. Okay, because I know that marcus Garvey Park had a basketball court done. There was some a painting, that's a mural, that's on the floor yeah, but that's and I think that was Yahoo. It was it was some big corporation Yahoo or somebody yeah. Those are do not that's different. When it comes down to these buildings and they're. You know these recreation buildings, they have all sorts of. You know rules and what can be done and what can't be done, how they're operating so I really do not know outside of that clockwise I can give you more information when it comes down to the park, but they're buildings. I do not know. I really do not know, okay, because I'm just thinking in that area, if we could get outside funding, you've got starbucks. You've got bank of America in that area of dollar tree. You see the I think the CBS pharmacy, the New York Sports, Authority popeye and chicken. It's a great picture, just pitch it. You know pitch it to them and see what you know. What may could come out of it. You know I do not see it does not hurt to try, because I really do not really know, but I know when I was there, they did have that roof up there I remember that and then I was gone. Then I left the area and I have not. Once we got kicked once we were released from the building, I rarely go in the building. Unless I have you know to go to the bathroom or you know, you know speak to the use the computer for a minute or two, so I'm really in that building at all. Okay, so it looks like we have a plan here. We can draft a letter to send over to to park to find out whether or not this is something that we could work with, so that we could make it accessible for youth as a positive sign that miss Kaufman suggested that it was formerly used as a some sort of green space. So that's a in a positive direction. I do not know if they've been using it within the last six years or how recently they've been using it, but the fact that they've been using it at all and given the fact that she says it's landmark, you know that's a positive thing and I know that also department of parks and recreation has initiatives called green roofs where they do sustainability. So we can look into that as well, any other thoughts, barbara you're in that area. What do you think about this proposal? Oh we can't hear you. We can't hear you hear me now: yeah, okay, so yes, I am in the area and it is a good idea, but I'm wondering now that we're talking about it being a landmark status if it's something that can even move forward I know from just visiting the center that you know, like Sheena, said: there's some work that was needed to be done there, but I do not know if it's even sustainable to think about putting something up there. Without checking on this the structure of the building first yeah, the feasibility study would have to be done right. Definitely- and I'm just saying in just thinking outside of the box, with all the budget cuts and everything if we could go just to the private route to get support that would be great and I've been, as I said, I think Marcus Garvey has done that Kevin. Did you have a comment? No I too just had some just questions about just structural integrity of a building, especially if you start putting planters water dirt, it's heavy so I that would just be like base one conversation to inquire about, but there is a garden in place already, but just nobody's working with the structural integrity of just wear and tear in the building. You know but I think it's a great beautiful site. It's a great place. It's a great effort and if successful I got about 10 other rooftops I'd love to recommend it, you started something big yeah, any other comments. I can't see who anybody has their hands. Do you see anybody with their hand raised anybody else would like to make a comment all right. So I think with that we just can draft the letter into the title. That's our henry's! I'm sorry who does anthony Palmer has her handwriting, stephanie I know I just wanted to say. I also think it's an incredibly beautiful space and a wonderful opportunity, Shatique and I did not mean to sort of be a downer with the landmark status. It's just that my experience with landmarks says: it's not impossible. It just means you've got to jump through more hoops to get things done and it's a pain in the butt and can cost a lot more money, but I think it's a wonderful idea, that's good information, because now- and we know exactly who we need to reach out to so. Thank you for pointing that out great and thank you Shatik for coming up with this wonderful idea, it's great when you're looking around the neighborhood, our neighborhood and we see something that could be done and we say something about it and bring these ideas yeah, because there's weeds up there now so I figured we'd do something with it. Okay, so we can vote on whether or not to draft this letter. With someone like to make a motion, I definitely can make a motion that a letter b drafted. It's not clear to me if the letter is going to landmarks or if it's going to another agency at this point, but to express interest and vision for the site. Yeah, that's kind of the dress of the letter of inquiry is just an interest in activating an underutilized space. For you know, I guess community benefit, and yes at this point, who would you be sending the letter to oh, it would go to parks at this point. I would think, and we were in the middle of a of the most would love someone like to second, the motion. I'll clarify the motion too. It's a recommendation or a motion to issue a letter to the Parks Department regarding a vision for an underutilized space on the Xyz property, with a hope to re-envision it to serve as a is it a. Would it be a community garden? Would it be? What are we defining it as the first space community garden I, would think I should think I was I would say either a community gardener or something geared to Environmental. I'm sustainability, I'm fine with either one, even if they wanted to use it for solar energy, it's something: that's: environment, environmentally friendly to the to the community district. The reason I thought of the garden was because I already saw vegetation and on top of the roof, so that came to my mind automatically. But if there's other things that can be done, that's environmentally friendly I would not be opposed to that. Also, I'm not just set on that particular space. I'm would I'll be open to the reason I thought of the center, because I know that's city property. So if there's any other city property in the district, whether it's another recreation center I'll be I'll, be interested in exploring that but I guess we could. That could be the ask for that specifically and if there's other spaces in the district that we might consider so that might be hands borrowed yeah, we got to go. Take a look at their roof right, but that's all I know they're going in yeah, that's landmark and they're going under some sort of renovation so for the pool I think it's for the pool. Yeah I thought that they brought it up. I. Think everything is like on standstill with you know, with all this Covid-19 stuff going on, but I believe that was supposed to go under. You know, prior to Covid-19, okay, all right! So do we have a second for that emotion? Second, who is that second Marcus Wilson? Oh, thank you, marcus! Okay, any discussion and Kevin. Thank you for making clarifying the motion and Marie and thank you for your question on who the letter should go to so Karen can I just expound on that because I think it would be nice if you spoke with the friends of Jackie Robinson before you sent a letter and talked to them because they should be involved. Oh yes, well, we had expected the new administrator for historic parks, Harlem historic parks to be here and I. Know that that's you know they work with the conservancy. Also, now that's a good point. We would not go forward with this without checking okay, any other discussion, oh Terry, you're, trying to say something. We can't hear you, okay, thank you so much my apologies for being late, but I just needed to be caught up to speed, which exact property is it that we're speaking about this is the Jackie Robinson Recreation Center inside of Jackie Robinson Park we're talking about the rooftop where there's an existing garden at this time, but we would like to see it more utilized, even bringing in youth groups to work, I mean not to work to to explore gardening and that sort of thing, so we would just need to have to make sure that the roof is secure and you know that it's safe to go up on top sorry, okay, thank you. So much I appreciate it. You're welcome okay. So with that, oh question, is it only that one that we're talking about right now or are we speaking about hansboro, also well, we are also going to explore hansboro as well. Okay, thank you. So much any other questions or comments. Okay, so we can move forward with the vote. Can we do that by common consent? We have a quorum. Do we oh, but we can. We can still move a full recommendation, but right what do we got? Yeah yeah I do not think we have five. Maybe we do have Quorum I. Take that back. We have Tahani's here. We've definitely been joined by a few new members that we should probably if we can carry at some point, just do a quick production of them board. Members, okay, I, think Marcus just joined us marcus. Would you just like to introduce yourself? Yes, Marcus, Wilson, New, Board, member and Parks and recreation committee member as well as transportation committee? Member and oh derek? Can you just introduce yourself? Please absolutely sorry about that. How you guys doing I had to pull over I was driving hi Community, Board, Chen, Parks and recreation, guys challenging elections still being decided still has this on eggs, I'm Derek Perkinson, I'm the New York State field, director for the national action network and I'm a member of Community Board parks and recreation and public safety, and I'm happy to be here and and I loved. Having madame chair in control, leading us and I salute you, madam chair, for doing a great job. Thank you. Thank you. That's a wonderful introduction, thank you. So we do have Quorum. Now we have forum. So we have six committee members present. Thank you Kevin. So can we vote by common consensus that are sure I think I can see everything? Okay, so all in favor can you can we unmute all right any opposed? Okay? The motion passes great. So that's yeah, okay, all right, so we can move. Thank you for that. Wonderful idea, shati! So we're going to see what we can do about that you're welcome. So we had expected Dr Dr, Wertham Galvin from Central Park, I'm sorry from Clemson South Carolina, Clemson University. Yes, we had expected the professor to be here this evening from Clemson. University is what I'm trying to say. So we did not know that we were waiting for to hear back from clemson from the professor as to when the students could begin to start to start working with us to collaborate with us, but they have already been working with a phillip, Randolph Square. So that's wonderful! So we have gotten that started so Gregory you're on to see the concert. Can you just share for very quickly what's been going on with with a phillip, Randolph Square, and perhaps that can inform ac Adam Clinton junior boulevard malls as well yeah, so we've had two meetings with Bd's team at clemson and we're working with graduate students that come and go so we're not working with the same group of students but about three or four students are assigned to the projects that we do we're working on. So we've identified a scope of work that includes them producing graphic graphic content, visual graphic content based on our visioning survey. We're going to compile that content into both a short report about the visioning project as well as a longer report. The second scope of work that we identified was to develop visioning exercises to expand the data we've collected because to some degree the data we collected was largely driven by the negative conditions at the space, which has actually been alleviated to some degree and I do not know if Miss caught with Miss Kaufman agrees with that position. But it looks as though the park is no longer a drug nexus. And so what has happened is that we now have a drug corridor that expands from Linux to frederick Douglass from about 1:16 up to maybe 1:20th or so so we do not have as much career outing. Of course, when the park was closed because of Covid-19 and the benches were removed. That also created a little bit more space. So so we're now looking at trying to gather some additional information from a more positive perspective and to also figure out. How do you gather information under Covid-19 and so they're going to help us create some visioning exercises, and we have also established a partnership with a group that does visioning so they're going to work with a bds group to basically implement the exercises that they're going to refer to us remotely, and so those are the two projects that we're we are undertaking and then there's a third one that we will probably get to during this year. But that is the tactical urbanism. The recommendations of these types of small scale projects that my understanding of the Parks Department is trying to encourage, rather than larger capital projects. The group has been very responsive to emails and competent in their capacity to produce those visuals and we're meeting tomorrow to actually come up with our mood board or our color palette for the the surveys and I do not know if those of you are familiar with W.E.B Du Bois says Stud Sociological study, but we we're basically modeling our visioning on this project. That Dubois did where he basically focused on just disseminating data through visual graphics. We can't hear you no I was finished, but I did want to also say I want to really give a heartfelt thank you to miss Kaufman for the garbage cans, brooms grabbers dustpans bags. The only thing I will say that the negative side of that was folks are hounding us with these counting us for these items we have to kind of protect them with our life. The supers in the neighborhood want your grabbers and all this stuff, but what I did what I did want to ask? You, though, is that do you see any impact from the work we're doing when we do clean up on Tuesday, because to some degree you guys are doing a stellar job, because when we go to hancock, it's usually pretty clean and Harriet Tubman is usually pretty clean. Well, we have well lately we was. There was a like a up, a problem with us, locking up our sites, so the the city gave us permission to lock up our sites our own sites. Usually we have a group from downtown a another, a borough block up team, but they have been. You know there were some problems they issued there and I guess this had probably a lot to do with the pandemic, because a lot of people were out, so we were locking up our own sites, so we were able to get to some of the sites after hours. Okay, so we were able to be. We were able now that has been cut back it might you know we might have to. We might slide back on the cleaning, because we do not we're leaving earlier now we'll be leaving instead of leaving at 11 o'clock at night, we'll be leaving we're leaving at like six okay, we were also seeing workers doing stuff on weekends. Yeah looks like I think we saw somebody either Saturday or even on a sunday on sundays. Yeah. That's the best time to be able to tackle some of the areas because of the it's not that crowded and the streets are, are let there's less cars on the street because for safety purposes, especially on the Adam playing power, mores and the next smalls. But to give you a heads up about the Hey phillip Randolph, we have to congratulate the police too they're, actually standing in front of the building, that's across the street from a Philip Randolph you're talking about Graham court, no, not graham courts. No, the building, that's across with that ramp that you can walk up the ramp. Oh yes, okay, yeah, so you just had a murder there. By the way there was just a murder there. Oh they've been here is a mess now that scaffolding on the idea and the homelessness there, it's a mess yeah it's hard to walk down that block. Okay, it is bad I understand and we're getting a lot of grief, because people are assuming that somehow the closure of the park was a deliberate attempt to remove the drugs from the park and then push it out into the community, which is a crazy argument. But we get emails and calls all the time from residents who are kind of angry that the drugs is no longer in the park, but kind of now spread out in the community to have you advise public safety about that gregory I need to be honest with you, karen, you know, I was on the bandwagon and at the end of the day, the reality is that I've come to learn that some of this stuff takes a lot of time and patience, and so I've learned to exercise a little bit more patience when it comes to resolving issues. The police know more about this stuff than we ever imagined that they know and that they I think at the end of the day, they're trying to make the types of arrests that really will put a dent in the problem rather than spending a lot of time. You know arresting people who will be back out in the street overnight, so I have not been on the public safety bandwagon as much as I have been in on the in the past, because one of the things we've learned is that if you actually interact with the people who are using drugs in the community, that is to say, if you treat them as if they're part of the community, they tend to go somewhere else to do dirt. They won't do it on your stoop. If you actually, you know, say good morning to people or offer them a cup of coffee, or you know just kind of create a little bit of some sort of relationship where it pricks their consciousness, that maybe they should go somewhere else to do what they are doing, but but no I have not really gotten on that bandwagon, and, quite frankly, I'm a member of the greater Harlem coalition and being a part of that group has kind of given me a little bit of a pause about this notion of attacking people who are addicted to drugs. Well, gregory! Please do not get me. Do not confuse I'm not do not confuse what I'm saying, I'm not suggesting that you confront people personally. I was just asking if you had no way but I just wanted to ask I was asking if you had advised our public Safety committee at the community board, then I did not because I think I kind of backed off on complaining and with about situations that the police are already well aware of, and that we also have access to the police. And you know the park, commissioner and everybody in the police department already knows. What's going on and so to some degree. Some of the hammering away at the thing that we all know about is not always that effective and, quite frankly, like I, said, the community has managed to respond to the people sitting on their stoops in a way that people really do not sit on the stoops of people who extend them some respect, and maybe that's a lesson that the people at Graham Court need to learn. Putting a big spotlight on people who are homeless under a scaffold may not be the most effective strategy to get them to move. Just want you to be safe, gregory! Do not you go confronting anybody? No it's you know, and but we do have a severe problem. It's and I think Miss Kaufman might be aware of it, but you know: there's drugs being sold at 117Th Street right near the park. It's a whole new group of people doing it. They're young well-dressed, they're selling, drugs out of cars. It's a whole operation where you buy drugs, you pay at the car and go pick it up around the corner and all this other stuff. So the police is well aware of what's happening, yeah not to interject, but that's, not new. You know 25 years ago, right up on Broadway and 157th in the dirty 30 that was going on every day at the school bus stop everyday every day. You know the people come out of the methadone clinic and they're, not selling bugs, because they turn it into the white car, that's sitting there, and then they get a little ticket and they go to the black car and it drugs. You know so this is not new, but I think you know just because we're saying that I do not think we do have to be having compassion. This is a problem. This is our people that I have a problem. It could be our son, our daughter, our Nephew, mother or father. However, it really has to be addressed and potentially I do not know where the money is going or what is happening, but the mayor's Commission on mental health, the mayor's commission on race, some of that money needs to be appropriated, not just you know, in mindset or make-believe, but to really get a task force on drugs here in Harlem, with some real people that can kind of try to help the situation, because that situation is impactful to every single committee that we have and the quality of life and the safety as people are getting shot. You know what I'm saying: it's, not a joke: I, it's not something like I, have kind of a little bodega that I used to like to go to a lot on 124Th. You know it's a you know a young arab people that run the store and there's some twins in there and I've known them since they were 15 and we have a rapport, but a lot of times. I just really do not want to go in because it's too much drug activity and it's impacting their business, it's stressing them out. They run the store now and they're like 18 or 19, but the stress that one twin in particular is dealing with because of having to navigate with all of that. Okay, the three drug you know, rehabs or centers on that block- do not deal with it. The bodega is dealing with it. You know what I'm saying and dealing with it nicely and respectful- and you know- but this is this- is not it. This is unacceptable completely. You know and there's all this money yeah Terry. Are you talking about the safe consumption sites or the weed? Okay? No, we're there. It that one 124 rehab the 124Th Street between Malcolm X and Adam Clinton power, Junior Boulevard. There are three methadone, centers or whatever they are. Those people pick their stuff up and then they come out and sell it and just hang out- and you know- do drugs and get drugs all day long and it's migrated over to Adam Clayton Powell by the you know, because there was a scaffolding there, but now they it's down and now that that's down they go on Adam Clayton Powell between 123Rd and 124Th and then they're doing transactions under there and they sit on the CitiBikes. That's what's that's for and they have a seat. You know. So this is crazy and this does not happen in other communities and as a community board I mean we should have to sing and do something. Well, you know gregory, I'm also part of the greater Harlem coalition, and so I've been on the list serves and seeing that in they are working on pushing back on the concentration of safe consumption sites in our area and Sean. Had one of the leaders told had this pie chart showing that I think it was something like 60 percent of people who use the clinics are not even from Manhattan they're coming in from Connecticut and Staten island. So again, I think our area is being used as kind of a dumping ground and people feel because some of these already exist that all of them should be there and then also. The other issue is there's no comprehensive response to this problem right. It's just. We want to make sure we're avoiding sharing needles and unsafe consumption, but then that's it, and so we solve one problem but create a bunch. So one other thing and I think the agency is oasis. That is responsible for these facilities, and so we should probably you know, join with the greater Harlem coalition and sit in on one of these meetings with oasis and find out what's the plan. What's the future look like I think that would be a recommendation. We can make the public safety and I think that's. You know. Excellent. We also have I was speaking with Sheena earlier talking about the concentration of clinic methadone clinics and drug clinics in our community and that we're oversaturated- and you know that needs to be spread out. We should not have a constitutional opportunity, yeah there's a total of nine facilities from 1:28th to 119Th and in the district. Eight of them are in district 11 and and then the ninth one is right down the block from TD bank on Linux side between Linux. So when you, when you put all of these facilities in one area, you're going to you're, creating this problem, we're creating this problem, we should not be inundated with all of these methadone clinics. They need to be in a different type of atmosphere in a different type of area and the way we're going now if we keep adding more and more to it. Eventually, it's going to you know, take away our quality of life, the rest of the quality of life that we have it's already taking it away. Yeah it's already. It's already taking it away and it's getting worse every day and we can make the difference and I do not know too much about oasis and whoever the other. You know, people I do not I'm not too versed in it, but I do know that those of us who have eyes and can see and been here and been there done this. We know what's going on and we need to address it and on 124Th there's not one, but there are three. Oh, there are three places the facilities and they need to those people who own those I do not know if they're private, you know just like jail has been privatized or whatever it is, but they need to start paying a fee. You know what I'm saying they need to get a fine or they need to make some grants into our community, but they can't just go Scot-free and I do not care, because in the other committee, it said well, they're not responsible for the people once they come to the window and get the method on whatever the people. That's there that's their policy and but they're making a lot of money in this community and we're suffering, so they need to get a fine, a fee or something, and the mayor needs to step in because they got mental health money that the first lady is running and they got the you know: I think that we're getting away from parks and recs I think that we're going in a total another direction, perhaps the health and hospital the health committee. Some other committees would definitely address that. But right now we are parts of Rex, okay, I apologize for going long, but I think it does impact parks and rec, because all the drug people are in the park. Well, let's just say I'm just going to say this in fairness: they're, not drug people, they're people who attend treatment in those facilities. So what we need to be careful how we're labeling people? Thank you carefully. So can we get back to parks and rex? If, yes, we most certainly can't have a problem with that? Yes, thank you so we'll make that referral to public safety. Okay, while we have Miss Littlejohn on I'd just like to address the issue with acp mall, so we do not have the professor here from clemson. So what would I just like to ask you Mr little John? What do you think you would see in terms of working with the graduate students with the malls and until the friends start planting the malls I learned that they had never ever been planted, never had plants on them and we started in 1997. At this point, the malls, the soil needs testing. We need to find a way to protect the plants that we do prepare. We need to have upkeep of the planet. Part of the problem is we do the planting and because they never get watered the plants die. The global warming and the kind of heat we have in the summer. It is not good, so what we would like to do is have the malls the salt tested on the mall. We would like to have a design for the not for one mole, because some moles are gorgeous. Some moles are terrible. Some of this some moles have that we would like some uniformity and we would like to get a design for the whole mall. What people do not realize is those malls cover 42 blocks, that is a long area and it's going to be extremely expensive to get them done, but we feel that for Harlem we deserve to have this. They are there and something needs to be done with them. So we need a design that takes into account the kind of soil. It is the environment where they are and sustainability. We need plants that will grow where in that area, because that's what we need, we need to study for the soil, the plants, the results. Let me just ask you this: who do you see as the stakeholders that we could invite to the discussion that might be able to provide resources, or you know just how do you see that what we are going to do? We are in the process of getting a 501c3, and what we want is some corporate sponsorship, because this is a very expensive undertaking so which corporations do you I mean in the area? There are so many associations and we're in the process of researching the ones that we think would be amenable, but we need to have an idea of how much money we are going to need before we go to foundations. Okay, because we have verizon in the community. You know there are several foundations: Bill Gates, Foundation, Bloomberg, Foundation I mean there are several foundations and that's what we plan to do once we have some idea of exactly what is needed, but we need to get the design that we want and we need to get the soil tested. We need to know what kind of plants we're going to buy so that we can have some idea of how much money it is we're talking about. Well, I, know that you're talking about raising funds, but just in terms of community and bringing in different stakeholders from the immediate meet community. You know who do you see, because this is what clemson will do? They will work with you with you with your organization, along with other stakeholders within the community, to develop you know, so you get you get to buy in from the community. For one thing, when you get that, maybe people will say: hey I do not want to walk on this, and I'm going to tell somebody else not to walk on this because we create and you get a buy-in from the community. They walk across the broadway malls. People are going to forever walk across the mall. We just need to figure out a way to plant the malls that would discourage people and that's why we need to design if the middle of the moth had some kind of shrubbery, some kind of something that was discouraged. That is what we need. That is why we need to design the volunteers would continue to plant on the ends of the mall and I. Do not know if you have seen it, but some woman between 122Nd and 123Rd has built up. A berry has built up on the ends of the malls and she has planted I do not know who she is. Someone sent me a picture. I do not have the famous idea, but that is a good idea for the ends of the malls where we are having problems, but the middle of the mall needs to have some kind of shrubbery that would discourage people from walking through, otherwise they are going to still walk through. You know the way they throw trash on the mall. It is going to take years to educate the community for them to become involved in this. You know we reached out to block Association years ago. We got no response from them. I do not know if they now have different people, but it would that it would be really good if they would partner with us the all of the block associations. It would be good if businesses or churches would adopt a mall. That's in there. You know, but there's a mall right across from Citibank. You know it would be good if they would adopt that law, but the problem is unlike Broadway and Park Avenue. We do not have enough people for that whole stretch. There are not enough businesses for that whole stretch. That's what part of our problem is. You know it sounds like that: I used to donate to us I think that you just listed a great group of stakeholders that can also bring to the table. So so I'm hearing that you, the scope of work that you're looking for, is planting sustainable plants that are adaptable to the environment and will thrive in the environment that you need soil testing and you need some type of protective barrier for the plants or even planting plants. That would discourage people from walking on the on the malls and destroying the plants. So and then you want a uniform design. Okay, so I think that we have some material that we can work with here to present to clemson, and then we can bring you all together and start to work on developing this plan. How do you feel about that? No, that sounds good is that their landscape architect program because they have no legacy architect program. Well, the thing about dealing with the university is that we have, we would have access to their res or the students would have access to the resources, so they could certainly reach out and get that information. So that's the one of the advantages that we have in working with them, that they have access to resources and best practices and that sort of thing so, okay yeah. So we hope to make this a successful experience for you. I would appreciate that and I. Thank you for thinking about us. Oh you're. Welcome that you're, our one of our premier mall boulevards. We wanted to. We wanted to look like park. Avenue no I wanted to look better than park. Yeah. Okay, remember that, for me, is our legacy and remember that's what this is for me, and that is a remembrance. So you know, let's keep that in mind and also what one of the objectives of tactical urbanism is to convey, concepts and ideas. Maybe around changing policies, also even making an educational experience. We could learn about Adam Clinton powell Junior boulevard, his legacy at heart, so that goes to be the part of the development, because you know when I come to community board, I get real crazy when people say 7Th, Avenue did I say that oh my gosh I forgot I would suggest to all of you that you Google Adam Crane power and see what pete the things that he did. He brought his congressional committee to Adam Clayton, Howard, Boulevard and 114Th Street, and his committee met in the middle of the street. Okay, so that's part of it too Karen I'm going to sign off and we'll. Okay. Excuse me just one. Second, if you do not mind Karen before we sign off, there is a group and you might I can give the information to Karen. But there's an organization called woke foods and they're in the Bronx, but they're based in the Bronx, but they are a non-profit, but they do things here in Manhattan also and the leader of it is a farmer and an agriculturalist, and you know they grow food on rooftops and they do a lot of things. So they might be able to do some things to help. You know what I'm saying, because they're not removed so I can it's called woke foods, and you can look up. You know Google then, but I am in contact with the directors and I can give Karen the information and she could give it to you because they're farmers and agriculture, thank you, yeah, okay, so thank you. Terry and Ed Marie before you go I'd just like to ask: is there? Is it possible you could send the pictures of the to me of the mall from 122Nd to 23rd? That has the barrier, but I have just gotten the news and they have not put that information on my new computer, yet as soon as I get it I'll send it to you. Thank you, that'd be great. Okay, all right all right! Thank you! So much Marie, thank you for coming on, okay, good night, good night, okay, so Tina. While we have you on anything that you could see in terms of or suggest in terms of this tactical urbanism that we're talking about that, we could bring into those part into to Colonel, Charles, Young, Playground or Harlem River park, something educational or I do not know like I'm just wondering if we can brainstorm here, that'd be great. The waterfront front may be a little much more easier, I guess to to get people in involved over there. The playground itself has his own mind. If it's in itself, everybody there has a agenda there, you have the people playing in the playground, you have the people playing baseball, you have the basketball people, you have the picnic people, you know it's a everyone. You know it's I get I, guess the everyone at County, Charles Young, has they. When they come there, they already, they are already known. What they're doing over there on the waterfront is very underutilized and bringing certain things there might enhance. The you know may enhance the people from com to come visit. Besides in the summertime doing extravagant barbecues, you know it can be utilized in a different manner. So I think it I think they'd probably be more useful over there, as opposed to in Colonel Young, because Conor young, it's already formatted, you know it's already. It already has its his core people and what they come to do. Playgrounds are. You know, playgrounds that are heavily used, it's kind of hard to bring other things in there, because people are. You know that they they're fascinated by basketball, they're fascinated by baseball. You know they already have their goals and but something like that will give some sort of education. I. Think that I think the waterfront will be much more and much easier to get people involved in, as opposed to trying to do that in an area. That's already, you know already in place, let's just say yeah, and we mentioned before that the river is an estuary which is a body that brackish water, where it's going out into the ocean. So you have different life. Life forms that are there different animals that give birth and estuaries. You know they have their young and estuaries, and so there's different. So maybe we could look at that, so that would be a great opportunity for students to go in and study the area to study the world. I think I think we should develop curriculum, maybe develop a curriculum with that and and make it an educational experience, because that's an excellent opportunity for learning. If you could build some kind of way so that school groups could go in and safely do these studies I think that area is something you might want to look at. Okay, anybody else have any other suggestions. Any comments on Harlem River park, hi, I'm Madam Chad, this is marcus. I would have to agree with Sheena that Hollywood Park is one of like it's one of the most underutilized areas, I normally bike over there and one over there, and they have you know a fish nursery and I'm going wow. Why are not kids using this, and why are not we, you know bringing students over here and I, always see the painting from I think it's from P.S 175, where they did a painting on the wall, and I'm going wonder if these kids still come back to this area. To you know either farm or even look at the grass that's over here, like things like that, so I think that area. We should definitely look into okay, all right, because we we shared Harlem river park with CB11, so we're looking at. We start at 142Nd and Sheena had also mentioned that there's some homeless encampments as you go up along the shoreline, so yeah. So that's that's something. We also have to take into consideration as well. But thank you for that marcus, yeah. So I think you know we can get some learning opportunities out of this natural resource. That would be fantastic. We in the district needs statement. We got the fatigue sent over a a an email from CB1 and they asked us to corroborate their requests for a study of the topography of the water in that area and just an assessment of, and also the veg. We can look at vegetation also. We could put in a monitoring system for with respect to climate resiliency. That would be able to monitor the waters as they go north and they would let us know, can let us know about any potential flooding conditions. So you know that that's instrumentation that could be installed. So that's something else, I think if we fix you know, do some things in that park, because I think I had mentioned that there was a big art project that people bid for to do and about 10 different artists through the Harlem bid. I believe have art things in along the way. But you know they've just not been attended to. Maybe people do not know they're there and I think is just should be an extension of what's happening at the lower levels in our city. It's all New York City and if it was really fixed up- and you know the homeless encampment is dealt with, people could go there, but it you know it does not feel safe to go there at all. And it's not nice. You know, you know it's not really. You know it's not. It's not good. So I think it's crazy that we have something that wonderful and we really can't use it and do not use it. You know this city is an island and it should extend. You know like if you ride along the FDR downtown. It's all people biking and doing different things, because it's nice, it's not nice up here, so it definitely should be addressed for all the things that it can be and the art that was installed there should be restored. Looked at toward. You know, yes, I think as we engage people and we begin to do these projects with different stakeholders at the table, that other ideas will come out of that as well. Okay, so I think we have a plan of some for some scope of work for on these projects. So I'd just like to move the agenda along and just in terms of update exonerated five, the state statement of objective objectives and goals for the Central, Park installation of an exhibit or sorry commemoration to the exonerated five and social justice reform has been, is being moved along. That announcement was made at the General Board Meeting Assistant Committee, just to update central Park conservancy. They should be getting back to us by next week or the week after to let us know where we need to go from here. What the next step! We do know that we have to go to department of city planning, maybe landmarks, so we will know at that point, and then we also have to look at what that art selection process would be looking and hopefully, central park. Conservancy will be held will give us a lot of help with the project, because I know that they got funding for the lions project. That's there going to be putting installing in central park commemoration to the alliance project and fought lions family who were affiliated with the Senator village, and they have a grant from the Mellon Foundation to do that. So hopefully they will take on this project and and do a lot to help us bring it to fruition. So we still have a lot of hurdles to overcome, but we at least we are. We have started the process. I've been going around with sicily to the individual boards because at the fir at the World Board meeting in September, it was presented and it was tabled. So as a result of that, we were asked to go around and talk with the individual boards. I've been doing that we have a letter of support from CB11. We have presented to CB2 and CB4 we're looking at seeing cba. Our biggest concern is the boards that surround the park, so the only other ones in addition to eight and eleven, would be five and seven so we're doing that. Cb9 is asked to come in December or January we're making our rounds to the board and we've gotten some very positive response. So far the CB4 was giving us some pushback and we were really concerned about them, but they're, giving us a letter of support, I believe or it could be a resolution in support of the project that that's the update on that project. Harlem River park, waterfront Resiliency. We had a presentation from parks in the mayor's office, so I do not know that I do not. We were asked to well. The committee was asked to come up with any ideas. If you had any brainstorming ideas, I think that the suggestion to look at the fish nurseries and doing some project around developing some kind of ecological study area in Holland River Park, is something that is a suggestion that we can make. So that's the along the lines. Anybody else have any other comments. I had I had a question karen about the the Central Park exonerated project. I wanted to know exactly what the ask was to the conservancy and I also wanted to know why the project was tabled and when it will be brought back up. The ask for the center of parks and central Park conservancy is to install the commemoration in central park. So that was the ask why it was tabled at the borough board that came about, because CB4 had said that the chair of CB4 said that he did not. He felt that the exonerated five had been paid, that they did not need a statue. He said they were not role models. He said a lot of derogatory things, and so we were not able. I was not at that meeting, but you can see this on YouTube. If anyone would like to see if there's just google on YouTube September I think it was the it was a September borough board meeting from Manhattan, so I think it was the 17th, but I'm not sure, but if people google it, you will see it, you can take a look at. It starts like around Mark one, but let me okay, it's like towards it's like two thirds through the meeting. Okay, so it was. That was the reason why it was table because CB4 had raised an objection, but the full president had a resolution that he had that would have been submitted for a vote so that we would have gotten a full board vote at that time. So really we did not have the visual presentation. Excuse me, we did not have the as I said: I was not at the meeting and Sicily was presenting and she did not have visuals or anything so, okay, so when will it go before the board again or will it I do not really have a date at this time because we were asked to to visit the individual boards. There are 12 of them. Wait I mean 11, not counting us. So far we have, as I said, 4, 2 and 11 and we're going to be presenting at eight okay. We have a ways to go, but if we can get those get those presentations done, then I think that we could go back before the borough board, maybe by January, okay and you and Cecilia are going together and doing presentations now. Okay, so that's great! Okay! Thank you. You're welcome, okay! So moving the agenda. Oh somebody had a comment. Question well: I just was asking was I hearing that community Board four reversed their position that they had during the borough board meeting great to know. Thank you so moving the agenda along any new business. I know new business people hate new business, but I just wanted to ask Miss Kaufman. Do you is there a procedure that we need to follow to get a lock box at a phillip Randolph? The reason I ask is because we always get our materials, whether if the parks is giving us tools they're either at the garden or at the senior center, and because we do not really control the tools we ultimately lose. Possession of them, and so I was wondering. Is there if we could afford to buy our own lock box? Would you be able to approve something like that at the site? It's really called like a Joe box. The problem with that is that if it gets broken into, we can't be held liable for any materials. That's in there. You know. That's. That area is really not an area, I think for a lot of fun for a lock box, because of it being so, you know so hectic around the area. It's a it could it could be a little. You know you can try it, but I do not want to be held liable for anything, that's in there because of the area. So you have a box at Hamilton, Square, right and I know. A lot of people are not there and it's kind of green and it blends in with all of the plantings, Hamilton Square, Hancock Square, it's I do not know of it. If it is, it's probably the gardeners, oh okay, yeah, our our garden team that comes from there and that area is really not an area that we that that's plagued with a lot of vandalism right. You know it's not I mean I say you can try it. You know, I, I'm just afraid it's going to be coming, something that somebody's going to sleep on and greedy. It will definitely sleep on it. So, okay, all right one other question. I wanted to raise Karen and I know that the Parks Department is going through some renaming of areas to honor black figures. I heard about the James, Baldwin, Lawn and I. Think there are other areas, that's being renamed I just want to. Let I'm not trying to start anything. I just am providing information, so we have hancock square, which is a beautiful square, but the one of the issues with Hancock Square that I've come up with looking at research is that the person hancock who's being honored there who I thought was actually John Hancock from the declaration of independence. It's actually a general from the civil war era, who was actually a pro-slavery advocate and fought against reconstruction, and I'm not a type of person. That's interested in erasing history, I like to keep memories of racism around so people know what's going on and things like that. One of the things I found out about that space is that, in addition to it being named as after hancock, the actual maintenance of the space was actually done by a group called 100 negro women who I think are still around, maybe in Chicago or National group, I'm not sure, but they did most of the maintenance for the space back in the late 19th century up through the 20th century, I'm not sure when they ended or where these people came from. So I do not know if this is something that you might want to undertake, or not it's just some history that we landed on and it's actually written right on the historical marker for the park. But it's not amplified I think the narrative could be written a little bit better. We can definitely look into that would be new business. I think we need to take a look at that any comments from the committee members yeah. We should definitely look into it for sure. No, we should know. What's you know who are the people in our neighborhood and I? Have another thing just along those lines and I do not know if it already exists because I'm new, but is there like a list of all the parks that are in coming? You know in our community board 10 and a little paragraph or two sentences about it. You know because that would help me to know better. You know what all the parks are and so on and so forth. So well, if you go on the, if you go on the parks website, you will see well, we can definitely give you a listing, but I do not think. There's no I do not think there's any I do not think there's any concentrated list of the parts. You know that we have with a description and that sort of information, whether they are that all the information is listed. I just want to know yeah, I'm sorry yeah. All the information is is listed on the park's website, with respect to the part, okay by Community, Board or just Gen, not by community board, but by borrow I can give you if you just if you just do it, put the name of the park in the search engine it comes up. Okay, I, do not know all the parks and malls in our community I can provide the list of parts yeah. That's why I'm asking, because I have a listing of the parks we just done. If you would like to put that together, Terry for the committee. That would be great okay, yeah, because I'm just saying as we're talking, you know some I know some I do not exactly know you know so. I do not want to be not totally knowing what I'm talking about so okay, all right, so I will work for good. That would be good to have. Okay, thank you. That content might already be in the district profile. I, do not you know, I think she might have it or one of the council offices, so you might want to check the district profile. Okay! Thank you. Okay, oh and and then in terms of the announcements Saint Nicholas, Park, North, Sick, Nicholas, Playground North, you know, was renovated under the community partnership initiative, I believe: okay, absolutely initiative, yeah you're, right city parks, initiative. It was renamed to Langston Hughes Langston Hughes Playground, so we had been asking advocating for a renaming to the Bird Classic Park Miss Johnson had come on and she had physicians and we've been working around that. So I got a call from Commissioner Castro Deputy Commissioner Castro, and he is recommending that the court, the basketball court be named for Mr William Bird in honor of Mr William Byrd for the Saint Nicholas Park Playground South, be named for him. I also put Miss Johnson in touch with Karen Taylor, who is who has an organization that has gotten a grant to do monumental, plaques in seat in our community and so they're talking about a a commemorative sidewalk plaque for Mr Bird, which would be in the area of the park. So those are Ms Johnson. It was amenable to that. So I'm going to be putting a call to let them. Let parts know the commissioner. No deputy commissioner know what what where what the group is amenable to any other announcements. I can't I'd like to make one. We actually did a community cleanup roughly two weeks ago. So I'd like to just thank Sheena I know the parks Department sent over like some flowers and plants and the sanitation department sent over some materials as well. We cleaned from 138Th and Malcolm X Boulevard to 142Nd and Malcolm X Boulevard got some trees planted, I'm not even sure about who we cleaned it up and the next day trees were up. I could not believe it, so that was very exciting, for you know the people that lived over here, as well as some of the tenants from Savoy park, who came out and helped as well. So thank you guys. Oh thank you. That's wonderful! Sorry, I had another question. Karen with the Crimson University people developed like a full project of what things we actually want them to do. Well, that's what this is that that's what came out of tonight's meeting so it'll be in a minute yeah. We developed some scope of work that we will bring to them and let them know around well Gregory Baggett and they still Randolph Square. They already have something in the works, but we developed some ass for them, for Paula, River, Park and for I. Think that's something they will get back to us on once we give them the scope that we are interested in having them work with us on so I do not mean. Maybe it's something that they'll work with us, for you know a considerable period of time on, so we can get other areas done. Other parts, any other announcements, someone like to make a motion to adjourn: oh hold on Miss Cameron Hold on one second, oh we're going to open up Billboard Django's tomorrow. Oh that's right! Oh okay! We're going to I do not know if they're going to have a ceremony because all of the Covid-19 stuff, but they might have a few like they've, been doing lately. They just invited a few people and maybe six or seven people, and then they did a ribbon cutting, but we're opening tomorrow we're going to remove the fence and then I'm going to have my staff clean. Whatever is the remaining then we're going to open up the park right and Fred Johnson is looking amazing. What time sheena? What time are they doing it? We do.
