On what committee They said, there's people who want to switch and people who are coming to this committee, But I, was told prior to submitting this agenda that we would have that information Today we do have two presentations, one, that is a community presentation and an sla renewal.
Don't know if that's going to be the name new justice center, but there's a justice center, allegedly supposed to be arriving on 10th and replace of the jail She was coming to talk a bit about that I'm, not sure all that she had to say or whether she was going to ask us for some sort of support letter So I, don't know if you guys seen the newsletter, but what I'm trying to do is the official vote doesn't come out of the economic development committee.
You can just tap on your business and it should pop up how the committee actually voted for that That's not an official vote The vote of the committee before it goes to the full board, so I just want to mention that Other thing I wanted to say is that I noticed that a few people haven't filled out the forms for like mexican grilled chipotle, there's a red lobster, one So when we as committee members, don't provide at least some sort of opinion so that she has an idea of how we feel or at least to let you know how do we determine who comes before us and who doesn't right on the forums it actually gives that option for committee members to stay whether someone should come before us or not right , We know they're doing good work in the community.
That's is essentially what has driven hours, if not all, of the restaurants that have probably come before you in the various ways in which they've tried to address that deficit in our revenue and trying to increase as much as possible the potential for delivery, which we will all be solely dependent on once the winter months hit and our patios are closed, which I think will be october.
Are some businesses in harlem You know my other hat that I wear harlem park depart and I've seen, which ones have done extremely well with delivery and those that have fine, dining or other concepts that are more about the dining experience are not faring as well with delivery as those that have very simple grab and go's like a harlem shake or the pizza places or et cetera, You know that's the name of the game right now when it comes to delivery and takeout Does , any committee members have any questions for nicola or brian?
Ruby's vintage is obviously a member of harlem parks, the application, because there's no reason we wouldn't have got you So I'm, going to be stating that when we go to general and executive committee, although you guys didn't say that you are a part of a community-based organization, but that you guys are, you know also the owners of park to park So, you are actually you know doing community work , That's the we're trying to how our businesses giving back to the community exactly that's what I'm trying to measure So I was out because we know that you do park the park.
I know uptown grand central serves as a as one of the kind of pickup locations, not just for businesses, but just for people in general for us and I think the same would hold the case for fdba having the capacity to store, because ebton ground central actually has a space that they're that carry king is operating out of daily to distribute or Do we really manage doing that distribution in terms of the restaurants, themselves?
I've asked the office to send emails and call all the electeds to get some updates on those bills that they have that they submitted already and to let us know if there's new bills or if some bills are already been passed or just pushed to the back I think I want to thank all the board members for submitting their committee request to me.
