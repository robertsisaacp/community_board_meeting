You too can also be a member of our committee, and I would just track that, because I would like to make sure that I put everyone who's, participating Okay, so miss Alam is not on the call she had called and asked to be on the agenda to talk briefly about The I.
So I do not know if you guys seen the newsletter, but what I'm trying to do is the official vote does not come out of the Economic Development Committee.
The vote of the committee before it goes to the full board, so I just want to mention that Other thing I wanted to say is that I noticed that a few people have not filled out the forms for, like Mexican, grilled chipotle, there's a red lobster, one Then they pretty much have to wait all the way to September until the full board votes on all these liquor.
So when we, as committee members, do not provide at least some sort of opinion so that she has an idea of how we feel or at least to let you know.
We are severely limited now in terms of our operations and ways in which we can generate revenue, because we are not able to use the interior of our space for the foreseeable future, most likely not until well into 2021, and so we are all relegated to operating on our patio and then driving as much business as we can through delivery.
That's is essentially what has driven hours, if not all, of the restaurants that have probably come before you in the various ways in which they've tried to address that deficit in our revenue and trying to increase as much as possible the potential for delivery, which we will all be solely dependent on once The winter months hit and our patios are closed, which I think will be October.
The experience and the menu did not translate as easily to a delivery, takeout model, and so you know again we're all trying to work as best as we can with the circumstances, and we just realized the investment in building Ruby's vintage into a delivery.
When it comes to delivery and takeout Does, any committee members have any questions for Nicola or Brian?
You recall that question about whether we work with a CBO, meaning community- based organization, Harlem, Park, Department Ruby's vintage, is obviously a member of Harlem parks.
So I was out, because we know that you do park the park The official vote comes out in September, but we will be voting to send it to executive committee.
So it's a fair question to ask: if any of them would want to administer that you know, I, think people are concerned about having as few people coming in and out of their space as possible.
There's a downtown Manhattan, you know You know the Bronx location for us in our communities right there on 161St and Grand Gong, course, I just wanted to say that, and as far as the watch and discuss come September, I'm pretty much going to rely on getting those topics from committee, members.
I think he wants to like close the street down and have some sort of contest, but I really need for folks to get feedback in those forms so that it's not a committee of one.
If there are any, is there any committee members who need to change due to commitment or not being able to come to their schedule committees, or they just want something different?
