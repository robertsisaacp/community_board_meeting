You too can also be a member of our committee, and I would just track that, because I would like to make sure that I put everyone who's, participating Okay, so miss alam is not on the call she had called and asked to be on the agenda to talk briefly about the.
So I, don't know if you guys seen the newsletter, but what I'm trying to do is the official vote doesn't come out of the economic development.
It comes through the economic development committee for sort of like an opinion, I mean before it was a vote.
The vote of the committee before it goes to the full board, so I just want to mention that Other thing I wanted to say is that I noticed that a few people haven't filled out the forms for like mexican grilled chipotle, there's a red lobster, one Then they pretty much have to wait all the way to September until the full board votes on all these liquor.
So, when we, as committee members, don't provide at least some sort of opinion so that she has an idea of how we feel or at least to let you know.
They submitted a renew application, and the committee did vote to see them come before.
We are severely limited now in terms of our operations and ways in which we can generate revenue, because we are not able to use the interior of our space for the foreseeable future, most likely not until well into 2021, and so we are all relegated to operating on our patio and then driving as much business as we can through delivery.
So I just wanted you to be able to express that to the rest of the committee in case they had any concerns and they're like well.
When it comes to delivery and takeout Does, any committee members have any questions for nicola or brian?
You recall that question about whether we work with a cbo, meaning community-based organization, harlem park, department, ruby's, vintage, is obviously a member of harlem parks.
So I'm going to be stating that when we go to general and executive committee Although, you guys didn't say that you are a part of a community-based organization, but that you guys are, you know, also the owners of park to park.
So, you know, assuming it's only limited to customers that come in without a mask, is one thing having it be, a place that hit anyone.
I think he wants to like close the street down and have some sort of contest, but I really need for folks to get feedback in those forms so that it's not a committee of one.
