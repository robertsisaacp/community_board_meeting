Foreign shatik, are you on the call hello? I can't see anyone. I can see, there's seven participants, but I can't I'm not in this meeting yeah. I just don't see you. I don't see anyone either, I'm not sure what's going on, but I never like do anything as far as recording these meetings or anything and today I'm not, I you know trying to become a zoom expert right now, so I don't know if someone staff can get on a call and try to figure out what's going on, but I usually just come like every other chair and just share the meeting, I'm not sure, what's going on with this juanita's on it shows it's recording. I understand that, but we can't see one another. I don't know what's going on. This has never happened. Shatikar I see what you're saying I don't know, I'm not responding for recording meetings, thomas washington, so, on my end, as far as the meeting everything looks normal, I can see all of the participants in the meeting. I hear everything you're saying. Well, I don't know something is not right. I don't see anyone yeah join audio share screen, invite others maybe leave the meeting and try to come back in and see if that helps because on my end I see yeah miss evans from ruby vintage, but she said she can't see anybody either so yeah, maybe I don't know foreign, so this is delcinia, I'm still having the same problem. I'm not I'm not! I can't my. I don't have a screen, I'm with delsinia, I mean I went out and then I came back in and it's still the same thing. It's just weird. I've never seen this before yeah. This is weird. I'm gonna try one more time and go back foreign. Okay. I can see people now so I'm gonna see all right because we're already late- and I know folks- have other things to do so good evening. Everyone, my name, is chanel washington. I am the chair of economic development technology and communications committee today. Did everyone receive a agenda, a pretty short one? So initially I was hoping to have a planning committee where I would go over things that you know committee members would like to do. However, we still that was with the the thought that we would already know who would be in our committees by now, but I am told that they are still meeting about who's on what committee. So it makes no sense to have that meeting when the people- I guess, I'm getting. They said, there's people who want to switch and people who are coming to this committee. So it makes no sense to do that part of this meeting, since we don't have that information. But I was told prior to submitting this agenda that we would have that information. So today we do have two presentations, one that is a community presentation and an sla renewal, applicant presentation. So, first off I want to just remind everyone that we do have a committee members form and you do not have to be on the board or on the committee to fill this form out. We are looking to see how we can incorporate community members right folks who may not be on the board, but are passionate in the topic of economic development and technology and communications. Also, if you sit on the board- but you are not on the economic development committee officially, you too can also be a member of our committee, and I would just track that because I would like to make sure that I put everyone who's participating, I'm in the newsletter and things like that, so that we can highlight what folks are doing and contributing. So, please feel free to fill out that form with that said, I would like to move on to presentations. Is ms alam on the call? Okay, so miss alam is not on the call she had called and asked to be on the agenda to talk briefly about the. I don't know if that's going to be the name new justice center, but there's a justice center allegedly supposed to be arriving on 10th and replace of the jail. So she was coming to talk a bit about that, I'm not sure all that she had to say or whether she was going to ask us for some sort of support letter, but she's not here. So if she comes on the call, then I will circle back. Is ruby vintage present? Yes, okay, so ruby vintage good evening. Welcome guys! So I don't know if you guys seen the newsletter, but what I'm trying to do is the official vote doesn't come out of the economic development committee. The official vote is from the board the entire board. That's the official vote. But what happens? Is it comes through the economic development committee for sort of like an opinion I mean before it was a vote, but technically we can't vote via email. We tried to figure things out in the coved to try to make sure people didn't lose their licenses, so we came up with a system that was temporary. We do plan on voting in committee and back in person, but for the meantime, while we're on zoom, we try to put in a process that will accommodate small businesses and not have them losing licenses just because they couldn't come before us. So I am putting those results in the newsletter. You can just tap on your business and it should pop up how the committee actually voted for that. But that's not an official vote. That's pretty much! The vote of the committee before it goes to the full board, so I just want to mention that and that's for every renew or new license that come before us. The other thing I wanted to say is that I noticed that a few people haven't filled out the forms for like mexican grilled chipotle, there's a red lobster, one there's a few of them. If we don't provide an opinion, then we it's like a it's like us, giving an opinion with no quorum. So then they pretty much have to wait all the way to september until the full board votes on all these liquor license. So when we, as committee members, don't provide at least some sort of opinion so that she has an idea of how we feel or at least to let you know, how do we determine who comes before us and who doesn't right on the forums it actually gives that option for committee members to stay whether someone should come before us or not right, because sometimes it's a renewal, we know them. We know they're doing good work in the community. We don't necessarily need them to come before us. We just want to make sure that we get their renewal out. So I just wanted to mention that we do have a few that we only have like four people. So it's not really. I mean we can just say this is what the four people said, but it doesn't really put any weight or tell the chair or executive committee or the entire board, how we feel as a committee about who came before what came before us. So with that said, I would like to introduce ruby vintage to present. They submitted a renew application and the committee did vote to see them come before us. The committee voted in form for them to have a renewal. I was told by the chair that I have to take another vote while we are in committee. So if we do get quorum tonight, I will take another vote on ruby vintage. So please, okay, nicola, yes, hi yeah and my partner brian washington palmer is here as well hello. So I don't know brian. If you want to speak to the renewal and kind of the steps that have been taken, I from what we understand there was, I think, a question about the sexy taco pop-up that we've added to the concept, and so we didn't know. If, specifically, that's what you wanted to us to address outside of just the standard renewal process, and so it can give some direction as to exactly what was needed. I mean ruby's vintage as you're all familiar with is located on at 2340, adam clayton powell at 137th, and we've been there now. I think, just coming up on two years right, brian yeah, two years and as with all the restaurants in harlem we've, been dramatically impacted by covid19 and the overall shutdown or slowdown of the restaurant industry throughout new york city, but specifically in harlem, and so in light of a lot of the restrictions that have been put in place by the state which I'm sure you're familiar with other restaurants that have come before you. We are severely limited now in terms of our operations and ways in which we can generate revenue, because we are not able to use the interior of our space for the foreseeable future, most likely not until well into 2021, and so we are all relegated to operating on our patio and then driving as much business as we can through delivery. So all of us have had to get very innovative about how we can determine ways to cover what is essentially 100 of our expenses on 25 of our operating space, which the math does not work and we're all struggling to try to do the best that we can with that recognizing the circumstances or beyond anyone's control. But that's is essentially what has driven hours, if not all, of the restaurants that have probably come before you in the various ways in which they've tried to address that deficit in our revenue and trying to increase as much as possible the potential for delivery, which we will all be solely dependent on once the winter months hit and our patios are closed, which I think will be october 31st. If I understand correctly. So that's essentially the rationale for the choices that we've made for our pivot, similar to others. Brian. I don't know if you want to add anything. Sexy talk, yeah go ahead. Taxi taco, as I'm sure you're familiar with there's on 118 in lenox and it closed I mean we were there almost 20 years and oh well in the location. 20 years are at least expired and that's the open, rumors vintage part of the thought. It was a popular kind of location, especially in the summer. So we thought to bring that back with the strong takeout delivery model, in addition to reviews vintage for the winter months, and so what we've done is just ruby's venture still exists. We've just taken the vestibule, which was a large just kind of open space, mainly used for photographs and we've just added a counter and are doing the taco menu pop-up in addition to the ruby's vintage menu. Basically- and that's really our it's set up, it's almost like a mini chipotle set up inside the space. As soon as you walk in and if you're able to open again, then you turn make a left and walk right into these vintage, so they're operating together, just kind of out of one kitchen and it's really geared towards takeout delivery and pickup. It's really just a counter and we're just quick assuming the food. It's still not open, yet we're still working on the menu and trying to see how to make the two menus work together, but it should be pretty quickly and that's sort of the strategy. Just when we were in the other location. We did pretty well in delivery, so we figured we could. You know, bring that back I'll, be into a different neighborhood and focusing more on upper harlem and in the heights, and the thinking was that that was a brand that already had brand equity in it because it was so recognizable in the community and as a business model. It is a grab-and-go concept versus ruby's vintage, which was for those that are familiar with. It was really more based on the vibe and the ambiance experience as a dine-in establishment. The experience and the menu didn't translate as easily to a delivery, takeout model, and so you know again we're all trying to work as best as we can with the circumstances, and we just realized the investment in building ruby's vintage into a delivery takeout model versus an existing brand. That is already a very strong delivery, takeout grab and go that had a lot of demand from our prior customers who had been asking for us to bring sexy taco back. We thought this was a great opportunity to experiment with the demand for that and see where it could go and allow us to accelerate sort of hit the ground running with the delivery model that would hopefully generate revenue day, one as opposed to having to build traction with it, as we would have had to do with the ruby's vintage model. Thank you nicola. So I have seen the sexy taco. It's actually cool, but I have to act so I did call around to see you know if anybody understood what was happening. I am a new chair. I do not want to go down for any craziness, so I did make some phone calls and they explained to me that it's normal, for you know, businesses to team up with others. So I just wanted you to be able to express that to the rest of the committee in case they had any concerns and they're like well. She no. She never addressed the fact that you know it was going sexy taco, but it wasn't that wasn't the case. It's like a temporary resolution to obviously trying to survive, yeah covey and there's no there's no other owners. I know that right. There are situations where two different owners will partner and one will do a pop-up in another one space. This is not that it's right, so it was really just about how do we survive on takeout and delivery only for the foreseeable future, and what can we do to to ramp up quickly? There are some businesses in harlem. You know my other hat that I wear harlem park depart, so I work with all the restaurants and I've seen, which ones have done extremely well with delivery, and, and so you know, the grab and go model is just the best way to survive, those that have fine, dining or other concepts that are more about the dining experience are not faring as well with delivery as those that have very simple grab and go's like a harlem shake or the pizza places or et cetera. So you know that's the name of the game right now when it comes to delivery and takeout and we're trying to best maximize our potential for that as well, we got it. Does any committee members have any questions for nicola or brian? Does any community members have any questions for nicola or brian okay great? So I just have one question and that is is so park to park is a local cbo. So when we submit the when you submit the forms right, it asks these questions. Hey. Are you partnered with a local cbo? Are you interested in partnering with a local cbo? Did you guys just skip the question because I was like why didn't they put that they were parked to park? Also, I don't I don't. It might have just been something overlooked. Brian. Do you recall that question about whether we work with a cbo, meaning community-based organization, harlem park department, ruby's vintage, is obviously a member of harlem parks. Apart along with the other restaurants, it could have absolutely just been an oversight yeah the application, because there's no reason we wouldn't have got you. So I'm going to be stating that when we go to general and executive committee yeah, although you guys didn't say that you are a part of a community-based organization, but that you guys are, you know, also the owners of park to park. So you are actually you know doing community work yeah, absolutely right. That's the we're trying to how our businesses giving back to the community exactly that's what I'm trying to measure. So I was out because we know that you do park the park, so I was like. Why did she leave it blank it would it was? It would have just been an oversight, absolutely okay. So I'll be sure to mention that, unfortunately, the official vote comes out in september, but we will be voting to send it to executive committee this month. So I believe it has passed. I don't know if we have quorum, it does not look like it hold on cecily. Are you on the line so sicily? I would like to have a vote, but it doesn't seem like we have quorum in committee, so we have lots of people on the call, but I don't know who I don't know if you have new members in this committee. Now that's on the phone, but I do know as far as having quorum with the list that is currently in place. There's no form now the meeting the meeting does not have quorum, but you know, like you, said chanel you did do the you did the the email survey right? Yes and it passed right and you can just do like a consensus vote here, a consensus just discussion like if we were to have quorum and then we will send it to ec where we will have quorum and then we can just do an official recommendation from the ec. But it's good to present the consensus or the feelings of the folks on the call I mean. Well, I don't well, we can't take a vote. So no, but it's just any way. I can submit how the committee has voted to the executive committee so that they can view it and then they'll be able to if she needs this to be voted before september. I guess that's somewhere where it gets handled, yes and we can handle it and it's not like an official vote. But when you come to the ec you just preface it that we did not have quorum. However, on the call felt this way towards the establishment- and then that just goes to the ec, so we'll just have like a general sense of what happened in the meeting got you is there anybody on the call? That is an objection to so. This already was sent in a form vote and it passed. So is there anyone that feels opposite from that outcome? That's on a call! Okay! So then we have already expressed our committee opinion and that passed so she's pretty much good to go to ec committing me and since we don't have a quorum. Okay, thank you so much nicola and brian for coming and presenting today. I wish you guys luck in your business. So let me just bring up the agenda. Is miss alam on the call should we remain on the caller. Should we log off? Oh no! So if you're interested in central park north central park five initiative- oh that's right! Nothing! You'll stay on the court. If not, then yeah you can okay great right now miss alam. She said that she would like to present to the economic development committee on a proposed justice center that should be coming on 10th street to replace that jail. Is she on the call okay? So in that case, are there any elected officials or any elected official represent representatives that would like to give an update chanel really quickly? If miss salam is not able to join tonight, you can also recommend that she go to land use and have that conversation there too, I think she's going to several committees right yeah. I think she's taking a tour, so I think that she might have. She could have forgot, because she's probably visiting a lot of committees that she was scheduled for this one and that's okay, we'll just get her on another at the next meeting, but yeah, so she probably can still go to land use. I think she should go to land use, even if she was to make it tonight. She should go to the land use right, okay, great yeah, so I guess we can catch her and try to see. If we can, you know make sure that she's gonna be a land use meeting. Yes, yeah, okay cool, but you had the walk today with her or no is that? That's because I'm on saturday, because I have remote access I'm on remote access during those times, so I couldn't work today, but I did communicate that with her. So we should be doing another walk on saturday morning. Okay, yes- and this is this is terry wisdom. We did do the walk this morning and it was incredible. We took pictures, video and very successful. I could try to see if I could text her if that makes sense, but it was a great walk and we were there for about 40 minutes and it was stephanie and you know wilma and it was it was just it was very moving. So thank you. I could try to text her and we will be again on saturday at 8 30. right waiting for you, chanel hi. This is felcina how's everybody. This evening I don't have a. I don't have a huge. I don't have a huge update from the office of the public advocate, but I just wanted to mention we had planned. We had. We were planning and I had sent the flyer to to shatik, but we had planned an event on NYCHA and health that was supposed to happen on the day of the big storm, and so we postponed it. So we have rescheduled it for august 25th, tuesday, we've partnered with some community groups and also with mount sinai hospital. There's a physician there who has done a lot of research on NYCHA residents in health. I would encourage everybody to come and take a look at it I'll make sure I'll send you the updated flyer, probably sometime on probably by monday, and also send it up to shatiq, but it's it if this is some really important information and something that everyone should know about, what's happening in NYCHA with folks help and so that we can galvanize people to you know, make sure something is done about it. That's it. Thank you. Thank you, delcinia. Anyone else, okay, at this time, madam chair, would you like to say something to the committee? Just a couple of things I know that, and maybe nicole will probably even know this better- the update on open streets with restaurants, it has been extended to october. Is there any news of any further extension or any type of developments with the open streets with restaurants? I haven't heard anything more, but I didn't know if it's just that I had missed the communication or is it just continuing as it has been, and I know there has been a harder crackdown through the sla on violations, so I I've been aware of that and a couple of harlem restaurants did receive some violations, but I don't think it's been that many, but nikoi have you heard anything in addition to this? No, I haven't, I mean we're sort of all operating under the assumption that october 31st is the end of it, and you know if we're lucky, we'll be able to maybe get another month out of it, but I doubt it. I think, like I said before the where the assumption is that as soon as the cold weather hits there's going to be further kind of preparations for a possible resurgence of the virus, and so any spaces like ours, where there's gathering they're gonna Cuomo is going to restrict us further again. So that's sort of the feeling now and nothing has indicated otherwise. Okay, I do have a question. So is there a way that frederick does douglas business alliance and parker park, these type of organizations? Are they able to secure like free PPE? I went into caribbean star and they have like this little setup that they have where they have like masks, hand, sanitizer gloves, and so when customers come in right because I think we're all experiencing this, you get all the way downstairs and you realize you don't have a mask on. Do you have to go back all the way upstairs or you gotta go back to the car to get the mask. So are you guys receiving that type of right? Because you guys are organizations right? So is there a way that you guys can receive the PPE to distribute to the restaurants that are in your or partner with your organizations? Is that something that's being talked about instead of relying on people, and sometimes I'm not gonna lie some people they have on mass and it's like? Okay, have you been using that for three months like what's going on right? That's a great question. I know that there have been some city at some efforts by city agencies to distribute masks to community organizations. I know uptown grand central serves as a as one of the kind of pickup locations, not just for businesses, but just for people in general for us, and I think the same would hold the case for fdba having the capacity to store, because ebton ground central actually has a space that they're that carry king is operating out of daily to distribute or a few days a week. So the answer the answer. The question is: yes, we've thought about it too. It's been. How do we really manage doing that distribution in terms of the restaurants themselves? I don't know of any that are currently distributing PPE outside of to their staff. So it's a fair question to ask if any of them would want to administer that you know, I think people are concerned about having as few people coming in and out of their space as possible. So you know, assuming it's only limited to customers that come in without a mask, is one thing having it be a place that hit anyone. It's a pickup location for PPE. I don't know that any of the restaurants would want to do that. Yeah. I don't. I don't want to do that, just having it as a courtesy to customers that may need to get additional masks swap out a mask or they've walked in and they've forgotten one. That's that's something to consider I'll certainly float the idea to fdba and see if they have had any thoughts around that as well. Okay, yeah, but I do agree with you. People are those masks are looking a little thin. Sometimes I think people don't realize the regular, the blue ones, that you see people in most of the time. The moisture you know around the mouth area, you can see that it's worn thin and they don't realize that is puts them and others in jeopardy, but having access to maths on a regular it is. It is a concern so, and I'm only saying that, because I was like at ponte bistro outside and then you know we're social distancing. But if you see somebody with a mask that looks stressed out, it's like we all can you know. I understand right. So if we can possibly at least allow them to give it to the customers or have it available. If customers don't have it, that would be nice so and not for them to necessarily have to come out their pockets as businesses, but to make sure that businesses receive that like how they have the organization stop, gun violence, they got to get mask and if you guys can be added to that list right as folks that need to receive that type of equipment. Yeah great point, anyone else have any questions or would like to bring up any old or topics of discussion. Before I go into old business, new business, charles just had something in the chat. If you could, I don't know if you saw that chanel about isaiah from the mayor's office had done distributions of PPE, and maybe we can talk to him about extending those distributions to the restaurants, charles powell, thanks charles for that, maybe we can't talk to him about doing that. Yeah, isaiah jenkins. This is charles good evening. Everyone he's been extraordinarily generous. It's you know, I mean I'm talking about he's been saying. How many do you need ten thousand? Twenty thousand thirty thousand, you know, and the chamber greater harlem chamber of commerce is taking advantage and maybe park the park as a cbo and just really talk to him for the next round. We've done all three rounds and we've used them. You know in our food distribution areas and, of course, just for some of our smaller businesses and for our residents. You know for our catchment area. I just think I've done it, for I got a you know. A large number, for you know for some of the churches in the area. I think he's just looking for who needs what and you pick them up. You know right next to the supreme court in the Bronx, you know: there's two locations, there's a downtown Manhattan, you know and then there's you know the Bronx location for us in our communities right there on 161st and grand gong course, and it has worked out. You know very well and he really doesn't care where they go. So you know he just knows that they'll go for good use, there's nobody who should be, as was pointed out by I think I don't know if it was nicola or terry. You know nobody should be using some of those masks more than once. You know so and also he did bandanas last time so he's doing reusables, re-washables and also disposable, so cecily I would just recommend or chanel. I think we can. You know we could probably be he talks to shatik. He talks to me. Why don't we see if we can get a bunch of that might be able to be distributed to our restaurants? That would be great. Yes, I think we should do that. Okay, let's do that. Thank you, charles you're. Welcome! Thank you, okay. I just wanted to say that, and as far as the watch and discuss come september, I'm pretty much going to rely on getting those topics from committee members. So again, if you can fill out the committee member form, it gives me an idea of who's looking to do what so there's about four people that I know would like to do things and I would like I would have liked to discuss it today, but it's okay. It can either be scheduled for another meeting before september or at the september meeting. But if you guys can please fill that out so that we can somehow allow folks to leave their own watch and discuss right. So, for instance, josh is interested in doing some sort of entrepreneur kickoff where he wants to highlight the fact that people have had to shift their entrepreneur initiatives. You know around now that covet has changed how things work so being that he has submitted that I am able. I was able to contact. Josh talk a little bit about what he wanted to do things of that nature, so I asked him: would he be willing to host you know, watch and discuss about that topic as well as he would like to do some sort of I think he wants to like close the street down and have some sort of contest, but I really need for folks to get feedback in those forms so that it's not a committee of one. We would like to see you know a few people's ideas. Roll out. I believe victoria hartford wants to do something around women in business or something like that. So that's just like two ideas that we have and we have from september to june. So what I would like to do in september is to just map out somewhat of a schedule so that we can get what folks would like to see done and who would like to do what rolling early so that we can try to get everyone's initiatives and or as many as we can this year and with that said, does anyone have any questions concerns if you go to the agenda? Has the view july 2020 newsletter, you guys, could take a look at that. I've asked the office to send emails and call all the electeds to get some updates on those bills that they have that they submitted already and to let us know if there's new bills or if some bills are already been passed or just pushed to the back. So I have asked for that information already, so that is coming and if you guys have no questions or concerns, then I would like to adjourn chanel really quickly, just two things. I think I want to thank all the board members for submitting their committee request to me. We are finalizing that committee list this weekend. So if there are any changes, please get those to me because right now you should have that new committee list finalized this weekend and we will give it to you next week in preparation for our september to june season. So if there are any, is there any committee members who need to change due to commitment or not being able to come to their schedule committees, or they just want something different? Please get those to me I'll, be finalizing those this weekend and lastly, harlem week is starting, I think, next week, charles you can correct me if I'm wrong, but there's some economic developments webinars that are going on and I know, there's been a flyer around a virtual flyer. So please take a look at that and let's try to support that as much as we can, since it's going to be virtual this year. Thank you, madam chair. So with that all being said, I'm going to adjourn is there anyone that would like to second hello? I am moving to second, I seconded it. I was trying to press the mute, I'm mute okay, so charles and I continue to enjoy your summer and that's pretty much it great. Thank you. Thank you have a great day. Everybody.
