Thank you, juanita, okay, so I'm just doing a brief update here on our project on seneca village. So we've been, I know I don't know all of you and I not everyone- has seen some of these projects. Probably so I'll give a little bit of background, but I don't want to take up too much time on background. You know: we've been working on various projects around the history of seneca village, one of the biggest ones we've done recently is this exhibit of interpretive signage. That's in central park, there's a total of about 20 signs scattered around the landscape of seneca village, and we installed those in October of 2019, and this is a temporary exhibit. It was sort of an effort to do something kind of more quickly than is typically possible when we're doing something permanent. So we wanted to put something in the landscape and really get people to start to learn about the history of seneca village, and so we did this signage exhibit, which originally had the duration of one year, because that's typically what you can do in central park, which is a landmark you know, without having to go through a lot of regulatory permissions and again we wanted to do something quick and accessible. But you know, in light of the pandemic, limiting the ability of people to get to the park and see the exhibit. Obviously we want people to really be able to engage with this history for as long as possible, and so what we did was we actually got the signage exhibit extended. So I just learned recently that we are able to keep this up for another year so until October. Sorry, I'm like having trouble doing the math until October 20 21. This will be up, so we're really excited about that. Obviously I know it's still hard for some people to get to the park, but we're going to do another round of promotion of this. Just to really let people know that it's here and if they can get to the park, it's a great way to explore the history of seneca village, so also thinking about the fact that a lot of people can't get to the park right now. We've also worked on taking the seneca village information that we've compiled. That's really based on these years of research around seneca village and putting it on an app a digital iphone app. So we've partnered with bloomberg connects a program of bloomberg. Philanthropies who's been really working very closely with museums, primarily but other cultural institutions, to try to take a lot of the content that they've created around what they're doing and put it on an iphone app. You know, I think apps are really great, but they're also kind of difficult to deal with like they need a lot of maintenance. You have to update them all the time. So what bloomberg is trying to do is create a platform for different institutions to put their information and they deal with all the back-end stuff. So they deal with the updates and the tech support, and so the cultural institution doesn't have to, and so that's I think something really important to think about, because again, apps are not something that everyone can do. So we've put a lot of the seneca village information on this iphone app, it just came out or just was released a couple days ago. So this is a really great way to explore the seneca village history. It has a lot of similar information as what is in the park right now. But again, the idea is to really create opportunities for people who can't get to the park and also a little more interactive. There's lots of different ways. You can kind of explore it through the app technology. So we're really excited about that. You know. We've also been doing these virtual programs. We did include seneca village on one of those you know if you're around, on wednesdays at noon. We do these every week and then they're also archived on our website. So the one about seneca village is archived on our website, but we're trying to really again, like other institutions, really try to do more virtual programs and take all the work that we've been doing and try to share it more widely. This way, so that's another thing we're doing. I also did a lecture with the new york historical society that features seneca village and we're going to do another lecture the same basically the same one. So I I'll figure out a way to get that info to you guys and make sure you're invited to that. We've been also doing a lot of blogs and we did one blog that I want to show you guys. Sorry, I wasn't able to figure out how to link it directly from my presentation. So this is a blog that I did that really compiles everything we know about seneca village to this date and that has been created as a resource in one place. So what we wanted to do was really take everything and put it all in one place, so this was sort of one-stop shopping for seneca, village, archaeology and stuff about descendants. Stuff. That's been compiled for educators, there's been a lot of visual art and performance, art related to seneca, village, so and poetry. So I tried to kind of reference, some of that as well and then thinking about other black history in new york. So I can put this in the chat for sure and also send it to karen if she wants to send it around, but I thought it was important to again remind everybody of all the work that's been done and all the resources that have been compiled about seneca village. Do you have another screen that you're referring to because we're seeing the we're seeing your powerpoint slides? Are you still seeing my powerpoint slides sorry about that? Let me see if I can. New share pause share. Okay! Yes, I think I see where I went wrong here. Okay, is this better? Are you guys late lane? Are you seeing this blog post now right now, I'm still seeing like the the view of just all the different powerpoint slides. Oh there, you go okay. So this is sorry about that everybody. This is the blog post. I was talking about that really tries to again consolidate in one place. All of the work that's been done on seneca, village and again I can share that in the chat and with karen. I also was thinking you know. We also put together this video. I think one of them the things that is, you know one of the biggest questions about seneca village. Is you know about the descendants and have we been able to find people and figure out what happened to seneca village after people were forced to leave, and so that is one big area of research and we made a little video about the work and research of celedonia jones, who was used to be the Manhattan borough historian and is involved very closely in all of the work that's been done in seneca village and he traced some of the descendants of andrew williams, who was one of the original seneca village landowners, and I was thinking I would share this video that we put together about the williams family and essentially the work to locate his descendants. So it's about six minutes, so hopefully that's something you guys would be interested in lane. Are you seeing this other screen or let me see if I can make sure I'm seeing I'm seeing yeah this? It starts with central park, new york city right and it's like it's a video yeah being the first I'm seeing just the first, the first shot. Okay, I think this is it then seneca village was a community of african-american, irish and german immigrants that existed in the 19th century. In an area that was known as the free park area, it was roughly between 82nd and 89th streets between 7th and 8th avenues in new york city. There were about 300 people that lived in the community, particularly towards the end and towards its demise, and we've been on this mission to find descendants to help tell the story. Andrew williams was one of a number of african americans who were free and in 1825 andrew williams, purchased land in seneca village 420, which was a lot of money. Andrew williams was one of the early settlers of seneca the village. He was there in the very beginning and he was there at the very end. He was a boot black. He shined shoes for a living later. He was a cart man and he was someone that we were really interested in and really wanted to try to make connections. I've been able to find four generations, and one of the descendants is andrew williams, three great granddaughter fourth grade granddaughter ariel williams, cal jones reached out- and I remember that first week of us connecting we had so many calls and try to help him connect all these missing puzzle pieces and connect my entire family back to seneca village, and she was like the family historian and she gave me some understanding of everyone in the family. All the men were named andrew, so the name andrew williams, continually gets carried over throughout the entire family and the only variation is the middle name changes. It's absolutely crazy that they all look alike and the name is still carried out to this day and my brother also being named andrew williams and the women. The women had started with a running and being as close to andrew's boss right down the area. So it's still a lot of family. Andrew williams was not a formerly educated man, but he is he's a shark and you could see it from the move that he made. He immediately protested about the takeover first year, but it seemed as though he felt his property was worth about four thousand dollars, as the records show. Angie williams was offered an amount for his space in central park to get him out and he responded to that request with a counter stating. I should be at least given this much money. Unfortunately, that was not an agreement that was made and they were actually getting way less money and forced to leave the park. So he did. The protest was didn't matter. Then they took the property. He got paid, two thousand three hundred and thirty five hours in April of 56 and by junior of 56. He had purchased land in newtown, so as a man that he didn't waste any time through kind of my studies and my understanding of the williams family from all the research that I've done, we were very resourceful people and with this new land, he was able to really start to invest in angie williams, number two's education. He was the first one that was able to read and write, invest in other different things as well and continue to be a property owner, and so after andrew williams, number two andrew williams, number three was a very educated person, a musician as well, and actually traveled the world and attended what is now columbia's music school today and he had a son. They moved to California. My grandfather started a security business that my father worked with him on and they're, both in law enforcement and he kind of grew up in California the rest of our lives. What is really meaningful is to find a family in a time when it was very difficult for blacks to survive, let alone free and to see someone who was taking care of his family working and saving his money and always showing sense of things being in the park where andrew williams house was located was really a little bit overwhelming in a good way that so many people would be interested in learning more about my story and about my family and our involvement with seneca village and where we went after that and what happened after that? What seneca village is putting the focus for this? The importance history is just absolutely the center of everything that we do. It can have a profound effect on who we are as people now. I feel very connected to not only my father but my family. I understand the pride behind my name and understand where I came from and the traits that I took from those people and why my father was the way he is and why I am who I am today. History is with you afternoon with history. You should know where you came from to know where you're going [Applause] so okay. So that's pretty much all. I have presentation, but I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have and talk more about anything that anyone might be interested in. Thank you marie. I just like to say- and I just like to we'll just- have questions and comments from board members and then we'll open it up to our other guests and I'd just like to say that the family photos, the video was beautiful. Oh my gosh, that is really so one of so wonderfully put together marie and thank you so much. Thank you and the updates with the the digitizing of the information and the networking with the museums. That's all fantastic, and I just wanted to ask what impacts are these updates? Having on the permanency of the exhibit? Well, I mean one of the things that we can certainly talk about. Now is plans for something permanent. So when we put up the exhibit, you know again, as I mentioned, we really wanted to do something somewhat quickly. We wanted to get people out there to really be able to explore the history and doing something permanent. As you know, within central park is a little complicated and mostly it's just that it's time consuming right. So we wanted to do something kind of quickly and the idea behind again the sort of process for something permanent is that we would get people out there exploring the history learning the history and that we could all kind of come together to have a dialogue about something permanent, that's rooted in a in a deeper understanding of seneca village and its history. So you know, I think, we're still a bit in the phase of really trying to get people grounded in the history. Obviously, things have been a little bit. You know distracted by the pandemic and what's going on, but what we really want to do right now. I think I don't know I feel, like you know, I'm kind of coming back into really focusing on this. A little bit more than maybe I have been in the past few months is really start, creating a framework for some kind of process for something permanent. So you know, I think, the questions that we need to still answer within the conservancy. Maybe first is you know who's going to really be the leader of a type of project like this like? Is it the city? Is it the conservancy? You know how do we fundraise for something like this? What's the scope, you know, there's, obviously you know there's a lot of talk about before pandemic. There's been some talk about monuments, and you know: there's a monument to the lions family. That's been planned. The lions family was a family who owned property in seneca village, but they didn't live there, but is a monument really an appropriate commemoration, so I feel like we just have a lot of things to still kind of talk about a little bit and you know ideally we'll talk. You know amongst ourselves a little bit and then come back to you, and you know also talk to the other people involved in this project. So you know, there's a whole large group of people, the institute for the exploration of seneca village. History. That's been involved in this, for you know again like two decades that also we obviously need to talk to and they've been. I want to add that cal jones who's been doing a lot of research. He actually found some other branches of the williams family, so he's been working on that meredith bergman, who sorry meredith lynn, who is an archaeologist who's, been working on a lot of the seneca village. History she's been working on a this whole summer on a program with teenagers to explore the history of seneca, village and she's, also working on a website. So there's a lot of stuff. That's been going on again a little bit delayed because of the pandemic. We really need to kind of come together and I'm hoping we can all do that in the next few weeks and kind of think about next steps. A little more yeah and all those okay excuse me. Excuse me I'd like to I'd just like to ask marie what is what would the task force needed to do in order to help facilitate at this point? What do what can we do? Sure? I think maybe just give us a little more time to come together and talk a little bit first and then maybe we'll schedule something I don't know for your meeting in september, or you know we can talk about doing another presentation or something at our at your next meeting, okay, yeah and then I just like. I think lane wanted to say something as like a little hard to hear lean. Can you hear me? Okay? No, you can't hear me. Okay, you're a little muscled, but I think we're done. My whole tech system is breaking down. Okay, I'm getting really close to my computer. Can you hear me okay now? Yes, we can hear you okay thanks, so I think you know. Just in terms of the question of you know, what can we do to make this permit permanent? I think it's important to you know understand the fact that we never thought of this specific exhibit as permanent, and I don't think that we think that necessarily something like this exhibit, which is how many signs marie it's 20 signs, 20 signs throughout central park in various locations. That you know are the understanding and the detailed information will continue to evolve and change over time, but I think the community has long been interested in permanent commemoration, so the information and the educational content can continue to kind of be available. You know and we're making more people aware of it by the fact that it's in the park now, but I know, there's a real, interesting permanent interest in permanent communicat commemoration and the idea of the exhibit was to first educate a much broader cross-section of the public about this history. So we could have a really energetic dialogue about the importance of this history and the hope is that would lead to a really good process discussion about what would be an appropriate form of permanent commemoration within the historic landmark of the park, which is, as you know, marie suggested complicated. But you know I really, I really believe, and the discussion that we're. Having is how do we, who do we partner with what are the next steps? So we start to have the discussion of what is possible in terms of permanent communication. So I don't think that we should be thinking of it is how do we make this exhibit? This exhibit permanent, because this exhibit of 20 signs in the land spread out in the landscape. It has a particular function which is creating dialogue, but what it is about is how do we have enough people understand both the you know, both the history and the park, to contribute to what's, hopefully like a really meaningful discussion about permanent commemoration? That's really appropriate and fits within the park, but also helps people understand the history of the landscape they see around them. I just like to say I'm just wondering if the next steps lane would involve an art process where we would have to have a selection of the which would determine what that form of commemoration would take. I think that's definite. That is definitely part of the process. I think and part of the discussion that we're having now is about both who do we partner with, because I think that it's important to partner with both institutions and individuals in the community that have expertise around this, but also, I think it would be helpful. We've basically been working over the last couple of years to to compile the research and inform the public about the history. I think one of the things that we want to start to have a little bit of dialogue about is examples and ideas of how other places have commemorated important events in very specific sites in a way, that's unique so that we can start to. I think one of the things we would like to do is start to broaden the ideas of what's possible and what goes into coming up with a unique, meaningful, site-specific solution to something like how do we commemorate seneca village? So I do think yes, an answer to your question. Yes, an art selection process is definitely an upcoming step. I think before that we would need to give as parameters as guidelines for the art selection process. We would need to give some guidance that would be informed by a little bit more of a little bit more dialogue about what are sort of the parameters and of both working within the historic park, but also what are the goals of of the commemorations so that so that we come up with just the best result possible. So yeah, absolutely that is the art selection process, is something to come up with. We would like to make sure we're partnering with some other institutions that can maybe help us help us organize this and bring the right people into the discussion and to help us help. Point us to other examples of really good solutions to to how to commemorate important historic events in specific sites, so that the that the broader community's ideas about what is possible are kind of broadened. So we don't go to kind of the obvious you know for lack of a better of a better term. Okay. So I imagine that this is something that the institute for exploration of seneca village history would have to be engaged in terms of developing a statement of objectives and goals and and initiating a an art selection process. Absolutely yeah, and I just like to also say that the education component, I think it's extremely important to continue with that, no matter what the commemoration, I think we agree, yeah, definitely and I'm just going to ask if there are any board members or guests who would like to ask a question of marie and lane. If you just raise your hand and we'll recognize you and then call so we can maintain order. Let me check to see if I see any hands ray, I'm trying to raise my hand lisa here. Where is the ray's hand? Karen, I think lisa is trying to raise her hand. Maybe we could just correctly raise your hand. I forgot. Okay, I just wanted to make a comment. Many years ago I worked on the weeksville. Exhibit historical society exhibit. When I was in college and it's a very similar story, there was a thriving community in bedford, stuyvesant of a freed men, and it's called weeksville and 40 years later they have a museum in bedford, stuyvesant, and I just it's a wonderful model for you and it's a incredible museum, an incredible facility and you might go to them and learn from them and they might be very happy to help you and guide you. Yeah. I've been in touch with them a little bit, and you know I think, as part of this process, we're definitely gonna be in touch with them more I'm not also planning I'm trying to work on. You know again as a way to kind of keep the dialogue moving. I'm trying to work on a symposium like a virtual program that we would collaborate with them on about. You know, I think one of the things I've been really interested in through this whole process and I think to what lane is getting at it like. How do we create something, unique and something site? Specific is thinking about black history and how to think about it in the places that it happened. So you know the importance of weeksville like weeksville is incredible because you can go and there's actually houses there. When we go to seneca village, we have to kind of use our mind's eye to kind of imagine what it looks like, but you can actually go to weeksville and see actual houses, and so this idea of thinking about black history and the places that it was happening- and I think that's you know there are some things you can do in seneca village, and that way you know you still have the rock out crops and the hills, but anyway. Yes, I think we expel is a great resource and they're really important collaborators and possible certainly involved. We certainly want to involve them in the process. Great. Are there any other questions, I'm not seeing any hands raised. Anyone else have any questions for maria and lane. Okay, well, I'd like to say thank you so much marie and lane. This is exciting and we're going to keep up the momentum and keep the hope alive and we're going to see this become permanent. So I don't see anyone on from the seneca village project, but we need to make them aware that, are they aware that they need to do these statements and start to initiate in an art selection process, yeah we'll meet with them? I mean I've been talking to them a lot in the past month or so you know again. This is a very much a collaboration with them and again I think we need, as liam said it's like, we need to figure out who are we partnering with you know, what's the framework for a process, because you know it's not, you know we need to figure out who's leading this. It's not. You know something. That's you know totally clear right now, so yeah we'll certainly talk to them and obviously we'll you know, keep you posted and you know. Hopefully we can come up with something to present at the next meeting to move forward. Well, that sounds great. So we're going to look forward to that and we'll schedule. You for the september meeting so that we'll have you already that'll set in for that for september. Okay. That sounds great all right. Thank you. So much for you for getting back to us, yeah, no, really great to be here and really nice to see everyone, and I hope everyone stays safe and healthy. Yes, you too! Thank you. Okay, with that we'll move on to our next agenda item, which is tactical urbanism and parts. We have dr bg wortham galvin and we have to share your screen thanks karen I'm gonna go ahead and do the show the screen and once I think, I'm sharing. If you can, let me know if everybody can see it. Okay, we can see okay, you can still see yes, okay, great, thank you. So I presented a talk at a virtual conference in June on tactical urbanism and how it has in informed a lot of cities, responses to the pandemic. Excuse me, and karen, I guess, was in that session and saw me present, and so she reached out to me for a potential collaboration between your group and my program. So to that end, what I thought I would do is just do a very brief explanation of what tactical urbanism is show some examples of how cities are applying those methods during the pandemic and then end by talking about the what this might mean for parks, some critical questions that I think it raises and also some ways to talk about. You know outputs or expectations that we might have during a collaboration question. I just like to say, because we have some background noise right now. Thank you all right, thanks karen okay, so tactical urbanism, if you ask most people, said that phrase to most people prior to the pandemic. I would argue most people didn't wouldn't know what you're talking about most of us do, and it's actually not necessarily because of the pandemic specifically, but I would argue because of the black lives matter, movement that had a resurgence it's starting in the spring and here's. You know, example of one of the street murals black lives street murals under construction in charlotte north carolina this spring. This is an example of tactical urbanism. So, whether you know it or not, could name it. This is exactly what it is. A very sort of concise definition that you see here on the screen is that it's an approach to using to community building using short-term, low-cost and scalable projects intended to catalyze long-term change, and that change could be physical, political, economic or sort of you know any combination thereof. So how are folks able to deploy these murals so quickly right? We saw the first one in dc and then we started seeing them pop up all over well, let me talk about sort of the context for the emergence of tactical urbanism. It actually starts. The contemporary version of it starts in 2005 when this group of young designers, who had their own firm in san francisco and they were called rebar, realize that to lay claim to a parking space, all you have to do is feed the meter right, you're feeding the meter you get to be there, so they fed the meter of a parking space in san francisco, but turned it into a little mini park. That movement I mean that act in 2005 has become now a global movement in hundreds of cities across the globe and every september there is what's known as parking day, which is where people across the globe feed meters, take over parking spaces and give them back to the public as public space. What made rebar's little act that could have just stayed an isolated san francisco one-off moment. I contend one of the reasons why it started to flourish as an approach. These priming conditions you can see them up there. One is the growth of social media just to remind us, because it's now in our lives, so much facebook starts in 2004 twitter in 2006, and these types of social media platforms really become a participatory tool. For someone to say, hey, I'm claiming a parking spot as a park. Wanna come and join me and therefore people who don't necessarily know each other. All of the sudden could participate in these sort of you know very temporary acts. The other reason why it flourished was our you know the great recession of two starting in 2008 and the reason. Why is that? You know big money, big traditional development, both in terms of size and scale, but also cost all of the sudden. The bottom dropped out in that now and we had lots of vacant, land or underutilized spaces, and so people would start to claim them in a tactical way. So here are some of the attributes of tactical urbanism and you can see I'm showing it over sort of the finished version of the charlotte mural. It's usually and again. It may not be all of these bullets, but the, but it usually has you know at least more than one of them. It's usually inexpensive. It's usually not permanent. Sometimes it's based on existing plans or goals or values that a group has it's people driven and people centered. It's because it's inexpensive and not permanent. It's usually low risk, but with the possibility of high reward. Think of these murals, it's often about developing social capital between citizens, but also between citizens and other organizations right to build capacity and trust. It's you. It's often a deliberate, phased approach to instigating change, so, even though it might start is inexpensive or not permanent, it might lead to changes that become permanent, it's usually based in the local, and it begins as a short-term commitment and has super realistic expectations. So a lot of this work often takes place in streets vacant. Lots parking lots in terms of reimagining who gets access to what in the right of the city as a process. Tactical urbanism allows for testing retesting input from multiple voices and to move quickly without committing or risking large amounts of fiscal or political capital. It allows us to push on business as usual and rethink our physical infrastructure as it can and should support our social capital and what you're seeing here are some images from a report produced. It was sponsored by natto and bloomberg and was primarily done by street plans, which is this design collaborative and I'm showing it to you, because I'm gonna show you, then this is an example of something that we might consider as an output. For you, it's highly visual, but it includes sort of you know key bullets. It includes case studies. You know this one you're, seeing an image of a case study in paris you're, seeing a visualization of what might happen to a street as well. As you know, some of the key sort of you know elements of this particular envisioning for street redesign during the pandemic. So for me, I think tactical urbanism is a great way to start to think about. If we want to rethink, think things during the pandemic that we can do so now. Here's a moment of levity, because I know that we've all had a very serious set of months in the past five months, but this is what we mean by testing and retesting. This is obviously retesting and testing gone awry. Someone trying to figure out. Should this be a bike lane right but the, but the notice notion that these things can be can be so temporary they're up for a day, temporary can mean a week. Temporary can mean a month. Temporary can mean a year, it's all the negotiation of what you're trying to achieve and what feedback loops you're trying to get at so that you can rethink infrastructure. We already have, as I mentioned, and here's three different case studies of how people are rethinking right of ways that were normally for cars for bicycles, because we've seen an increase in an extreme increase in biking during the pandemic, and you can see whether it's minneapolis in the lower left hand corner. It can be super cheap. They literally right just you know, put out some cones or if you're looking at paris, france, they have a little bit more money they're, you know, painting the streetway and adding more sort of permanent infrastructure. So whatever bandwidth you have financially, you can make this happen. Tactical urbanism has also inspired outdoor and dining, whether it's cities rethinking their current approval processes, which is the lower right in tampa, Florida, d-mapping and closing some streets- and you know, new york city, actually has a long history of that with the play streets program where you can apply for permits to close streets for play, you know right in cincinnati, ohio reclaiming parking spaces to start to carve out space for outdoor dining. That might happen. It's inspired markets that have shown up in spaces where they normally don't I'll point just because it's more easy to see the one in the upper left in myanmar right we're starting to see how people are sort of either taping out or painting out safe space and social distancing in places that used to not have it so that we can continue public activities but understand what our physical parameters might be tactical in the in the bottom right, where you see dallas texas. This was at the moment at the very beginning where you know all of our restaurants closed down, but a lot of them had a surplus of food that was going to go rotten pretty quickly right, and so this was an effort where they just used. You know they asked for wood donations. They built these racks to provide food to get this excess inventory into the hands of people who might need it right. So this is what we mean by sort of short term, the one in dallas texas, that's not out anymore, because that was a moment to respond to the large sort of excess of food supplies that restaurants had at the beginning of the pandemic. All right so I'm going to go. This is the definition that I showed you before and I put in red community building and catalyzing long-term change, and I did that for two reasons: one because I think community building's at the heart of it. If it's not with people and understanding how people want to occupy the spaces in their own neighborhoods, then it's missing the mark in terms of a design idea, but I also highlighted catalyzed long-term change, some tactical urbanism projects, literally a short term. They go away and you never see them again, but many of them have become long-term infrastructures that have allowed people to change the way they see or occupy the public spaces in their communities. So I just put that out there that, in terms of goals, could be short-term, but goals could also be phased towards testing out long-term changes that you might be interested in exploring now and when it comes to how designers interact with parks. Usually it is not in a tactical urbanism way, so I'm showing an example here. This is a design that has been proposed for a response to the pandemic in vienna, austria, that is maze-like right trying to you know, make sure that people are sort of individually going through it. So therefore, there's that people are not collecting in masses and doing sort of this unwanted, you know super spreading of the virus, and certainly that's one approach. It's the approach. I think that most of us are used to with the design and planning of our cities and our parks, but this is very expensive. It takes a long time and I would argue particularly relative to that highlighted red. Does the community want this particular idea of a park? How much of this has this been discussed and vetted by the community in terms of the attributes that they would like to see? You know in their park system all right so back to the attributes, tactical urbanism is very different and what you're, seeing now I have a different underlay you're, seeing you know domino park in brooklyn's response to trying to open up in may to the pandemic, and I'm going to go to sort of a more detailed with less with less text on that for you, so this photo was taken. I mean most of you probably seen it was. It was in social media a lot. It was taken on the 15th of may and what's interesting about this. All they did was paint these circles and you didn't have to have all this signage people knew what to do. I mean there was some signs, but in other words, you're not having to have a lot of people out there. Explaining you've got occupy the circle you can't go. You know you can't occupy somebody else's circle. You have to be respectful of passing by people's circle. In other words, you didn't need a lot of people interpreting this. They literally painted the circles on them, opposed to that same day. In central park, sheep meadow there was a cop wearing a one of those n95 masks right. You know that keep him safe. He was standing behind a steel barricade with a bright red sign with white letters. That said, keep this far apart right and gave you the indication of. Certainly this feels like a way to start to occupy space that doesn't feel like it's being hyper, controlled and regulated, even though it is as opposed to you know, people in uniforms and with signs and looking a little bit threatening that this feels like maybe a more gracious way to return. It's not expensive, it's not permanent. It's thinking about social distancing and it's certainly short term. So when I look at a another thing, I'll add is that what's interesting, you know- and I've been both studying and doing tactical urbanism projects for the past decade and what's interesting, is that most of them tend to be urban infrastructure focused, and by that I mean streetscapes parking spaces vacant lots. Those types of things very few of them, like the one that you see here at domino park, tend to be park focused, in other words, usually it's about turning spaces into parks like the parking space example, which is called parking day or if it's made permanent. It's called a park lit right, that's an idea of turning a parking space into a park, but you know after I spoke to karen, I started poking around and I realized that there's been very little focus on parks themselves, and so I think that this is actually unique opportunity as a collaboration for us to do a deep dive into that to be able to provide you all. You know with ideas about how these tactical urbanism methods really could inform some things that you want to see happening in your parks. So that's what's interesting about this. Is that once I started looking into it, there's very few examples I mean, even in my own work, I've only done one that was specifically park related. It was in 2000 2015 to 2016. At the time I was living in portland oregon and we had an nea grant and we were partnering with a group called the black portlanders who are a group of black artists, and we designed and built a porch where discussions and demonstrations of black art could be made manifest, as well as black contributions to portland, which is often seen as a very white city, and it was temporary. It was up for just a month, but I think what's interesting about the potential of our collaboration. Is that not only would it potentially be helpful for you, but I think in terms of dissemination, it might you know, be breaking some new ground, since most of the work to date has really focused more on hardscape, streetscape vacant lots etc. So questions that I start to think about you know when we talk about how tactical or you know, how can it be useful? The end of that first question is about with communities not just for communities, in other words, the way that I see the role of our program is that we're not coming in and telling you what you should do with your parks. We want to work with you in a cyclical fashion. Get your you know. Do some work talk to you about it, get some feedback, understand your goals, values and aspirations, so that we're both experts, you're experts on your parks, we're experts on tactical urbanism and we're trying to work together to figure out. What's going to, what's going to be useful, for you know to with you, as opposed to we're just handing you something delivering it. I always ask myself for home and by whom is this being instigated right, be being very clear about who's developing the idea, but who is the idea for to make sure that there's more parity there I ask myself? Are there people still being left out of these processes? And how can we change that and again, that's often cyclical? It may not be possible to bring everyone to the table at the beginning, but we wanted, as we would move forward, try to think of other constituencies that we want to ask questions of and have participate in giving feedback. I sort of already made another point, but it's you know how do we treat everyone as experts in place? Certainly, my own education was one that and I'm educated as an architect. You know said the architecture architect knows best and we tell you what to do right. That was sort of the model of the sort of genius of the architect and my feeling has been a rejection of how I was trained that, as I said before, everyone has expertise. Our expertise are just different and we need to bring them all to the table and honor them all equally, and you know, I think the critical issues for your parks have to relate to your need access what the benefits of this might be and also issues of equity. So, having said that, I'm just going to show two more slides that could talk about outputs. This again is that report for a street about streets, for you know the pandemic response and recovery that was produced either in may or June. I can't remember the exact date I think end of may so an example of this report. It's not only highly visual right, but it has text explaining what some of these ideas are. This one is more general, so in other words, they produced this expecting that then cities or neighborhoods could take this and figure out how to apply it to their specific situation. So certainly we could do something that is general. We could also do something that is specific, meaning you could. You know, identify specific parks that you want studied, so that what we're doing is highly specific to those parks. There also could be a combination thereof right that it could start out with some of these general principles or ideas, and then maybe there's three parks that are picked as a focus. I'm just naming a you know a random number and that it moves from the general to the specific. The other type of guide that or report that could be produced. Is this one from the city of burlington, and this is more about trying to make a community-wide call or process for ideas? So if you were really interested in seeing what your own constituents would want to have happened this it's called a demonstration project guide right, so you know it introduces people to tactical urbanism. It gets. You know. Obviously, there'd be some kind of permitting process that community members would go through either with your organization or whoever we'd have to identify that gives them ideas for projects typical materials used, how to plan and evaluate it. But then- and you can see then there's appendices for you know the initial proposal, so this type is different than the other one. The other one is delivering specific designs, ideas for parks or general design, ideas for parks. This one is more about. It would have some of that content as the front matter, but is more a guide that allows you long-term to solicit community-based projects and ideas and gives you a method for evaluating them and understanding if you want to move forward, so those are sort of two things. I think, because I want to be able to see everybody karen, I'm gonna go ahead and stop sharing, and I know that was very brief, but I wanted to open it up more to dialogue. I mean I'm hoping that we get to collaborate. If we do, you know expectations and goals and outputs are all very important, but know that you know. One of the methods I have used with community groups is that if we agree, we want to work together. We talk initially just about some goals and intents, but we don't talk about the outputs until later. In other words, we go through some processes. We show you work that we're doing we get feedback on it and then there's a moment where we decide what's the best output for this work, so it allows you to see some of it without pre-deciding it and then producing a report that maybe isn't, as is helpful or useful. The other thing I'd say that we could do because I'm inspired by the seneca village- and I hadn't talked to karen about this, but my students will be learning how to make short films. I believe it's a really important tool for them to learn, and certainly one that I did not learn in my own education and so a short film would be on the table as well. If you wanted, I wanted that because we all know that in the end, while these reports can be really useful, they either sit on a shelf somewhere because I'm a 20th century gal. So I still think of it. That way, I think everybody else thinks of it being in the cloud somewhere, but you know- and we can do that, but we also want to do things that are useful, so we could even talk about. Is there a shorter report and a video? Is there a longer? I mean there's many manifestations. None of it has to be decided today, but if these are ideas that are of interest to you because school starts next week, although we're starting online, we were supposed to start in person, but clemson pushed it back to september to start in person. So I'm personally happy about that. We could just agree to work together tonight and then I can work with karen and some of the board members to initially talk about some very basic parameters of scope, meaning the content that you're most interested in us exploring in a very general way, and then I think, what's more useful is for us to start doing it and whether it's at board meetings or special other meetings that we set up, then we can just start showing. This is what we've learned so far, and this is what we're thinking so far and when you can say to us wow, you guys are way off base. We were saying x, y and z and you're doing a b and c, and then we get a sense of of that, and that could be one way that we work together. All right, I'll, stop monologuing karen and we can turn it into a dialogue. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you! So much bg. Let me see if there are any hands that are raised right now. Okay, gregory baggett has his hands raised: okay, yeah karen! Thank you very much, and also thank you for the leadership on the seneca village project. I wanted to it's interesting that you brought up this concept of tactical urbanism. It looks as though the parks department is moving in that direction in a lot of projects, and it seems to also be a natural response and evolution out of the Covid-19 experience. I have been spearheading a project at April of randolph square for quite a long time now, and we are, we came to the conclusion that the proposed three million dollar capital project that we were developing a vision project around needed to be set aside to think about a much more smaller project and we met with gail brewer at a PPE distribution event that we did just recently, and we learned that 400 000, 500 000 that was allocated to us for the larger capital project had probably been diverted to Covid-19 related emergencies and, at the moment president made a commitment that we could do a much scaled down project, and we also re was told- and I would say off the record. You know that the parks department generally will not be lobbying elected officials for discretionary funds. So what we are planning to do is a much smaller beautification project. We have a designer who is willing to volunteer some time and we identified a way of using the sidewalks around the space. That was a very in a very interesting way. We happened upon two, ladies who were walking around the park and you know they, but they seem to have a intent, but I couldn't understand what they were doing, and so we went over to and asked them. Why are they walking around the park? And they basically said they were praying, and you know we were kind of shocked at the at what they were doing. But after we thought about it, we thought about. Maybe the space could be turned into some type of meditation circle or some type of thought circle that would sort of activate a sidewalk at a very depressed park. So I'm very interested in these projects that you are talking about, because we have successfully moved the elements of drugs out of the park. Unfortunately, they've gone to other areas of the neighborhood, but our park is now free of much of the drug activity. That was there and we do have this commitment from the borough president to do some type of beautification project. Under this new concept of urban tactical urbanism, yeah gregory, I love it. Everything you're saying is sort of exactly what I'm talking about, and certainly one of those bullet points under the attributes is sometimes there's an existing project that you can't do right, because the money either politically or financially- and I think this is a perfect example that if you all I mean so, we can have many approaches. But if you all identify specific areas or locations that you know, a project has stalled that we can look at them and take them on to show how we could do a tactical version of that to prime the pump. I mean you know in san francisco there's some of these that really started out with the equivalent of like duct tape and chewing gum, and now our multi-million dollar permanent projects, because often called pre-development developers want to see. If you want to get private funding, they want to see that there's the ability to get people to a place right and then it can become a chicken and an egg thing and we're like well nobody's here, but we need to do something to get people here and nobody's willing to put the money behind it. So I think you know one approach could be identifying very specific projects that have stalled either financially or politically, and we could. We could look at new ways to approach them or it could just be places that you've identified that you wish. Somebody would look at right. I mean that that's something that we can do too, but everything that you said gregory is spot on and that tactical urbanism has been really successful. In doing things like, when I say, low risk high impact that don't cost a lot of money often have some sweat equity put into them, but then, when they start to yield results, you would be surprised how sometimes, the politicians and or the financers, which are often both fall behind now wanting to support it, because it's getting momentum as opposed to just talking about you, know an empty space or an under utilized space. So yeah, absolutely great everything. You're talking about gets me excited about potentially working with you all, because this is exactly what we're looking for and the things that we can help you do. The other thing is what I say before is that it also could just be general. It can be general principles like the pandemic guide that bloomberg and street collective produced. The other thing that you know is sort of the not only my expertise, but obviously that I teach my students is participatory methods. So we could also give you a guide about how to engage with the community in sort of these new and different creative ways to solicit feedback, or even, if you have an area, and you have four different ideas, what are some participatory methods where you can sort of understand? You know what is going to truly really feel about what they want to see happen at this space. Oh, thank you and just gregory go away. I still see him. Oh, I think. Oh I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry! No! That's fine! I wanted to. I wanted to say thanks for acknowledging the room, you know that the park is no longer a nexus for drugs, but I wanted to share with you how that happened. It happened because the people in the community actually befriended the people who were abusing the park and I guess to some degree the more they got to know the people who lived in the area who really didn't appreciate their behavior. They actually began to police themselves and, quite frankly, where they went to go and set up shop again were places where they felt rejected. So I think I entered this whole social landscape with this notion of removing people from a space that just does not work, and maybe it works in other neighborhoods, but in the end it really didn't work in our neighborhoods. You know. I also love that anecdote. The porch that we built the temporary porch we built with the black portlanders in portland in this park was a park that was, you know, had a high population of homeless in it, either with mental health problems or with drug issues, which is very common in portland, because it's a mild climate right. So a lot of places with more mild climates tend, I think, have higher homeless populations and there was a lot of handwringing about it by the city in terms of permitting and also by the university, because you know, students would be working on this project and I convinced them that if we didn't try and they wanted to force all of the sort of homeless out of that area- and I said I said- and there's a really great landscape architect named walter hood- if you're not familiar with him, he is amazing. He I I've only met him a couple times, so he's an intellectual mentor. I wish he could be my real mentor and you know he wrote a book in the 90s when I was a student and it really influenced me that had to do with he would go to all the parks in oakland, which is where he was living and from, and would just study the users, and did this book called urban diaries where one day he just focused on what he called the beer drinkers, which tended to be the homeless the next time he focused on the prostitute population. The next time he focused on the kids who were making play out of non-playground equipment like they were finding old barrels and turning them in into play, and so he was he was basic and then he next time he studied. He looked at the elders in the community and he was specifically studying, I think, communities that are disenfranchised from our processes either politically or financially, and so that always stuck with me. So when we did this project, I said I think we can work with the homeless community. Can the city and the university get off my back and if it's an epic fail, you can hang me up to dry, and so what I did is I went around and started talking to the homeless and letting them know what we were going to do, that we were going to be building something on the site. I let them know why we were doing it and what became really interesting is that yeah we'd, be it's portland we'd be doing some of this in the rain. They would help hold up tarps or help us when we're trying to have somebody struggling to put up a tent at night, we had to leave a lot of stuff on site during the build and we tried to protect it as much. We could, but mostly it's just being wrapped in tarps and being held down by concrete blocks, and it was all donated materials for the most part. They were watching it at night to make sure nobody would vandalize our raw materials. They were super proud of this porch that we built with and then when we were programming it. You know we did a night called a history of hip-hop that we projected onto this one wall. We would have kids programming during the day where kids would learn about jacob lawrence and people like that, and what was interesting is that the homeless population became very productive of that programming, in which oh show away any teenagers. They thought were there for nerdwell reasons, and this is the homeless population right yeah, and so I love that you said that gregory, because that became one of my guiding principles is that you know, if there's a disenfranchised population in a location instead of just trying to sweep it under the rug or push them to a different location. Let's do some outreach and figure out how they can contribute positively to the park, so that then you know that the elders are there. We had a lot of elders right in the neighborhood who liked to in their walk there and sit on the porch. When there wasn't official programming- and you know it had a canopy- and that became a really popular space for and it had built-in seating and some other things. It became really popular when it wasn't being officially used for programming for people who often felt like they didn't have a have a place in some of these spaces. So I love that you said that because I think that is a value you know when we come to an agreement about values or goals that I love to hear. You say that we can collaborate on what we think our values and goals for this project are, and that's one that I think is certainly achievable. Is that working with populations that people often think of as negative and want to get rid of, and do they just need? You know a human face to actually talk to them right and figure out how they can feel like they're productively, contributing to that project. Well, thank you, bd and I'd just like to say that I'd like to we can ask if the committee would like to move this forward to the executive committee when we come to the voting segment of the of the agenda sure, but I'd just like to say. I think this might be a great project for a phillip randolph square, and perhaps we can, if you know, if gregory's group is amenable to that, and then also look at selecting two other parks as well. So, and I think that you know at this time, we also need to incorporate the social distancing in whatever it is that we're doing and I'd like to ask a bd if you could provide a synopsis of what your graduate students would be able to. You know exactly specifically what you would propose to us in terms of tactical urbanism in our parks. So if you could, if you would be able to provide, that would be great, and I think that did you want to say something: nope, I'm just I'm just listening and hearing you, okay and I think we have and we want to move the agenda along. So we have a question from terry wisdom has had her hand raised and if you could just be brief. Okay, thank you. Thank you, yeah. Thank you! So much, I'm sorry for being late and missing the bulk of it. I was through harlem network news, helping coordinate and sharing the tribute to john congressman john lewis. That's happening now that congressman espion is doing decide to make sure that all of those court cross platforms were happening. So I heard a talent of what was said and I think in my thoughts and mine, I work very closely with the harlem black lives matter and just the model and the spirit of what they did. I was out there every day and I they I covered it and just the fact that these four women were able to just put this together. They used different vendorships. I know I don't know if you're a firm or who was involved, but I know that they used an architectural firm to actually strip the letters so that they were all even and of course, you know they did overhead shots. But what I really liked about the spirit of what the black lives matter and the harlem park to park was that it was truly harlem and there wasn't really any separation. You know they had a harlem artist who chose other quote harlem artists and they painted and the community protected. You know so I my thing is that I know tomorrow we're going to go on a research walk with sister sharon, salam and chanel, we're going to walk at nine o'clock tomorrow through the park and just kind of look and feel and talk and research and develop and have ideas, and I think all of the things that you're speaking about can come into it. That's for sure, even looking at the suffragette and the fact that there's theater, but I think that it's very important that this really be harlem, because there are so many creative people. There are artists, there are filmmakers they're, I'm a film, I mean there are so many talented people and a lot of times they don't really get to participate. You know there is an economic disparity and you know I mean some of those homeless. People or artists are just all a part of the community. I don't feel there's a separation here, you know, and that was what harlan park depart did, and I feel like it's very critical that we do those same things. I mean the economic disparity for people of color is extreme, the disparity of people being able to participate or do their are. Is it it's astounding it's across all boards, and I know that all of the things that have happened right now, you know, have primed the way for things to be opened up, but I want to make sure that people of color are apart economically apart creatively apart, notably apart. It's just it's a very critical thing, because the disparity is extreme and it's not for lack of talent. So thank you so much. I just want to keep that. Keep that thought alive, because, oh absolutely and I'll just say historically, architects, urban designers and planners have done things for people and that's why I emphasize the change in preparation to with that. We should be doing things with people, not for people, so that everybody is an expert everybody's expertise, so we would just be one collaborator in whatever would manifest, and our hope is that we're stimulating design ideas in sort of the larger scale that then we could find partners to really take them over and make them specific in your in your community. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much and we appreciate it gregory if you could just are you amenable to this idea of working with? Yes, absolutely it's a great surprise. I didn't know to anticipate this. Thank you so much. Thank you. So if you all don't mind, I would I'd like to go put my eight-year-old to bed, but I look for I'll look for that synopsis from you. Yes and we meet towards the end of the month. So if you could get it to us by next week or absolutely great, thank you so much such a pleasure all right bye-bye and with that I'd like to move the agenda along and our last item is soul street with emergency messaging and that's lisa smith. So you have, you, can you'll be able to share your screen. You have to unmute okay, yes, I'm unmuted great presentation and love to connect her with a public color who is a an organization, a friend of mine, where the students re-uh imagine schools and fix them and paint them, make them beautiful and safe and that's happening all over new york. Let me share my screen share. Okay and now here we go all right, so I have created a company called soul street and we, our solar charging bench. I met with gregory several months ago, and we talked about this for maybe some parts of the harlem community we are last year we had a presentation in times square, but the thing that's really wonderful about us is we have this ink panel and the ink panel is a message board. It's like a big kindle and the more sunlight you have on it. The better so, where we have become very relevant now, is to post we can post alerts and emergency messaging over the internet and on our e-ink panel. So local businesses can talk about. You know openings and to how they're serving the community e-paper signage in the age of Covid-19 can have emergency messaging and and so on and charge your phone. This is an installation we just did at the university hospital in newark and we have a big sign telling the essential workers how much we appreciate them. It's all solar, there's, no deep trenching and the beauty of this is you can place it anywhere. It's needed and and talk to your community and the revenues from the advertising can be shared with the community. So here we thank the essential workers and we talk about what, with the attributes of the soul street solar charging bench here, I am sitting with the rutgers university hospital ceo and we're sitting safely apart and so the emergency messages, real-time updates, the you can move the sign very easily. It's not connected to the grid, it's just eight bolts into the side work or we can put a weighted base on it right now, the the average daily miles of well. This is what happened in around April and March, with outdoor advertising and so on, and it's starting to move up again in cities like new york and across the nation. We will be installing next week. This is srivenko park in passaic, new jersey, it's a beautiful park and the mayor and the community are very excited for us to be there so because the park is being used much more than it has been in the past, more people are working from home, more people are walking on these streets, walking on main streets using the stores from main streets, and it's a great way to communicate with the community. Here's another one in passaic that we're putting down, and it's in garibaldi plaza, which is a place where a lot of the community from south american nations like mexi, central american and south american nations, mexico, peru, ecuador, live in passaic, new jersey and they use this plaza as their place where they celebrate and sell their goods and so on. So it it's very frequented. This is a proposal that we had talked to gregory and the community about up in harlem at a phillip randolph park. So this is a photo rendering, obviously and again if we would keep the advertising maybe to the department of health and hygiene so that they can communicate with the community about Covid-19 issues and staying safe. And then we could post updates about what's going on in the community and what cb10 is doing in the community and how to reach out to the community. Everybody looks at their emails, but if you're walking by and you see something posted, you might read it when you're at a bus stop and it's a little better way to communicate or not better. But it's an another way to communicate with your community another proposal at morningside park, I mean at roosevelt park up in up by the columbia, presbyterian and cuny. This was an interesting proposal and we're still talking to the city of fort lauderdale about this. They thought of putting them by uber and lyft stations so that everybody would go to a certain location. In other words, if you have a bunch of restaurants and bars, and you clog up the streets with uber and lyft, you want to have plenty of you: wanna have a soul street unit there, so that people can sit there and wait in one designated spot, so we're talking to uber and lyft about partnering with them. In that regard, we can do it in different colors. This is at asbury park. We were gonna place, a bunch in asbury park, but asbury is really being very careful right now, and so we might do some in the fall or next spring again in newark on broad street. This was last summer in east hampton massachusetts, we were posting a lot of the events going on in east, hampton it's a big music town and again in falls river massachusetts. There you can see on the right-hand side what it looks like at night, so it makes the street look a little safer and again our model is we give it to the community and we share the revenues from the advertising. It's a great way for restaurants to post a an advertisement. You know and very cheaply to get a few more you know visitors and so on, so I'd love to have community board 10 consider maybe putting one or two of these around the harlem community. In a spot I mean I made a couple of proposals, but obviously you know you guys decide where you think it would best serve the community where you could communicate the best, but we give it to the community and then we share the revenues with. Maybe the community board right now. Advertising revenues are way down, but we expect them to pick up again, like I showed in one of those slides and as I said, if it doesn't work in that spot, it's not like. We have to deep trench. We can easily move it to another spot, and maybe it works better in that in you know another location. So let me unshare my screen and does anybody have any questions or comments? Yes, lisa I'd just like to ask you who would determine the content free and post Covid-19 of the signage? The community always determines the content. We would never force anything on. You I mean. There's you know, of course you don't want to do you don't want to have you know cigarettes or alcohol because you want to keep it. You know it's near a school zone or whatever absolutely the community always can always. Okay, I just for the sake of allowing other people to speak. I do see that terry has a hand up, but I'm gonna ask barbara, has her hand up and I'll come back to terry, barbara, yes, hi good evening, everyone. I have two questions, one who would maintain the upkeep in terms of cleanliness and wiping it down, especially during covert and people coming and sitting and utilizing it, and the other question is: would it be something that we're looking to only put in the parks like, for instance, jackie robinson? They just did a beautiful renovation. Unfortunately, everybody has birthday parties, cakes whatever, and they leave all the trash all over the place so like how do we? You know that that's a major concern now and at least in my community we've done this beautification, but the community is not respecting the beauty of the spots. No, I hear you if we put one of those things there. You know what could it say as reminders to use the trash receptive? I don't know, but that's my only two questions. Yes, we would, where where's your community exactly you're in Queens at jackie robinson, where is your community in harlem, on bradhurst avenue, jackie robinson park is: oh I'm sorry, yes and block stretch. Yes, so there's a lot of sunlight. There's a lot of community people utilize in the park, so we're talking about putting in putting them in parks. So we talking about just a little like a phillip randolph triangle: are we talking about the larger parts like you can put them wherever you want them, I'm happy to to work with the community it, as you said it may work beautifully and people might respect it and use it and you, you know, like gregory said, if you befriend those people that are doing you know the bad stuff, maybe they begin to understand and respect the you know what you're bringing to them. So we would hire a firm. You know a solar, firm or an advertising firm would come, and would they change the advertising? You know the static advertising, they would make sure it's clean and there's ways. I do have a you know a way to monitor it. If you we wanted to put a a camera attached to it, we could consider that so yes, absolutely you know we would hire a firm to to make sure it's cared for, or you know you might, we might collaborate with a bunch of kids who want to learn about solar and we could have hire some mentors and they can go, make sure it's clean and maybe they have some artwork. They want to display on some of the eating pan on the eating panel. You know we will work with the community to serve the community. I'd just like to ask lisa, would soul street provide them and I maybe would have to develop a memorandum of understanding a contract? Yes, we have a contract that we and you know we just signed a contract with the city of passaic, and you know it clearly establishes our role and what you know. Our responsibilities are, and you know, if you want to remove it, you give us 30 days notice and we'll you know, remove it. If you don't think it's working for your community, you can get out of the contract and there you know I don't want to be in a place where it's not working, because that's not good for anybody, but I think it you know, I think harlem is a, is a great community for it. You have. You have lots of sunshine because you have big wide streets unlike downtown, would you be able to provide us a sample of one of your memorandums absolutely of the contract? Yes, absolutely. Thank you and terry has her hand up. Yes, terry. Would you like to ask your question? Oh hi, teddy. I just wanted to share with everyone good evening. I'm also a resident up near jackie, robinson park, and I share you know barbara's concern, but I do believe that you know us acknowledging to the community that this is something that's owned. You know once we introduce that, then people will take responsibility and wanting to you know to be active participants and clean up behind ourselves, because I know one of the big things up here. I'm on bradford avenue so is the brad herz annual block party, and what just actually made me feel a part of the community was that this was the annual tradition that I saw in a predominantly black community being carried on as a black american that was coming from, I would say the midwest, so I was like oh. This is something that made me feel part of this community. So I think that there's a lot of opportunities with this, but, as you know, karen has said being able to see you know, a draft of what the agreement will look like would help us better draft and understand what the unique needs of harlem would be to always partner with you, because you mentioned you know us being able to have a partnership with schools or about solar power, and things like that. So that's a part of the stem education that you know if you guys are willing to take on that cost. You know and partnering with us, then that would make it more of an incentive for us to have this in our parks, because, right now you know you're saying that you can only do static advertising and we know the way of the way you know is electronic. So you know that would be something we would be interested in. Knowing are you going to head in that direction and then oh, no, we excuse me. We do electronic advertising on the e-ink panel, so there's a 140 by 60 static panel and then the ink panel is about 30 by 40 and that can do electronic advertising, absolutely okay and so in the advertising. You said that the revenue would be a shared revenue. Without I mean. Would this also mean that we would also get to decide? You know like how you did say that we would get to decide like what advertising we decided to take, so we would do all the media buying for it. Well, basically, what we're doing in other communities- and you know I mean- is going around to the local restaurants going along to the local banks, or you know, food stores there in passaic, for instance, there's this wonderful, peruvian food store. That is amazing. It's a really big and that community is largely peruvian and so because of Covid-19 they're doing much better than they usually do, and so now they want to reach out to the community and and share recipes. You know cooking peruvian recipes, so it really highlights local businesses, which is which is so nice. My question was so my question in that would be who gets to set the cost of the advertising, because advertising is a premium. So would it be the community board setting pricing for this advertising that's being offered to local restaurants, and then we decide what the profit share would be between us and you guys or would you it'll all be in the net yeah? Okay, that would all be a contract and obviously right now, advertising rates have gone down quite a bit. You know people can't afford what they used to. But you know that's gonna change. Hopefully you know it'll go up a little bit higher, but the community, the community, decides what the advertiser you know who they are. They you have a right to reject an advertiser, and you know we'll work with you. We want. We want to serve the community, not you know we want to serve the community. That's all thank you and thank you karen. Thank you for your question. Oh you're welcome jerry. You had a, and can we be brief if you have any questions? Yes, this is very interesting and it goes in keeping with this whole digital world that has evolved and just all the creativity that can come from it. So thank you. I definitely would like to know more about it, because what you're doing is the technology and once again we're looking to take our content and move it in lots of ways, and so I think it could. You know be something that's great, even for the entire community, as we try to really build up our businesses and change the paradigm of our community, and I think the time is now you know. So a lot of brilliant minds. So it's about meetings of the minds and thank you karen for bringing together a lot a lot of interesting people. So we look to do more of this. Thank you. Oh you're, wrong. Everybody's information, I'm very interested my mind is saying so. Thank you. You're welcome. Gregory has a question. You had your hand up, gregory, yeah, more of a statement and just well. First of all, I just want to say that you know I don't necessarily speak for the needs of the community at April randolph square, more so than I serve the people's interest, and so I mean at this point I don't think a. I don't think that resource would be useful at a philip randolph square because we're actually trying to move away from benches and other things that attract communities to the space other than using it as a kind of nexus for commuting and the like. So I'm not sure that would work there, and I think when you look at the drawings, it would be helpful for the community board to understand scale, and so you know either you have to have a design that fits into these smaller spaces or you're, going to create areas where people could be where visibility could be blocked. So I noticed that these things work where there is sort of 360 degrees, of open space yeah. The third issue, which is most important and I'm speaking, to the community board and to lisa- and that is, I think, that you have to come particularly to our community district, with more than what you're proposing the fact that you're offering the equipment for free doesn't matter, because we never ask you for the equipment so bringing the community something for free that it doesn't didn't ask for, is not really bringing an asset. It's you know, your orientation is somewhat wrong. The second thing is the avenue the advertising revenue is based on scale, that is to say, your business model is profitable, because you're able to have advertising popping up in a variety of different geographies versus a single geography which may amount to crumbs, let you know, and not even the ends of a loaf of bread. So I think that you might want to think about community benefits proposals. If you're going to bring these types of resources to community district 10, you might want to think about maintenance agreements that not only includes wiping down equipment that could become contaminated, but money for possibly security. Money for maintenance of tree pits near these things, money that deals more with revitalization. That is this thing, must have some outreach beyond the thing itself or you could do just a check, a partnership with somebody like gail brewer, matching funds to capital projects that we need to get done because, right now the parks department is suffering yes, and so it's kind of odd for us to be thinking about propping up equipment in parks that are overrun with weeds overrun with trees, because we don't have staffing. There's a serious budget issue happening in the parks department and this conversation is not consistent with that reality, and so I just think you need to think a little bit more creatively and a little bit more deeply and specifically about the needs of community district 10 when you're thinking about these projects. The last time I spoke to you- and this is my final comment- I did recommend to you that maybe these things would work at NYCHA complexes and I'm not sure why you didn't pursue that path. I don't know if it had anything to do with demographics or whatever, but I do know that there is a desire for that type of equipment in nature, and maybe that might be a better place, but I want to go on the record that it's just not appropriate for April of randolph square at this time. Yes, I have been in touch with parks and I don't see that it's going to be relevant in a lot of parks, because people think of parks as a place where there's not advertising and so on. So it but parks are not the only place where this could be, and I understand completely that you're, not you, don't feel it's appropriate for philip randolph, but it I think it does have relevance in the community and I'm not. I apologize for not pursuing NYCHA we've just been extremely busy, we're upgrading our systems and so on, and I think that's a great suggestion is everybody hearing me, okay and I appreciate all of your input, gregory and but what about? Because I think that barbara and the gentleman who was speaking to you, I think that their underlying argument is was where's. The money where's, the community resource where's the benefit where's, the outreach where's the value if the value resonates. Only in that thing I mean is that it the thing or is there something else? Is there room for community benefits proposals the benefit to the community is an ability to communicate local businesses and local events, and and for it's a place to stop it's a it's an iconic place to stop where people can gather and and see. What's going on in the community, it's just another way to communicate to your community yeah, okay, but it also I'm sorry gregory. It also generates revenue for your business and so what's the benefit to the community, like what does the community get out of having your item placed in our parks or within our community, the current news to communicate what? Whatever you want to communicate emergency messaging about events that are going on community board events to bring more people, get more people involved in the community board. You could post whatever you feel you want to communicate to your community. Okay, I'd just like to say that you know I I think that there I can see benefit in being able and using this facility to to provide the community with information, especially in this time when we have covered- and we have to have social, distancing and- and we have are having issues around that and that we need there's a need to wear masks and that sort of thing yes. So I just like to say if there are no other questions or comments, I'd like to move the agenda along and lisa, you said you would be providing us a copy of a sample contract that you have and- and we would look forward to that. Thank you thank you and thank you for listening. I really appreciate it and you guys are doing a great job. It's wonderful community board! Okay, thank you! So much! Thank you and then moving the agenda along. We don't have quorum at this time, so we just like to get the sentiment of the of the committee members. So if you could do a thumbs up, if you are in favor of voting on moving the following two items to the executive committee, okay, can I get a motion to I'm? Sorry we're not doing I'm sorry if you just have just give me thumbs up that you are in favor of moving these two items along to the executive committee and those two items are considering the installation of this solar soul street, with emergency messaging unit units and also in working with doctor with dr wertham galvin of clemson university on technical urbanism and parks. Did I do I need to make that more clear if you can give a thumbs up if we should move this along to the executive committee. Just let me see your thumbs up. Okay, barbara tahani is here from the and karen dixon, oh, and I can't see your screens. Let me see, let me just take a look here, so karen you're asking if we want to move lisa's project and the tactical urbanism both projects forward to the executive committee, I would like to say that the project that was just presented- I think there are a lot of intricacies. I don't think it's ready for executive committee, yet I would like to see the tactical urbanism move forward. As a matter of fact, when I heard it gregory, I thought immediately about a philip randall square. When I was here- and I was glad to see that you were on the zoom, but I think we need some more information from lisa and also some of it seems like the city or the parks department needs to be the the vehicle that needs to be contacted, as opposed to cb the community board. I mean it's good information for us to know, but I think there's not enough information for us to move forward to executive committee, and that's just my that's my position. Okay, so you're saying yes to sults, yes to tactical urbanism, no to soul street barbara. Yes, I concur with what karen has said. I think there's some more that maybe what she's presenting would do better elsewhere for now, because when we're talking about funding and revenues and sharing the money, I don't think it's something that the community board actually involves ourselves with in terms of pricing. So I'm sort of on the same page as gregory, like maybe some sort of contract with nature would help, because that's where a lot of information can get out to multiple people at one time, but I concur with karen. I like the presentation by bd and I think that we could work together on various areas within our community, not just a philabrando, okay, tahani yeah. I agree with karen and barbara. I think tactical actions should move forward, but in terms of the second agenda or item on the agenda, do we explore it further or are we karen and barbara? Are you saying that it's not something that we should be discussing at further meetings? I do agree that it needs a wider reach and more input, and I don't we don't have quorum. We don't. We also don't have as many people as we usually have on these meetings, but I think this is something that should reach more people. More people should be aware of it and weigh in on it. Okay, honey. I couldn't I'm sorry karen honey. I agree, but, as I wrote in the chat you know, we ended up with these kiosks in our neighborhoods that we didn't ask for they basically do the same thing. Everyone has a smartphone, so we get the alert. So I'm asking what's different, what's going to be different and who's going to monitor it, and will we actually benefit from it versus it just being advertising space exactly yeah? I could see that and it lends itself to the hyper commercialization of our neighborhood as well, and to the extent that our residents are already getting their information from social media and other resources. I don't know how many people would really stop and get information from these places. Okay, sicily, have you had your hand raised for a while? Oh as well with everybody, I do like the presentation from clemson karen. I know we spoke about this before they came, so I kind of already knew a little bit about them, but I do like the project and I see that there is a space where we can maybe partner with them, especially with gregory and his input of what he would see for a philip randolph, and you know that has been a project of ours for a long time. So we would like to see something going on there and I do have to agree about the solar kiosk because it is kind of like our link, NYC plus, as you all were saying, this is probably not the correct form for it, as we do not own in city streets, any parts any land. So we cannot sign any contracts right. So I think maybe if we did want to move it out of committee and then maybe she could come and we could pass it to shatek and he could talk about it at the borough service cabinet, where they can talk about this idea and see if any of those agencies there are interested in it. So she could provide us with a little bit more information, allow shatte to share it at that meeting and then see if anyone at borough service cabinet is interested because that's an agency-wide meeting, so they can, they can have that discussion and really belongs with the city. Okay, thank you all right so and then so we would not be making any. We would make a recommendation if any at the district cabinets meeting. Is that what you're saying so? Should we still ask lisa to send us a the sample she can provide to you and then give it to shatek and we're just going to be a liaison in this situation, because we don't have enough information to really like recommend it. However, it does sound like a good project for some agency that could take it on. So we don't want to take that away right from folks. That might want to be a part of that, but right now we as wars cannot really wait on that, but we would okay and I just like to say I do feel that we do need to have more signage at this time, especially since we have people who are not wearing masks who are not social distancing I mean there are, I mean, there's a large population that is not adhering and we're about to go into the flu season which this, which would cause this virus or the virus could escalate during that time. So I think we do need more communication out in the community to let people know that this is serious and that you know they need to be adhering to what the regulations that are being asked to ask that they're being asked to concur with and the beauty the beauty of seoul street. Is that it's solar? You don't have to deep trench for the signage. It's a beautiful. You know. I understand your concern. You don't want to add too much. You know commercialization to your community and we could try something as a pilot project. We would be willing to put it there for 60 days or 30 days and then remove it. If you know, if you, if there's a lot of objections, but we're just asking for you to you know, give it a try. I I understand that you know you love your community and you want to be very careful about every decision. Okay, thank you. You're welcome all right, so I will provide a contract and then what do you suggest? How can I give you more information? What more information we should communicate tomorrow? Okay, all right! Thank you all right. Thank you very much lisa. So with that we'll move on to old business. I'd just like to just be very briefly because we are over time very pleased to let you know that colonel young playground is being considered as a capital project, so we've got to they'll, be getting back to us with more information, so we may have that whole project moving along, which is to upgrade the ball field so that it's a multi-disciplinary sport field. So that's really exciting. That's been a couple of years, four to five years in the works. So that was exciting, also, there's still opportunity to provide feedback for the harlem river waterfront vision, 2020 plan. So we need to develop a survey to get out, so we can get some feedback from the community and there's also opportunity to have input on the repurposing of the brownfield which is at located at I believe it's 155th street, but I will if someone would like to support in developing survey, questions that would be great and you could just afford them to me through the email and I believe with that is old business, and is there any new business at this time, aaron yeah in this meeting I didn't see her anyway. No, she isn't okay, she's, not in the meeting, so we were looking for her to provide updates, but we were expecting her, but she wasn't able to make it any new business at this time. Can't I'm sorry karen. I did send an email to try to get something on the agenda, but in the essence of time, right now can I just email you and maybe it could be on the agenda for the next meeting. Well, I did take a look at your email, I'm sorry. I wasn't able to get back to you, it's okay, but it's you're, asking about people who are congregating alongside the perimeter of the park right yeah that whole stretch between 100 110th street that you've got a lot of folks there who seem to be almost invisible to everyone there and they're presenting with lots of different needs like alcohol, like drugs like homelessness, and I was hoping that we could at least have some discussion about what those needs are what's being done, if anything, but my fear is that they're gonna absolutely get gregory said they're gonna be asked, they're gonna be moved out if, in fact those needs aren't addressed- and I was hoping it was something that we could at least begin to discuss in our committee. I don't know if it's the appropriate committee, maybe it's someplace else, but I did want to raise it yeah. I think I'm thinking you know that could be public safety. Anybody else want to make a suggestion. I don't wanna. I hear I hear that I did think about it, but I didn't want to sort of stereotype those members of our community who are there as a public safety issue. I think it's an unmet needs issue. From my perspective I mean we talked about that lincoln facility being closed, and I understand that that's happening, but people who, for whatever reason, were served by that center still visit that area. That strip you know, and so I there may be plans that are there to meet those needs. I don't know I just wanted to know in this committee. Can we begin to do outreach to discuss what those needs are if any and if they're being met, if any, okay, and then also do was, would that be something we could take up in district? The district cabinet meeting, because it's mostly the you know the problems are multiple. Okay might be something, for instance, homeless services, almost dhs karen, yes, gregory there is a group, and I'm sure all of you are aware of the group of the greater harlem coalition that was focusing initially on structure, treatment facilities and it looks like they're now. Moving into homelessness and other issues, it's a very diverse group- I will say it's: you know new people in collaboration with long-term homeowners and long-term residents in harlem they're, trying to be as empathetic about these issues as possible. You know, I don't know if that is the cup of tea, but I do know it's a group of people that has political clout, has the attention of all the electeds and they're dealing with those issues gregory. What's the name of the group? Again, it's the greater harlem okay, I'm sure sicily knows about them, or I'm sure sicily and strategic knows about them: okay, I'll reach out to siddique and also sicily, to follow up okay. So if it needs to be, if there's something that this committee can provide, we would be glad to do so. Thank you. Karen oh you're. Welcome one more thing: karen, do you know that the barbara askins and see virginia fields is doing this street cleaning? Yes yeah, so one of the things we we've done is we've realized that the street cleaning also includes cleaning around the parks, and so I just wanted to let you know that we're now, including the parks as part of the street cleaning process and things are really bad. You know in the parks, it's a bad situation. You know we it's a bad situation in terms of a lot of services, particularly for our small green spaces. So there is a real need for volunteers. I know the community board got out there and painted the black lives matter, so maybe there might be more interest in participating in cleaning up the area. Okay, I could also put in a call and to steve- and let him know that you know there's some concerns about this area. Yes, but be careful because then we could get hit with safety, PPE social distancing, so I'm trying to avoid the bureaucracy, but I'm letting you know what's going on. You know what I'm saying so: we're cleaning around the parks and not in the parks. Okay, well sheena should know about that yeah, but the maintenance is not what it should be in the park. Okay. Well, thank you gregory! Yes, barbara! Karen, I'm sorry! If you could get word to sheena or steve in regards to the beautiful work they just did at 153rd street, the garbage bills are terribly overrun. The garbage is so bad over there. I don't care what time of day you go because I'm out early and I'm out late with the dog there's a stretch that comes from the amphitheater down to where the traffic cars come in when they have events there, that there are no trash receptacles, there are there's no garbage calls back there, there's actually one. So people are not picking up behind their animals. It's just really a bad look, that's always used, and so teddy, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about and a lot of people over here own dogs, it's not nice, oh okay, all right so I'll put in a call- and thank you thank you, you're done about that. So are there any announcements so hearing none? Could I get a motion to adjourn hold on tomorrow morning? Those of us that are going on the exonerated five walk research and development at nine o'clock. We're going to be meeting at one tenth and fifth avenue, and I know ms salam is going to join us and whoever else- and we decided to do two days because everybody wanted to get an opportunity so the next day that we're going to go on the walk is going to be saturday morning at the same entrance at 8, 30 and I'm committed to taking some pictures and whoever else and then we'll come back and see what we found. So this is so exciting, so exciting and we've made a lot of progress with the exonerated five task force. Most of you have been on it, so you know what's going on so we're moving right along, we did the three public panel discussions for outreach, community outreach and the panels were diverse and we're now developing a statement of objectives and goals. So we are moving that along and we'll. Let you know when the next subcommittee meeting will be, but that statement will be circulated for people's review and comment and that would be going to central park for presentation to central park conservancy in new york city parks, so any other announcements. Okay, can I get a motion to adjourn? Don't move a motion to adjourn the meeting? Okay, the motion to adjourn has been made and properly seconded, and so I'd like to say the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. So much good night.
