, I'm lisa smith, founder and creative manager of soul street, and we do solar charging benches And I'm the historian for the central park, conservancy And I'm, going to do a brief update on our project about seneca village in central park.
You know: we've been working on various projects around the history of seneca village , That's in central park, there's a total of about 20 signs scattered around the landscape of seneca village, and we installed those in October of 2019, and this is a temporary exhibit.
We wanted to put something in the landscape and really get people to start to learn about the history of seneca village, and so we did this signage exhibit, which originally had the duration of one year, because that's typically what you can do in central park, which is a landmark you know, without having to go through a lot of regulatory permissions.
It's a great way to explore the history of seneca village, so also thinking about the fact that a lot of people can't get to the park right.
You know about the descendants and have we been able to find people and figure out what happened to seneca village after people were forced to leave, and so that is one big area of research We made a little video about the work and research of celedonia jones, who was used to be the Manhattan borough historian and is involved very closely in all of the work that's been done in seneca village I was thinking.
He was the first one that was able to read and write, invest in other different things as well and continue to be a property owner, and so after andrew williams, number, two andrew williams, number three was a very educated person, a musician as well, and actually traveled the world and attended what is now columbia's music school today My grandfather started a security business that my father worked with him on and they're.
What is really meaningful is to find a family in a time when it was very difficult for blacks to survive, let alone free and to see someone who was taking care of his family working and saving his money and always showing sense of things being in the park where andrew williams house was located.
We wanted to do something kind of quickly and the idea behind again the sort of process for something permanent is that we would get people out there, exploring the history learning the history and that we could all kind of come together to have a dialogue about something permanent, that's rooted in a in a deeper understanding of seneca village and its history.
Think it's important to you know understand the fact that we never thought of this specific exhibit as permanent, and It's 20 signs, 20 signs throughout central park in various locations.
You know and we're making more people aware of it by the fact that it's in the park, now , The idea of the exhibit was to first educate a much broader cross-section of the public about this history.
We could have a really energetic dialogue about the importance of this history, and the hope is that would lead to a really good process, discussion about what would be an appropriate form of permanent commemoration within the historic landmark of the park, which is, as you know, marie suggested.
It has a particular function which is creating dialogue, but what it is about is how do we have enough people understand Both, the history and the park, to contribute to what's, hopefully like a really meaningful discussion about permanent commemoration?
I. Think one of the things that we want to start to have a little bit of dialogue about is examples and ideas of how other places have commemorated important events in very specific sites in a way I.
Think one of the things we would like to do is start to broaden the ideas of what's possible and what goes into coming up with a unique, meaningful, site-specific solution to something like how do we commemorate seneca village?
We would like to make sure we're partnering with some other institutions that can maybe help us help us organize this and bring the right people into the discussion and to help us help.
We have to kind of use our mind's eye to kind of imagine what it looks like, but you can actually go to weeksville and see actual houses, and So. This idea of thinking about black history and the places that it was happening, Yes, I, think we expel is a great resource and they're really important collaborators and possible.
Most people didn't wouldn't know what you're talking about most of us do, and it's actually not necessarily because of the pandemic specifically, but I would argue because of the black lives matter, movement that had a resurgence.
Tactical urbanism has also inspired outdoor and dining, whether it's cities rethinking their current approval, processes, which is the lower right in tampa, Florida, d-mapping, and closing some streets- And you know, new york city, actually has a long history of that with the play streets program where you can apply for permits to close streets for play.
Right we're starting to see how people are sort of either taping out or painting out safe space and social distancing in places that used to not have it so that we can continue public activities but understand what our physical parameters might be tactical in the in the bottom.
They go away and you never see them again, but many of them have become long-term infrastructures that have allowed people to change the way they see or occupy the public spaces in their communities.
This feels like a way to start to occupy space that doesn't feel like it's being hyper, controlled and regulated, even though it is as opposed to you know, people in uniforms and with signs and looking a little bit threatening that this feels like maybe a more gracious way to return.
Is that not only would it potentially be helpful for you, but I think in terms of dissemination, it might you know, be breaking some new ground, since most of the work to date has really focused more on hardscape, streetscape vacant, lots, etc.
If you were really interested in seeing what your own constituents would want to have happened this it's called a demonstration project guide right, so you know it introduces people to tactical urbanism.
Everything you're, saying, is sort of exactly what I'm talking about, and certainly one of those bullet points under the attributes is sometimes there's an existing project that you can't do right, because the money either politically or financially- If you all identify specific areas or locations that you know, a project, has stalled that we can look at them and take them on to show how we could do a tactical version of that to prime the pump.
It happened, because the people in the community actually befriended the people who were abusing the park, And I, guess to some degree the more they got to know.
So, a lot of places with more mild climates, tend, I think, have higher homeless populations, and there was a lot of handwringing about it by the city in terms of permitting and also by the university, because you know, students would be working on this project.
When we did this project, I said I think we can work with the homeless, community.
Is, that working with populations that people often think of as negative and want to get rid of, and do they just need?
You, know a human face to actually talk to them right and figure out how they can feel like they're productively, contributing to that project.
Sure, I think this might be a great project for a phillip, randolph square, and perhaps we can, if you know, if gregory's group, is amenable to that, and then also look at selecting two other parks as well.
Okay, yes, I'm, unmuted, great presentation and love to connect her with a public color who is a an organization, a friend of mine, where the students re-uh imagine, schools and fix them and paint them,, so Street I met with gregory several months ago, and we talked about this for maybe some parts of the harlem community we are last year we had a presentation in times square, but the thing that's really wonderful about us is we have this ink panel and the ink panel is a message.
In a spot I mean I made a couple of proposals, but obviously you know you guys decide where you think it would best serve the community where you could communicate the best, but we give it to the community Maybe the community board right now.
As you said, it may work beautifully and people might respect it and use it and you, you know, like gregory said.
I'd just like to ask lisa,: would soul street provide them You don't think it's working for your community.
Would it be the community board setting pricing for this advertising that's being offered to local restaurants, and then we decide what the profit share would be between us and you guys or You know people can't afford what they used.
First of all, I just want to say that you know I, don't necessarily speak for the needs of the community at April, randolph square, more so than I serve the people's interest, I.
Don't think that resource would be useful at a philip randolph square because we're actually trying to move away from benches and other things that attract communities to the space other than using it as a kind of nexus for commuting and the like.
Think When you look at the drawings, it would be helpful for the community board to understand scale, and You know either you have to have a design that fits into these smaller spaces or You 're, going to create areas where people could be where visibility could be.
I did recommend to you that maybe these things would work at NYCHA complexes and , don't see that it's going to be relevant in a lot of parks, because people think of parks as a place where there's not advertising and so on.
I, think that there I can see benefit in being able and using this facility to to provide the community with information, especially in this time when we have covered- And, we have to have social, distancing, and, If there are no other questions or comments, I'd like to move the agenda along and lisa, I really appreciate it and you guys are doing a great job.
And I, just like to say I, do feel that we do need to have more signage at this time, especially since we have people who are not wearing masks who are not social, distancing, I, mean, there's a large population that is not adhering So I think we do need more communication out in the community to let people know that this is serious and that you know they need to be adhering to what the regulations that are being asked to ask that they're being asked to concur with and the beauty the beauty of seoul street.
I wasn't able to get back to you, it's okay, but it's you're, asking about people who are congregating alongside the perimeter of the park right That whole stretch between 100 110th street that you've got a lot of folks there who seem to be almost invisible to everyone.
Let you know that we're now, including the parks as part of the street cleaning process and things are really bad.
