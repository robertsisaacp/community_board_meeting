, I'm Lisa Smith, founder and creative manager of Soul Street, and we do solar charging benches I'm going to do a brief update on our project about seneca village in central Park.
You know: we've been working on various projects around the history of Seneca village , That's in central park, there's a total of about 20 signs scattered around the landscape of seneca village, and we installed those in October of 2019, and this is a temporary exhibit.
We wanted to put something in the landscape and really get people to start to learn about the history of seneca village, and so we did this signage exhibit, which originally had the duration of one year, because that's typically what you can do in central park, which is a landmark you know, without having to go through a lot of regulatory permissions.
It's a great way to explore the history of seneca village, so also thinking about the fact that a lot of people can't get to the park right.
You know about the descendants and have we been able to find people and figure out what happened to seneca village after people were forced to leave, and so that is one big area of research We made a little video about the work and research of Celedonia Jones, who was used to be the Manhattan borough historian and is involved very closely in all of the work that's been done in seneca village I would share this video that we put together about the Williams family and essentially the work to locate his descendants.
What is really meaningful is to find a family in a time when it was very difficult for blacks to survive, let alone free and to see someone who was taking care of his family working and saving his money and always showing sense of things being in the park where Andrew Williams House was located, was really a little bit overwhelming in a good way that so many people would be interested in learning more about my story and about my family and our involvement with seneca village and where we went after that and what happened after that?
We wanted to do something kind of quickly and the idea behind again the sort of process for something permanent is that we would get people out there, exploring the history learning the history and that we could all kind of come together to have a dialogue about something permanent, that's rooted in a in a deeper understanding of seneca village and its history.
You know, I think, we're still a bit in the phase of really trying to get people grounded in the history.
The lions family was a family who owned property in seneca village, but they did not live there, but is a monument really an appropriate commemoration, so I feel like we just have a lot of things to still kind of talk about a little bit.
I. Think it's important to you know understand the fact that we never thought of this specific exhibit as permanent, and I.
You know and we're making more people aware of it by the fact that it's in the park, now, But, I, know, there's a real, interesting permanent interest in permanent communicat commemoration and The idea of the exhibit was to first educate a much broader, cross- section of the public about this history.
We could have a really energetic dialogue about the importance of this history, and the hope is that would lead to a really good process discussion about what would be an appropriate form of permanent commemoration within the historic landmark of the park, which is, as you know, Marie, suggested.
It has a particular function which is creating dialogue, but what it is about is how do we have enough people understand Both, the history and the park, to contribute to what's, hopefully like a really meaningful discussion about permanent commemoration?
I. Think one of the things that we want to start to have a little bit of dialogue about is examples and ideas of how other places have commemorated important events in very specific sites in a way An art selection process is definitely an upcoming step.
We would like to make sure we're partnering with some other institutions that can maybe help us help us organize this and bring the right people into the discussion and to help us help.
We have to kind of use our mind's eye to kind of imagine what it looks like, but you can actually go to Weeksville and see actual houses, and This idea of thinking about black history and the places that it was happening, Yes, I, think we expel is a great resource and they're really important collaborators and possible.
What I thought I would do is just do a very brief explanation of what tactical urbanism is show some examples of how cities are applying those methods during the pandemic and then end by talking about the what this might mean for parks, some critical questions that I think it raises, and also some ways to talk.
Tactical urbanism has also inspired outdoor and dining, whether it's cities rethinking their current approval, processes, which is the lower right in Tampa, Florida, D- mapping and closing some streets, and you know, New York City actually has a long history of that with the play streets program where you can apply for permits to close streets for play.
Right we're starting to see how people are sort of either taping out or painting out safe space and social distancing in places that used to not have it so that we can continue public activities but understand what our physical parameters might be tactical in the in the bottom.
They go away and you never see them again, but many of them have become long- term infrastructures that have allowed people to change the way they see or occupy the public spaces in their communities.
This is a design that has been proposed for a response to the pandemic in Vienna Austria that is maze- Trying to you, know, make sure that people are sort of individually going through it.
That does not feel like it's being hyper, controlled and regulated, even though it is as opposed to you know, people in uniforms and with signs and looking a little bit threatening that this feels like maybe a more gracious way to return.
Is that not only would it potentially be helpful for you, but I think in terms of dissemination, it might you know, be breaking some new ground, since most of the work to date has really focused more on hardscape, streetscape vacant, lots, etc.
If you were really interested in seeing what your own constituents would want to have happened this it's called a demonstration project guide right, so you know it introduces people to tactical urbanism.
Everything, you're saying, is sort of exactly what I'm talking about, and certainly one of those bullet points under the attributes is sometimes there's an existing project that you can't do right, because the money either politically or financially- But, if you all identify specific areas or locations that you know, a project, has stalled that we can look at them and take them on to show how we could do a tactical version of that to prime the pump.
So, a lot of places with more mild climates, tend, I think, have higher homeless populations, and there was a lot of handwringing about it by the city in terms of permitting and also by the university, because you know, students would be working on this project.
The next time he focused on the kids who were making play out of non- playground, equipment like they were finding old barrels and turning them in into play, and so he was He looked at the elders in the community and When we did this project, I said I think we can work with the homeless, community.
Is, that working with populations that people often think of as negative and want to get rid of, and do they just need?
You, know a human face to actually talk to them right and figure out how they can feel like they're productively, contributing to that project.
So, and I, think that you know at this time, we also need to incorporate the social distancing in whatever it is that we're doing We want to move the agenda.
I, met with gregory several months ago, and we talked about this for maybe some parts of the Harlem community we are last year we had a presentation in Times Square, but the thing that's really wonderful about us is: We have this ink panel and the ink panel is a message.
I have two questions, one who would maintain the upkeep in terms of cleanliness and wiping it down, especially during Covid-19 and people coming and sitting and utilizing it, and the other question is: Would it be something that we're looking to only put in the parks like, for instance, Jackie, Robinson?
There's a lot of community people utilize in the park, so we're talking about putting in putting them in parks.
As you said, it may work beautifully and people might respect it and use it and you, you know, like gregory said.
We might collaborate with a bunch of kids who want to learn about solar We could have hire some mentors and they can go, Make sure it's clean You know we will work with the community to serve the community.
You, know, I think Harlem is a, is a great community for it.
Would it be the Community board setting pricing for this advertising that's being offered to local restaurants, and then we decide what the profit share would be between us and you guys or You know people can't afford what they used.
I. Definitely would like to know more about it, because what you're doing is the technology and once again we're looking to take our content and move it in lots of ways, and so I think it could.
Just want to say that you know I do not necessarily speak for the needs of the community at April, Randolph square, more so than I serve the people's interest, and I do not think that resource would be useful at a Philip, Randolph Square, because we're actually trying to move away from benches and other things that attract communities to the space other than using it as a kind of nexus for commuting and the like.
Think You know either you have to have a design that fits into these smaller spaces or You 're, going to create areas where people could be where visibility could be.
And I do not see that it's going to be relevant in a lot of parks, because people think of parks as a place where there's not advertising and so on.
It also generates revenue for your business So, what's the benefit to the community, like what does the community get out of having your item placed in our parks or within our community, the current news to communicate what, whatever you want to communicate emergency messaging about events that are going on community board events to bring more people, get more people involved in the community board?
I, think that there I can see, benefit in being able and using this facility to to provide the community with information, especially in this time when we have covered- And, we have to have social, distancing, and, So I, just like to say if there are no other questions or comments, I'd like to move the agenda along and Lisa, I really appreciate it and you guys are doing a great job.
But I think we need some more information from Lisa and also some of it seems like the city or the Parks.
But I think there's not enough information for us to move forward to executive committee, and that's just my I think there's some more that maybe what she's presenting would do better elsewhere for now, because when we're talking about funding and revenues and sharing the money, I, do not think it's something that the Community Board actually involves ourselves with in terms of pricing, so I'm sort of on the same page as gregory, like maybe some sort of contract with nature would help, because that's where a lot of information can get out to multiple people at one time, but I concur with Karen And I think that we could work together on various areas within our community, not just a philabrando, okay, tahani I.
I was not able to get back to you, it's okay, but it's you're, asking about people who are congregating alongside the perimeter of the park right That whole stretch between 100 110Th street that you've got a lot of folks there who seem to be almost invisible to everyone.
Let you know that we're now, including the parks as part of the street cleaning process and things are really bad.
