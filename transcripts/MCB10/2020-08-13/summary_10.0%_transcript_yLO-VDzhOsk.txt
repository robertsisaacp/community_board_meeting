I'm lisa smith, founder and creative manager of soul street, and we do solar charging benches and I'm the historian for the central park, conservancy and I 'm, going to do a brief update on our project about seneca village in central park The director of the resilient urban design program for the clemson design center located in charleston Everyone I'm stephanie palmer, a community board 10 member and I see lane is on hi elaine Would you just make a production central park conservancy with marie Well, maybe it'll come on eventually welcome lane good to see you I'm a potential resident to the harlem area and I just wanted to be a part of this community board.
We wanted to put something in the landscape and really get people to start to learn about the history of seneca village, and so we did this signage exhibit, which originally had the duration of one year, because that's typically what you can do in central park, which is a landmark you know, without having to go through a lot of regulatory permissions and again we wanted to do something quick and accessible You know, in light of the pandemic, limiting the ability of people to get to the park and see the exhibit Obviously.
Obviously I know it's still hard for some people to get to the park, but we're going to do another round of promotion of this Just to really let people know that it's here and if they can get to the park, it's a great way to explore the history of seneca village, so also thinking about the fact that a lot of people can't get to the park right now, So they deal with the updates and the tech support, and so the cultural institution doesn't have to and I think something really important to think about, because again, apps are not something that everyone can do.
It starts with central park, new york city right being the first I'm, seeing just the first, the first shot, Okay I think this is it then seneca village was a community of african-american irish and german immigrants that existed in the 19th century, In an area that was known as the free park area.
He got paid, two thousand three hundred and thirty five hours in april of 56 and by junior of 56 He had purchased land in newtown, so as a man that he didn't waste any time through kind of my studies and my understanding of the williams family from all the research that I've done, we were very resourceful people and with this new land, he was able to really start to invest in angie williams, number two's education He was the first one that was able to read and write, invest in other different things as well and continue to be a property owner, and so after andrew williams, number two andrew williams, number three was a very educated person, a musician as well, and actually traveled the world and attended what is now columbia's music school today My grandfather started a security business that my father worked with him on and they're.
In a time when it was very difficult for blacks to survive, let alone free and to see someone who was taking care of his family working and saving his money and always showing sense of things being in the park where andrew williams house was located, was really a little bit overwhelming in a good way that so many people would be interested in learning more about my story and about my family and our involvement with seneca village and where we went after that and what happened after that?
It can have a profound effect on who we are, as people now I feel very connected to not only my father, but my family I understand the pride behind my name and understand where I came from and the traits that I took from those people and why my father was the way he is and why I am who I am today and then we'll open it up to our other guests and I'd, just like to say that the family photos, the video was beautiful , We wanted to get people out there to really be able to explore the history and doing something permanent As you know within central park is a little complicated and mostly it's just that it's time consuming right We wanted to do something kind of quickly and the idea behind again the sort of process for something permanent is that we would get people out there, exploring the history learning the history and that we could all kind of come together to have a dialogue about something permanent, that's rooted in a in a deeper understanding of seneca village and its history You know I think we're still a bit in the phase of really trying to get people grounded in the history.
and we're making more people aware of it by the fact that it's in the park now , the idea of the exhibit was to first educate a much broader cross-section of the public about this history We could have a really energetic dialogue about the importance of this history, and the hope is that would lead to a really good process discussion about what would be an appropriate form of permanent commemoration within the historic landmark of the park, which is, as you know, marie suggested.
It has a particular function, which is creating dialogue, but what it is about is how do we have enough people understand both the you know, both the history and the park, to contribute to what's, hopefully like a really meaningful discussion about permanent commemoration?
I think one of the things that we want to start to have a little bit of dialogue about is examples and ideas of how other places have commemorated important events in very specific sites.
So I don't see anyone on from the seneca village project, but we need to make them aware that, are they aware that they need to do these statements and start to initiate in an art selection process with that we'll move on to our next agenda item, which is tactical urbanism and parts So I presented a talk at a virtual conference in june on tactical urbanism and how it has in informed a lot of cities, responses to the pandemic To that end, what I thought I would do is just do a very brief explanation of what tactical urbanism is show some examples of how cities are applying those methods during the pandemic and then end by talking about the what this might mean for parks, some critical questions that I think it raises, and also some ways to talk about.
It allows us to push on business as usual and rethink our physical infrastructure as it can and should support our social capital, and what you're seeing here are some images from a report produced It was sponsored by natto and bloomberg and was primarily done by street plans, which is this design collaborative you're, seeing a visualization of what might happen to a street as well As. You know some of the key sort of you know elements of this particular envisioning for street redesign during the pandemic We want to rethink, think things during the pandemic that we can do so now, Here's a moment of levity, because I know that we've all had a very serious set of months in the past five months.
Florida d-mapping and closing some streets, and you know, new york city actually has a long history of that with the play streets program where you can apply for permits to close streets for play, you know right in cincinnati, ohio reclaiming parking spaces to start to carve out space for outdoor dining right, we're starting to see how people are sort of either taping out or painting out safe space and social distancing in places that used to not have it so that we can continue public activities but understand what our physical parameters might be tactical in the in the bottom right, where you see dallas texas, They built these racks to provide food to get this excess inventory into the hands of people who might need it right that's not out anymore, because that was a moment to respond to the large sort of excess of food supplies that restaurants had at the beginning of the pandemic and I put in red community building and catalyzing long-term change and I did that for two reasons: one, because I think community building's at the heart of it If it's not with people and understanding how people want to occupy the spaces in their own neighborhoods.
This feels like a way to start to occupy space that doesn't feel like it's being hyper, controlled and regulated, even though it is as opposed to you know, people in uniforms and with signs and looking a little bit threatening that this feels like maybe a more gracious way to return and what's interesting, is that most of them tend to be urban infrastructure focused and by that I mean streetscapes parking spaces vacant lots, Those types of things very few of them, like the one that you see here at domino park tend to be park focused, in other words, usually it's about turning spaces into parks like the parking space example, which is called parking day or if it's made permanent It's called a park lit right.
That's an idea of turning a parking space into a park, but you know after I, spoke to karen and I realized that there's been very little focus on parks themselves There's very few examples: I mean even in my own work, I've only done one that was specifically park, related At. The time I was living in portland oregon and we had an nea grant and we were partnering with a group called the black portlanders who are a group of black artists, and we designed and built a porch where discussions and demonstrations of black art could be made manifest, as well as black contributions to portland, which is often seen as a very white city, and it was temporary I always ask myself for home and by whom is this being instigated right, be being very clear about who's developing the idea?
If you were really interested in seeing what your own constituents would want to have happened this it's called a demonstration project guide right, so you know it introduces people to tactical urbanism.
It can be general principles like the pandemic guide that bloomberg and street collective produced So. We could also give you a guide about how to engage with the community in sort of these new and different creative ways to solicit feedback, or even if you have an area, and you have four different ideas- You know what is going to truly really feel about what they want to see happen at this space.
The porch that we built the temporary porch we built with the black portlanders in portland in this park was a park that was, you know, had a high population of homeless in it, either with mental health problems or with drug issues, which is very common in portland, because it's a mild climate right, So, a lot of places with more mild climates tend I, think have higher homeless populations, and there was a lot of handwringing about it by the city in terms of permitting and also by the university, because you know, students would be working on this project and I convinced them that if we didn't try and they wanted to force all of the sort of homeless.
Sure I think this might be a great project for a phillip randolph square, and perhaps we can, if you know, if gregory's group is amenable to that, and then also look at selecting two other parks as well, and we want to move the agenda along.
So I think that there's a lot of opportunities with this, but, as you know, karen has said being able to see you know, a draft of what the agreement will look like would help us better draft and understand what the unique needs of harlem would be to always partner with you, because you mentioned you know us being able to have a partnership with schools or about solar power and things like that That's a part of the stem education that you know if you guys are willing to take on that cost, and you know I mean- is going around to the local restaurants going along to the local banks, or you know, food stores there in passaic It's a really big and that community is largely peruvian and so because of Covid-19 they're doing much better than they usually do, and so now they want to reach out to the community and and share recipes.
Randolph square, more so than I serve the people's interest and so I don't think that resource would be useful at a philip randolph square because we're actually trying to move away from benches and other things that attract communities to the space other than using it as a kind of nexus for commuting and the like, When you look at the drawings, it would be helpful for the community board to understand scale, and so you know either you have to have a design that fits into these smaller spaces or you're, going to create areas where people could be where visibility could be blocked.
But I want to go on the record that it's just not appropriate for april of randolph square at this time and I don't see that it's going to be relevant in a lot of parks, because people think of parks as a place where there's not advertising and so on.
So I'm sort of on the same page as gregory, like maybe some sort of contract with nature, would help, because that's where a lot of information can get out to multiple people at one time, but I concur with karen and I think that we could work together on various areas within our community, I think tactical actions should move forward, but in terms of the second agenda or item on the agenda, do we explore it further or are we karen and barbara?
I hear I hear that I did think about it, but I didn't want to sort of stereotype those members of our community who are there as a public safety issue, I mean we talked about that lincoln facility being closed and I understand that that's happening, but people who, for whatever reason, were served by that center still visit that area.
