Just in case I did not mention that the chair of CB10 there was a lot going on that we found it necessary to continue to meet in July and August to continue serving the community.
We did not stop this summer, so we were continuing to meet and trying to serve the community through our committees.
And I'm sure that there are other board members and members of the community who will say the same thing that was amazing, chairman as a resident of Linux terrace, when I heard people screaming from 470 all the way down with all the commotion, I said to my dolman.
If, if you get a text from so thank you so much for doing for being here today and for letting us have this discussion with you and for all of the wonderful things you do, and I was just able to read a news article about it And You all were right on it and so prepared, and we just thank you for all of your work every day for keeping us safe, and I do not know if people say it enough, but you are definitely one of our local heroes that when we are clapping for all those medical professionals, we are also cropping for all those first responders, and I know that it's died down at seven o'clock that people do not do it as much, but we do need to keep that spirit in our heart.
Do, not brian good job, Even you know during the time of Covid-19 and the unfortunate reality of things now not being in person or trying to now work.
You know fire safety is always a year- round topic We look forward to working with the Community board and community residents, as well.
October is fire prevention month, and it's something that we would like to see within the coming month of stressing that message and potentially working with the board for the uptown community of Harlem.
That would like to say a few words or a representative of an elected official sure I can talk about a couple things that are coming up in the public advocates office.
We are doing another meeting on NYCHA this one night, not just Nigel but affordable housing, but focusing on Nigel we're going to be talking about alternative preservation, strategies, rent to own and other methods to preserve, affordable, housing, develop, affordable housing, so that folks, who live in our communities can stay in them and so that folks, living in niger could have a better quality of life.
The last thing I want to mention is our team is trying to get the D.A out there throughout the community more talking to groups engaging with different members.
If you are interested in, you know having conversations with the Da if you're having public safety conversations and then want to include the D.A. I'll, leave my contact information in the Chat box.
Everyone, welcome back in September, so I have two things: one: The New York City Controller Scott Stringer, along with Congress member Esbayad, State Senator, Brian, Benjamin, City, Councilman, Bill, perkins, 125Th, Street, Bid, Barbara askins, a host of a lot of community leaders on 125Th Street, the congressman and the Controller have wrote a letter about the increasing the increasing of too much trash and was trying to get a lot of buy- in from the city to restore some of the funding back to sanitation.
It was the assuming men, interacting with the community, making sure that folks had what they needed and staying safe and also just making sure that you know they knew that his office was present and was there to address issues and the last day for the peace walks is September.
Thank you and again thank Brian Benjamin's office for the protect the block campaign that a lot of the elected officials and the Community board have adopted.
I know we may have missed a few committee meetings, but the diligence and the fortitude to push on throughout everything going on and to be of service to the community.
Until we address the disparities in economics in the community, so we were out there with street corner resources occupying the corner with Assemblyman Al Taylor, Manhattan Bro, president Gail Brewer , We were out there, I believe at least four to five times this summer and many times more than that with street Corner Reese's talking to the to the young people, we were at the mayor's meeting that they had for the young people at the community center here off of Lenox Avenue.
We were constantly out there constantly trying to address the issues that are so plaguing our community Now we passed out masks at a lot of these impromptu parties that we've been seeing popping up over the summer.
Thank Brian, Benjamin and Shauna and Christina, and a lot of the community members Larry Blackman for getting together and doing the protect your street campaign.
I want to publicly thank Karen Orry and the Parks Committee for their diligence for having those walks for having those conversations, not just in the committee meetings but outside talking to the parks, Department, and really pushing it forward of what we want to see What really reflects our community?
Really we want to put out there and actually bringing in those folks that in most effects and talking about disenfranchisement and all those things will be a part of what is manifested through the CB10 initiative around I also wanted to thank the health committee for all that they're doing or they're talking about sanitation, which has been extremely vital to our community, but also addressing the nursing home issue that we've had and we'll hear from Dr dukes on that and finally, again, I'd want to thank Barbara Askins and their cleanup team on 125Th Street.
I might want to commend our community board members for working over the summer as well, by holding their zoom meetings online, also want to thank our community assistant, Miss Juanita Anderson for all of our hard work, because there's a lot of correspondence that needs to go out They can be a tough job trying to keep up with everything.
There said that Jayvon allegedly tried to chase a drug dealer off of the street and he was fatally shot in the neck in broad daylight, just after 3 P.M. At, this point, we do not have all of the details, but I look forward to following up with the 28th present in regards to issues at this location in particular, as well as issues that have been a continued nuisance to residents around a phillip, Randolph Square on 116Th Street in regards to public safety, drugs and drug trafficking.
When we reconvene in two weeks throughout the summer months, we have seen many issues in our community around gun, violence, drug enforcement, noise and sanitation, concerns, and I hope that, even with the reduction in the city's budget that we can come together to work towards fixing the most pressing issues and complaints on a brighter note, I'm happy to report that, after many months of trying to get NYPD to start Pac to stop parking in front of the bus, stop in front of Psa 6 on Frederick Douglas Boulevard, the mayor's office.
In response to that, many constituents and community organizations have started the Harlem Cleanup initiative, like cicely mentioned earlier.
Last week, myself, along with board members, Deneen, Brown, Blackman and Joshua Clennan towards small businesses in our district with Manhattan bro president Gail Brewer and uptown director, Athena Moore handing out face, masks and hand sanitizers and getting feedback from business owners all the way from 130Th Street down 112th street from Malcolm X to Frederick.
We would normally, at this time, be talking about elections that will happen in November, so I was able to attend a presentation by the Parliamentary Association of New York that was put on by the Manhattan presence office.
Let you all know that we are moving towards that, we're going to go ahead and get into our committee.
There is a conversation that needs to happen prior to us, get rescheduling another watch and discuss And, that's pretty much it for the summer voting items or echoed it.
I'm, chair of the education, youth and libraries Committee during the summer I set in on lots of zoom meetings regarding reopening this morning.
I want to put on records and thank three of the persons from well all of the health committee, but especially Vice Chair Michelle, Booker, Karen, Dixon and Dr Smith for really putting together our proposal to the Harlem nursing home.
They were at one of the borough board meetings and a lot of the Community Board chairs did have a lot of concerns about the operating and even the safety precautions, or the lack of lessons that are given for the people that are writing.
We were concerned about what that might look like for emergency vehicles, parking and public transportation, so that shutdown will take place from on Friday, starting at five o'clock.
They should be putting them up now, if not now or first thing tomorrow, morning, and I believe NYPD I do not believe I do not know if there's any questions or concerns about that, but definitely we'll be talking about this at transportation.
So a couple of things I like the theme of what most people are saying and acknowledging the fact that this summer, I think during the Covid-19 pandemic.
I want to acknowledge something that I think the housing committee has not paid proper attention to Chanel Washington has been talking about the issue of appraisals and the you know disparate impact on communities of color.
You know I'm going to be looking Donna, you know, and what used to be when I first chaired the housing committee, and that was I think we would have to create some subcommittees and some working committees, subcommittees.
You, know one of them that pretty much are the few things that we have on our wish list and just grateful for those who have decided to honor us by being a member of the housing committee, and we look forward to having a great year.
We have a brief presentation from the more development group who's at who have come to us asking for a letter of support for their project on 126Th Street.
A.M they've always already received two letters of support from two of the schools in the area, so we're talking about the North East Corner, pretty much of 8Th Avenue and 126Th Street a little a little west of the apollo, not a high a high traffic area from going east to West, but not a lot of density in the immediate area with respect to residences and businesses do not open till 10 or later.
I do not know why that even directly influences, but I, guess I'm concerned about residents who, because a lot of people working remote students are working remote and things of that nature starting earlier , I'm not, and we do not really have any gauge of the community.
I would be concerned that if we have not heard from the community in regards to tenants, no matter how few or just to hear some voice, that we have people who are working, you know because they work from home.
It takes like about two hours later, so we're really starting to erect like around nine o'clock, and we want to be done earlier rather than later, because you do have a lot of more people on the road later on during the day, especially in that area.
I believe we requested 12 months, but in the 12 months your one sweet top off the building, which I would think that would be in the next we're going to the second floor now, Well, I hear us talking about school opening, but I do not hear anything in regards to the safety, because, from my understanding, I believe the schools will be open.
So I'd, like more discussion on how you plan to deal with the safety of the students coming and going how of the hours that you're actually going to be in use of the crane, how it will impact the school and I'm with Marquis.
It's good, that you got a letter from the funeral home, but the funeral is the funeral home affected at 7, am in the morning as much as the tenants are the rest of the people, even though on the, even though, if your store or school is not affected, it's the letter is still required by DOT or We will not get permits to start work and in response to Mrs Nelson's question about the safety we have to have flagmen on site at all times during constru crane operations, and we also have something.
I. Think if you gave us the justification ladder as to why all these things are needed, it may be a little easier to you know And, it might be easier for people to agree to have you start at seven o'clock, because in essence, you're not really starting construction at seven o'clock, you're prepping to start at nine o'clock, Are you also closing the street two hours earlier at seven?
Is that there's like they want every entity or the entities in the that community right to speak and give you a lot of support.
You have the funeral home, the business, the school And they're, now they're coming to the community board.
So we definitely want to get this building up and out of people's way before another mass of residents start moving in on the block.
Further east and again, I think they originally stated that the reason that they want to open an hour earlier is to just get a jump start on the project.
Has the weekend been suggested at any point for the cranes to be utilized, so it does not disenfranchise the community the residents the children going to and from school we could get permits for a saturday.
Everyone I'd, just like to welcome the New Board New committee, members, I'm, looking forward to working with you and- Know, that I sent a a letter to him if he could share it with regards to Clemson University.
That statement of objectives going to be sent out for the committee to review And and give their input, and then we can send it on to New York City parks, the mayor's office and whoever else we need to send it.
So it's an opportunity for community board 10 to get the assistance of graduate students in developing plans to, as our committee sees it, to develop strategies to cope with the Covid-19 situation, to make our open space areas, safer.
We had a group, I think it was the Harlem greater Holland coalition came and addressed some issues that they saw and we're continuing to see being a public safety issue, continuing that we had this conversation before last year with health and Human services, where Dr Dukes led a charge.
I know she has been greatly involved in a lot of conversations, so either you can speak now, barbara, if you want, or we can invite you to our next public safety meeting, to continue that conversation.
One of the things that's happening is the business owners, and this should be Harlem wide, like they have cameras, but a lot of the images are not good and the police can not there's nothing for them to work with and if the images are not good, even if they prosecute somebody.
So what we're doing now is trying to have a zoom, meeting, and probably the chair of public safety Should be a part of this with the commanding officer and the business owners on the street, because what we see is that this is not going to change and more communication and people working together is probably going to be the only route we could go.
I do not even know if the other board presidents have gotten the money out yet, but we got it out quickly and we've been in, for instance, this week in Washington Heights at nine different events on the street, trying to get people to sign up number one number, two : we've got the listing from the board of elections as to who has left the city and where they are, and so we are now sending a letter to the Census Bureau to 35,000 new yorkers they're, not living where they're Hopefully.
I want to thank the chair of the education committee for participating today, but we did have all the boards and all the cecs and about 70 people with the executive.
It's, really important to kind of take over blocks that the community know between book bags and food and support and census and voter registration that there is a lot of support for that community and just in general, whether we heard earlier about the refrigerators and the mutual aid or just people on 146Th, Street and Seventh Avenue a couple of days ago on the weekend, giving out food and masks and census, material.
We need to have a further discussion with all the community boards to figure out what to do, because it's a non, stop complaint It's got pros and cons in terms of legal aid.
If it's a renewal, seven days, if it's a new application, And, then I also asked whether the committee would like to see them come before.
Those were the only two that came before us this summer, so we did not have a chance to dive in the questions that you see in the questionnaire were there before If the committee does not vote to see the applicant come before us, we do not have that opportunity to question them.
Definitely honestly, not sure whether it was echo death or the health committee had discussions about Hookah, specifically, and I think it may be a good time for us to revisit the health concerns as around Hookah.
So I actually think it's still a good thing that we have for those people who do enjoy Hookah And it has not had any problems as a business.
I think it's a business that we should support, because people are going to do this.
Unless we're talking about higher public policy, where you want to ban Hookah establishments in New, York City, but realistically speaking, Like, Marquis, said, this has nothing to do with the liquor license and secondly.
However, I know personally, of complaints that have been filed that have been registered with the District Office Department, of Sanitation building management and within the community, and if it is in fact a permit to continue to expand their operation to the patio, I think there are some questions about their capacity and their care for the building and sanitation.
So we have not received any information as to whether or not this is going to be kind of like a temporary permanent thing, or will we revert back to the official process as a community?
We do not know the future of what the sidewalk cafe licenses will look like, And then I would caution the check mark on the application that this is a sidewalk cafe if they have not been issued.
With a letter of concern, Okay and to be addressed hopefully by health and human services, as we talk about the effects of Hookah and any type of smoking , I do not know if they're going to do a joint discussion, but I believe the the request for education was made by Sheryl Smith member of Health and Human services.
That's one thing but doing it outdoors is very concerning to me, and I think to other members of the community.
I did not miss all of the other votes, because I was online Okay, we'll add you to the opposition, so the opposed people are Donna Gill Chanel, and this is a renewal, not a new application.
The next voting item is the free Clemson University Covic strategies for Central Park Safety thing that Karen presented.
Do think that at this point of hearing the developer hearing the committee report, it is important that we vote either one to send it back to community to committee to get more information.
Do not know if it's about this matter, but it might help us just to keep order in regards to like when we want to, because this is a very interesting topic, that a lot of people have things to say.
The block regarding you know how they feel about this project and and to make sure that's not going to I, would just like to say that if that's the motion, then the decision gets made at the committee.
It does not come back to the Community Board next month that the decision gets made at the committee.
I mean we have discussion on that people, please chime in It seems to me that you're moving that this goes back to the committee, where you're asking for more information to be brought back to the full board before a vote is taken, and I.
You did second It goes back to committee to get the information that the board has requested from the community and otherwise, and then it is to be brought back to the full board for a vote.
As soon as we hear something that the district office will let the community know, thank you, okay, That's it for old business, any new business, any announcements.
