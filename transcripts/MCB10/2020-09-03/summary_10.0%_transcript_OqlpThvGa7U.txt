We do have a bit of an agenda tonight, so we definitely want to make sure that we're making use of everyone's time appropriately, so welcome to community board tens first meeting of our year.
We did not stop this summer, so we were continuing to meet and trying to serve the community through our committees.
We didn't have our general board meetings, but we did have our committees that were getting out critical information throughout the summer.
If, if you get a text from so thank you so much for doing for being here today and for letting us have this discussion with you and for all of the wonderful things you do, and I was just able to read a news article about it And You all were right on it and so prepared, and we just thank you for all of your work.
You know we do want to extend even you know during the time of Covid-19 and the unfortunate reality of things now not being in person or trying to now work.
You know fire safety is always a year-round topic We look forward to working with the community board and community residents as well.
October is fire prevention month, and it's something that we would like to see within the coming month of stressing that message and potentially working with the board for the uptown community of harlem, so anything that we can do.
That would like to say a few words or a representative of an elected official sure I can talk about a couple things that are coming up in the public advocates office.
The last thing I want to mention is our team is trying to get the d.a out there throughout the community more talking to groups engaging with different members.
If you are interested in, you know having conversations with the da if you're having public safety conversations and then want to include the d.a. Please reach out I'll, leave my contact information in the chat, box.
Everyone welcome back in September, so I have two things: one:: the new york city, controller, scott stringer, along with congress member esbayad state, senator brian benjamin city, councilman, bill perkins, 125th street bid, barbara askins, a host of a lot of community leaders on 125th, street.
It was the assuming men, interacting with the community, making sure that folks had what they needed and staying safe and also just making sure that you know they knew that his office was present and was there to address issues and the last day for the peace walks is September.
You and again thank brian benjamin's office for the protect the block campaign that a lot of the elected officials and the community board have adopted.
I know we may have missed a few committee meetings, but the diligence and the fortitude to push on throughout everything going on and to be of service to the community.
We were constantly out there constantly trying to address the issues that are so plaguing our community Now we passed out masks at a lot of these impromptu parties that we've been seeing popping up over the summer.
Thank brian, benjamin and shauna and christina, and a lot of the community members larry blackman for getting together and doing the protect your street campaign.
You will hear from committee board member karen orry and her reports from parks about our effort with the exonerated five initiative.
I want to publicly thank karen orry and the parks committee for their diligence for having those walks for having those conversations, not just in the committee meetings but outside talking to the parks department and really pushing it forward of what we want to see What really reflects our community?
I also wanted to thank the health committee for all that they're doing or they're talking about sanitation, which has been extremely vital to our community, but also addressing the nursing home issue that we've had and we'll hear from dr dukes on that and finally, again, I'd want to thank barbara askins and their cleanup team on 125th street.
I might want to commend our community board members for working over the summer as well, by holding their zoom meetings online also want to thank our community assistant.
This point, we don't have all of the details, but I look forward to following up with the 28th present in regards to issues at this location in particular, as well as issues that have been a continued nuisance to residents around a phillip randolph square on 116th street in regards to public safety, drugs and drug trafficking.
When we reconvene in two weeks throughout the summer months, we have seen many issues in our community around gun, violence, drug enforcement, noise and sanitation, concerns, and I hope that, even with the reduction in the city's budget that we can come together to work towards fixing the most pressing issues and complaints on a brighter note, I'm happy to report that, after many months of trying to get NYPD.
There is a conversation that needs to happen prior to us, get rescheduling another watch and discuss And, that's pretty much it for the summer voting items or echoed it.
Don't, forget education, sorry, deborah!, Deborah, hi, I'm, deborah yates, I'm, chair of the education, youth and libraries committee during the summer I set in on lots of zoom meetings regarding reopening this morning.
They were at one of the borough board meetings and a lot of the community board chairs did have a lot of concerns about the operating and even the safety precautions, or the lack of lessons that are given for the people that are writing.
We were concerned about what that might look like for emergency vehicles, parking and public transportation, so that shutdown will take place from on friday, starting at five o'clock till eleven o'clock saturday from 12 p.m, to 11, p.m, and sunday from I.
They should be putting them up now, if not now or first thing tomorrow, morning, and I believe NYPD Now is not towing or ticketing people right now for not moving their cars friday, saturday and sunday , I, don't believe I, don't know if there's any questions or concerns about that, but definitely we'll be talking about this at transportation.
So You know I'm going to be looking donna you know, and what used to be when I first chaired the housing committee, and that was , I think we would have to create some subcommittees and some working committees, subcommittees.
You, know one of them that pretty much are the few things that we have on our wish list and just grateful for those who have decided to honor us by being a member of the housing committee, and we look forward to having a great year.
We have a brief presentation from the more development group who's at who have come to us asking for a letter of support for their project on 126th street.
So we're talking about the north east corner, pretty much of 8th avenue and 126th street a little a little west of the apollo, not a high a high traffic area from going east to west, but not a lot of density in the immediate area, with respect to residences and businesses, don't open till 10 or later.
Don't know why that even directly influences, but I guess I'm concerned about residents who, because a lot of people working remote students are working remote and things of that nature starting earlier , I'm not, and we don't really have any gauge of the community.
I would be concerned that if we haven't heard from the community in regards to tenants, no matter how few or just to hear some voice, that we have people who are working, you know because they work from home.
I believe he's talking to the community committee chair.
Believe we requested 12 months, but in the 12 months your one sweet top off the building, which I would think that would be in the next we're going to the second floor now, Well, I hear us talking about school opening, but I don't hear anything in regards to the safety, because, from my understanding, I believe the schools will be open.
A few days of the week for certain students, so I'd like more discussion on how you plan to deal with the safety of the students coming and going how of the hours that you're actually going to be in use of the crane, how it will impact the school and I'm with marquis.
I. Think that that's something that needs to go to the community board, to the department of education, new york, state department of education, I'm, not sure, which is why I ask that some of the documents that were received, not just your letter or letters that you received, but the complete package- is something that we would need to view in light of kovic.
We had to get one from the schools, but now we have to get one from the community board in order to start at that, time.
If your store or school is not affected, it's the letter is still required by DOT or We will not get permits to start work, and in response to mrs nelson's question about the safety, we have to have flagmen on site at all times during constru crane operations, and we also have something.
I. Think if you gave us the justification ladder as to why all these things are needed, it may be a little easier to you know And, it might be easier for people to agree to have you start at seven o'clock, because in essence, you're not really starting construction at seven o'clock, you're prepping to start at nine o'clock, Are you also closing the street two hours earlier at seven?
Is that there's like they want every entity or the entities in the that community right to speak and give you a lot of support.
You have the funeral home, the business, the school And they're, now they're coming to the community board.
So we definitely want to get this building up and out of people's way before another mass of residents start moving in on the block.
Further east and again, I think they originally stated that the reason that they want to open an hour earlier is to just get a jump start on the project.
Everyone I'd, just like to welcome the new board new committee, members, I'm, looking forward to working with you and- Know, that I sent a a letter to him if he could share it.
Over the summer we had three subcommittee , I'm sorry, two subcommittee meetings and three community outreach public discussion, panels.
That statement of objectives going to be sent out for the committee to review And and give their input, and then we can send it on to new york city parks, the mayor's office and whoever else we need to send it.
I just wanted to bring to everybody's attention that burglaries at night have increased on 125th street people going into the stores.
One of the things that's happening is the business owners, and this should be harlem wide, like they have cameras, but a lot of the images are not good and the police cannot there's nothing for them to work with and if the images are not good, even if they prosecute somebody.
What we're doing now is trying to have a zoom, meeting, and probably the chair of public safety Should be a part of this with the commanding officer and the business owners on the street, because what we see is that this is not going to change and more communication and people working together is probably going to be the only route.
I don't even know if the other board presidents have gotten the money out yet, but we got it out quickly and we've been in, for instance, this week in washington, heights, at nine different events on the street, trying to get people to sign up number one number.
I want to thank the chair of the education committee for participating today, but we did have all the boards and all the cecs and about 70 people with the executive, superintendent.
It's, really important to kind of take over blocks that the community know between book bags and food and support and census and voter registration that there is a lot of support for that community and just in general, whether we heard earlier about the refrigerators and the mutual aid or just people on 146th street and seventh avenue a couple of days ago on the weekend, giving out food and masks and census.
If it's a renewal, seven days, if it's a new application, And, then I also asked whether the committee would like to see them come before.
If the committee doesn't vote to see the applicant come before us, we don't have that opportunity to question them best address Definitely honestly not sure whether it was echo death or the health committee had discussions about hookah, specifically, and I think it may be a good time for us to revisit the health concerns as around hookah.
I think it's a business that we should support, because people are going to do this.
But you're not going to be able to stop people from participating in it unless we're talking about higher public policy, where you want to ban hookah establishments in new york city, but realistically speaking, like marquis said.
This has nothing to do with the liquor license: and, secondly, Even, if we don't permit a establishment like this to open up in our community, people in our community are going to go to other communities and spend their dollars and still do it.
However, I know personally, of complaints that have been filed that have been registered with the district office, department, of sanitation building management and within the community, and if it is in fact, a permit to continue to expand their operation to the patio, I think there are some questions about their capacity and their care for the building and sanitation.
Have this now would they have to again apply for go through the official sidewalk cafe petition through echo dev, so we have not received any information as to whether or not this is going to be kind of like a temporary permanent thing, or will we revert back to the official process as a community?
Yes, with the exception of the land use item and madam chair, so people who arrived late and were not in the original roll call will they be called to vote as well.
You were mark president, the first one, So, this passes, and I think this will be the same thing- that it should go back to echo dev with a letter of concern, Okay and to be addressed hopefully by health and human services.
As we talk about the effects of hookah and any type of smoking, I, don't know if they're going to do a joint discussion, but I believe the the request for education was made by sheryl smith, member of health and human services.
That's one thing but doing it outdoors is very concerning to me, and I think, to other members of the community.
I didn't miss all of the other votes, because I was online Okay, we'll add you to the opposition, so the opposed people are donna gill chanel, and this is a renewal, not a new application.
The harlem one I don't know as long as one won't allow it Are. You saying you no longer want to vote?
Next voting item is the free clemson university covic strategies for central park safety thing that karen presented.
Do think that at this point of hearing the developer hearing the committee report, it is important that we vote either one to send it back to community to committee to get more information.
Don't know if it's about this matter, but it might help us just to keep order in regards to like when we want to, because this is a very interesting topic, that a lot of people have things to say.
The block regarding you know how they feel about this project and and to make sure that's not going to I, would just like to say that if that's the motion, then the decision gets made at the committee.
It doesn't come back to the community board next month that the decision gets made at the committee.
I mean we have discussion on that people please chime in It seems to me that you're moving that this goes back to the committee, where you're asking for more information to be brought back to the full board before a vote is taken, and I.
It goes back to committee to get the information that the board has requested from the community and otherwise, and then it is to be brought back to the full board for a vote.
I didn't think we had enough information in terms of what level of research it would be involved with, and just the safety issues around having infectious diseases being studied in the residential community right next to a school karen.
As soon as we hear something that the district office will let the community know, thank you, okay, That's it for old business, any new business, any announcements.
