I can't stress enough the importance of voting checking on our neighbors and to continue a big shout out to our sister atkins for the cleanup crew that they've been doing I think other people now understand their significance and for I believe there's a representative from congressman sbs office hi good evening, hi sicily, how hello everyone from the community It is going to be having a conversation regarding kovit, where we work the successes and how we're going to be moving forward in the fall and also to encourage those who do to take their flu shot.
That would like to say a few words or a representative of an elected official sure I can talk about a couple things that are coming up in the public advocates office So on housing, I'm, the deputy public advocate for housing, and what we have coming up this month is We are doing another meeting on NYCHA this one night, not just nigel but affordable housing, but focusing on nigel we're gonna, be talking about alternative preservation, strategies, rent to own and other methods to preserve, affordable housing, develop, affordable housing, so that folks, who live in our communities can stay in them and so that folks, living in niger could have a better quality of life.

Everyone welcome back in september, so I have two things: one, the new york city controller, scott stringer, along with congress member esbayad state, senator brian benjamin city, councilman, bill perkins, 125th street bid, barbara askins, a host of a lot of community leaders on 125th street The congressman and the controller have wrote a letter about the increasing the increasing of too much trash and was trying to get a lot of buy-in from the city to restore some of the funding back to sanitation If you have any questions or concerns about the letter or about the press conference or how you can help, please contact me, and certainly not least, our office, in conjunction with cuny we're doing a fellowship program, which is a paid fellowship.
Please call our office and also the assemblyman has been promoting the census: Promoting voter registration promoting wearing your mask as well as hand sanitizers with his daily peace walks and that started july, 30th with local organizations such as resources who are present and with us, as well as public assets, office and reps from local representatives It was the assuming men, interacting with the community, making sure that folks had what they needed and staying safe and also just making sure that you know they knew that his office was present and was there to address issues and the last day for the peace walks is september.
So, if you'd like to join I, will send you the locations happening for this week, and you can, you know, take a walk, engage the community make sure folks of mass hand sanitizers make sure that they register to vote as well as make sure that they have completed the census.
I also wanted to thank the health committee for all that they're doing or they're talking about sanitation, which has been extremely vital to our community, but also addressing the nursing home issue that we've had and we'll hear from dr dukes on that and finally, again I'd want to thank barbara askins and their cleanup team on 125th street For. Cb10 will be taking a roll, so next tuesday we will be taking a roll, because it's every tuesday starting at 8am that everyone needs to get out on their block and start cleaning.
We will also be joined by street corner resources and harlem park the park, and we will also be raffling off two laptops on my way home from the office yesterday after we, you know packed up the book bags and everything I started, receiving calls about a young man who had been shot and killed on malcolm x, boulevard in front of the wells fargo between 124th and 125th street, and said that jayvon allegedly tried to chase a drug dealer off of the street and he was fatally shot in the neck in broad daylight, just after 3 pm At. This point we don't have all of the details, but I look forward to following up with the 28th present in regards to issues at this location in particular, as well as issues that have been a continued nuisance to residents around a phillip randolph square on 116th street in regards to public safety, drugs and drug trafficking.
Throughout the summer months we have seen many issues in our community around gun, violence, drug enforcement, noise and sanitation concerns and I hope that, even with the reduction in the city's budget that we can come together to work towards fixing the most pressing issues and complaints on a brighter note, I'm happy to report that, after many months of trying to get NYPD to start pac to stop parking in front of the bus stop in front of psa 6 on frederick douglas boulevard, the mayor's office finally intervened.
I believe that one board has already successfully done a virtual election and that's cb1, so we I talked to adele, who is the manhattan-born president's general counsel for ideas and suggestions of how we will do it, Along with your options, we will have a meeting to discuss those options and decide how we would like to proceed for the november elections, we're going to go ahead and get into our committee reports, arts and culture.
Believe before we move on to health and human services, I believe our Manhattan bro president gail brewer has joined us So go ahead with your wonderful important committees: Thank you for getting education, Don't, forget education, sorry, deborah!, Deborah, hi, I'm, deborah yates, I'm, chair of the education, youth and libraries committee during the summer I set in on lots of zoom meetings regarding reopening this morning, The borough president had a wonderful meeting on the reopening Also during the exec board meeting last month.
I just wanted to make us aware of health initiative really community-wide, because there are three community fridges within our district now, one on 120th street, one on 116th street and one on 151st street I believe, and these community fridge is a new concept, at least for new york, where in our particular case we only have fresh food meats, vegetables in the refrigerators and it's completely free, and it's really helping people supplement their meals or create a meal, , it has been really a true service to the community 116th street The community garden supports that particular fridge and they found the same thing So it's something that we need to be aware of, and also we may see more and more of this happening in our community and it's a true service to all residents, not just homeless residents.
I know they were at one of the borough board meetings and a lot of the community board chairs did have a lot of concerns about the operating and even the safety precautions, or the lack of lessons that are given for the people that are writing them.
So we at one of our last meetings we had fdba, come and talk about their proposal for and that's frederick douglass boulevard alliance come and talk about their proposal for open streets to open the streets for the restaurant to start serving beyond the parking lane That means shutting down frederick douglas boulevard for a weekend up until october to allow the restaurants to go into the street We did a walk through with the borough president, some elections, officials were there a lot of some community members and I believe that was in June or early july to look at what that might look like I.
I contacted them right away as the m10, which is one of our most traveled buses, is on that street We were concerned about what that might look like for emergency vehicles, parking and public transportation, so that shutdown will take place from on friday, starting at five o'clock till eleven o'clock saturday from 12 pm to 11 pm and sunday from That's, going to be from 1 12 to 1 20th, the cross streets will be open, but 8th avenue will be shut down.
They should be putting them up now, if not now or first thing tomorrow morning People right now for not moving their cars friday, saturday and sunday, I, don't believe I, don't know if there's any questions or concerns about that, but definitely we'll be talking about this at transportation This is they were approved last week, but this is the first weekend that is actually supposed to be happening.
I like the theme of what most people are saying and acknowledging the fact that this summer, I think during the covert 19 pandemic, So I'm grateful for the borough president's office and all of what she's done in keeping us informed her daily reports and now weekly reports, and you know, of course, the things that are coming from the mayor's office You know the work that we've done with each other, because it's all about you know our collectively working to survive this pandemic I want to acknowledge something that I think the housing committee has not paid proper attention to Chanel washington has been talking about the issue of appraisals and the you know disparate impact on communities of color.
You know one of them that pretty much are the few things that we have on our wish list and just grateful for those who have decided to honor us by being a member of the housing committee, and we look forward to having a great year Everyone I hope everyone had a good summer.
So we're talking about the north east corner, pretty much of 8th avenue and 126th street a little a little west of the apollo, not a high a high traffic area from going east to west, but not a lot of density in the immediate area with respect to residences and businesses, don't open till 10 or later We wanted to share this information with you to for you to answer any questions that you may have.
There may be a few brown stones on 127 street and then the NYCHA housing sets back into the block Otherwise, it's not a densely populated area for residential You say you have a letter to the school who from the schools we got one second here: the democracy, prep endurance, middle school, signed it by katherine perez and for harriet topman signed by elizabeth jarrett, and those letters say what, though, that we're gonna start at 7 am I'm wondering why a principal is signing a letter to say that she's Ok I don't know because the school doesn't open at 7 am I, don't know why that even directly influences but I guess I'm concerned about residents who, because a lot of people working remote students are working remote and things of that nature starting earlier I'm, not, and we don't really have any gauge of the community either.
You have the funeral home, the business, the school they're coming to the community board If, we sign off on a letter that we have not heard from the community So I really think it might be really helpful that we hear some community voice to make sure that they would be fine with a street closure.
Is it inconvenience to the community and that's our main concern to have the street closed for weeks at a time you know in a day when that's a busy time of the day going from east to west- We are heading into our winter months.
We also had a meeting with the parks department and the mayor's office on waterfront and resiliency, and we are still able to have input into any suggestions that we might have for the for waterfront development and anything in terms of resiliency That would be the harlem river waterfront vision, So, please we'll try to get out get a survey or, if you just the community, would like to weigh in just send information into the office as to what they'd like to see in terms of waterfront activities to be suggested for this plan and please call into the office and and make your recommendations known, there's also opportunity to still weigh in on the brownfield repurposing project at 280.
Ademola look bifola artist and we were really fascinated to have Sarah burns participate, she's, the filmmaker of the central park, conservancy I'm, sorry, the central park, five documentary, so she has collaborated with us on the statement of objectives and goals and we'll be providing an educational component to whatever we are doing or and with respect to the exhibit That statement of objectives going to be sent out for the committee to review and and and give their input, and then we can send it on to new york city parks, the mayor's office and whoever else we need to send it to Had tremendous support from the world president I may have to just stop for a moment.
It's the shoplifting is more from the people that are hanging out on the streets and they're, very aggressive to where store owners are starting to pair up their sales people What we're doing now is trying to have a zoom meeting, and probably the chair of public safety should be a part of this with the commanding officer and the business owners on the street, because what we see is that this is not going to change and more communication and people working together is probably going to be the only route we could go So. If there are others from the community board, That would like to be a part of this conversation Thank you barbara, thank you for that, and we definitely want to be a part of that conversation Basically had a presentation of voting items, Please prepare those questions.
The each borough president got from the governor empire state development, actually some funding very late to give to nonprofits to work in underserved communities and thanks to deputy board president alvin burnia , we got it out, I, don't even know if the other board presidents have gotten the money out yet, but we got it out quickly and we've been in, for instance, this week in washington heights at nine different events on the street, trying to get people to sign up number.
I want to thank the chair of the education committee for participating today, but we did have all the boards and all the cecs and about 70 people with the executive superintendent Are, our children in harlem, going to get a device period, and even if you do turns out I thought nitro was the challenge in terms of bandwidth Just a piece and the schools are going to be open, apparently five days a week, but you could go twice a week to the school and three times a week to a learning center and you might even end up being all virtual We just sent a letter today for those schools that want a street closed near them.
I do want to thank senator benjamin to be doing the protect the block campaign, It's really important to kind of take over blocks that the community know between book bags and food and support and census and voter registration that there is a lot of support for that community and just in general, whether we heard earlier about the refrigerators and the mutual aid or just people on 146th street and seventh avenue a couple of days ago.
All the way to buladic and all the harlem developments in between and I do think that people would like to appreciate it We're going to try to also work on some farm, fresh food to randolph and wadley, and grant and manhattanville I'm, not gonna talk about the homeless because I'm up to here with it with other parts of Manhattan.
I give three to seven days three days if it's a renewal, seven days if it's a new application and then I also asked whether the committee would like to see them come before us, neighborhood brulee came before us and ruby vintage Those were the only two that came before us this summer, so we did not have a chance to dive in the questions that you see in the questionnaire were there before I became chair So if the committee doesn't vote to see the applicant come before us, we don't have that opportunity to question them best address I think it was echo, definitely honestly, not sure whether it was echo death or the health committee had discussions about hookah, specifically and I think it may be a good time for us to revisit the health concerns, as around hookah I know.
Smoking is a big thing in new york city and there's very few establishments here in harlem That would permit that So I was very happy to be able to go somewhere in your own community versus having to go to astoria washington heights or further downtown So I, actually think it's still a good thing that we have for those people who do enjoy hookah and it hasn't had any problems as a business, and this is really the only spot that we have in harlem and it is the black owned business.
Everybody else forget the health list, but you're not going to be able to stop people from participating in it unless we're talking about higher public policy, where you want to ban hookah establishments in new york city, but realistically speaking, like marquis said, this has nothing to do with the liquor license and, secondly, even if we don't permit a establishment like this to open up in our community, people in our community are going to go to other communities and spend their dollars and still do it anyway.
This is one of the locations that, on frederick douglas boulevard, has had I believe some questions around just social distancing, not so much under the leadership of the organization The fact that this is a timed entrance location where groups of people sign up for two hour blocks of time for painting instruction eating and drinking I, know residents in that building have expressed concern and I and I- I was not told that any complaints came into the district office.
I. Just looked at the application, They did check sidewalk cafe because they're saying that's a licensed outdoor area where they're serving, but that's only through the cove, with open streets program from what I it is so and that in full disclosure that went through, as we know, without a lot of community input and without anything, So I, just I believe there's another establishment on eighth avenue, at least by name of the petitioning company We, are in support of our businesses.
So we have not received any information as to whether or not this is going to be kind of like a temporary permanent thing, or will we revert back to the official process as a community board?
We are asking that the mayor revert back to the official process of going through letting getting community input, because those these sidewalk cafes as they are usually are not up to the standard code that we would ask for in a permanent sidewalk cafe so just to put that out there, and we do not know the future of what the sidewalk cafe licenses will look like and then I would caution the check mark on the application that this is a sidewalk cafe if they haven't been issued.
I know everybody's eyes are real big right now about all these voting items that we have, but what we wanted to do is try a different kind of process that a couple of other boards have done.
This is about inconveniencing the community and not only there's no letter we did not We did not amend our agenda for it to be presented at the beginning of this meeting So my concern is: Why are we automatically voting on an item?
I. Don't know if it's about this matter, but it might help us just to keep order in regards to like when we want to, because this is a very interesting topic, that a lot of people have things to say, but it's hard when everyone was you know talking I think we can like move ahead and go and vote for it, but just have those conditions around it saying or you can send it back to committee with those conditions say it's already motioned to send it back to committee with the documentation.
Regarding you know how they feel about this project and and to make sure that's not going to I, would just like to say that if that's the motion, then the decision gets made at the committee.
We can follow up with the health and human services committee karen or michelle I will provide you and shatik with the information that we've been receiving from harlem hospital related to that the destruction and then the construction of the lab, any other old business, cicely I'd just like to ask: Has there been any more community outreach around that community outreach in regards to doing what do you mean by because the project was moving forward?
I, know I voiced concerns about the health lab coming in I, didn't think we had enough information in terms of what level of research it would be involved with, and just the safety issues around having infectious diseases being studied in the residential community right next to a school.
