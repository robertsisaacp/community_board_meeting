So, and we know about the strong ties the seniors have towards religion, so She's, not here yet from Canaan church, and then we have Deborah gardner And she's, representing the catholic Churches, Saint Charles, all saints and resurrection , So, we'll just start off with general questions and general things about seniors in Covid-19, in isolation and just a few questions, and then you could answer them in any order.
So we just want to know how are the church seniors coping with this isolation with the Covid-19?
The church has been extremely encouraging for our seniors, not to attend mass over the past two months, particularly if they are aged, have underlying conditions reported out by the CDC.
Now in New York City having less cases of Corona viruses at this present time and the extreme caution the church is taking with cleaning and disaffecting the church between the masses, the limits on attendance of each mass and at the two locations taking temperature checks at the door, handing out masses at the door Handing out gloves if it's a necessity for those seniors of winning over more parishioners weekly.
Family members set up doctors, appointments as well as AIDS, and the good thing there is all they would have to do is call the rectory say what their need is and directory will automatically send an email to that person in the parish who can help them with their specific problem of that particular time.
Friends and family do help the seniors who have technology issues, but that is not coming or emanating from the church, particularly that has to be a friend or family member.
They were just afraid they was living in fear, and so we had to deal with that and one of the things we did was we practiced mindfulness every day for about 15 minutes where we just sat, We, went through some some positive affirmations and just help people find their center, and we continue to do that.
My director, so I always, you know, inform her of what's going on and let her know and a lot of the seniors were asking about.
The telephone number for the church is two one: two, eight one, twenty one hundred And it's for you to leave your name and telephone number to attend the bereavement sessions on saturdays, your name and telephone number, and for the past I think Lazarus has been in making about eight or ten years, because I am a member of the last and we have catholics and non- catholics, just people.
I. Think it's going to be exactly how it is for a good while at both Saint Charles and resurrection, we've done a herculean effort to ensure all seats are sanctioned off with blue tape, and, of course, to know where people would sit where families would sit.
Everyone feels the safetiness in the church at this present time, which is great because we really thought we were going to have the most difficult time getting people back to church We did from the first two masses, but I think word got around that.
We just asked people please not to come if they're not feeling well, because we really do not want to turn away anyone, but at the same time we're not going to allow anyone in the church who has a temperature of 100 and more so Personally, I could not wait to get back to church Many of us could not wait to get back to church We do know the seniors, who are still not coming still Miss church, but there are options for them and they are taking advantage of those options and as long as those options are available, You know, would you please mention about the music?
Those are what we always know of as ushers, and they are the persons that we have to take directions from Eve when they meet your door to take your temperature You know like one side, individuals as Debbie said, and the other side is for families, but, and they also lead the way for the acceptance of the communion, because you know you have to wait until they tell you come at your pew and move forward and everything and in resurrection, church They.
I do not want to direct the Central Hollywood Executive director, I'm, the executive director of super Harlem senior citizens center and, as we oversee four sites,, that's Beatrice, Lewis, located on 127Th and third Lincoln housing that is Saint, Nick, Saint Nick right over 130Th and 7Th Avenue and our main office is Kennedy.
How would that look for central Harlem senior citizen, the four sites we had and understand?
We are looking at grab and go, which is a good thing, because that means we will be cooking our own meals, as you all know, that a lot of our seniors are not very happy with the meals that have been coming through Harlem, and that really is a catch and go.
I want to be able to give our take our meals to us here in Harlem, where there is a necessity, my staff will be willing to take some people, their meals to their homes, but you got to understand a lot of, and only three are open.
We are willing to take on additional people as well and that and how they're looking at this, how they are looking at it Is they're, going to give us a list of names and understand those lists of names are going to go by zip codes, because what they're doing if, in fact, they start open up these senior sites.
So again, they're, asking each site to take on additional people and central Harlem senior centers.
I really do not know, and that is something I'm going to have to ask them, because she did say she's right, now, calling them additional people.
You know it's a work in progress because everybody wants to come back and All the seniors.
You know we already had the majority of the senior centers do like a ten thousand, a fifteen thousand dollar cut in the food section and that's the weird thing they made.
I want to say one thing regarding the cut and how you doing the cut they did the cut, but they gave money back to the people so again with the additional people and when the centers open for those sites that are going to be taken on additional.
He jumped off, but he did amazing and thank you, miss Deb, for talking about how Covid-19 has affected the seniors and how you guys facility have increased your safety measures in order for people to feel safe when they come into your church, and also I want to thank everybody who came out to Senator Benjamin's as long as well as first corinthians baptist church and Dc nine's hope for Harlem event that we had this past Saturday, where we gave away groceries hot meals, school supplies.
Some of my seniors here gave us some call precautions when we were first planning this over two months ago on making sure we kept it safe, because the first group of people that I talked to about this was cb10s Senior steering committee, because a lot of times at these big events that Senator Benjamin has is mostly our seniors that come out, and so I wanted you guys.
I do not think that, like homeless people per se were dumped into Harlem and without what I can say, Is that a transitional men's shelter opened up on 110Th street and Lenox Avenue.
Just think these people they need help, and it's not a coincidence that they're standing there the reason they're standing there The block is the facility open, yes, Anymore I'll do 125Th, Street and 7Th Avenue, because I do not even feel safe Over.
One is around the corner from Td banks and the other one is right there next to the eyeglass place, so you're going to have a lot of them hanging around in front of the red rooster, starbucks things like that, because some of these facilities do not open up until 8 o'clock 8:30 in the morning.
You want to talk, you can walk and talk, but in order to keep the distance of the church safe for everyone departing, everyone must keep it moving, and so another thing that has been working really great people have learned to call one another who you normally would only see on Sunday, but you did not finish a conversation, so phone numbers are being exchanged between parishioners that had not necessarily been done.
I'm glad I've actually left information and glad to hear that everyone's fine and the things that are going on for the seniors at churches.
We have to keep in mind that a lot of seniors may be technology challenged, so we not may not be reaching everyone, but the things that are going on is actually great.
I'm, still checking in on the seniors that I know to make sure that they're, People, who would not give you their phone number, have now given out their phone numbers because they realize that this is a way to keep in touch with with everyone.
The pandemic has created a lot of uncertainty, but it has also brought a lot of people a lot of seniors together and looking forward to getting more information from everyone.
