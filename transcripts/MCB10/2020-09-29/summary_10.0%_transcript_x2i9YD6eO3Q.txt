Okay, I'm collecting my from the tioga democratic club, community, garden, 146th street health and wellness and senator brian benjamin senior task.
So we just want to know how are the church seniors coping with this isolation with the Covid-19 19?
The church has been extremely encouraging for our seniors, not to attend mass over the past two months, particularly if they are aged, have underlying conditions reported out by the CDC.
Friends and family do help the seniors who have technology issues, but that is not coming or emanating from the church, particularly that has to be a friend or family member.
My director, so I always, you know, inform her of what's going on and let her know and a lot of the seniors were asking about the pantry.
We are open to anyone and we do have people who come from the community to some of our sections they held on saturdays.
I. Think it's going to be exactly how it is for a good while at both saint charles and resurrection, we've done a herculean effort to ensure all seats are sanctioned off with blue tape, and, of course, to know where people would sit where families would sit.
At this present time, which is great because we really thought we were going to have the most difficult time getting people back to church And, we did from the first two masses, Oh, my goodness, you're sanitized.
We just asked people please not to come if they're not feeling well, because we really don't want to turn away anyone, but at the same time we're not going to allow anyone in the church who has a temperature of 100 and more so, I.
Personally, I couldn't wait to get back to church, like many of us couldn't wait to get back to church We do know the seniors, who are still not coming still miss church, but there are options for them and they are taking advantage of those options and as long as those options are available, I think, and each one of those three people sing with the musician and then the following, sunday.
To take your temperature You know like one side, individuals as debbie said, and the other side is for families, but and they also lead the way for the acceptance of the communion, because you know you have to wait until they tell you come at your pew and move forward and everything and in resurrection, church They have a bottle of ham sanitizer You know it's hard because you know I, don't own a seat, but I'm a customer sitting in a certain place.
I, don't want to direct the central hollywood executive, director, I'm, the executive director of super Harlem senior citizens center and, as we oversee four sites.
What we are looking at and what the department of aging and the commissioner is looking at is if we were to reopen, how would that look for central Harlem senior citizen, the four sites we had and understand?
We are looking at grab and go, which is a good thing, because that means we will be cooking our own meals, as you all know, that a lot of our seniors are not very happy with the meals that have been coming through Harlem, and that really is a catch and go.
I want to be able to give our take our meals to us here in Harlem, where there is a necessity, my staff will be willing to take some people, their meals to their homes, but you got to understand a lot of, and only three are open.
We are willing to take on additional people as well and that and how they're looking at this, how they are looking at it Is they're, going to give us a list of names and understand those lists of names are going to go by zip codes, because what they're doing if, in fact, they start open up these senior sites.
I, really don't know, and that is something I'm gonna have to ask them, because she did say she's right, now, calling them additional people.
You know it's a work in progress because everybody wants to come back and All the seniors.
You know we already had the majority of the senior centers do like a ten thousand, a fifteen thousand dollar cut in the food section and that's the weird thing they made.
I want to say one thing regarding the cut and how you doing the cut they did the cut, but they gave money back to the people so again with the additional people and when the centers open for those sites that are going to be taken on additional.
He jumped off, but he did amazing and thank you, miss deb, for talking about how Covid-19 has affected the seniors and how you guys facility have increased your safety measures in order for people to feel safe when they come into your church, and also.
Some of my seniors here gave us some call precautions when we were first planning this over two months ago on making sure we kept it safe, because the first group of people that I talked to about this was cb10s Senior steering committee, because a lot of times at these big events that senator benjamin has is mostly our seniors that come out, and so I wanted you guys.
And, it's just a lot of homeless I , don't think that, like homeless people per se were dumped into Harlem and without what I can say, Is that a transitional men's shelter opened up on 110th street and linux avenue.
Maybe one of the things would be: There are an awful lot of homeless people on 125th street and lenox avenue.
Happening, is, as we keep going, what I've heard from other people in terms of what we're hearing from seniors the need to connect.
Those are real things for us too right richard is from afa randolph senior center at 146th, street.
You have any online zoom classes, October, 1st, Okay, we're working we're working on putting stuff together right now If the center's gonna open for this year, Or I guess we gotta- wait to January to find out what's going on, but I'm just waiting to see what what's gonna happen seem like.
You want to talk, you can walk and talk, but in order to keep the distance of the church safe for everyone departing, everyone must keep it moving, and so another thing that has been working really great people have learned to call one another who you normally would only see on sunday.
I'm glad I've, actually left information and glad to hear that everyone's fine and the things that are going on for the seniors at churches.
We have to keep in mind that a lot of seniors may be technology challenged, so we not may not be reaching everyone, but the things that are going on is actually great.
The pandemic has created a lot of uncertainty, but it has also brought a lot of people a lot of seniors together and looking forward to getting more information from everyone.
It was saturday there's a big celebration in front of a church and people rolled by and came by to give thanks and to just show her that you know she is a major part of our community.
