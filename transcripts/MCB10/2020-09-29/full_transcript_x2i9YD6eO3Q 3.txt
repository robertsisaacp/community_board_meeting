So I think that's the 11 that we have right now and some more will come so our community protests for us we keep up with the pulse of our senior community and one of the greatest institutions that we have in Harlem is our churches, our religious organizations. So our seniors are the life blood of the church society. So, and we know about the strong ties the seniors have towards religion, so we just so. We are pleased to have with us our guests today. So we have the reverend marshall lee watson. Is she here, okay, she's, not here yet from canaan church, and then we have deborah gardner and she's, representing the catholic churches, saint charles all, saints and resurrection, and then we have the pastor, khali james and he's from mount zion amy church. So it's such a pleasure to have you guys here today so we'll just start off with general questions and general things about seniors in Covid-19 in isolation and just a few questions, and then you could answer them in any order. You know in any style that you choose, so we just want to know how are the church seniors coping with this isolation with the Covid-19 19? Are the church seniors getting help with food, health checks, supplies and technology and how are the churches assisting with the grieving process? So many of us lost loved ones and could have turned and couldn't attend funeral rules, and you know whatever, because of the cold and stuff like that. So how are the churches assisting you know and helping with the grieving process? So anyone can start jeff, deborah or reverend kelly. You know, let us know a little bit about what you're doing. This is deborah garner from saint charles resurrection of saints parish and what I did so, if my eyes come off, the screen is because I prepared a document so that I wouldn't miss anything so occasionally I'll be looking down at my notes. Okay, so how are the seniors? Coping with isolation? Seniors had not necessarily dealt well with isolation. However. Some are now veering back to mass. The church has been extremely encouraging for our seniors, not to attend mass over the past two months, particularly if they are aged, have underlying conditions reported out by the CDC. There is an online mass offered each sunday for our seniors and others to view at 1 pm it's over zoom and I'm sorry the mass is actually there are. There are several. Let me say this: there are two locations: there's saint charles location, located at 142nd street between seventh and eighth and there's a resurrection location located at 151st street between seventh and mccoombs place. So, at the saint charles location, the tennis is the mass that is streamed and seniors, and others have the opportunity to look at those masses if they do not want to attend. The mass at saint charles are 7 45 a.m, 10 a.m and the masses at resurrection are at 9 30, which is the spanish mass and at 11 15, which is an english mass. So the seniors have an opportunity if they can come to church and we highly recommend they don't come to church if they have underlying conditions. However, the comfortability now in new york city, having less cases of Corona viruses at this present time and the extreme caution the church is taking with cleaning and disaffecting the church between the masses, the limits on attendance of each mass and at the two locations taking temperature checks at the door, handing out masses at the door handing out gloves if it's a necessity for those seniors of winning over more parishioners weekly. And lastly, there are groups in the parish that are calling seniors, weekly doing check-ins on them, as well as deacons, delivering holy communion to those seniors who are shut in or ill. The church is doing a phenomenal job at the grieving process. For many of our seniors, there was a special mass that was held in July, where members of loved ones were the only ones in attendance to that mass and those were family members who had lost either spouses or who had lost children, and that mass was very well attended, even by some of our seniors, because they knew that this was an opportunity for their church to do a memorial for their family, and they really appreciated that. Additionally, there's a group called the lazarus project, which is a ministry of consolation that has a virtual bereavement support group. They have scheduled meetings on saturdays between 10, 30 and 12 30, and the dates are available from September. The 12th through October one session, is in November there's a session between January, the 9th and February the 13th, and then the last sessions for the year would be may 15th through June the 19th of 2021. Lastly, there is a food pantry of both of our locations. One is saint charles and one at resurrection. Saint charles does a saturday distribution, hello, okay, saturday, there's the distribution at saint charles bar mayo and on tuesday there's a distribution at our other location, which is resurrection. Some of those members are also taken to the supermarket by some of those volunteers who are volunteering at the food pantry if they need additional items, and so if they need to go to the bank or if they need to do additional shopping, there are people at each location that will assist them. In that way, our health ministry is a referral service set up for social workers, psychiatrists and questions regarding medications for seniors or their aides. Family members set up doctors, appointments as well as aids, and the good thing there is all they would have to do is call the rectory say what their need is and directory will automatically send an email to that person in the parish who can help them with their specific problem of that particular time. Many of our seniors, particularly at saint charles, are savvy with technology, but there are still many seniors that are not most, who are not don't, have internet and find no need to incur. That course, because there's a course for internet. If you are, you know living with channel two three, four five, but you don't want spectrum or you don't want time warner, and so that's where the internet comes into play, so many are not interested in obtaining it because they're not and they're not interested in that recurring bill every month. So I don't know if there's going to be too much more, we can do about that because in order to have the technology for the zoom meetings or for internet, you do need an internet provider. Friends and family do help the seniors who have technology issues, but that is not coming or emanating from the church, particularly that has to be a friend or family member. That's willing to assist the senior in that regard, so I think that's it. I mean that's what we're doing at saint charles resurrection in all saints debra. You are mute. You are muted. I forgot I muted myself. Thank you. That was a lot of transformation and we appreciate that. Thank you so much deborah, and now we have the reverend, I'm sorry, pastor, khalifa khalil james from mount zion, amy, church, okay, pastor good morning and good morning, everyone amen praise the lord everyone. I am the pastor of mount zion and b church 116th street in madison. This is my. This is my first year amen pastoring in new york. However, I am from new york, but the amb church sends us out amen and I've been traveling, the amy church for 12 years pastored in newark, new jersey, philadelphia, germantown, philadelphia and also connecticut. This is my fourth pastoral charge and I was excited to get here in June been a year and in eight months, eight months into my tenure, we went into this pandemic, so many of my seniors were with the press. They were, they was anxious and they were. They were very isolated. They felt isolated. They felt alone during this pandemic amen, which start which started around March 13th for us when they declared a sturdy state of the emergency amen. We even had some bus trips play, it scheduled and we cancelled all of our trips- and you know, our seniors are very mount. Zion seniors are very close and very connected, so they look forward to sunday morning amen to see each other's face amen, so that was taken away from us. However, it didn't stop us from having worship amen. Many of my people became sick and because they were in that number of 65 and above many of them were fearful, they were traumatized. They were watching the news. They said they saw how schools were being closed and the church building was being closed and the travel bans. Many of them couldn't. You know couldn't find hand sanitizer and paper towels and lysol, and you know people are fighting over toilet tissue in the stores. So many of my people, many of my seniors, were very afraid, and many of them were in a home alone. They could their children couldn't even visit them, so they were in the house alone and many of them had family members who had contracted covert 19 as well as some of the members themselves were battling amen with Covid-19. So it was a very scary time for my seniors amen. Many of them was afraid they were going to die and they were dealing with. It was wrestling with that and it was wrestling with just about carrying just about everything that was going on with them with their family members, because some many of my seniors had children. That was essential workers that were who had who had contracted Covid-19, and they were in the hospital on these restorations and they couldn't even go visit them and you know so they was. It was afraid I mean so in the midst of that. I think we we started our online worship service and we realized and recognized very early that we had to do something every day for our seniors, so we connected with them every day at noon. From noon to two, we stayed on the phone and we just chatted. We talked, we read scriptures, we prayed and we also practice what I call mindfulness because- and that was just really breathing and really just bringing your body and your breath in your mind and your thoughts all to the same place. That was very helpful. One of many of my seniors said that was very helpful for them, because it's more of an inner prayer of contemplation and those would- and we learned how to center ourselves. So when those moments of fear and anxiety rose up in us, we can find our center. So that was very. That was something that I think was very helpful for our seniors, because they many of them couldn't even go to their doctor's appointments. They were just afraid they was living in fear, and so we had to deal with that and one of the things we did was we practiced. Mindfulness every day for about 15 minutes where we just sat and we just breathed, you know and we went through cement. We went through some some positive affirmations and just help people find their center and we continue to do that today, amen. So that was one of the things that we that we did to help our seniors wrestle with the isolation and the fear peace. Next, we begin to, we have a wonderful day. Church has a wonderful class leader system where we have members who are assigned to other members. So so I have 12 class leaders and they have in the membership, is breaking down is broken down into those classes, so every member has a class. So that's how we dissimulated information, because many of our members did not use internet, they don't have. They didn't, have zoom accounts, so you know we had to reach out to them. We had to make sure we mailed information to them made sure they all had communion make sure they all had food. We made sure that our food pantry remained open and then those who did not have enough. We made sure that we got that to them, so we pretty much took care of our seniors in this pandemic. We made sure all of our pits us seniors had masks. You know we had a maid for them, so you know, and we made sure they all had water and anything they need. You know we took care of them and because they have been like you said earlier in your introduction. It is the seniors that have carried the church right. So for so we had to carry some of our seniors through this season. We had to walk through them and actually be there for them and and stay connected and stay connected to them, amen and that that's really how we we weathered the storm and- and god has been good- you know because we have grown closer to each other as well as going closer to god. In the midst of this pandemic, all right amen, all right, debra, you I'm mute, I'm sorry, I'm a senior girl, so I forget. Sometimes I mute myself to unmute, but thank you so much that was so nice. I have a question about one of the things you said, but we have some additional members here. We have shawna hammond golf. If shauna you can introduce yourself, hey shauna from senator brian benjamin's office. Y'all can keep going I'll. Just tell my announcement after everything is over. Okay, thank you and we have kim parker and we have talora from canaan senior center hi guys if you can introduce yourselves hi guys hi, pastor james. How are you wonderful? I have a question. I try to get in contact with donna for the pantry. Yes still pantry still available or no we closed down for august, but and we're working some things out, so we should be open and by October all right. Okay, we look. Actually the one of the issues is volunteers, all right, okay, some most of my seniors are 65 and older. So I remember that, and today I usually come up there and help donna when we do it, for you know, kanan and stuff like that. So if you need before you know time we can, we can come and help you know okay, so I tell you what I'll reach out to you can reach out to me I'll. Give you my number, because that's one of that's one of the hold ups. You know that many of our members are older and they're just afraid to come out and serve right now, so you didn't get a chance to meet miss parker she's, my director, so I always, you know, inform her of what's going on and let her know and a lot of the seniors were asking about the pantry. So I did reach out to donna, but me and donna keep missing each other, but I wanted to introduce you to miss parker. So that way you can speak to her as well. Okay, wonderful, okay, wonderful! Do you have my number? You can get my number, but I have the church number. Let me give you my number, so you can call me you ready. Okay, all right! Yes, six, four, six, four, six, four one, eight four, one, eight, six, four, two, five! Four, two five got you! Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much thanks man. Thank you to laura you're, welcome, hi, everybody! Okay! Does anybody else come in okay? So go ahead? No go ahead. No, I was gonna say I'm gonna say it didn't make sense for me to say anything because laura said at all right. Thank you kim something. You said, pastor james about the mindfulness and taking a deep breath. Is that a type of touching? What is that? I know I'm no mind from this grew up, but I'm I do. I do take yoga and it's just about breathing and just finding your center. You know I've been taking. I've been I've been a yogi for about three years: hey man, that's just the beginner so, but it has helped me wrestle with my own anxiety, because I'm one who I shared at one meeting, that I'm one who suffers with depression and has great moments of sadness, myself so yoga and mind practicing mindfulness was a way for me to just find my center and to really embrace some of those negative thoughts and some of those things and that run through my mind, a man to sit present with them and not to run from them, but to sit present with them and to find out where they're coming from- and I found out that when I do that and when you embrace those moments, you rise with an adrenaline amen to you know those some of those deep moments of sadness, just after those moments become some of my greatest moments of productivity amen. So I'm you know. So I try to get there quick. You know, and I think that's what it is. We just need to embrace them and move forward. You know so I just I just shared my experience with people and it kind of helped some of them. You know some of them even shared with me. You know that they didn't even know how to pray until they went through that finding their center. You know- and I was amazed at that, because you're talking about people who've been in church, almost all their lives and say, listen pastor. You really taught me how to pray and it was not any no words. It's just getting in touch with your inner thoughts and your in your in who you are finding your core, and sometimes it takes some time to peel back the layers you know of who you are. But you know it's a beautiful experience and I just I it's a beautiful experience and I encourage anyone to practice. It amen. Oh a little bit on what deb garner said, our bereavement program the last now church. We are open to anyone and we do have people who come from the community to some of our sections they held on saturdays. You have to call a church and leave your name and number so that we will be anticipating your attendance that day, the telephone number for the church is two one: two, eight one twenty one hundred and it's for you to leave your name and telephone number to attend the bereavement sessions on saturdays, your name and telephone number, and for the past I think lazarus has been in making about eight or ten years, because I am a member of the last and we have catholics and non-catholics just people. You know and we'll certainly welcome you and right now. We can't you know we do everything on the phone and the website or zoom or whatever it is and if need be, like I'm one of the people who will call a family if they do not have that kind of a access to have someone to try to comfort them. Okay, so keep that in mind that we're open and we are at 211, west, 141, street, okay and 151 west. What's that just debit, 276. 151st, yes, uh-huh! All right! That's wonderful! That's a wonderful program and the fact that we still have it that that's good, because people need that. So that's that's wonderful, so the future of the churches. Well, I guess for the first of the year, so I guess it'll be zoomed and those who can come- and I guess maybe social distance, while they're there or and zoom, tell me about the future of your church. As you know it right now. I think it's going to be exactly how it is for a good while at both saint charles and resurrection, we've done a herculean effort to ensure all seats are sanctioned off with blue tape and, of course, to know where people would sit where families would sit. Families can sit together as a group, but excuse me if you come in singularly then there's a spot for you and you are six feet apart in both churches. Aisles are separated as well. You have a you, have a pew and then you have an empty pew. Then you have seats again, so it's really well distanced in the church going up for communion. We are sanctioned six feet apart in the middle of the aisle while receiving communion, and everyone is really following these rules. So well, it's like it's like it's always been like this and we know it hasn't you know, but it feels because it's working out so well. Everyone feels the safetiness in the church at this present time, which is great because we really thought we were going to have the most difficult time getting people back to church and we did from the first two masses, but I think word got around that. Oh, my goodness, you're sanitized, when you go in you, have a temperature check when you go in you get gloves if you want, but certainly a mask, if you're not wearing one, you cannot enter the church if your temperature is a hundred and over and so that's a steadfast rule. We just asked people please not to come if they're not feeling well, because we really don't want to turn away anyone, but at the same time we're not going to allow anyone in the church who has a temperature of 100 and more so, I think for the future. In the next months it's going to really be the same. I don't see how things will change. I think, as long as we maintain what we're doing in the manner that we're doing and we keep, we do it in a manner to keep everyone safe. I think that it will go on until it doesn't have to go on that way. You know I and I think, that's better than nothing. Personally, I couldn't wait to get back to church, like many of us couldn't wait to get back to church and we do know the seniors who are still not coming still miss church, but there are options for them and they are taking advantage of those options and as long as those options are available, I think we'll be mentally and spiritually fulfilled. You know, would you please mention about the music? Oh, the music, the music is it's interesting because, where both churches are used to full-blown choirs and right now, you know you can't have those choirs in the place like that, so every sunday each parish is doing alt. What is a alto, a soprano and a bass? I think, and each one of those three people sing with the musician and then the following sunday. Another three come in with the same musician and the music has brought everyone back to life. It really has you have more people singing, you have more people, you know moving in the pew, because you know this is the only time you can do it now. You know because it's a limited hour service, and so everyone is getting so much out of the music component thanks for bringing that up. Carolyn, because that's a really good point, the music just makes you feel spiritually connected, and it's been great. It's been great. Thank you so much. Thank you and one last thing. We have what we call the. What is it ministers of hospitality? Those are what we always know of as ushers, and they are the persons that we have to take directions from eve when they meet your door to take your temperature and they tell you where to sit. You know like one side, individuals as debbie said, and the other side is for families, but and they also lead the way for the acceptance of the communion, because you know you have to wait until they tell you come at your pew and move forward and everything and in resurrection church they also when you're going down to take your communion. They have a bottle of hand sanitizer and they sprinkle it on you. If you so desire- and I think that's been very helpful- and you know it's hard because you know I don't own a seat, but I'm a customer sitting in a certain place. You know- and you can't do that during this time you have to sit where they tell you to sit, because you might have the. What do you call the person who takes the pictures you know of the mask they might be there, but those they call ministers of hospitality. You know all right. That sounds good ministers of hospitalities. That sounds very good. Thank you for that miss mcbane hushes in some places. Thank you so pastor. James tell me the future right now we're not looking at mountains, we're not looking to open up right now we're holding out. We have a denominational structure and our episcopal leaders are not allowing us to open up at this moment, but we they did provide us with a guideline for opening. So we are prepared and we have been preparing. We have cleaned the church, we have sanitized the church. We have thrown away all the toys and things for our after-school program and we got all the bibles that were we had to get rid of them everything so we're getting new carpet, so we're just we're painting we're getting ready. We also brought the elec electrostatic sprayers where you can spray disinfect it between services, so we're doing everything we need to do to prepare to open, but we're still waiting for the clearance from our episcopal leaders. However, we do have procedures that are in place when we do open, for instance, for communion. We no one will come to the altar. You will have your communion when you walk through the door in a pre, communion cup and that'll, be the first order of the service is to get the communion out the way then we'll move on in the service. There will be no altar calls there. You enter, do one exit you and you enter to one entrance and you exit through another. So there's certain things that we have to follow and certain guidelines they have given us even to the to the cleaning of different surfaces. You know you have to use certain things, so it's pretty it's pretty comprehensive. So on any church. That's that needs it. You can go right online to the ama health commission, the amb church, health commission and it's a downloadable document all right. So it's the amb church, health commission, if you just google that you'll see the download document and any church can use it, it's very, very informative, all right, but but we're waiting as soon as we get that call. However, we do meet every other saturday. Members come out every saturday and we have meetups and we talk and we keep our distance so we're staying connected and you have to and we understand and that we are the church amen, not the building all right. So we know that the building is the place we where we perform ministry and we come together for corporate worship, but thank god for zoom in these platforms amen because we can have corporate worship, amen on zoom and do on conferences, phone conferences, and let me tell you something many times church many churches have missed their sick and shut in all right because they always depended on the pastor, the visit, the sick and the shut-in. I want to tell you that we have. We have increased our attendance without sick and shut and now they're able to be a part of the worship service. So now they feel reconnected to the church. So that's a wonderful thing. We have members who have relocated to the south. Now they have rejoined the church they've been through our zoom and they're with us every week. So, even as we move forward we're in the process of putting to putting a sound system in that has the virtual capacity, so even as we move forward, we can still be on zoom and phone conference and conference calls in our worship services providing this service as we move forward, because this is something that we always could have done. We just you know it took a Covid-19. It took Covid-19 and Corona coronavirus for us to do it amen, so we reconnected with our sick and shut in a major way amen because people in nursing homes now are able to experience our worship experience all right. So that's a wonderful thing. Thank you so much. That is a good thing. People who couldn't connect before can now connect via zoom, so that is wonderful and that's a good thing. So thank you for that. Monica I see she just got up. Okay, I wanted to okay. Is she coming back? Anybody have any questions in general for our guests, okay, yes, wilma! Thank you wilma. I had a difficult time. I was at another location earlier trying to work with you, so I apologize. So I got in a car and drove over here. Oh no problem. This is wilma brown she's, the director of central Harlem. I think that's your title. I don't want to direct the central hollywood executive director, I'm the executive director of super Harlem senior citizens center and, as we oversee four sites, that's beatrice lewis, located on 127th and third lincoln housing that is saint nick saint nick right over 130th and 7th avenue and our main office is kennedy center downstairs. We are renters central Harlem senior citizen, so we oversee four sites. I happen to sit on the department of aging commissioner cortez reopening of centers senior centers throughout the five boroughs. I sit on the task force meeting my part of that meeting and the last meeting we had was two weeks ago, which was an impromptu meeting because she was trying to get everybody on because it appears it appears that they are looking at reopening. Now. We hope, when I say, reopening, not the not seniors coming into the facility, because that stuff takes another step before we get to that point. But what we are looking at and what the department of aging and the commissioner is looking at is if we were to reopen, how would that look for central Harlem senior citizen, the four sites we had and understand? One thing: lincoln housing is under a renovation, so that site will not be open, probably to next year the three sites that we do have. We are looking at grab and go, which is a good thing, because that means we will be cooking our own meals, as you all know, that a lot of our seniors are not very happy with the meals that have been coming through Harlem, and that really is a catch and go. Some bills are good and but a lot of them are bad. So if we can get the commissioner and the mayor on board with grab and go, let us look our own meals, let's get our people outside, because some of our members are coming outside as some of us who are saying no, so we can set this up within the three sites that we have. That would be a great thing. Then. She went on to ask hey: when do you think if we were to do this and the mayor agreed? When do you guys think you can make this happen? A lot of these seniors? A lot of the executive directors online in the five boroughs said: hey I'm looking at November because you have to work with the vendors you can't just make this happen. You got to contact your vendors and get them on board and see what they have and what is the orders that we're ordering. So a lot of us said no, and she said okay. That sounds good, but I understand something guys Harlem, where we are located we're saying, grab and go in other areas, they're doing meals on hills in other areas. They could very well say hey. I want to be able to give our take our meals to us here in Harlem, where there is a necessity, my staff will be willing to take some people, their meals to their homes, but you got to understand a lot of, and only three are open. We do not have a lot of staff, so what we will probably do in those cases, probably our friend to come pick up their meals. We are willing to do that. Also, I wanted to throw out to you. The commissioner asked us hey along with your seniors, you're ready. A lot of seniors are not registered with this senior site. She asked us: are your sites able to take on additional people? And, of course I in my head we are able to. I have three sites that are open. We are willing to take on additional people as well and that and how they're looking at this, how they are looking at it is they're going to give us a list of names and understand those lists of names are going to go by zip codes, because what they're doing if, in fact, they start open up these senior sites that mean it won't be any other foods given out they're, actually leaving that up to all the senior sites, but yet who are not registered with us throughout the five boroughs so again, they're asking each site to take on additional people and central Harlem senior centers. We said definitely, but that is going to be based on the list they give us. It won't be based on the people. We all know who they may not appear on that list. I just want us to be careful with them. If their names are not those people, the list that they gave us give us we're, gonna have to go through them first and then those other people. We can add addition, we'll add those names to that list, because we know they're going to be names that are going to be dropped off so I'll. Keep you guys in the loop we're due to have another meeting. I think about the second week in October, but I'll keep you guys in the loop and right now we are open. We are servicing, but we only doing it by phone. Okay, and I thank you and feel free to reach out to me at any time. Thank you deborah for the call this morning. Thank you, mr evan. Miss brown. Let me ask you a question: where are they getting the names from if you, if they're doing it by zip code because well you know something I to be honest with you. I really don't know, and that is something I'm gonna have to ask them, because she did say she's right now, calling them additional people. I am throwing out there that, basically, I'm giving you saying the only way they're able to do that is by zip codes. I'm not too sure how they're going to go about making that happen. I really don't, but they have a assist. That's called stars. There's a system throughout this. It's like a regular system that we on the it's like. We call it stars. It's almost like one of those. If people look at all names all names, anybody who was getting any type of service- and that was not connected to these the sites and they can tr this. The stars is called the data track senior through your doctor's office. They can they can. They can track seniors through any system. If the senior is involved in a system, some way right, they're, crosstracking, they're, crosstracking them and that's how and I'm the one that's coming up well, wow. I know they can do the cross track. So if you got a doctor, if you receive some type of aid, if you've done that- and you were in this system, if you went to Harlem hospital, they can cross you, they can pull your name up through a crosstrack system and I'm thinking right loud saying. Well, how would they know who we have up here? The easy way to know is: go buy, zip codes, that's and I threw that out there if those who have medicaid medicare, that's called a crosstrack they're gonna. Do that, put their people together and pull all these names up, but the only way I mean the logical way is for me and that's why I'm throwing it out there is through your zip code. That's you know they go. Look at your medicaid medicare they're gonna go there. They're gonna, look who's on who receiving any type of aids and pull all those names up and they're gonna look at sixteen sixty plus, or is it sixty five? In other words, sixty plus okay, if you've been involved in a system any kind of way they could you know they can find us if you got eyesight. Thank you. Thank you. Wilmer also. I know the mayor had classes, you know about that, how I think they had offered us classes and by and you could pull Pacific data on Pacific population. So, like we'll say, if we are all in some type of system period from way back, we would be in the system. So it's just that: how did they capture it and pull it and then share it and stuff like that? That's just today, that's how it goes yeah. So thank you wilma. Thank you. Miss mcbain, o'neal, james o'neal, how you doing I'm doing fine. I know you're very involved with the u.n and the different programs on the aging right. Have you did I send you the October first announcement? I yes, okay, so just October 1st is the international day of the older person and everyone is invited to attend. This is a great way to get to the u.n, because you don't have to go there. You don't have to get a pass. All you have to do is register for the we call idop international day of the older person and you'll be given a zoom address that you just click on and go on, October 1st and it's from about nine in the morning until noon and very interesting lineup planned for the day, so hope everyone attends it's a safe way to do it and everyone's invited to attend james. You gonna furnish us with information yeah. I sent it to deborah to furnish everyone. I think she did. I send it out too I'll be forwarded to you, mr mcbain October. First, it is all right. Thank you. James you're welcome here mentor, laura how's your center doing just like what like mama said, I mean and we're sort of under this auspices right now we're not allowed to have the physical senior there and that's been a problem, because so many of them come by anyway, and then they don't they want to like you know they don't want to sit and they make excuses. We've actually tried to help out a lot of them by programming, their tablets or their phones, so they can get on their church services or do zoom classes, because we do offer tai chi on tuesdays and fridays at 10 30. We also have a movement speaks daily monday through friday, from 11 to noon. We've done. We have some nutrition classes, so we're trying to stay consistent because that's how different is kind of tracking our, I guess our progress and how you're actually getting paid through your funding through difter. So you know it's a work in progress because everybody wants to come back and all the seniors they call every day. Are you open yet? Can I come back they're bored under their minds and they want to do something and can we go to walmart? Can we I'm like? No? Not yet so yeah? You know. We've tried to have buses that would take the seniors to walmart and stuff, so that's barely missed, yeah, so yeah. So we were just trying to stay relevant because you know the whole thing is when I was talking to differ, you know with the mayor's looming budget cuts. You know we already had the majority of the senior centers do like a ten thousand, a fifteen thousand dollar cut in the food section and that's the weird thing they made a lot of senior centers had to cut their food line for the first quarter, because there was food, wasn't being cooked or bought. So we don't know yet I mean we may have more information, but we don't know where that's going yet and with the budget cuts looming that will affect us and when, with the blas de Blasio saying he'll see what happens in October, it's kind of gonna depend on how senior centers go forward as well. I want to say one thing regarding the cut and how you doing the cut they did the cut, but they gave money back to the people so again with the additional people and when the centers open for those sites that are going to be taken on additional. My understanding at this last meeting that they're not so much worried about that budget because they know they're going to have to give us money. So you have three sites, I'm sorry. Maybe you have three sites that may work to your advantage, because you have three sites and you're a little larger than we are, so it's a little different yeah. Yes, it's a little different, but I understand that we, I think we too, when it comes to food. We give you guys a little something too so we're all in this together. So let's sit down and talk some let's sit down and talk. Okay, thank you, you're a mute deborah we came. I can't hear some hang some banging outside. That's why I keep muting myself. They are doing the outside of the building, so they're doing the terrorists they're putting scaffolding on my terrace. So I have to keep every time I'm not talking. I have to keep this muted, so y'all wanna hear the hammering and stuff and they are out there somebody's out there colette. So thank you for that. I have to keep them when they went up. I saw them when they went up okay, so I have to keep muting them and stuff. So I know what you got for us. I just want to say really quickly well pastor khalil james he jumped off, but he did amazing and thank you, miss deb, for talking about how Covid-19 has affected the seniors and how you guys facility have increased your safety measures in order for people to feel safe when they come into your church, and also, I want to thank everybody who came out to senator benjamin's as long as well as first corinthians baptist church and dc nine's hope for Harlem event that we had this past saturday, where we gave away groceries hot meals, school supplies. We gave away baby items, adult items, feminine products, book bags to the entire community and that had took place on 119th between 119th and 120th. In st nicholas avenue we had about over 1200 people attend. It was a huge event. People are still talking about it today, shatek mitchell, the district manager was there as well. It was a great event fun by all. We had wbls radio station out there, and so we just thank everyone for coming out. We might do one again. It was a huge production. I know some of my seniors here gave us some call precautions when we were first planning this over two months ago on making sure we kept it safe, because the first group of people that I talked to about this was cb10s senior steering committee, because a lot of times at these big events that senator benjamin has is mostly our seniors that come out, and so I wanted you guys opinion. You guys gave me great helpful advice on how to maneuver this event that we did, and so we truly thank you one more update is our office is having a phone banking with census, NYC and that's going to be on monday September. The 28th the last day to complete your census is September the 30th. So we're doing that big push this week, we'll end next week too, before the census is stopped, so make sure you encourage your neighbors to complete their senses and tell them to tell their neighbors and friends and family to complete their census, because we get a lot of funding. Resources and representation comes for congress through the data of the census. So please let everyone know to fill out the census and also voting make sure people vote November the 3rd, and so that's all. I want to say thank you so much deborah for hosting this every month. Thank you. We appreciate it so much you're, always there with us, 100 valencia, what you have for us, I'm just here to listen to this morning, okay! Well, thank you, shanti. What you have you have anything for us kind of indirectly related. So there was like you said when the mayor's office, they do the demographics of the neighborhoods that's affected by Covid-19 central Harlem, east Harlem. We were one of the main areas that were affected so and I guess subsequently they decided to ramp up our trash pickups, because that was a big thing for us. We removed the trash bins off of our streets, but because we were identified as a a hazardous health area for covering a hot zone, a hot zone right they're, just gonna yeah they're gonna increase the pickups in our district, so we got a benefit out of a bad situation. You know through the Covid-19, but that was about it. Really I had in yesterday's newspaper, it did not mention the Harlem areas being one of the areas to get increased pick up. It mentioned the other bars, but it certainly didn't mention Harlem, because I read that myself in the daily news yesterday yeah, I had a district service cabinet yesterday and the mayor's office was on the call and they advised us that our district was one of the districts that was selected and if you look, if you look through the map, like deborah, said online you'll see where the hot spot areas are, so you can check it out, I'm for yourself yeah. I know where the hot spots are and I'm not communities, black and latino low economic areas. So can I ask a question: did when you in that survey? Did they say anything about the enormous amount of homeless that has just been dumped in Harlem, where it is just crazy, like that Lenox Avenue area and 116th and 8th avenue right on by graham court, there's a whole community that just moved in underneath the scaffolding they set up like a that's community board, another different community, but even like 125th, though not far from the state office building? Do you guys see it on linux over there by the wells? Fargo and everything has just like been I mean you could walk from 125th down to 1 12. and it's just a lot of homeless and I don't say, degenerate, but you know just lost folks that are talking about. I don't. I don't think that, like homeless people per se were dumped into Harlem and without what I can say is that a transitional men's shelter opened up on 110th street and Lenox Avenue. It used to be a house, a family shelter, but they made the dynamic and they moved the families out on the temporary play store to house men who have had the Covid-19 test, but they're not ready to be placed. So, on 110th street you'll see a lot of men there who go into that shelter they get in their test and they have to be quarantined for 14 days at that site and then they go to and then they're placed into permanent shelter. As far as, what's going on 124th street between Lenox Avenue 124th, the 125th, there are different type of clinics that are on 124th street. You have mental health facilities, you have methadone yeah, you have different clinics for drug addiction, so I don't think necessarily these people are homeless. I believe that they come from outer boroughs. They come. Sometimes they come from out of state and then they go to their programs and their programs just happen to be on 124th street. That's something that the community board. We fought against because we feel like if you're gonna put these type of services in our community, they should be equally distributed throughout the city, not just in Harlem, not just in the black and brown communities. Let's share the burden, you know put some of these facilities on the upper east side or the upper west side or Tribeca. But what happens is when you try to put those type of facilities in those communities they band together. They issue lawsuits just to prevent homeless shelters from coming in to pres, prevent these type of clinics and services, and then we fill the brunt of them because we're inundated with these type of clinics and facilities. But it's a it's a non-stop battle. I know the people and the residents in that community. They don't want it to get back to the days of the 70s and the 80s. There was a lot of lawlessness and there was a lot of you know: drug use and open drug markets so going forward we're looking to meet community board 10 public safety meeting as public safety committee, as well as the 28th precinct, we're going to have a meeting with the stakeholders that, in and around that block, including the mount morris park, improved improvement association. So we just ask our constituents to be vigilant. Whenever you see something, you know say something put in a 311 complaint, that's the biggest thing that we can do because the NYPD they respond off of the 311 complaints and a lot of times we're so used to accustomed to living in conditions like this that we don't even put in the effort. So I just I just urge everyone to just keep putting that 311 complaint. But listen. You know that corner right. There, 125th and Lenox Avenue on the uptown side street right there by the rooster and that other place. Oh yeah, and I think it's a disgrace that starbucks is still there, the man who's, they don't even have stools and starbucks anymore. The man stands at the door. He has a little sign outside and those people I mean you know when I have to wait for the bus there. I go protect him with my cane, my shopping, cart and everything because those people, those people they would come up to. You asking you to buy things and I was waiting on the bus. The rooster people were passing out food people in their little bags and some fight started, and luckily one guy he's. Oh we're not gonna. Have this here well, I said: well, let me move I'll walk to the next bus stop, but that place is a disgrace. But, as you say, it's not only people selling drugs. It's some of the people getting mental health, the bus for the mental health people, stop staying right, discharges them and picks them up right. Something needs to be right and plus now I don't notice for that, but they say one of those stores, they're selling drugs out of there too one of those old stores. It's really it's really a bad look for Harlem like that strip like what you're referring to in front of starbucks in front of red rooster area, the store that you may be referring to. It looks like a bodega or grocery store, that's in between and it's in between, starbucks and I feel bad for the business that are there and just normal people that want to occupy the street and pass by because it looks real bad. It's a lot of garbage out there. Sometimes I know a few months ago when there was a lot of restaurant activity. You see the garbage piled up on the corner. You see people hanging out from the police precinct standpoint. Loitering at one point was against the law. Loitering is not against the law anymore and they don't they don't enforce it. So you won't back in the days you may see the beat cop walk by with the night. Stick, he may say all right guys, keep it moving or get off the corner. You don't see that anymore. So because you don't see that type of enforcement, you see the crowds and you see people just standing and lingering, and they were even doing that in the months of March and April. When kovit was at his strongest right, that's right and the numbers were at the highest. It was. The site was the same type of activity and I just think these people they need help, and it's not a coincidence that they're standing there the reason they're standing there is because the facilities are right down the block. Is the facility open? Yes, okay, oh it is because it seems like there's so many out there waiting to get something as if the clinics are closed, and so because you hear them saying anyone got this. Anyone have that and they do it so openly. I mean I decided that I just can't do 125th street and lennox avenue anymore I'll, do 125th street and 7th avenue, because I don't even feel safe over there guys don't feel safe. It looks bad. I wish you guys could get them to change the location and move it somewhere else. Put it on 12th avenue somewhere over there by the water, something the thing is. We fought against it come in our community, but any community board that you try to put it in they're, gonna fight it as well all right. Everyone says I'm not in my backyard, not in my black and we're saying it's not even not in our backyard, we're just saying we don't want the majority. We don't want to hold the brunt. You know there's some community districts that don't have a single facility like this there's some community districts that don't even have a single shelter and they and they fight it. We just don't want to carry all of them right, that's not fair, exactly and I think something that chick said. We have to call three one more often, sometimes we so used to seeing it. We just turn our heads and keep moving and sometimes even if we move, because you don't want to call and report something right there, you could go home and just report it 3-1-1. Somebody was selling stuff. Somebody was laying on the bench thing somebody was doing this and that they need to get the calls and the complaints, because that adds up and we need to call and encourage people to call 3-1-1. It does add up, but the problem with it is, I know, like he's, dang they're, not interesting at standing around doing nothing. The police department is not enforcing that, and so, when you call 3-1-1, you have to say something specifically: that's going to get them motivated to transfer you to the proper agency. So maybe one of the things would be: there are an awful lot of homeless people on 125th street and lenox avenue. Could the homeless you know, department of homeless services come see. What's going on up here, I think you have to get other agencies involved other than the police who are not going to react because they can't move people anymore. But the thing is: if you with the 3-1-1 app, you can download the app on your phone or you can just do a traditional phone call. If you do a 3-1-1 complaint for street homelessness, they will have a representative come out within an hour. So if you see a man who sleeps in front of the wells fargo bank, they just ask that you describe his the way. He looks the clothes that he's wearing and the location. Within an hour, a street outreach, her outreach worker will come to the homeless person. However, it's up to the homeless person whether they would like to accept the services or not if they decline their services, then they'll just continue to sleep on the in front of wells fargo right, and not only that. I wanted to say that you realize how united has two interests. They have two buildings. One is around the corner from td banks and the other one is right there next to the eyeglass place, so you're gonna have a lot of them hanging around in front of the red rooster, starbucks things like that, because some of these facilities don't open up until 8 o'clock, 8 30 in the morning, so a lot of them have to get their methadone shots or their medicine or whatever. They call it nowadays and stuff like that, so you're going to have you're going to see a lot of them because of the fact that the center is like literally right there like this morning, I was walking past there from my class that I took in the morning, and you saw nothing but cops around with their captains trying to move the people on the street from off the from off the corner. Something must have happened, but they didn't arrest a lot of people, but they were just trying to clear the streets for people to get off the bus or coming from the train station. So another thing I just want to add is we have to realize as well that these are sick people and when I say I mean not just physically sick or mentally sick, and then we have an expectation that we put on them that they may not be able to fulfill or put on themselves. They don't they're, not in their right mind. You know to say you know what let me not lay here or not. Let me not stand there. Let me not do the things that I'm doing so the fact that they're in such a poor condition the focus, I think, should be to try to get them out of the condition because sometimes enforcement, you move them today, they'll be at another location. They close to use your example kim on 116th street at a in randolph square. They were used to him when they closed a phila, randolph square. They just navigated across the street in front of ram court. So it's really about trying to fix the people and give them services because they're in such bad shape and they need it more than anybody. So we just have to be I'm cognizant of that and hope that we can lead them to services. Thank you guys. That was a good discussion. Thank you. Monica I see you there. How are you doing monica you could take a I'll mute yourself, I'm good how you doing I'm good. How are you can you hear me? Okay, I'm good! I'm good there, where you at all right. Thank you. I see richard is on the phone richard. Are you still there richard? Yes, I am my apologies for being late this morning. I'm at the center today- and just there have been some things happening, is as we keep going, what I've heard from other people in terms of what we're hearing from seniors the need to connect the concern about reopening. When will it happen? When will it happen? When will it happen? Those are real things for us too right richard is from afa randolph senior center at 146th street. Richard are you up? Do you have any online zoom classes, October, 1st, okay, we're working we're working on putting stuff together right now and we're expecting to have a calendar for the coming months? Okay, I mean we're doing some connecting right now, with conference calls and some of the some more limited things, and we know we want to be stepping that up. Thank you. Thank you, richard colette, how you doing I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm just waiting for something to happen. I don't think I don't know if the center's gonna open for this year or I guess we gotta- wait to January to find out what's going on, but I'm just waiting to see what what's gonna happen seem like. The mayor is more interested in the school kids because he got to get them back to school and he got the seniors. I guess on the bottom of the list, we're not the main priority. I guess so. I'm just waiting to find out what's happening. That's all! Well! We got to make some noise, so we need to be a priority. Miss mcbain, how you doing I'm doing fine, I'm doing fine. Okay, is the bottle stuff still there at the supermarket. I ain't starting no stuff, but bottom, I'm asking the lord. Let me keep my spirits in the right word about my hand, so no they're closed they closed. Are they close? Okay? It's close! Okay. They're closed, okay, good! Okay, so you goodness is the sidewalk clean? No, but that's another story, all right. One thing at a time: one thing at a time all right, okay, but it's one thing. I want to say about the churches, and I think debbie can speak more to this than I can. We do encourage our people after mass not to congregate. Maybe you can speak to that deborah. Oh, yes, there's! Absolutely! No congregating! After mass you go in you wave, you do your spiritual service, you receive your holy communion and you wave to people as you continually to walk down the block. There is no congregating. There is no talking in front of church. If you want to talk, you can walk and talk, but in order to keep the distance of the church safe for everyone departing, everyone must keep it moving, and so another thing that has been working really great people have learned to call one another who you normally would only see on sunday. But you didn't finish a conversation. So phone numbers are being exchanged between parishioners that hadn't necessarily been done before, because you knew you would see them the following sunday and you would catch up. So there are a lot of great things that have been going on forced through corvette 19, but nevertheless keeping people tightly knitted. And if I, if I'm looking forward to hearing your story, then just call me after church- and we can talk about that, because we can't stand here and chit chat right now. So it's been great, you know, I think that's a good point. Thank you, carolyn! Thank you! Okay! Thank you kim. I don't know what happened to your pastor. She was supposed to be on this program this morning. I heard reverend reverendly. Could I say this and no disrespect? Half the pastors in our church. Don't know what's going on, so they couldn't tell you, because I mean I mean reverend watson. No, that's reverend marshally watson, yeah! That's my that's my neighbor! That's my buddy, but probably she didn't come on because since pastor johnson has not told anybody what's going on can't anybody communicate what's going on all right, okay, all right! So, okay, so we did good sometime. Other things come up, so we did good. Nevertheless, donna gill, are you still there? Yes, deborah, I'm still here? Okay, so how's everything going with you, everything is fine. I'm glad I've actually left information and glad to hear that everyone's fine and the things that are going on for the seniors at churches. I we have to keep in mind that a lot of seniors may be technology challenged, so we not may not be reaching everyone, but the things that are going on is actually great. I'm I you know, I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to speak to pastor james. You know, because I would like him to give us some more information about his mindfulness training and you know, come and give us an example. So we can move forward or we can help our seniors in this time of fear and uncertainty so that they can calm their minds and you know reconnect with the spirit. So thank you, ladies everyone and gentlemen for your for your information. It was actually very good. I'm doing fine, I'm still checking in on the seniors that I know to make sure that they're, okay and you know just making phone calls like deborah said. You know people who would not give you their phone number have now given out their phone numbers because they realize that this is a way to keep in touch with with everyone. So it's actually, the pandemic has created a lot of uncertainty, but it has also brought a lot of people a lot of seniors together and looking forward to getting more information from everyone. I thank you. Thank you devil. Thank you, donna. So, just one more note, one of our members, I speak to her weekly, miss nixon celebrated, her 100th birthday that one that was a big celebration yeah.
