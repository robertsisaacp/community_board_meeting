Well I'm a resident here in the in the community, I've, been trying to monitor your regular emails and news and bulletins and all that, but I'm a little bit concerned for some of the children who might be falling behind with the school sure tutoring or any That's a one concern!
It's best that you go to one that maybe that's closest to your neighborhood, to find out different aspects, especially of the bonus I, think that a major concern with a lot of people is students falling behind, and I noticed on the new york public library website that they have quite a bit of homework, help and mentoring.
That's based in harlem It's, a virtual learning program designed to help middle and high school students pass their classes.
Also, first, vice president of the board, he's a member of the education committee He's also a teacher in new york city, public schools.
What's going on with dallas teacher and also what's going on the front lines with teachers, I mean the new york city, public schools, in collaboration with the teachers union, we did initiate a program to try to create some support and homework.
When the pandemic took place, it we shut down dollar teacher and were really not necessarily equipped to go online to begin supporting students as we should have been able to, and so now they created a system within you know a month or they had a system that was in test phase, but they pretty much accelerated, getting it operating to create dollar teacher.
It certainly has increased traffic a lot more, and so it seems to be doing pretty well now, and that's just one support to assist parents and students in school who might need extra help, and it goes from four to seven every day after school.
They were really talking about the gap amongst our students here in harlem and that it seems to be winding during this pandemic, and you know what can we really do to I mean, It takes way more than teachers are gonna, be policy makers.
Really, this today, I didn't get all the ability to read through the whole thing, but we do know that they want to increase the amount of students in summer school right, but right this is going to be remote, so we're going to be dealing with some real hard challenges.
Okay, great also, as you guys, know, people on the committee we did have our summer.
That's being run by young people who are who will be talking about what the summer youth employment program means to them.
So I would ask you all to invite all of the young people that you know and get on the call yourself as well as their parents, because it's going to be a great event.
You know it's kind of tricky because folks are losing a lot of funding, and so it's hard to necessarily see for sure what the summer is going to look.
Lot of teachers are worried about that because they want to be in the schools that they are in, but they could potentially be accessing, doesn't necessarily take them out of a job.
Have anything to say about that conversation before we move on Or they're supposed to have ambassadors go around and deal with the mask and all of that, She wanted to be on the call tonight, but she had a conflict and she- And I chatted today and I'll- make sure that you know she did send me a draft of a proposal that I'm going to sit up, send out to the committee.
I have sort of breached, brought up the idea with the board about, maybe because I think that, because no summer youth program there's always a lot of organizations in harlem that are given our backpacks full of school.
The committee had talked about this before doing some kind of forum to just inform our community about trade schools that are available.
So food is always good , I mean my concern has been for the kids of this neighborhood Just you know when I heard the summer youth employment program was, but You know, I want to see how I can volunteer and offer some resource in terms of educating and things like that.
