Well I'm a resident here in the in the community, I've been trying to monitor your regular emails and news and bulletins, and all that but I'm a little bit concerned for some of the children who might be falling behind with the school sure tutoring or any That's a one concern!
Things of that nature that you can go on in your community I think that a major concern with a lot of people is students falling behind and I noticed on the new york public library website that they have quite a bit of homework, help and mentoring.
It's a virtual learning program designed to help middle and high school students pass their classes, They have a rolling admissions policy and you have fly, and so just wanted to point out that I see that leona willis said where the links in there.
The district manager for community board 10 is going to put them in again He's a member of the education committee he's also a teacher in new york city, public schools.
He is also involved with a teacher which has just been reignited What's going on with dallas teacher and also what's going on the front lines with teachers, I mean the new york city, public schools, in collaboration with the teachers union, we did initiate a program to try to create some support and homework help We had our famous dollar teacher program , That's been enacted in place for many years as a collaboration between the teachers union and the department of education to support students with homework, and that was great kindergarten or pre-kinder pre-k to 12th grade in several languages When this because it was operating on a very antiquated system, though, when this, when the pandemic took place, it we shut down dollar teacher and were really not necessarily equipped to go online to begin supporting students as we should have been able to, Getting it operating to create dollar teacher Now, dial teacher is operating to provide homework, help and I sent the link tutorteacherorg You know anyone, but it's limited right now, as we're kind of testing it out to see about phone call, I'm engaging how many students actually log in to get homework, help and parents as well are getting support, and so it's mostly elementary school kids, even though I could say that was always the biggest call group anyway I mean the DOE did go putting it out and they tried to put it out in the course the last week or so for the first two weeks it was operating with hardly any students calling it you know.
Really this today, I didn't get all the ability to read through the whole thing, but we do know that they want to increase the amount of students in summer school right, but right this is going to be remote, so we're going to be dealing with some real hard challenges.
I know some schools that have in the parent teacher conference and we're just focused on parent outreach right, whether they be phone calls emails, we're going to try to do as much as possible to get in contact with students and parents to see if we can pull them back in, because, at the end of the day, we've been given instructions that anyway, we're continuously be positive, that we really can assure you that you can pass, and that's really the truth, because you can't fail based upon what new york city's outlined right.
Meeting at the beginning of the month sent it to all of our local elected officials so that they know we support that, that's being run by young people who are who will be talking about what the summer youth employment program means to them.
Think the ipads they recently gave or the new things those were probably open a little bit more, but a lot of kids got laptops and things straight from their school too right before we tried to give as many as possible I've heard from some parents who were already keeping their kids home right before the lockdown, so they weren't there that last day for their kid to get You know there's not even that type of system in place where we could bring where a student could say.
You know this new illness, that's affecting our young people, that's a major concern and just trying to find ways that we can be proactive before students get back to school.
