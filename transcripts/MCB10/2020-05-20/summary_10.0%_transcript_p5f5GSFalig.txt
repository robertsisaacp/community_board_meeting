Well I'm a resident here in the in the community, I've, been trying to monitor your regular emails and news and bulletins and all that, but I'm a little bit concerned for some of the children who might be falling behind with the school sure tutoring or any That's a one concern!
It's best that you go to one that maybe that's closest to your neighborhood, to find out different aspects, especially of the bonus I, think that a major concern with a lot of people is students falling behind, and I noticed on the New York public library website that they have quite a bit of homework.
You talk a little about that offering within the New York public library, system, okay, so one thing We do have the the teacher's help the ABC mouse.
That's based in Harlem It's, a virtual learning program designed to help middle and high school students pass their classes.
I hate to ask you to do this, but could you put them in again The links are only visible to the people that were in the meeting when the when the links were put in so Shetty Mitchell who's, I appreciate that, because it's a lot of headache, while he's doing that, I'm going to ask member Marquis Harrison Marquise Harrison, is a member of the board he's also first vice president of the board, he's a member of the education committee Also a teacher in New York City, public schools.
What's going on with Dallas teacher and also what's going on the front lines with teachers, I mean the New York City public schools, in collaboration with the teachers Union, we did initiate a program to try to create some support and homework.
As we're kind of testing it out to see about phone call, I'm engaging how many students actually log in to get homework, help and parents as well are getting support.
It certainly has increased traffic a lot more, and so it seems to be doing pretty well now, and that's just one support to assist parents and students in school who might need extra help, and it goes from four to seven.
I did not get all the ability to read through the whole thing, but we do know that they want to increase the amount of students in summer school right.
Your point, I just want to say a couple of things that if any of any child student still needs ipad, they're still available.
She, wants to make sure that there's some kind of summer learning plan put together for the students to make sure that they achieve whatever it is that they're supposed to achieve and to identify the process for which we're going to find out whether or not it's completed.
As you guys, know, people on the committee we did have our summer youth Employment program letter was approved by the board at the General Board meeting at the beginning of the month, sent it to all of our local elected officials, so that they know we support that.
Okay, there's an event on Saturday That's being run by young people who are who will be talking about what the summer youth employment program means to them.
Would ask you all to invite all of the young people that you know and get on the call yourself as well as their parents, because it's going to be a great event.
As for the summer, youth, employment, program, no, not if anything, I, mean, there's still some advocacy going on around people trying to put pressure on the mayor and all the powers that be to do.
You know it's kind of tricky because folks are losing a lot of funding, and so it's hard to necessarily see for sure what the summer is going to look.
While we're talking about students being behind there's a lot of talk of accessing teachers, staffs, getting smaller and potential layoffs, obviously- What is a school who's already short on certain things.
Lot of teachers are worried about that because they want to be in the schools that they are in, but they could potentially be accessing, does not necessarily take them out of a job.
Have anything to say about that conversation before we move on Or they're supposed to have ambassadors go around and deal with the mask and all of that , She wanted to be on the call tonight, but she had a conflict and she- And I chatted today and I'll- make sure that you know she did send me a draft of a proposal that I'm going to sit up, send out to the committee.
I have sort of breached, brought up the idea with the board about, maybe because I think that, because no summer youth program there's always a lot of organizations in Harlem that are given our backpacks full of school.
So food is always good , I mean my concern has been for the kids of this neighborhood When I heard the summer youth employment program was, but You know, I want to see how I can volunteer and offer some resource in terms of educating and things like that.
