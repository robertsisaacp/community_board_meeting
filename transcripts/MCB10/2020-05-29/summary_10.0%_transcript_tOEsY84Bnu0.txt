I know right now in houses in situations, and they do have some hotlines if you can call, but unfortunately, in our community we tend not want to go to get professional health You know that's going on in the news and around us, and so many people in our community do need immediate support, so I just got off a conference call, for example, with jimana Williams office how to call on domestic violence You know just talking about the needs of people within their own homes.
Okay, we have 12 folks on we're just going to wait for a couple more people Thank you for sending the agenda out with that agenda for today's meeting should have also been the June calendar, but if we can just get back to shot eek or Juanita about the dates for the meetings that we want to have, that would be great for the June calendar and we can get those set and put those zoom links in there, so that the community will know that we are still meeting so we'll go ahead and start with my report.
so thank you and we will as soon as everyone's answers that, or at least you know, a majority of people answer that we'll get that date set out for you Finally, there has been a proposal headed up by the Manhattan borough president's office and the Uptown committee boards to have a forum on social distancing You all have you all have seen the neighborhoods knows know what's going on and with everything reopening you know, there's mixed messages in the community about what's actually happening, what's open and when we try to increase these opening, especially with open streets with the restaurants, maybe spilling out into the street Now. We want to make sure that we're able to support our economic development but at the same time social distance and stay safe, so we're doing a forum on that.
immediately I know that dr Dukes, our Michelle Booker, the vice chair of the Health, Committee and others, are gonna work to set up a plan to see how our community members could reinstate the ward, because, from my understanding it was already aboard I'm presently up-to-date over 5000 seniors have died in nursing homes throughout the state.
You know in this fiscal year of course ends on June 30th thing start in July, first this fiscal year, and that the UM, the city will be deeper in debt and I personally think that education should never be on from the table because already with we have the largest school system in the country, with over a million students- It normally does community for back-to-school supplies is going to be even greater and I'm, hoping that this board will support the Education Committee and because we want to have the back school program and a sister Of course.
I know at my a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, Also I can say that Abyssinian the people on the call or putting together food pantries, it's gonna, be the boys Agora The, three boys and girls, clubs and the in the community are going to be doing, but I definitely will follow up with them tomorrow, Karen and ask them because they do give an update every third day about.
A. Spectrum is offering free services to students that are at home, that don't have it and can't afford it, and it is This is something that marquis talked about at our committee meeting this month about students not finding in, and then there were members in the committee In right summer, they've also been told a message to the city of New York It's, because somebody is really not letting someone know that they need it, but they also just may not be aware, because the resources were there in some sense, People are signed to just calling school aides using every resource in our buildings to follow and track with parents So. Those are probably the people we haven't gotten yet It's not conducive to going to do house business as we used to do.
There's, a report from Health and Human Services I Don't think that I'm Karen Dixon Michelle book or Cheryl Smith on the call I just wanted to go ahead and piggyback on what shotty ket said earlier, kudos to the Health and Human Services Committee for getting the reinstatement of the cab for the nursing home I was on one of the original cabs for the nursing home I know how important it is for us to have access and to have the conversations with the administration for the nursing home We had a meeting yesterday and did discuss some open streets The community had wanted to know more about what the format is and then also the issue of the incident with the woman in Central Park, who fortunately accused a black man of what was she saying she threatening her life and that just snacks of you know, through the years of the these serious accusations that can lead to death or just devastation people's lives This should be something that should be addressed in public safety, because even though the woman did have some consequences, it should be illegal for someone to do those kinds of things We did get authorization to do that from the executive committee and we are now at the point where again we have this to stakeholders with mr stakeholders and community partners, we'd like to have on the subcommittee, so ballistas will be coming out and we would like for the board to send out a letter of invitation to these subcommittee members So. As a committee, we decided it was a good first step to just adopted resolution, George Raft, a resolution so that the community board as a whole could be on board with what we're doing Basically, my report, The draft resolution, I believe karyn air The board, received the draft resolution So this is, we didn't have quorum in committee, but the concern was to go ahead with the draft and we're sent the draft There's.
I know that there are a couple of community boards that are doing forums around it right now, so we know that there are issues with open streets, so D-O-T, hopefully, will do a brief free presentation at our general body meeting and then follow up with us at the transportation meeting One of the things that the borough president did highlight was that open streets as it is now Sutter Street, is open to allow people to social distance and get out of the house, and you know just enjoy the outside What.
We as community boards want to recommend that we are intimately involved in those discussions about what restaurants, what streets and how will that look as they start to use a lot of our public spaces for this it could be in parks and plazas all over trying to allow like eating areas or open-air cafeterias.
I know she was on here earlier for her service There's, a lot of things going on, and it's important that we're able to want to take care of the punic community, but also engage in self care.
Give me a second okay, also things that I requested believe the office staff is working on a excel sheet of city agencies having to do with economic development and technology, as well as organizations in the district Also a list of small businesses I'm trying to get from the borough president's office to also add to this document.
These are the bills from Inez office that she sent over and we'll have a lot of pushback from the community and they come into the community board to scream at us So. What I've done is I've tried to create a way for them to vote on the actual bills and allow us to create a report that we can give to the elected officials that show the people who are actively coming to this committee meeting and that are, you know, interested and what's happening in the community.
I'll create the page to add to it in terms of what how you know where people can go for resources for small businesses, So at our meeting, Charles Powell presented from Harlem chamber around PPP, and also he mentioned that he was a part of the Harlem Renaissance - that was being organized Michelle, reported from SPS office on the heroes act and a few other eggs I have to leave in a second Also.
You see, you know Caucasians and other people that are literally you know violating the social distancing on restrictions they're trying to avoid as much physical contact you know and that regard as possible, because I believe xxxii had over 50 officers who had tested positive So That was the response, but that was one of the ricchan CERN's that even what the public members brought up and also, first of all de Blasio said no more summonses and I want to see police officers giving out mass like they're doing in Central, Park same treatment, same city, same treatment, no I'm definitely will follow up on that too As far as with it , it's that's an instruction from the mayor Are they doing to help support that initiative?
What's gonna happen, we want to make sure that we're able to continue to meet and be safe, so they're asking for the governor to extend it until we are, you know, safe, a vaccine or when so appropriate We, the chairs of the community boards in Manhattan, are signing a letter asking the governor to extend it and even when we can come back, we still need to social distance.
Some people come in if it gets at that point and I still be able to vote Is this coming out of a committee, or is this just attached to It was part of the chairs report and I was looking at my agenda and I'm going to go ahead and sign the letter of support Not until you know we are able to come together in somewhere, so we are going to continue to social distance You know, because we are in this situation, it's best to make plans now or in the chance that we are able to do that, and you know.
Even if we are getting a situation where people can come back out, we don't there are gonna, be some folks that don't want to just to put it You know point-blank, but they still want to be a part of the community board, a part of society and able to give an opinion and I think we also should stay on top of the research that shows that the virus is more susceptible to the virus in closed spaces than they are an outdoor spaces You know we want to make sure that we're able to you know social distance and not being probes closed spaces for prolonged times , We just haven't been able to vote Did. You want to finish tonight with your report?
I think you know, I open it up to anybody else who might feel differently in the area of housing, and that's all I want to report and just to thank everyone for continuing to come onto these calls.
Lisa I, don't believe, there's a report from personnel Thank you for Denis for letting me know the general board agenda, Please, look at it and let Shattuck know when you're gonna have your meetings and then let's talk about any resolution so right now we only have one voting item and that will be for the exonerated five out of parks and then we will have hopefully a presentation from open streets at our general board meeting Is there, any old business hearing, none we'll move on to new business?
