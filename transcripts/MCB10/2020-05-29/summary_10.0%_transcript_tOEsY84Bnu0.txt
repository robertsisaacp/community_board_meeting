You know just thinking about what people are going through right, now, But I try to stay positive, And I grieve for people who can not read their lost loved one or not there, because that's very difficult.
You know that's going on in the news and around us, and so many people in our community do need immediate support.
So that the community will know that we are still meeting so we'll go ahead and start with my report.
All of our committee chairs our executive team for getting out there getting the technology getting the technology set up and being dedicated to being there for the Harlem community being dedicated to the issues being dedicated to keeping our meetings when they are scheduled, so I think for the last month and some forms all of the committees met, and we did get a shout out for that.
It is important for us to stay near and dear to the community to continue to have our committee meetings because there are so many things going, on, and so many things are changing in a brief.
But I believe we should still continue to meet in our committees to still handle the business of Harlem to still be there for constituents, because you know, unfortunately.
So I know that some of the committee chairs might want to discuss that I've talked to a few of you offline And There's a lot going on my job as well.
What's going on and with everything reopening you know, there's mixed messages in the community about what's actually happening.
Now, we want to make sure that we're able to support our economic development but at the same time social distance and stay safe, so we're doing a forum on that.
If there are issues that are touching on a committee that they might not know, about, I think it's important for us to have a conversation in this EC meeting, because we're all on different calls all have different subsets of friends and organizations that will let us know and influence our knowledge of Covid-19 and what's going on So, it's important for us to have a conversation in this forum.
It's, going to be one second, so You may have heard this, but for the greater community I know you seen the news story on that came out about the nursing facility on 138 Street in our community , broad district, where they had a lady video, taped, 20, dead, allegedly 20, dead bodies being carried out of this facility on this nursing sensor.
Since that time we had divided the administrator and the general counsel of that nursing Center on to Army Health and Human Services Committee meeting, which happened on last Monday, and they you seemed willing to set up an advisory board for the facility.
I know that Dr. Dukes, our Michelle Booker, the vice chair of the Health Committee and others, are going to work to set up a plan to see how our community members could reinstate the ward, because, from my understanding it was already aboard To- date.
If you can not say safely separate at home, you can contact New, York, City, Health and Hospitals, and they will get you placement in a hotel and also we're doing tests and tres community center a test and tres Community Advisory Board, because we want people to get the jobs from our community as far as testing and tracing the Covid-19 maintained.
It normally does community for back- to- And I'm, hoping that this board will support the Education Committee and because we want to have the back school program and a sister, Nobody , here, I, think we should check in our district to see if our students have the equipment that they need, because in some instances you have multiple families- You know moves on to give to different for other types of distribution.
That might be another you to find out who needs, equipment and I know we have the teachers, but Maybe after school hours, tutorial programs, because it's difficult well one thing that I think that it is difficult than one thing that I talked about at my meeting this month was a lot of the services that are available and there are a lot of a services that are available.
They offer that and I sent that list out to my entire committee as well as ask anybody else that was on the call if they wanted, that list to put their email in the chat So there are, there are things out there that are out there that are free and in our community that are Because I know, parents who say they have to like you, then teach so that they can then teach their kid out of it.
The community had wanted to know more about what the format is and then also the issue of the incident with the woman in Central Park, who fortunately accused a black man of what was she saying she threatening her life and that just snacks of you know, through the years of the these serious accusations that can lead to death or just devastation people's lives.
I know that it was a talk at Community Board meeting that has now come into a committee form This is a voting item.
We really have a report, but again the update of open Street, so I just wanted to talk to all about it.
I know that there are a couple of community boards that are doing forums around it right now.
So we know that there are issues with open, streets, So, D, O- T, hopefully, will do a brief free presentation at our general body meeting and then follow up with us at the transportation meeting.
Sutter Street is open to allow people to social distance and get out of the house, and you know just enjoy the outside.
We as community boards want to recommend that we are intimately involved in those discussions about what restaurants, what streets and how will that look, as they start to use a lot of our public spaces for this it could be in parks and plazas all over trying to allow like eating areas or open- air cafeterias.
There's, a lot of things going on, and it's important that we're able to want to take care of the punic community, but also engage in self care.
Give me a second Also things that I requested believe the office staff is working on a Excel sheet of city agencies having to do with economic development and technology, as well as organizations in the district.
So this will be the economic development and technology and communications I'm sorry, so they'll be like the paragraph every month about what's happening in the committee.
What I've done is I've tried to create a way for them to vote on the actual bills and allow us to create a report that we can give to the elected officials that show the people who are actively coming to this committee meeting and that are, you know, interested and what's happening in the community.
And, then I also have the economic development committees within the City Council, the Congress Assembly in the state, so that our constituents can also know where to reach out that information is also interactive.
You know what is it that you feel that the district needs I do not have a question, but I just want to say great job nice little assess.
The 75% of employees for one business are coming back so that, in that there were some deficiencies with the PPP, so definitely getting direct support and getting direct influence from the community or way in from the community is going to make a major impact on reaching out and getting to the elected officials and letting them know exactly what is needed.
I just want to ask I heard PPE, but you Is there a way to up to Harlem organizations like Carlin, Business, Alliance or Charles, even greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce to find out which businesses in the area have been denied PPP and what the situation is and going forward.
I know that street corner resources as mass on different churches, some have a mass I think the greater Harlem chamber comments as well, but this is what I'm saying it's when you see in Central , Park white police, officers, giving out white You know for our social distance, Yes, I.
You know, year and past four previous months, we've had issue with representation from 32nd and 28th I'm, hoping that same energy transfers over to a connect for this month coming up, Thank, You, Charles, really quickly, Then we're going to move to housing and land use.
Our support, but I wanted you all to know about it that we are going to continue to reason why we can have these virtual meetings.
What's going to happen, we want to make sure that we're able to continue to meet and be safe, so they're asking for the governor to extend it until we are, you know, safe, a vaccine or when so appropriate.
The chairs of the community boards in Manhattan, are signing a letter asking the governor to extend it, and even when we can come back, we still need to social distance.
We want to be able to have virtual or hybrid meetings where some people stay home.
Not until you know we are able to come together in somewhere, so we are going to continue to social distance.
You know point- blank, but they still want to be a part of the community board, a part of society and able to give an opinion so they're going to have hybrid meetings, but that's not until down the road, because, right now we are staying virtual And I think we also should stay on top of the research that shows that the virus is more susceptible to the virus in closed spaces than they are an outdoor spaces.
Think you know, I, open it up to anybody else who might feel differently in the area of housing, and that's all I want to report and just to thank everyone for continuing to come onto these calls.
Look at it and let Shattuck know when you're going to have your meetings and then let's talk about any resolution.
So we have someone from Manhattan legal, that's going to do the cares, act and all of the legal issues and as well as housing court, and he also will talk about HDFC shareholders who people do not understand or actually tenants, and most of you know, Oxana from community service, Society, Min, She's, a policy expert, just came out with a new report today on the two federal bills and the two state bills, so she's going to come and give a discussion on the policy and legal issues.
None I will entertain that there are a lot of housing forms You know one of the things that we can do as the community is trying to attend.
