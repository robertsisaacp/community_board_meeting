In the best interest of the community, we serve tonight, we'll have a range of things we'll be discussing in our meeting and look forward to a robust conversation being that said.
Other members will be joining me tonight who are part of this committee, which is Paula, Christian, Lisa and Edith, and now I want to give.
I'm, also like fairly new to the Community Board Darrell reached out to me in regards to joining this committee and like with like the little like overview and stuff that we had of it.
And I think that there is like definitely work to be done.
Are you hi, good sorry, I think, like a minute trying to figure out how to do that.
I think it's important that we, you know kind of deal with this head-on and work to try to to become more unified, and.
We do find something it needs to be justified, and you know I look forward to working with you and seeing what we can do to make this board one happy family.
I'm sorry, a gender, so I think that alone is like an issue: who's this.
All, right, great, so description of committee, the equity Committee is committed to addressing racial and gender-based disparities and improving equitable outcomes in the community.
Okay sounds good all right, Kristen, please continue sure I'll continue reading, so the responsibility of the equity committee will focus on identifying discrimination or harassment, raising awareness of implicit bias and eliminating or mitigating racial and gender inequity or its effects across our district.
The equity committee will make recommendations to the board on aspects related to racial and gender equity and the equity policies within all programs and select community-based activities and entities.
Can the equity committee will be responsible for maintaining a reconciliation commission that is responsible for delivering a yearly assessment of budget parity, ensuring that all the that the budget requests our board puts forward our balance, seeking to establish even distribution of funds, equality and equity of our board, ensuring that the current board and future boards accurately represent the racial, gender and other demographics of our community by ensuring that Overton, embedded racism, sexism and other inequities are not included in our bylaws website.
This is a framework, so this meeting, we're going to you know enhance some of these item points to make sure it's going to work for the board.
You know for making it broader, but can we think of it more from a human rights perspective, just treating everyone as human.
What we mean by that is, you know ultimately and analyzing the membership and the community distribution and social media profiles we're referring to the board jeremy.
I want to discuss with everybody right: now, analyzing membership, let's start off with analyzing membership and community distribution.
I, do not think that I do not know how quickly census results will be available, probably not in time, but I think it would be helpful to get the census numbers to see how this is reflective of our community.
You know, there's a lot of people that I feel like we can engage more to get on.
Let me share again because so 2010 census, you know obviously I think that would be a model.
You know getting civically involved, so I think our outreach to the younger generation too, would be great to get their opinions on the board.
You, know our communities and what we're seeing right now a lot of people are engaged, especially in this last election.
There I think that we definitely identify a priority which is to engage younger members of the board.
I would say that if that is one of the first priorities of this committee is to, you know ensure that we bring age parity to our board.
I'd say that you know the place is where we want to be looking for folks between the ages of 16 and 30, who are who are part of these demographics that are not that are not represented.
Conversations around gender are becoming increasingly nuanced and having someone who can speak to those issues on our board is an asset to all of us and to our community, then I, look.
That does not mean we should not look for them, but you know I, think that younger middle eastern members of our community clearly make one of our top priorities for recruitment.
You know these conversations are not always going to be easy, right, because I think I think problems if I could jump in for one second.
I did not know about the board at that point in my life to want to be a part of it.
You may want to open it up to as an internship I know when I was, though, that age I was looking for internships to to help me with my job search or to get recommendations, so you'll, be surprisingly.
So, like I, feel I feel that you know there are young people that are very engaged, perhaps maybe after 21 they just graduated.
You know we got to figure out ways to attract them to understand what the people, how important community board is for their community.
And I, think that if students were to see how passionate we all were about our community, the time we put into it these efforts, they would have a much different opinion on the importance, whether that's them being able to sit in on inviting schools to sit in on a committee to watch what we're talking.
And I know like from my time on the education committee group.
You know we want more members that are from the muslim community.
The hell is that they do not know what a community board is so like it's part of that educational aspect, where we're actually talking to a lot of your community members just to actively you know, just ask them and talk, engage them a little bit.
I know a lot of people want to go back to watching some TV or something.
And I do agree with paula that, like I, think reaching out to the schools and knowing that we are like a resource that could be helpful.
You know what I mean like.
That's one thing off: the top of my head: I think that in that I'm, not looking at those bullets right, now.
You know what I want to be careful about using the word inequity for everything, because then I think that devalues our purpose.
And I think we should stick to you know the issue.
You know, I think it's from a movie right.
I think that's something very tangible that we can try to accomplish within you know within this next month before we do our next meeting.
We can definitely focus on that to see put some failures out there and who we can actually get onto the board in terms of the age, parity and stuff, like that, it's complex, but we can definitely work on those things.
Right, I mean like because I do not know about you, but if I mean I, my chinese is very minimal.
Yahei might actually know because I think a larger bangladesh, community.
We can also resurrect that, if somebody's willing to help me with that, because I have limited time, sometimes I think it might make sense, for you, know.
Like I, think we have a lot of stuff here that we're talking about a lot of people want to do.
We do have a lot on our on our list and our agenda already, but I think we can definitely get things done for sure.
We were able to have this type of conversation to you, know, figure out where we can move forward and make some good changes to the community and the board that would be best for everyone all right.
My brain is just like going all over the place, but I think yeah was right.
You worked out something with the secretary well, so to speak, Paul's going to do notes, tonight, but I recommend rotating right, not just one person all the time unless they're totally fine with that, and maybe looking at committees from that perspective, too who's actually taking minutes.
Well, I just like to say that I think the public should have more time to speak.
A lot of us are savvy, but not everyone, is, and unfortunately, that, coupled with other you know, issues has led definitely to some poor communication, I think.
You know, I, think.
I, think that this committee can have can have a lot of insight, and you know, do a lot of research on a lot of these things that you're bringing up, and so you should always feel welcome to bring those claims.
We can actually look at what you're talking about and work from there all right.
So I, there's things that I know more about community boards.
