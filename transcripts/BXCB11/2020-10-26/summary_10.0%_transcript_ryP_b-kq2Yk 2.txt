The first thing on the agenda was that the transportation committee needed a recommended approval for a couple of those applications.
You know it's they're important, but I feel like us voting on something is more important so and that might trigger the member of the public to cause an outburst.
So that way that member of the public, if they do cause something or cause an issue, then you have something intended right now , it's basically harassment for being professional and having a hostile, free, environment.
Like, I said, a person feels threatened by the person they can get in order protection and every time that person is public come to place of work.
And I had to escort her outside because first you know Of course, I was not going to get physical unless you got food which I did not think she would have, but it was a very comfortable situation first for her to come to the job, and second.
So, I kind of like just you know, entered the conversation and went inside and left her talking about people by herself, because she did come there to pick a fight, because every time she brought something up, I shut her down, and then she was just grasping at anything that she put until.
If we're going to be of service to the public, then they have to respect us and not come at us like this, because it's not me, I was in a situation where I was harassed.
: It's a lot more people that are important and only suggestions about this number one on the text into these, because some of the things that we do for when we talk about the budget I mean if it's for government business, that's appropriate.
Is, that what you want me to say any personal attacks against a community board member staff, member of the public and or elected official or the representative, we can say any personal attacks online and stuff.
We can make it the general office email But, then that creates more work for you to forward and filter out So that people only think it's going to the Community Board office because we're getting a copy of this.
Well, I mean you can put down the instructions it will be given to the ethics Committee I mean, but that that's really yeah, because you know what I'm really upset at this email for the person to say that I'm going to make sure that the vote gets the that the person gets voted.
It's going paper, killing trees, but it's you want to do it that way, but that you're, assuming that's you know for me, like we are now, but still online.
What should be at the top, but you want it up front where it's going to be in their face, but you want them to see that first from Ken, some edits from Al, Like you, said harassment after after meetings or outside of meetings for right now.
This is a different situation because you're visible, but on one zone you know you still have to have some form of way to recognize one another in order for one person to be speaking at the time, because you can't hear everybody and everything just like you said when Jeremy actually asks you to turn up your life and the people are sitting there.
The first meeting I did not even want to touch it because I did not know what the heck it was so, But I You can move office that you do at home, so So, for example, tonight I was having a conversation with another board member about winning early.
I would not have to say like the rest of the committees, here's my report,, it's online, do not know No you're doing the report My report speak to me after the meeting you could do.
If you do not have anything, then he's just going to skip those committees, everybody, the agenda will get.
The agenda will change because you did not have a meeting Yeah ethics and public safety.
He did say how come the liquor licenses approvals are not being done on the public Safety committee meeting.
