Good morning it is October 22nd to it is 7 8 P.M. This is the third meeting of Connect Board 11 we have. Does everybody have the agenda? It's on the website. That's one of the few things that was, we were able to upload to the website. I did he sent out an email with everything I've shared in the chat. Can you share the? Can you go to our website? Is that possible? I'm going to start live streaming that so are we having a moment of silence or not? I can't be able to share, though the chat I can not be. Oh, I'm responding to Pharah about. You can not listen to us so going to send her a call. Would you have the do you have the agenda? Frano? Yes, Jeremy. I could post the agenda in the chat. Okay, thank you yeah somebody can. That would be helpful. Just can't get the agenda for whatever reason, I'm trying to explain that. I can't hear you I everybody else hears me though right. Yes, it might be something with your caption. We will. We should work offline after the meeting, pat I'll work with you individually, as I've worked with a lot of board members lately on your connectivity issues. I've learned a few things that might be able to help all right franno. It's all you, okay, let's take a moment of silence for all the men and women overseas, our first founders and all the people that have suffered from this Covid-19 and let's keep them in our mind and in our prayers. Let God guide them always and one more special that this election goes as small as possible for both candidates and that this country is at peace. Thank you amen and then to death great alan yeah. Does anybody know you can't get on at all? I do not know why we got the chairman's report I need to agenda, or is there a code? Are the board members? You want me to share the agenda yeah, it's online. Yes, it's simple online! Just look at it! Well, if you can share it to be great all right, so, let's move on May. I speak. I just want to yes, I was not here the last time and I just would like to request two things: that's the conduct and meeting statement and also the FY 220. two Community Board budget priority court requests, if you could mail them to me and put them in the email. Thank you. That's it! Okay, so everybody sees the agenda board members, so Al is having trouble getting in we'll come back to him as Veronica and finally hazel you're in right. I had to come in on my phone. I could not get onto the laptop okay, so the minutes were emailed out. I forget how long ago at this point there was an early draft. A fight more final draft was today submitted was just up to you maybe 20 minutes ago, because I could not get the city to publish it soon enough. It was the real difference. The primary difference is adding the attendance to the end of the the document which is required in our buying list. So that was the attendance for the meeting. Even though there were technically attendance with the flexing results and the roll call vote, but pete everybody was there for both, so the full attendance is attached to that Hazel anything else. No, I do not know why the city did not post them. We need to work on that so that they are posted by. You know me by the time that we have our full board meetings. So can we work on that together? Yeah? The big thing is making sure we have attendance. We have not put it put attendance in the minutes for a while, so it was a lot of it was actually really so. I was trying last year's meetings because some people are concerned about the attendance of board members, so it took a little while to get that form up and running. It is up and running now. So if you have any comments or suggestions on, it would be more than happy to take them. Yeah make a motion to approve the September 2024 board meeting minutes as distributed dominic seconded okay. Before we get into this. So before we get into discussion, can everybody meet themselves? That's not talking, there's feedback, that people are complaining that I'm cutting in and out for so, even though you think you're not making any noise you, it picks up every little sound and it really disrupts me go ahead. Hazel Discussion, Discussion anyone nope! I got ta mute everybody. I do not know why people can't mute themselves. Okay, any extensions or objections. That's really what we need. I heard people are in favor any obsessions or objections. If not anything else, hazel stop Hazel. Sorry! Well, yeah! I have to mute. I can't, unfortunately, I do not know who's making the noises, so I have to mute everybody. Okay, so the minutes have been approved. Okay, okay, let me go back to the agenda Mr Manager's report. My report was submitted in the email. If you have any questions, please see me after the meeting it was talked about we're not going to great detail. The only thing missing from my report that I would not want to touch upon was trying to transition to zoom. We will be transitioning as soon as possible. Do not hold your breath on how quickly that will happen in terms of the platform we'll be using. So please save your questions for the end, unless it's something really urgent and then we'll turn it over to committee reports for leadership yahei. Yes, hello, everyone we did meet, we met in person at Maestros, they did accommodate us. We plan to meet again next month at Maestros. Again I was there today and I thank them very much for allowing us to be there. As you know, other facilities, including Einstein, has they have declined to. Let us be there, so I they've been basically closed for seven months. They are struggling, so we appreciate them opening their doors for us and allowing us to have the meat in there. I think the minutes have been uploaded and that's pretty much it we do not. I just want to add to that. This is Darrell. I just wanted to say that I found out the leadership meeting was in person. I strongly object to having meetings in person going forward and in the midst of you, know the uprisings of Colvin 19 and you know, quite frankly, a lot of people are getting reinfected. So I do not think that will be wise for us to meet in person and I think it's too risky. It was less than probably 15 people in a room. The room was pretty big, they were social distance and everyone had a mask on there was hand sanitizers, they took temperatures of everyone coming into the hall, so everything was followed and we believe that a smaller group like that it can meet in person. I do accept your objection to it and if we get more objections, then we might switch it, but for now we did get a lot of people that that did attend and not too many objections from the leadership committee do understand. But in the midst, like I said again in the midst of all Covid-19, you know cases rising and stuff. Like that, you know the media is not talking a lot about reinfections. This is a big thing and I'm quite sure that we'll start talking about it in the future, but you know meeting in person I mean we have so many resources. You know why would we do that? You know right now we're talking to each other right. Now I see you clearly you see me clearly. I think this is the way we should do it for the rest of the year. To be quite frank, this is naomi Pemberton and I agree with Darrell. I think right now is a little bit premature to be meeting in person. I just heard news today, a friend of mine who has Covid-19, and you know it's just you know: people have families people, you know I have elderly parents, you know, I think it it's a premature. You know. I think we should even consider it next year, a point taken. Also. We did have the option for folks to attend via Webex. So if you feel uncomfortable you're, you know you're part of that age where you think you might be might be an issue for you or you have folks at home or you're diabetic or you have that connection. Then you can join us online via Webex. You do not have to attend. It was optional for those that wanted to attend and we did have a good number of people who wanted to do it in person yeah. I was just going to ask that's. Why would like to speak, and I agree with Yahei, because I know that a lot of us are having difficulty getting on these zooms and these different virtuals. So I feel that, like we did, I everybody that was in attendance did not have a problem, so I those who feel that they need to stay at a distance. We can also. You can also be online as you as we speak, and those who want to be in attendance just need to be in attendance so that you can see people's faces and even though you do it on zoom and on the social media. A lot of us are having problems with it. So that's why I do not mind actually being there, because we do keep our house open. We do keep ourselves healthy and we do you know we are mindful of other people's conditions, so we just want to be able to still get back out there and be amongst of doing things that person thank you Pat, and I think you wanted to say something yeah. Actually, I was embarrassed well, but now that Miss Charles said that she was there, it sounds like if you have the option to either appear in person or do it virtually. I do not really see what the issue would be with it. I understand people's concerns, but I think I mean some of us have been back at work for the last four and a half months working in the office, so hi this is daisy. I am also. I also have concerns about this. Does staff have the ability to make that decision as well and make that choice? The Community Board staff only Jeremy was there that evening correct. Does he have a choice in that matter to be working offline? When I had the discussion with him, he was not opposed to it. If he had a concern, I think we probably would have worked for the concern and found a different way to do it. This is your intent on doing the remote thing, because, basically, whoever probably last meeting suddenly it was terrible, understand everything. I could not really hear a lot of what was going on, so it was very difficult and you know I understand you know you want to have in- person meetings, but I just you know, feel that with the with the pandemic- and we do not know even our president is get has gotten it with all of that going on. It just seems to me very premature to be meeting in person and I think, if you're having technical issues, I think maybe we can do you know. I do not know if the community board can have like a class or something so that people understand how to log on and log off, and my company did it they did a virtual class. You know. So that's just a recommendation and we're doing all of that, but in the same token, like I'm saying I can't hear as loud as and clear as I did the left the last session that we had. We had another session, I'm on it and I hear but right now, there's technical difficulty me hearing everybody's conversation. So that's what I'm saying it's not where we can't see. I feel that I do not want nobody to see my face right now, but in the same token we are listening to each other and we we're responding to each other's needs. So if those who can get on and that's fine and those who can not need virtue, I mean that need to be in person. Then that should be an option where we're all getting the same information yeah I mean. I just think that if it's you know, I think if it's the majority can get online and they're. Okay with it and there's a minority that can not or having technical issues. I think we need to deal with the minority and help them to you know, get online or have or have the education for the technical issues or assist with that all right. So if I can be the last word on this yeah can I say something: Jeremy yeah go ahead: yeah Jeremy. I saw that meeting my show online on Facebook and I see everybody. This is like six feet away from the table. I do not think we should have a problem. I work in the health institution a hospital for since the pandemic, and I mean once you take care of yourself precaution. I mean you're good to go. I mean I do not see why we, you know if everybody followed the protocol, will you be safe and if people I mean, if you can see them online on Facebook, then you know you can follow two of you who do not want to come. They want to come, you can stay home and do that. That's my, but that's my thoughts on it. So as say for myself, I personally would prefer online, but you know it's. Ultimately it's not my decision. It's the boards discussions later. All I wanted to say was zoom works. Much better. All you need to do is to buy an account and it's not that expensive and I think if people will find it much easier to get on and less frustrating yeah I so we have a platform that is zoom based use. It's called Hd Office, suite meeting we have to for from committees. We can do it. We started off with this actually- and I plan on doing that, starting with that for the amenities, because we already have that the full board is a different issue but yeah, ideally we're going to go to zoom we're going to pay for it. Just by the account you could have up to 100 people yeah. No, it's just when we're not doing minutes and stuff like that or do you want to get into when you're still on? Did we send the email out to everybody with the letter? So there is a letter that we're working on. Actually, it's a notice that we're working on so Community board members are held to a certain standard when they're at meetings, and we wanted to have a standard for members of the public when they do attend community board meetings, and we came up with something that we plan to include and we're trying to fit it in every committee agenda and we're going to upload it to the website. I do not want to go through the letter of the entire letter Jeremy, but if you can just email it to everybody and do we need to vote on it or anything right, not only that there might be changes, people may come up with other suggestions. That was. That was one of the reasons why one of the reasons why it was not sent out, because I had made some suggestions and there were some suggestions that leadership so yeah I mean, I think both Yahei and I were pretty busy. I mean to get it to it. Unfortunately, so yeah it was voting on a committee to my knowledge, yeah. It was voted on it committee Jeremy. Would you be able to just read it real quick and we can just vote on it and if anyone has any issues, we'll have a discussion about it Jeremy. Why do not you just email it out to every board member and we'll vote on it next month? Very good point Andrea. I agree with Andrea. You Wanna just we'll discuss it further. Okay, all right, so maybe we should turn it over to. Is there anything else for leadership, yeah negative? Thank you. I mean it was not I just want. I did learn something technologically as a result of meeting in person that I think so. Thank you for that yeah. Can you put your? Can you put your computer on mute, please? I can hear you drinking a lot. You too sandy. Oh you heard. Oh, we can hear you sandy. You got to stay muted, please I'm on mute, Owl, Mister, Mr, Chairman Daniel. Can you hear me? Yes, okay. Did you mention the equity committee? While I was trying to get on? No, we. I waited we're waiting for you, oh you're, on now all right! Thank you. Thank you. We did. We took Christian Amato's a suggestion about setting up an equity committee which would address racial and gender bias disparities, and I asked Darrell to chair the ad hoc committee Darrell. Maybe you could say something about what we've done so far. Yes, Sir. Thank you, Mr Chairman. I appreciate the introduction good evening, everybody. I am happy to be the chairman of the equity committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues Paula Lisa, Edit and Christian, who accepted to be the members of the committee. The equity committee is going to be inclusive. We have conversations we're going to have conversations regarding diversity and inequity issues that will be that would address in a responsible fashion and recommendations will be rendered in the best interest of the community we serve. Our first meeting is on Tuesday November 10th at 7:15, and subsequent meetings will be every second wednesday of the month. Thank you. Can I ask you a question please. I will refer all the questions until the meeting on November 10th. If you can I'm just curious what you're going to what you're going to be discussing, you can join our November 10th meeting. We can fully discuss everything but we're, like I said it's going to be inclusive, that's what the committee is going to be about we're going to discuss issues both internally externally with the in regards to the community, and you know we'll go further into that. If you want to join our meeting on November 10th on Tuesday at 7:15., be our guest, I'm sorry! This is naomi. I just have a question: is this committee going to be talking about diversity, training for everyone or just or addressing that we're still working on we're still we're still working on the first we're still working on the details of our meeting for November 10th? We still got time. Okay. Thank you. I think the committee at this point is just trying to put together a plan of action so before everybody starts jumping in on on dorell asking him to explain, I think his committee should sit down decide where they want to go with this and then we'll present it to the full board and as and as per our conversation with the chairman, just to pick you back off of him. It is a it's an ad hoc trial. Essentially it's going to be for three months in which we would you know. Have you know these inclusive conversations, and you know, hopefully the committee would become official at that point based on you know our recommendations and feedback and et cetera, that's great. Thank you. That's all. I have all right great. So let me share the. Let me share the agenda again. The fiscal year 2022 budget request was sent out was emailed to each and every board. Member hope you had a chance to look it over what the committee decided was to only go for the items that we thought were absolutely necessary. So I'd like to take make a motion that you approve the budget priority request as was distributed, you get a second can't get a little seconded. Thank you even for discussion. Anybody against! I guess the motion passes, then any abstentions, I'm sorry who's that Patricia Pat, charles, yes, okay, all right, one extension, it passes. Okay, thank you. Thank you friend, transportation and there's only one motion out there to send a email of no objection to the New York City Tax and Limousine Commission regarding options, transportation at 740, Morris, Park Avenue was this voted in committee. It was not clear in the minutes. No okay, it was all right, so we got ta amend the minutes. For that any discussion. Can you elaborate what that means? I'm not sure what that means. Basically, a company comes before us. They have a, I guess, either a license or a renewal with a tax in Limousine Commission. They made their presentation. The committee felt that everything was fine and we have no objection to them getting a renewal or a license to operate the taxi service. This is daisy. Can I add just one more thing we had. I believe this is the one that we had checked with the Morris Park Association and also was told that there was no issue with them. Dominic I seconded it. I have a. I have a question. Discussion go ahead, the location do they have. Where are they going to be having their taxis and limousines? It's going to be on the street, do they have a place where they are putting that? How are they? As far as I know, this is a dispatch, but daisy could chime in, and so they do not necessarily have to have their tabs, because there's too much feedback from other people, can you unmute yourself? I can chime in okay. So basically it is my understanding. It's a dispatch type of service, therefore, there's no need to have cabs waiting around Daisy. If I'm wrong, please chime in, I think Chris has more information, but I believe they also had a little location where they parked their cars. Okay, like Franos, said this is just a dispatch. It's two kind of cap companies, ones that are dispatched and what they do mostly. They do, especially here in northeast. They deal with people that have Medicare Medicaid and do medical transportation, mostly, which means they get phone calls prior and after that they send cabs directly to them, based on the phone calls they have done, but on top of that to my understanding, they have like four or five parking spaces behind the diner. Oh behind. Oh okay is this location. This is this: is between union port and Victor Street. No, it's! No! Okay! All right! Thank you and any further discussion. Okay, all in well any objections before any abstentions. Motion passes. Okay, so I think it's over to the ethics Committee. Now, unless you have something else, random, no everything else, it's in the minutes and in your email. So please read them and that's it! Okay! All right can we can you skip me for now, because we're going to need to go into executive session to discuss a couple of complaints, old business right so towards the end land use Ken government good evening I apologize. I did not get the minutes in on time, but these we will have. We will have minutes to be posted in the next few days. We basically had a meeting. This is there's one issue who came up before the meeting was on this past Monday. There was one issue that came up, that is the gas station on the corner of Williamsburg and east chester, road right next to the firehouse. Basically, what they want to do is convert from a gas station into a gas station and convenience store. The issue that came up from a member of the public and from other members was that the firehouse was not at was not invited and did not comment on. If that would have any effect on them. We believe that a public hearing should be should be held. Are we going to especially explicitly invite the fire department to come and comment to see if this will have any effect on their dispatch or on their or on their operations and a base? The minutes of the meeting will be published in the next few days. Thank you. Thank you. Lester's question. Do part recreation, pat Charles, yes, hello, everyone, the meeting we had a very good meeting and all of the minutes are in place, so you can read it online or read it. However, they have been distributed to the community board. We actually we do not have a minute security committee. I do not know who we actually. I spoke with Harry earlier. We do not have minutes. I do not know if anybody from the committee took minutes. I believe it was well. I did not say we did not take any minutes because Harry and I we were just really getting through what we had to for the meeting, because she was very. She was trying to help out with recording and making sure that we are in, and out of, you know like muted and whoever wanted to speak, but I doubt it very much because I thought it was being recorded yeah we can. We will talk offline about it. Then, okay, public safety, yeah. Yes, we met the minutes, I think should be available and that's all thank you. Okay, Gallery Session, Roxanne Delgado have to unmute she's our first gallery session. Speaker Nope. This is not what I need. Okay, so everybody is aware. I will keep it to two minutes and make sure you cut them off Jeremy. I know two minutes for everybody, except for the electeds, giving the electeds 10 or he gave them a limit of 10. The reps are having two minutes, but the elected officials themselves. Hello, wait before I start. I send an email to chair to request additional time and he has not responded. So can I speak to chair now regarding to grant me additional time, because I have four points to mention. I was under the impression that everybody gets two minutes and that was from the chairman no, but I'm speaking to the chair now because I sent him an email and left my voicemail. So I'd like to him to address this now, if I can have additional time just to address the four issues that we've been going back and forth by email. So can you move the chair? What I said we would speak? I said we would stick to two minutes. Yes, but then you did not respond to my email. So that's a shame that you do not want the public to speak, especially when there's only one member of the public right now you are speaking you're having exactly the same amount of time as everyone else. No I'm not saying I'm not having. I just need additional time, because we have some certain issues that have not been addressed by emails. I send a response to them, so I figured I could bring them up at the public meeting. If we make one exception, then we have to make others, and that would be right to everybody else, but then, before I start, can you at least respond to emails? Then please two minutes. Please all right! You got two minutes miss dog. Can you give me a thirty Sec start before you finish it? Yes, okay, so tell me when to start go ahead: okay, disregarding open, meeting law, the open meeting law states that meetings held by community board should be open to the public and accessible to members of the public. This has been going on for quite a while that is not accessible, because the Committee board continues to put in the hyperlink on the agenda. Often the agenda is not posted on the website or the link is broken. So no one can access the link to the meeting when the agenda is not posted on the website or the link is broken, and also we have people who are vision, impaired, hearing impaired, they can not use these applications, they have to use. Do a calling you never give that option, you should send an email providing the hyperlink as well as the alternative call in option, so people who can not use the application will be able to at least call in. So this is a violation open meeting law. Regarding minutes I mean I just received a minute 10 minutes ago, so I can't I did not even have time to look over it, but this has been ongoing issues where minutes are not posted not unless even the recordings that have been posted for the parks meeting has not been posted. Minutes on. Regarding the leadership meeting held this week, no thought to young hey, but he's he may not be aware, but that same night, when I tried to get into the leadership meeting that the link was broken, there was no agenda posted and now they, the Committee Board states to me that the recording has they can not post, because it's inaudible, so people are not were denied access to the leadership meeting. Because of these issues, what 30 seconds? Okay phone? The fact that when phase four it took Facebook for the Committee Board 11 to start responding to phone calls, I think it's a shame through the three phases were not available to the public. I myself made myself available to public in the parkway. Helping people apply, for unemployment, apply for the stimulus check apply for dmv, but when people close CB11 for the for the first three phases m.I.a, so that's I guess I do not have time to address my fourth point, which was the dog run but, okay time alphabet. I should go over a second franco right. No, you sorry for how I muted you. I needed everybody. So, let's, unless the board member has a question, we will go on to the next gallery session Speaker, so Mr, Bob Press is the next and last question. Is it true what she's claiming I do not know? I mean she need three points. What are her allegations act? True, what I just wanted like in regards to the link on the like the Community board page, because I know I participated as like just observing the Budgets Committee. I believe, and the way that, like I got onto it, was like through the link that was like attached in the agenda, so but that's only one committee meeting that I've been to so I can't speak for all of them, so I'm just like putting that out there that it worked for me for that. One committee meeting edit dominic. How are you she's spot on when it comes to calling the Community Board? Okay? Nobody very rarely does somebody actually pick up the phone and I made numerous requests from the end of May or beginning of June, on that it should roll over to somebody's phone, seeing that they were working five days a week, nine to five. So when it comes to somebody calling the thing community board 99 times out of 100, especially for the first three or four months, you got an answering machine now. I've called on numerous occasions, and people have gotten back to me, but I'm an officer on the board, the general public. I do not know what their response is to that, but the bottom line is when that phone rings. If there's three people working and they're working from home, that phone should roll over to somebody's cell phone because you do not want to give that out to the general public, and I mean I stated that at the leadership or whatever committee was last Tuesday, and that's one of the reasons why I made the decision that I'm going to be making by the end of the month. That's it I'm done well dominic! Well, I actually do have a question because and something that was said today from the treasure. It indicated that there was like a cell phone bill, I believe in the amount of 400 or three from each month. So if that's the case, why are the phone calls not being answered scout so Chris hear it? Do you want to try something yeah I want to try. I mean I want to be the first one. Well, let's start with dom to my understanding as many phone calls, if you have done within one hour two hours, we have responded back to you the same thing we have done with the public whenever they leave a message. It happened that you know phone calls were coming toward mine on the second month coming on my private cell phone, and still I was able to respond to all the phone calls as the last two months we've been going over there at least me, I'm going Wednesday and fridays nine to five. You got ta understand and besides that on wednesdays, I have with me by risking that I am diabetic. I have high blood pressure. I have with me present taking measures. I have one of the interns, so it's two people at least on Wednesday they're, responding phone calls, but also you got ta understand that you know. By being honest, I understand what you're saying. Let me, let me finish. Well, I'm not saying anything about showing up at the board. Let him finish. Please never finish. I heard you respect me just because a cord fell on the ground and it happened. Did you stay for 45 minutes to wait for either Con, Edison or police or whoever is going to come? That is not our fault. You volunteered it over there and because of that now, if you would have called 911, then somebody would have been directed over there. Besides the fact either you are public or you are a board member and I've spoken with a lot of board members that have called you can ask Diane Norris every time, she's called every time the phone has been picked up, either from me or from my intern, but you can understand that sometimes might be a two three phone calls. I got ta I got ta. Excuse me, that's right and I'm always calling so there you go. I mean I do not understand why the public is now when it comes to miss Delgado. I have helped her on many occasions, either through the phone or through emails, but also it means that God's got to understand that not everything can happen within 24 minutes 24 seconds. Certain things take priority: okay, Jeremy, really quick, okay, really quick! The other caller had a few issues right. Some comments: does the communion board address these issues because she made some? You know decent points like call up call options for people with disabilities. You know I mean: is there a way to respond to those saying that you know we? Maybe we're not up to speed with that. Yet also the are we all. Are we truly giving late meeting minutes at the last minute? Are we doing that? Also it you know. Is there there's an issue with the link being broken when we try to log on to it? I know even at my job, the links, sometimes it breaks is it can we answer those questions and also the different phases that happened during Covid-19, where the community Board was not available? Maybe it was because we were in the midst of still getting people you know online properly. Maybe there were issues that need to be addressed during that phase of answering these issues and in some type of letter or more hold on Chris, we'll be missing a lot of time here. All these things occur it's technology until before Kavit nobody knew about zoom on webex. Unless you agree, I agree. That's I'm not I'm not blaming you. I'm just saying that commissions little bit of patience until get hand into it and God's will maybe we're going to go face to face and get back to. Whatever was doing. No, I agree because I'm not placing blame I was wondering, is the way to respond to it. When we come into the staff respond to phone calls, we've been covering the office Monday to Friday sometime, even in Mid overnight, I've gotten taxes middle night asking what's going to be in the agenda and it still responded. I've called people called me on my private phone that I've given to most of them saying that I can not make it because I'm sick or I have to work so what else we can do you tell me I can start smoke signals too. I can do that so Chris. Let me let me input because Oral asked me a question. So when Miss Delgado is right, she's right all right, I will give her credit for when she's right minutes, we do not get it soon. Enough right I mean Ken apologized, but you know Ken just had a meeting on Monday, I'm not concerned about that. The thing is, though, we do not have to publish our minutes on our website and, in fact, I've. You know. I've told I've asked quite a few of you to actually check out other community board websites and compare them. If you look at community Board one in the Bronx, they do not publish any minutes, then I can tell you who their board members are a community board in Brooklyn does not publish your minutes by law. Minutes need to be made available two weeks following the meeting upon request. So if somebody requests the minutes, whatever we have or whatever document we have, we give it to them and start in terms of the minutes. For me, if I'm wrong, but I sent out draft minutes like two weeks ago, because everybody, not everybody, but a lot of people wanted to know how the diversity vote went. So I carry in me together turn that around quickly we sent it to Hazel. We sent it out. So the only thing missing from it, like I said earlier, was the attendance. I whip that up today right we even if the minutes are incorrect, we can correct them later. We had an issue with ethics Committee Tuesday night. I already corrected that it's already should be well, it's probably not live, because when I sent to the city today they only responded to one request I made of them, but yeah I mean there's, definitely room for improvement. What we talked about at the leadership committee meeting and Hazel, because Hazel's been a board member prior to our appointment last year since 1995 and she said what happened to each committee choosing its own secretary- and you know something the equity committee maybe wants to look into as well, because historically it used to be the women that only did the minutes. So there's a lot of things that we can improve upon, and I mean I'm a perfectionist, as some of you know- and I do my best and Chris can tell you- Kristen Harry can tell you. I bother him about the stupidest thing. Sometimes it seems stupid, but it's a long- term strategy. So unless there's anything else, can we please move on hello? I would just like to add that anything that anyone is requesting. If it's with the most up respect, then it would definitely go a longer way. Then it's not so much. What you say is how you say it. So when you want things to be done, respect goes a long way and that's the end of that. Okay, I agree Charles, but you know what this is exactly why we need to address people's concerns right also so, and not just kind of like let them fall on deaf ears and just respond to what they're asking for and just say like in this instance. Now I know that we're like the board does not require to post the minutes. I did not know that before, but that's good to know, but she you know anyway, but I think it's. I think that it's good okay. So let me move on to our next gallery session. Speaker, please, Miss! Frano. Are you ready to time? Mr Press? Yes, make sure you do not mute me, so he could hear me at 30 seconds and so on. I know, but at the end, when they keep going- and you told me to cut them off and that's what I did last time. No, it's fine, but I'm saying leave me unmuted. I will, and as long as people use proper etiquette and we do not get a lot of feedback if I mute everybody I'll meet Mr, Press too, okay, so go ahead. Bob all right. The district manager sent out a statement from Andy King on the recent action by the city Council. His district of his former district office, however, remains functioning as stated, but unfortunately I am no longer Andy King's representative to Community Board 11., with my vast experience of community boards throughout the Bronx and the and my knowledge of the east Bronx, I will continue as a community resident of Community board 11 to assist the board or its members. If needed. Here are two examples. The gas station mentioned in the land use meeting was heard by CB11. Since the property is in community board 11. I was able to ask at their meeting why Community Board 11 was not involved, and now I see that I have been listened to as to committee minutes. They should not be published until they are adopted at the following meeting because they can be changed at the next meeting and sometimes committee meetings may not be held for a month or two, so you may not have minutes adopted for two or even three months, as we did on community board 8, which was one of the most functioning boards in the Bronx, and that's all I have to say. Thank you. Thank you next. So that concludes the gallery. We do have elected officials and at least one I believe, if he's still there, let me mark hey Jeremy, yes, I'm here, do you hear me yeah? So I'm sorry Mark, but we have to give you only 10 minutes. I do not even need 10.. I just call I want I wanted to chime in on all of those that are still suffering during this pandemic in crisis and the economic devastation we've had. I do not think there's anyone that does not know of someone that has passed in the last eight months or so from culverd, so I'll keep all of them in my prayers. I just want to thank all of the Community board members for the work that they're doing. I want to congratulate the newly appointed members, but I want to recognize the hard work that you all do year in and year out, and we do not speak enough about that and as an elected official, if I had it my way, I would truly empower the community boards to not only have a suggestive voice and a recommendation to their needs, but empower you in more ways, because you truly know what you are the eyes and ears of our community and you know what's best for our communities. So I know that my Rep, I believe, Pharah, is on she's, going to talk about some of the upcoming events, and I just wanted to thank all of you for what you're doing. If you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer them and if not God bless you for what you're doing. Thank you mark all right unless there's any questions for the council member, please let me know no, I have a question for the council member go ahead: Christian Hey, Councilman Jonai. I just have a question about 2021: do you have any plans to modify or expand the euler process, given that you're talking about empowering the community boards more? I think this is an area that we could definitely use your voice on. This is a matter we could use. Your support on user process is a top- down process. I think it would work better if it went from the Community Board to the city and I would love any thoughts you have on this matter. Christian. Thank you for bringing that up. When it comes to zoning issues, it truly belongs with the community boards and not elected officials or top down. In this case, the mayor, I've always been a supporter of community boards when it comes to any type of development, and my position has always been clear. If the community supports it, I support it if the community is opposed to it, I'm opposed to it. I rely on the feedback that I get from the community boards on any development and I appreciate that you brought that up and maybe in 2022, when we get a new mayor, we can reevaluate how zoning decisions are made and any type of zoning change. So thank you, Christian, amen. Okay, then we shall move on to the broad president's office because I do not think we are supposed to have the district attorney in she was going to come. I'm sorry, somebody said something is not farah supposed to speak. I do not know if she, the councilman, still has time right. The council member is all we need. We I mean no offense to Farah, but we do not have anybody better than I think the principal himself. No. I know, but he said that Pharah had something to say. Oh okay, I'm sorry! I did not hear that part. Let me unmute her real quick because he did not use his 10 minutes. Go ahead, pharaoh all right! Thank you. Thank you and you're right having mark should be enough, but he did want me to announce three events quickly, number one. We did start our Turkey Giveaway list, I know bernadette, you have a group of people definitely call me or have them rsvp directly with their office, so we could put their names on the list for a turkey. Also, we have a breast cancer awareness event on Thursday at 6 P.M. If you call our office to rsvp, please join us and we also have our food distribution on saturdays, with Pelham Parkway, Neighborhood, Association and Aaoh Organization in front of 2141 Holland Avenue at nine in the morning, and that's all thank you so much sure and sweet can. I say something: real quick yeah well go ahead! No, I just want to tell Pharah to tell Mark Joe. I thank you for so much for his input on the synagogue over here in my neighborhood that he helping us straight now. Oh he knows about it. The young Israel Synagogue over here he's done a good job and well talking to me and giving me some good ideas what to say and what to do. Thank you, I'm still on and we're still working on that by the way. Thank you so much I reached out to the owner and I told them and I've been working with other members of the synagogue. We still have some work to do, and hopefully we can shape it into something that the community would embrace versus the owner of the property. Thank you, and I know I you know. I know you always look out for us and I appreciate that I really do really do. Thank you, Mark. Thank you. Okay, unless there's anything else, ish gonzalez from the President's office good evening, everyone, it's gonzales from the Bronx borough president's office. I just have two quick announcements. I want to welcome the New board members. I believe we have three or four new board members here at board. 11, so welcome you. The new board members should have received if you have not received it yet you'll receive it shortly. A new community board member orientation. That's going to be a virtual meeting, so you do not have to worry about coming in person. For that, and that's going to be. I believe this upcoming.

The public advocate wishes. You guys well wishes and unfortunately I do not have a report this month, but the public advocate is still hard working on your behalf. But if you do have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me. Jeremy has my email address if you need to get in touch. Thank you. Thank you. Terence. We have hopefully still in the Mean Marcus from Congresswoman Ocasio- Cortez's office. Marcus. All right. Can everybody hear me: okay, so yeah, I'm here with my kids and it's bedtime. So sorry, if you hear a little screaming in the background, my name is Marcus bettinger, I'm a caseworker and field representative with the congresswoman's office, I'm standing in for destiny, who should be returning next month for your November meeting. Last week the congresswoman hosted her virtual town hall with Representative Earl Blumenhour, who represents Portland Oregon. The event was focused on environmental justice and housing justice and the unique challenges that both of our districts face. If you were not able to attend, you can watch the recording of the town Hall on the congresswoman's facebook page, which is you know, facebook.com slash, Rep, Aoc, and to stay up to date with future town halls and events. You can always sign up for our newsletter and I'm happy to drop the link in into the chat we have one newsletter in English and one in Spanish I'll do that in a second in terms of legislation. Last month, congresswoman ocasio- Cortez and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer urged FEMA to release funeral assistance to the families of Covid-19 victims. The representatives reached out to FEMA requesting this assistance in the spring and received no response. Since then, however, President Trump has authorized FEMA to use other needs, assistance for all Covid-19 major disaster declarations through the lost wages, assist lost wage assistance, executive order. The presidential authorization should give FEMA the authority to provide disaster funeral assistance to New York state and any other state that requests it, and so we'll keep you appraised on that. Okay, sorry and on October 1st, the house passed an updated version of the Heroes Act and it provided additional rounds of direct cash assistance and financial support for individuals and families, housing support, restoring unemployment benefits and 417 dollars for state and local aid. The congresswoman wants to thank you all for your participation in the census and, as always, we're still helping constituents recently. Oh okay, thank you. So much have a good evening. Everybody. Thank you very much marcus. For adhering to the time can everybody meet themselves who's, not speaking, please somebody you'll not know I'm just to meet everybody. Maybe I have to thank him.

That's probably the best way or just put it in the chat here: okay, Paul! So Paula, can you jump into the meeting using the staff account yeah? So I'm going to just log out I'd like to leave the meeting right now from my personal account and jump in okay in the meantime yeah. Can you explain, the part does need to be explained publicly. We can't just summarily kick the public out without an explanation, so the ethics Committee received a few complaints and because they involve community board members and personnel Community board staff. We will need to discuss them in executive session because they might lead to some sort of discipline. The only the thing is the Da might be joining us right now. I do not know if you want to just double check before we go into executive session. Do you or do you want to make a motion for executive session? Well, if the Da's on you want to give her some time to speak, she can speak, not I'm not necessarily seeing her hey, Jeremy, just letting you know I'm signed in okay. Great! Let me go to the public hold on. Oh, I can't I can you mean, I'm calling I got to reclaim the host ball. Sorry, no! So you will take it over as soon as we get out. Okay, so diane you're, going to stay in the meeting. Do not worry about you! The board members will stay in the executive session. Christina is she in yes, hello, yes, hi everyone, hi, Community, Board 11., the Va will be joining us in about a minute or so I let her know that we want that. You guys are going into an executive session she's just getting off of community board 12 meetings, so she'll be joining in the next minute or so. Okay, so just so, you want to make a motion, or do I wait. I do not know if we should wait. Jeremy does not make sense to make a motion if the Da's joining us in a minute or two okay, so just to recap executive session, the public will be removed from the meeting as well as staff. So and that's why Paula Career Board member who's, who was kind of to run one of the own committee meetings herself any board member. I would like to send my Dm report, make you staff and train so to speak, at least for the committee meetings. So if you want to rejoin the meeting email us just you have email at Bx11, Cb.Nyc.Gov Bx11 at Cb.Nyc.Gov, that's after the meeting is reopened. You can also. You can also text me because I do not know how, because I want to be mindful people without without phones or without computer access they're. Only calling in you can text me at nine or six four six. Oh my gosh. I can't remember my number right now. Eight three zero. Eight three, two, six, four, six, eight three zero, eight, three, two so she's in I'm going to unmute her. Just your attorney Clark all right! Well, let me see, am I unmuted? Yes, you're unmuted! We can hear you okay, because I can't I see myself yeah. No, that's! Okay! We just need to hear you we it's and we are keeping you to 10 minutes though okay, oh, I do not need 10 minutes. I just wanted to say that's what they all say. No, I promise. I won't keep you because I want to go into your session, but thank you for giving me the opportunity to say hello just wanted to keep you informed that you know the branch Da's office has been busy throughout Colvin. You know we never stopped working the course has always been open. Although access has been virtual, we've been doing all we can to make sure we continue to hold people accountable, who are causing crime in our community. As you know, shootings and homicides have really escalated in the Bronx in New York City this summer, but in the Bronx in particular, we've already surpassed the number of homicides that we had all last year, so that's very alarming, as well as doubled and tripled the number of shootings and shooting victims in the Bronx. I've been working to do anti-, gun violence, events, all summer marches, town halls, resource fairs, working with community organizations as well as the NYPD to do all that we can to help people cooperate so that we can hold accountable those people that are bringing the violence to the community. I've been looking at the data looking at the areas that have the highest rates of the violence and really going into those communities and really engaging them in the resources that they need to make the Bronx safer one of the crime prevention or gun violence prevention. Events that we're doing is coming up. This coming Saturday October 24th at the Saint Luke's episcopal church, within the confines of the 47 precent, located at 777 East 222Nd Street, I'm hosting my third gun buyback, because right now, when I looked at the data, the 47 has the highest rate of shootings. At this time I live in the 4- 7. My husband is a NYPD detective he's been on the job 38 years and we hear gunshots in our home. So no one is immune to this and we have to do all we can to stop it. So, in partnership with NYPD we're having the gun buyback. Normally you get a 200 cash card to turning a working, handgun or a salt weapon. If you turn one in just outside of this amnesty program, you get a hundred dollars during our program. No questions asked no arrests, nothing, you get a 200 cash card, but because the violence has been so prevalent, I wanted to do more. I wanted to add an incentive, so I went out and I solicited the donation of 200 ipads. So, in addition to the 200, you will receive a brand new ipad. One per person who has then turns in a working hand, the gun and the reason why I pick ipads is because we have kids in our community. They have to do remote learning that do not have access to the technology, so we figured. That was one way to encourage somebody to bring in the gun. So you can pick up an ipad instead and get the cash money, and also the parents or caregivers at home, either working remotely, so they can either use the technology or, unfortunately, because it calls it. We have the highest unemployment rate in the city at 25, so those parents can also use the ipad to look for jobs and you know, do different kind of professional development. So this Saturday no questions asked: let's get these guns off the street. We have kids being shot in homes. Had an eight-, year- old girl shot in her apartment, her mother's boyfriend shot her. We do not need that. We have people with mental illness. Suicides happen when guns are in the home. Burglaries are on the rise. People are breaking into homes, stealing things they steal a gun. That means they'll rob somebody they'll shoot somebody or they'll kill somebody. So I'm doing anything that I can to get the guns off the street. So please spread the word. You know pick put down the gun and pick up the ipad and the cash and it's 25 for a rifle or air gun or shotgun. So that's what I just wanted to share with you. I hope that was under 10 minutes. It sounds like it any questions. Anybody thank you for keeping that under 10 minutes. Thank you for the information. Okay, see a lot of my friends there, hello everybody! Well, I'm sorry! I could not be here earlier, but there were five meetings at the same time. So I just left the five votes. Is there hey? This is oral, I'm sorry! So the do you know why it's why it's so much on the increase. Is there? Have they done any studies? Why it's so why it's right? You know so much different from last year. You know everybody is looking at that. All I can say is, I think, Covid-19 has something to do with it. People were, you know, locked in for so long, social media. You know things are going on people, you know disrespecting each other on social media. We have a lot of gang and crew violence. People are unemployed, they've lost their jobs. You know, you know, people are sick, it's just a it's a real bad, perfect storm. You know that that's causing all of this and we have to do more to make sure that we stop it before it gets any worse yeah. I know and other people getting access to mental health, because I know that's a big issue is because of Covid-19. Has that slowed down some? Will you have counseling and help? Well, you know what the problem is. A lot of services are still stepped down because of the pandemic, not everybody's up and running like they were. You know socially distancing. You can't have for so many people in facilities. A lot of things have turned virtual. You know so. I know my office, my crime, victims, assistance unit is doing therapy sessions by zoom for our victims and our survivors so and we're connecting people to resources. It's just that the doors of the organizations are closed, but everybody has found a way to still continue to operate virtually. So you know that's one of the things in our community we're lacking the resources even before Covid-19. We needed more resources for mental health and drug abuse and poverty and homelessness, and all these things and great things when we do not have the resources people turn to crime and therefore the crime goes up yeah. I agree. Okay, thank you. Can I speak yeah see you, how do you feel about all the street units being taken off the street by the police department because of the defunding, and we know that some of the best cops and the street cops and people who know the area and know who the people are have been taken off the street? You think that has something to do with it. I do some people, I do think some people that think it's okay and they think they're emboldened, because they think the police are not working but yo. You and I know the police are still working. They just think that they're not working- and I think also you know- with closing for some reason- these mess they. You know people think that oh, I could do any crime. I want cuz, I got a mask on and nobody knows who I am but we're a lot smarter than you know, so we're finding ways to still get past. All of that and to really investigate to do things I mean we New York's finest is New York strikers and we're going to work our way through this. I was disappointed with disbanding of some of the groups, because you know, I think I think there was a time for change and reform, but you can't do it without having a plan to take its place so that you know you know the problem, but it does not mean that they've gone away, they're still working for NYPD, I'm still working with them. We're still doing all that we can working with the community to do what we have to do to make the community safe. The biggest thing is that we need people to cooperate and, unfortunately, what is happening is not necessarily the police fault. These shootings are happening, people get shot and they're like. I do not know what happened to me only because they just want to recalibrate, and I had a number of incidents like that this summer, where people just want to take it into their own hands and that's just perpetuating the crime. So you can't blame the police or the Da's office when we can't get people to cooperate to tell us who's, doing it, yeah so Joe. Unless you're still talking, can you press the f8 key just to mute your Mic because there's feedback I think, coming on your end? Oh okay, thank you, joe any other questions for the district attorney. Yes, actually, you may ask a question higher honor. I just want to find out if there are any trials being held at this time. Okay, thank you. That's a good question. You know the court has been trying to resume normal functions slowly, but surely they have to be very careful because of social distancing, and you know the courts before they depend before the shutdown with some of the real hot spots, because we have so many people we are just now starting to get back to trials. Civil trials have begun. The criminal jury trials have not they're going to be starting in November, we're going to try to resume that we can, but the grand juries have come back so since August 10th, the grand juries have been back so we've been able now to present the open, felony cases that have been pending since the pandemic. So you know we got a tremendous backlog, I'm not going to lie about that, but we're doing all we can to get through that. Okay, thank you. That's I think. That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much any time you all stay safe and anytime. You need me. You know that the Da's office is here for you. Thank you. So someone asked the question: what happens after executive session? What's on the agenda? Most likely will come out of executive session and we will hold a couple of votes in public based on a decision if, if a decision is discussed- and we end up coming up with, we come out of executive session agreeing to vote. That's to answer. I think someone sent the question there, but right now, I'd like to call for a motion to go into executive session to discuss complaints about from the public about community board members and staff members. I would do we have a second. Thank you, aided discussion. I second, it yeah discussion anything again, any abstentions. All right motion passes we'd like to go into executive session. At this time unanimous, I'm stopping the recording bear with me.
