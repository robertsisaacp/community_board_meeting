Yeah make a motion to approve the September 2024 board meeting minutes as distributed dominic seconded okay.
I just heard news today, a friend of mine who has Covid-19, and You know: I have elderly parents If you feel uncomfortable you're, you know you're part of that age where you think you might be might be an issue for you or you have folks at home You can join us online via Webex.
You can also be online as you as we speak, and those who want to be in attendance just need to be in attendance so that you can see people's faces and even though you do it on zoom and on the social media.
I understand people's concerns, but I think I mean some of us have been back at work for the last four and a half months working in the office, so Does he have a choice in that matter to be working, offline?
I do not know if the community board can have like a class or something so that people understand how to log on and log off, and my company did it.
If everybody followed the protocol, will you be safe and if people I mean, if you can see them online on Facebook, then you know you can follow two of you who do not want to come.
It's a notice that we're working on so Community board members are held to a certain standard when they're at meetings, and we wanted to have a standard for members of the public when they do attend community board meetings, and we came up with something that we plan to include and We're trying to fit it in every committee agenda and we're going to upload it to the website.
I do not want to go through the letter of the entire letter Jeremy, but if you can just email it to everybody and do we need to vote on it or anything right, not only that there might be changes, people may come up with other suggestions.
, that's what the committee is going to be about we're going to discuss issues both internally externally with the in regards to the community, and you know we'll go further into that.
I just have a question: Is this committee going to be talking about diversity, training for everyone or just or addressing that we're still working on We're, still working on the first We're, still working on the details of our meeting for November, 10th?
Thank you friend, transportation, And, there's only one motion out there to send a email of no objection to the New York City Tax and Limousine Commission regarding options, transportation at 740, Morris, Park, Avenue This voted in committee.
The leadership meeting held this week, no thought to young hey, but he's he may not be aware, but There was no agenda posted and now they, the Committee Board states to me that the recording has they can not post, because it's inaudible, so people are not were denied access to the leadership.
When it comes to somebody calling the thing community board 99 times out of 100, especially for the first three or four months, you got an answering machine, now.
If, there's three people working and they're working from home, that phone should roll over to somebody's cell phone because you do not want to give that out to the general public, and I mean I, stated that at the leadership or whatever committee was last Tuesday, and that's one of the reasons why I made the decision that I'm going to be making by the end of the month.
It happened that you know phone calls were coming toward mine on the second month.
We come into the staff respond to phone calls, we've been covering the office Monday to Friday sometime, even in Mid overnight, I've, gotten taxes middle night asking what's going to be in the agenda.
For me, if I'm wrong, but I sent out draft minutes like two weeks ago, because everybody, not everybody, but a lot of people wanted to know how the diversity vote.
We talked about at the leadership committee meeting and Hazel, because Hazel's been a board member prior to our appointment last year since 1995 and she said what happened to each committee, choosing its own secretary- You know something the equity committee maybe wants to look into as well, because, historically it used to be the women that only did the minutes.
Okay, I agree Charles, but you know what this is exactly why we need to address people's concerns right also so, and not just kind of like let them fall on deaf ears and just respond to what they're asking for and just say like in this instance.
I was able to ask at their meeting why Community Board 11 was not involved, and now I see that I have been listened to as to committee.
I just want to thank all of the Community board members for the work that they're doing.
I think it would work better if it went from the Community Board to the city When, it comes to zoning issues.
I just want to let you know the office We're still open from Tuesday to Friday.
If anyone has any community used with them, there's going to be an event called books with Bharati on 2018, Williams, Bridge, Road right at the office from 2-3:30 and next Friday as well.
You can also text me because I do not know how, because I want to be mindful people without without phones or without computer access.
Anti, gun, violence, events, all summer marches, town, halls, resource fairs, working with community organizations, as well as the NYPD to do all that we can to help people cooperate so that we can hold accountable.
One per person, who has then turns in a working hand, the gun and the reason why I pick ipads is because we have kids in our community.
