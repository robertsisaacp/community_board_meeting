Is so that was the last? Was it March was the last leadership community is on the website, I'm going to turn it off, but she wants to get here. Is this long? It's it should be on website yeah, you should read, them is and it was on March. The first thing on the agenda was that the transportation committee needed a recommended approval for a couple of those applications. It passed with one abstention, the second, the creation of locations section. He requested the district manager dropped, the written correspondence to the New, York State Office of addiction services and support subjectiveness of the licensing of the growing treatment facility. Fair was cancelled, no business, nothing, a german! It's up to you objections! Thank you. The things that are applicable to us are in the Community Board Handbook and the by law. So this is appropriate to the member of the republic, any personal attacks against board members, all solicitations or whatever. I think we can look into something else. Sorry meeting the Board of President's office was. We need support if we have a member of the public, that's in a hostile environment for us that volunteered to do our work. We need their attorneys to at least draft a letter of a warning letter to this member. That's the most we can do, but their response themselves right. Can I get them yeah. So if these reports are fine, because that model has a different story, I mean Harass- I mean you know it has to progress to that step. Yeah I mean you can do it that way. How do you recommend anybody that has any into these issues and returned to the public to reach epiphany more than happy report I mean I was on the phone with him earlier today. So that's one evidence we have so Joe Thompson was on the board. Al was on the board. Joel was maybe on board hatred for the police have escorted people out for being disrupted. So we can't ask people to leave and I do not think they saw my announcement today now in mass. You will be asked to leave. Maybe they check you at the door right and if you do not leave I'll be back, so we can't take that recourse. It's my two cents. If you can't fly you're on your own to handle it the way you see fit I'll, give you an example. I have a member of the problem me an email to my government email address. Yes, I'm a federal employee, but when I'm here I'm not a federal employee, I'm just beyond a private citizen yep, it makes sense that tony.singerly Dhs.Gov would work. The police told me today when it comes to electronic communication. If you ask somebody to stop- and they do not abide, then you should speak to them, because you may be able to file a harassment report workplace and I told them to stop calling it's not. I do not know them, they just called because they just they're bored and they do not. They do not stop and we got the Fbi involved and they stopped calling the reason. I said that I have something inappropriate or making other pages against you and your firm or your company. It could cause a problem for you. Sometimes because you have to make sure, does anyone have anything that we need to add or take away from the documents, because the police department escort him or her out of the media? Why should the rest of the public suffer from one person? You can get some sort of harassment here and a person won't shut up. We end up calling 9- 1- 1. How long is it before the precedent response? So sometimes you might call the cops call. Priority might be priority. Number six, so they'll be here in nine hours. How do you want to handle it, but it's just an option. We do not have to use it. You're right, like you said the public will pay the price. Can I make a suggestion on the agenda? Then I'd see the gallery session on the page and after that, we're going to put that into place the gathering session. Just in case you collect the shuttle down. Yeah remember they used to speak first, but they took too long yeah I mean it's your agenda, I mean we do have to go over. That's the next agenda item. Is the full board agenda right, so this goes down before old business? Have the gallery system honestly, I feel like public officials, they can email us up in a minute. You know it's they're important, but I feel like us voting on something is more important so and that might trigger the member of the public to cause an outburst. So I do not know if everybody can do with that upward discussion. I know we moved the public officials back because they did take a large part of our meeting. Yes, he does, but I want to share. Let's see what happens, you have a problem and maybe we'll use vanessa's. So anyone else I mean everybody's, a good point outside the board, both of them. You want to add more rules so that way that member of the public, if they do cause something or cause an issue, then you have something intended right now: it's basically harassment for being professional and having a hostile free environment. Like I said, a person feels threatened by the person they can get in order protection and every time that person is public come to place of work and I had to escort her outside because first you know I did not know what she was doing. You know I thought and even though he does not have anything to do. Of course, I was not going to get physical unless you got food which I did not think she would have, but it was a very comfortable situation first for her to come to the job, and second, you know to being put in that position where I was not sure how to proceed. So I kind of like just you know, entered the conversation and went inside and left her talking about people by herself because she did come there to pick a fight, because every time she brought something up, I shut her down and then she was just grasping at anything that she put until. Finally, I just got fed up and said you know what I have. This conversation was over and I went back inside, but it would have been a problem when she had fought for me inside, because then it would have gotten physical because then it would have just caught her outside. So I feel that we should have some kind of a protection against a situation like that, because you know you do not. You really do not know what to do in a situation where you do not want to be in trouble. You do not want to get in trouble because this person is out of her freaking mind and but then again you know I'm not the kind of person that goes fighting in the street. That's not who I am unless I have to defend myself, so I did call Jeremy and I told him I called Jeremy as soon as I got back inside, and I think I texted him just to let some knowledge that this just happened to me. It kind of shook me up a little bit because I was just so pissed off that this person had the number to come to my father, and I see her in the morning now. You know on my way to work, so I always got that note in my head. You know she could get behind me. You know it's like I'm not! I do not know. I do not trust her now, because you know it's time to look right now. I have to look out for myself, so you know this is all good and it's all good. I think that maybe I do not know. I do not know what to do. Maybe we need to speak to somebody, but there should be a little more protection for us against people like this when we're out by ourselves or you know, because we are born humans. I'm grateful that we're doing this because most of the people that have been arrested. All the time have been subjected to this, and even yourself, as you have tried to diffuse, and you gave a little encouragement to that person. They even came back at so it's not fair that you have to be subjected to this type of behavior by one person, two persons. It does not mean that it's happening. It just means that, if we're going to be of service to the public, then they have to respect us and not come at us like this, because it's not me, I myself, I was in a situation where I was harassed. I was assaulted and everything I was trying to do to try to keep myself protected. No one was there to tell me the steps that I needed to take in order for me to be able to be protected. I mean before that increasing I was a part of I'm quite really put upon. So was please that's a very difficult situation. This is, unfortunately, unfortunate laws. Whether you belong to the community, whether you're just down your steps, you can have certain people bad as far as your outside involvement people come to you, but like what you said, attraction but you're going to have to chill or what to get for something, and you can get. Somebody comes up to you and cause your family you're going to have to have calls individuals. If somebody touches you yeah you've got a case. You know somebody harasses you yeah, but to put this into important situation, the only thing that I can. I can't even suggest on something like this certain people and it's not because they disagree with us. Like certain people, you should have the ability to ban certain people from our name outside of the meeting subjected to the. If can you speak, you're commuted? Oh, are you not working? You speak and it's not your microphone's, not working. I do not know why it's not working. So can you want me to try to clean your phone? Call myself call my cell phone Ken. Can you call me oh Mike's, not working now? No, I can't hear you at all. I have the volume all the way up too 100 I mean I think you should just call myself cellphones. We might just have to take it with the job that we do so and I'll give you a couple of examples. I have a personal facebook page. I can't anything. I want right anything right, so I did post something regarding the debate and I was attacked and it's a the person said. This is why they put you on community board 11 executive board because you support trump that harms your own community. So it's just an example of a person harassing me or for being on the Executive Board right. I got an email today. It's the person well said inappropriate things they did Tom and Al know that my complaints will be voted down. That guy yahey will make sure the ethics Committee is. I do not know how to read this word. It's definitely misspelled. I do not think it's an english word how I think they're trying to say the White Community Board is a swamp, so this is all inappropriate stuff, it's being sent to me via email and I'm asking for. I guess, for your guidance and your input. How do we have? Can we put something on here? That'll address that I do not. I do not know if we can 10 individuals doing this. You know that's one thing, but it's the same person. That's attacking us! It's one person doing this as far as I'm concerned, one person, but I've heard that she's gone around the table. So it is a problem because if it was just one of us that she was harassing all right, I'll have to deal with it, but it's just me: it's a lot more people that are important and only suggestions about this number one on the text into these, because some of the things that we do for when we talk about the budget considered solicitation, I look at it. So what if we put inappropriate solicitation who's going to decide what's appropriate, we could. What standards are you going to use? I mean if it's for government business, that's appropriate. If it's not for government business, it's inappropriate. So should we stream yeah, but I feel like they're doing it. I mean from us on a government level. You know what I mean, but the problem, any other input. Does anyone? Do we have another word that we can use? I mean we can take it out. It's not a big deal. We have not. We have not had the issue of solicitation, we can easily take it out. So we'll take it out when we said any personal attack, whether verbal or physical. Is that what you want me to say any personal attacks against a community board member staff, member of the public and or elected official or the representative, we can say any personal attacks online and stuff. So if I get an email, I thought I felt like the email that I got today was inappropriate. Does any everyone agree? So what was that? Well? Do we? Do we really want to discuss some of this stuff in public? I mean we really should think about how much we want to air and do not do it. Well, if we add harassment via digital format, whether email include an email will result in the member being blocked. Can I can I block the member because well the member of the public that sent me this inappropriate email? Can I block them, but if I block them, then they're blocked from my email forever. They can't contact me well, I'm just blocking them from I'm, not sure. Honestly. I thought the borough president's office can help us out with a lot right, and I was really disappointed that it came down to you're on your own. You you're on your own and that's it for issues that individual problem is that's the email address that that's the intake for the ethics Committee. If you have a complaint, you send that to that email address, let me send it to Jeremy. We could. We could change that email to the Bx11 that CB the general email you can make that versus your individual email. We can make it the general office email yeah, but then that creates more work for you to forward and filter out okay, so that people only think it's going to the Community Board office because we're getting a copy of this. Well, I mean you can put down the instructions it will be given to the ethics Committee I mean, but that that's really yeah, because you know what I'm really upset at this email for the person to say that I'm going to make sure that the vote gets the that the person gets voted down. I take my job seriously as the ethics chair and we went against one of our own dominic I've known Dominic since day. One he's worked hard on this board. He was on numerous committees, you know I felt bad, but you know what it was the right thing to do and I did it and at the end of the day it caused him to resign. We lost one of our own. We went against one of our own hold on against him. Not everybody maybe knows what you're talking about it's public anyway since, but you might, if you want to clarify for people who just showed up so at the end of the day, I went against one of our team members, one of our group, and then I get accused of doing something like that. So it does not make sense what this person is saying. So I do not know what we can add to the emails. You should just block this person and then just let this person just email the board and then, if there's anything that you need to see it during the meeting I will be bought will be considered, ruled out of water. Yes, if you need to go first outside the gallery, yeah hit that and amend it. Good point. That was a good suggestion. So Al said we're going to just say any outburst from the public during the meeting. Okay, we'll be ruled out. I I'm going to leave it as go result in the individual being asked to move the meeting is that okay or do you want to add them anything else for anybody? I know we spent a lot of topic on this document, but also, I suggest I know it's lengthy, but every time we have a commit meeting like the leadership committee, this I feel like should be attached to it somewhere. It applies to committee meetings, Board meetings. I know we usually do not have a lot of stuff on the agenda. This is a committee agenda, as you can see. It's very short. I have not seen a lengthy committee agenda, so I think adding this portion to all the agendas, I think, is not a bad idea. What do you think we already have this on here right? We just want to have the rules at the bottom of every agenda. It's a fine print. Let me see what I can do, because that's a lot of effects. So that's like probably four times as much as much of what's on, for the committees may not look like him, but that's every time you set up an agenda, have somebody just think, or it could be a cover letter to any agenda. You do not have me too, especially on the website when we post it page one versus three on the website. I do not think it's going to be that bad. Look at this right. It's mostly blank. If you take that text- and you add it usually this thing yeah just send me one just send me what you can play, it's probably easier to just make each gallery flip one big page with that at the top. It's going paper killing trees, but it's you want to do it that way, but that you're, assuming that's you know for me, like we are now but still online. Somehow I think that's what yeah he's getting at, because a lot of people do go to our website. The question is where, on our website, that's going to be prime enough, and I think if you made that the first page of every agenda foreign and then keep that information because it was given to them, so they know that they know that this is something that they, I think right now, with what we're facing. Let's burn some trees fix the problem that we're facing honestly. I know it's going to be a little bit more paper, but we need it says so if we can't fit it in that low column which I'm I would bet you money, we can't again my suggestion just make it the cover to every agenda and then have the real agenda be on page two, so it's in their face and they can't really get around, because not everybody's going to look at that. Go straight to the agenda Ken we can transition into that next year. Let's make sure everybody sees this for at least a year. It's only really seven or eight meetings right, so everybody sees it once everybody gets used to it. Let's move it to a digital format. Why do not yeah we'll do that for sure? Well, every agenda goes on the website yeah. When I'm able to do it a separate vacuum. Well on the agenda page at the very top versus you know, where you go down you scroll and you click at the very top. It should be right there too. That's what should be at the top, but you want it up front where it's going to be in their face, but you want them to see that first from Ken, some edits from Al, some good suggestions- and I know everybody's facing- like you, said harassment after after meetings or outside of meetings for right now, it's unfortunate that we have to take that harassment and honest the board president's office that you know what I do not have to take this, I'm getting I'm getting hammered and harassed. I've signed him, I'm a volunteer. This is not fair. You need to do something or I'm going to not exactly that way, but he was upset that I threatened him. He was upset that I threatened him to resign and I said well, you know I'm not the only one. That's going to be resigned and if we keep getting this harassment, no one's here to get harassed, we're here to do business. So thank you all for doing this type of business and handling the pressure yeah. Yes, and this individual okay, they say so, but they're telling you we have to take care of it ourselves and we're, and if we're in agreement a hundred percent, then we'll take care of it they're not going to be we're going to be here longer than they're going to be in all this. You know what- and I mentioned that I said you know what we're going to end up, taking the wrong action and you're going to have to fix it. I told him, so I think we can move on. I think we can move on so third item on the agenda. Is the draft October full board agenda? I think everybody got it right, but Ken does not have a copy right, Jeremy I'll put it up on my back with me. Are you the only one? No I do not. I do not know it does not matter. No there's still three attendees, just not that I can tell she said she would call Angelo do you know who that is, looks like it's number eight and the elected officials number nine. We did move them last intention for the last, the last time yeah for the elect official himself. You see unless we decided ten minutes. For the rest, that's fine, we've been making them away. We've been making way to the end, and I so far I think I maybe got one complaint. 10 compliments from board members yeah and you know what. If we have to vote on something because our meetings have been going again last one went to what 10 or 11. So if we have to vote on something and it's going to be after nine o'clock- and we have a third of the people leave, I understand you know what 9 pm comes. Everybody's tired everybody's got something to do. I got to put my kid to sleep: let's do our business first and then the other stuff, if we miss it we'll go over later. Well. Let's also remember that this meeting, which has not met since March, is usually where we hash out a lot of stuff and when we do that, so this is a mini, full board meeting. That's how I always get it and now that we're meeting again, this is what we're doing with the agenda. So we're all we're. Not there's no surprises here. It is no reason why the meeting should last beyond two hours. You are not imposing on confirmations or electing officials or disadvantages. You know, they'll introduce you just say you know, send me to the memphis. Please start getting people to sign in before seven o'clock, because at seven o'clock and you're sitting and waiting for four months. What are you talking about yeah? What's up, I do not know yeah the one last full morning, the other four! Well, that's the other thing too. Well so Joe, okay, he calls it. The other people tell me: why do not you just meet the board members? The way we have it set up. Is you commute yourselves. I've called specifically board members to say: hey you're, not speaking, please mute yourself. They do not realize the background noise really picks up when you have 50 people. You started at the beginning right. You got that all clamored, but I tell you I can tell you that yeah my internet's not great at home, but I do. I did get a resolution to it like right now. This is my internet. It's actually really good. This is how this is working. So yes, so thanks to yahay for having this meeting, that's how I figured this out, because although I could connect to Mysterio's Wi- fi, it's unsecured and we got to really think about security nowadays, not just physical harassment, whatever you got to think about online, oh so Debbie reached out to me earlier today about the invite you should have got for the full board meeting. So there are two ways to do: Webex. I really want to move away from my backs, the city's really trying they were going to move to Microsoft teams. I do not know because, as yahay uses doom for his meetings, which I personally know when I'm familiar with and it's more friendly, there's two type of webex meetings- we use the a little bit more stringent, because if I do not just anybody, particularly the public can unmute themselves. We want that risk. We can do. We can have that ability. But as soon as I mute everybody just like some of our board members, they can just immediately unmute themselves and I can kick them out and expel them. We can go that route, though, and it is easier to use the simpler version that board 10 uses, but there's a there's, a there's, a oh there's, a conduit. So for the next meeting I can cancel that invite to a new one. Honestly, I do not. I do not. I do not know why the Community board has its budget right, so spending. I feel like spending 20 bucks a month to get zoom membership. I think is worth it because you can put someone. Let's say we decided to go to executive session, but I do on my meetings. We use zoom. My own account that I pay for monthly. I put people in a waiting room. I just slide them in waiting room and they wait until we're done with executive sesh. If they decide to hang up, they hang up and then I move them back. You can do pollen. So if we have to vote, you can just send it there and people click on their on their zoom. They can vote on there as well. We need to vote on something so many options that I think we should. We should look into like Jeremy said I do not know what city has you know what kind of restrictions they have? Yes, they do we're all yeah individuals, you need, if you you're going to say you know, make yourself. This is a different situation because you're visible, but on one zone you know you still have to have some form of way to recognize one another in order for one person to be speaking at the time, because you can't hear everybody and everything just like you said when Jeremy actually asks you to turn up your life and the people are sitting there and they still do not do that. Yeah there's something wrong with that. These things have to be corrected before you can't even move anywhere, I'm very crazy. You know, but in the same company you can hear everybody just moving on and going on and doing whatever they want to do, because that's what they're used to doing, but they have to learn how to be. We call themselves in order for everybody. Tony, you wanted to say something. Well again, we have two different versions of Webx, so the version that Debbie's used to with board 10 you can rename the phone numbers we could use that. But again, that means the public can mute themselves at any point, and I can mute them again. Then this I have to expel them and see, do not listen well for a private individual, it's fairly inexpensive, but you should be able to do that. We'll. Try would like to recommend that when we're doing our code board meeting that Jeremy and Chris in the office doing this and not from home, be in the office here in the Bronx, whatever scared you in the ground on that have our full board meeting Darren, Lee and Chris today in the office on Poland, Avenue, okay. So second one honestly he's into he's listening to me, that's okay! I, like it good, thank you, so I do not think it's fair, like any other reading that lasted so for someone to be in an office. I do not think it's fair. I think we should solve that before moving on to having someone attend a meeting in the community as the sergeant- at- arms. If it's easier enjoy saying you have done from the office, because internet connection is better, they know the office layout and everything I will keep people at two minutes. I do not care for Jeremy knows in two minutes: cut them off and play me went into executive session. Remember that was like an hour and I think I think if it happens again where we do have technical issues and that took probably five or ten minutes of our time. If it does happen again, then I think it's worth looking at it, but I do not think it's fair to have a city employee until 11:40 P.M, 11, 4, 0, 4, P.M and in office in the I just do not think it's fair. You know, but you know what at Einstein, I think after 10 P.M and it happened. I think one time here. It's 10 P.M in the same exact room and everybody's like let's go, that's it. This is out of hand, but once we're sitting in our home we're just on our couches, and I understand we're still responsible we're still in that meeting. I just do not think it's to have Harriet, Chris or Jeremy in an office until 11 P.M. That's what I think this is four hours as far as our reports go to the reactors, make it succinct. We should be out of there in an hour and a half down. We should not be waiting in that would go away beyond seven o'clock. Seven ten should be a cuddle, they all attacks. I know we all kissed him we're getting naturals if you're going to just recognize that you do not have to really recognize because they're not going to speak other people, nothing happens. You do not really have a conversation about. It is legally mine. Legally, the grain of our presence, Office Christopher Harris, does not have to work at night legally. They do not have to work at night, so we can talk about making Chris go, but to my knowledge he legally does not have to so. The other thing is, I appreciate you know the fact that if you recognize that the mean goes to 11 o'clock, I'm there till 12 o'clock unequivocally, even though people at home are going to be very upset with me. You know and it had happened, but I do have six. We had one pickup last meeting and this I do not have to join in back into the meeting as late as I did. Chris did pick up. Chris knows how to do this. I did set it up that way as a backup and even though yeah took out 10, maybe 15 minutes at most, because there is two recordings. Both recordings well Facebook went down, but then Webex got the whole meeting and they're both on the website. I do appreciate a little mindfulness in terms of me driving home. The question is: what's the difference between you being in the office and you people, that's all I want to know and if you're, if the motion is that you have to be in the office, then why do you have to be in the office? So the issue last meeting again, it was only the last meeting was that my internet went down so whether optimum went out or it got unplugged by an accident. I'm not sure exactly what should happen right now. This is live through this. So if the cell phone tower goes down, that's a different story, but that's how I'm doing this and that's how I did the meeting last night and I ran my video all last night. Well, the second half, when I said I can run the video now without it being a concern. Okay, two things! Well, if the meeting had been an einstein is the same amount of time you get out of 10 o'clock, you're still not yeah. Well, you're, not there, no you're, not, I think the 10 whenever whatever the meaning works, it's the same thing for you. That's one point second point I have to make with is: when we sign in, we do not start the meeting to like a race meeting, I'm not going to be starting to import the eighth, because how many people call in and then you have to go who's this who's. This loser. That takes a good point. Tell me if it's fair, if you have to actually if you can not get on a phone or a tablet or a laptop, and you have to dial in and Jeremy has to figure who you are. How do you ask for your last four of your phone number? You know what, if you're in that position, just ask to be excused and you might not be able to speak if it's going to affect impact one or two members of the community, so be it. We saved for 45 minutes how many people selling less so on average last meeting I mean it depends. I can't have an issue with his is his thing right here when I see it, 17, 3 and 5 between three and five hold minutes. Why do not? Why do not? We should just do roll call, a roll call attendance every meeting and he has to figure out who they are well. You know what, if you've died, you're not going to be heard on this meeting, let's say 45 minutes. Can we at least agree to that? I know I I'm too, I'm too patient is what a lot of people tell me and, as angry knows, some of the past means people called me rude publicly, but like at some point, I just got a call. If people do not send their minutes in then you can't really say you know in charge of the minute. So I think that we should put it in the chat, so I think that we should put a little pressure on the chairs to get those medicine as soon as possible, so we can have them at the meeting and me as secretary. I would be more than happy to do that because you know I feel like that, should be one I'll give you an example that worked really well last night at the end of the meeting, one of our care people said so Jeremy who's doing new ones, and I said it should really come from a board member because it really should, because I think you need to get in the habit of doing minutes in terms of my own. Some people do some people do not, and ultimately I look as we're talking it for those of you who are interested in the executive order. I got I got. We have over 13,000 residents at this point for 128,000., so we got a lot of people to assist right. We not just board members, so so somebody agreed last night to do a summary. Fine summary I'll do the formatting. I do not care, but somebody something this meeting who's taking the minutes. You have two people in the office. You got reporting again just hit. The bullet points, go Harry, listen to it, click on the bullet points and that's it, but is not it easier for somebody in the meeting I heard it was not in the meeting you can require to be in the meetings, but then again I was on the phone with her all day today, Chris took the day out. I have a meeting and somebody who wants to take the minutes he's not taking him in his property. This way you hear it and Harry's got the time, and you should years and years ago, that's how it used to be and every at every meeting at every committee meeting there was one person that was designated to take the minutes. I do not know what happened, but that's how it's that's, how it was and that's how it should be. It is not. It is not should, or it should not be her responsibility to take my minutes when I'm the one that's at the meeting, and I know exactly what happened yeah sometimes I may forget to put on that stupid. Recording now that I know how to you know, use it the first meeting I did not even want to touch it because I did not know what the heck it was so, but I but I take my own minions and if I forget anything I like, in order to call my you know my member and say Pat, what was it that you said you know. Would you say this? You say that it's my I feel like it's my responsibility as a co- chair. Nobody even discussed that yes and if he does not, I do not think once he calls for a motion. I do not think you can not do it. You can move office that you do at home, so it's less likely yeah, I mean whatever you Joe made the motion, so if he wants to withdraw, he can it's up to you. I can not help your error so, for example, tonight I was having a conversation with another board member about winning early, no that's at their last commandment now and they could not get on they're, not here. So I can't that that's the big that's one of the biggest problems here, as we said, 20 minutes always go here. Yet no, okay, let's go down the roll call list. That's a lot of people not needing themselves. Well then, we're going to have to start the meeting as soon as we have a form as soon as we have a forum yeah. Of course, let's talk to me and then as people come in, you can deal with that silently on the side, without interfering with the meeting, because every time you have to stop to you know to cut into the meeting, because you're waiting for somebody to put on everybody has to stop, but we tend to care to the complainers for this board. Okay, so, okay, I know the motion is still live. So would you like to withdraw the motion or you want to continue? I actually have another suggestion, but but I think, if you're going to dial in, you should be required to dial in 15 minutes early to get Jeremy to tag your phone number. He does not always start the meeting until morning last time at 6:30, but he was on last time at 6:30. so that I just wanted to mention that full board. Yes, one 6:30., oh start renaming them. Will you continue? The problem is. I can right now right, probably something like ken right now. He could not use his volume, so he was not expecting it. That's what happens last night right Debbie. Sometimes it works from you, but most of the time, it's not so I'm talking about taking the time to change the numbers. Yes, you have a list of people's numbers that they're going to be falling from place in the background to turn around well, the other thing, the other thing that board members really probably need to do that we did in the beginning, like Brandon had problems he said earlier. I would work with him individually right to help him get online. I've done that with some of you here right. I can always do that. We can always do that right. Eric can do this. Chris can do this. One, like you said, is right. Yeah. If you have a list, let Chris make the call that people have not online yet you're going to. If I have a problem, a friend has a problem: Chris could walk us through it who run the meeting, because, what's happening is every time you stop it's taking time? Oh yeah, I would but so Joe made a motion that Jeremy well Chris, Jeremy or Chris, but Chris is, I guess both of them should be in the office. What job were you on that? When your constituent says you need to be there? He was saying I can't be there because I'm not required to be there. What kind of job do you have there are union employees want to stick to their union? Oh, please, do not tell me tell the world presents on me: they're, the ones that told me you'll see how fast you're there. Let's continue the motion, so the motion is for fire, Chris or Jeremy and Jeremy, both of them to be in the office during General Board meetings, global agreements, it was seconded by frankel, so all in favor hi, I'm the only one how supportive, if we have a public hearing things like that, perhaps we need to separate or segregate public hearing, or you mean executive sessions. Okay, so at let's say: 9:30 comes right. You've had enough, can he can he call for a motion to adjourn the meeting yeah anytime? Anybody can so call firm. You know what, if you get some tired people that will agree with you, it's a little difficult to do that? No he's, not me yeah! Well, he can. He can find a way to volunteer in here. So we can do that or we give a nine o'clock or 9:30 whatever time we pick end in time and the only way to exceed it is. If we vote to exceed it. I would also revisit the fact that you know we have to do something else. Maybe make a time a time limit. I think one of the things we have to do everybody. We have to start the meeting at seven o'clock. So it's attention to the attention upon us to make sure that we're in by seven o'clock this way as soon as we have a as soon as we have a forum. We start the meeting we shut down on the on the reports, because the report is in get 10 minutes that'll. When we ask questions, let's be succinct about our questions and not go on for a half an hour to explain what our question is when it's only about two cents and jeremy on your part, you explain too much you say yeah, you do you try to explain everything, everybody, nobody they're, wasting all your time that you're talking to us and tell us what you're doing another question they'll ask you. I would not have to say like the rest of the committees, here's my report, it's online, do not know, that's what happens. No you're doing the report, that's fine, but what happens sometimes more than you have to only because somebody has a question about it. That's fine, but you know this way that'll cut down. Can I just say I submitted my report speak to me after the meeting you could do that. You could say I submitted my report. There might be one or two items on the report that you might want to point out point out those two things that the rest of the things are on my report. If you have any questions, I need you to. I need all of you to back me and say something so I know I want to they start. I need to shut these people down. They can call you the next day. You can say that no, you need to tell them that tell them if they have any issues. They'll make a complaint we got. I will say that, but when they try to change the narrative there'll be a couple of things on your report that are important, hit those things and then say I'm going to mention these two things. Everything else is in my report. If you have any questions, why can't you send my report is submitted? Let me ask talk to me after the meeting Jeremy says my report is online. Does anyone have any questions? Okay, if anyone has any questions you can reach me tomorrow morning, yeah he's working five days a week where not so, if anyone has any questions for us, they should ask during that meeting because they're not going to ask the next morning because nobody's going to answer them. Nobody reads the reports online. That's the problem. Well, yeah! That's their problem. I guess so. The other thing related to these meeting issues. Everybody here. Do you have a smartphone everybody here? Do you have a smartphone? Can you go on the internet? Can you watch the video? No so, but so anybody that does like better area issues I mean I will work with you individually. I mean, I know you have a computer at home Joe. I do not know how I know I know that's a problem but deadly. Where now I should look at your phone whatever you have, you do it and try to work out this one message, listen about it and I got it. Let's move on to the next item. So we have a draft calendar November calendar. Does anyone have any issues with it for any additions or oh yeah? I kind of moved on to the calendar, I'm not going to itemize my issues, I'm just going to submit my report, the ones that need them. Okay, I'm! Okay with that. Only because we're doing this online if he has to unmute mute one, two, three, four five committees and they have all have nothing to say how about we just make it. If you have something for your committee talk to Jeremy before so he can specifically unmute you. But if you do not have anything then he's just going to skip those committees, everybody the agenda will get. I mean you can tell me right now. The agenda will change because you did not have a meeting yet yeah ethics and public safety yeah. But if I'm going to upload the minutes, nothing should change you which what some people are saying is do not even list you guys. No, he can skip. I think he can say well, no one from the leadership, ethics, Committee, land use parks or public safety sent me anything. The minutes are online for the for the meetings that were held because, honestly, what do we say? We held the meeting. The minutes are online, and can we skip that? I think you should let the chairperson say that okay, that's that committee. They should make that statement. I know that's just my point. Okay then distinguish what we have all right demand: canadian development, because we have we'll have budget priority requests, how we could formulate, hopefully finalized more or less, and we will submit them that has to be voted on. These electives have not confirmed yet. Okay, no next month, it's on Monday, no okay. So we got that out of the way. Now we can move on to the calendar initiation of the calendar. So this is item number four we're going over the meetings and events calendar. So I got agenda items from Hazel, Community development. We have agenda items, economic development, I do we should talk about sanitation. You have agenda items, health cause. If you do not schedule it, I'm not I'm not going to schedule. It there's no reason to schedule it to cancel it, because you know you have a job items and then obviously we're not meeting Einstein Range. So is this the biggest room that they have here? No, that room is the room one big round table. Oh you have to record it, and so I have to use this model. I really wanted us to meet in person to try to test this out at a smaller setting. So no, I think this is great. I missed a lot of people. I have not seen a lot of people, so this is great. We tested it out, you know. Are we going to do the same thing next month? Do you want to meet again in person for the leadership, so Tony has not seen anyone in months, so, okay, so well so this month, we'll meet again we'll try a bigger room to test it out to see if there's a bigger echo or the Microphone system, Board. No, that's a holdover from okay! I have this is some of this is current some of us just hold up for March or so basically we're approving the dates. Yeah so basically times and the locations are up for grabs okay, so we will show you the calendar, borrowing any last minute changes all on paper. What time for this committee going same time, yeah everybody? Where is it yeah? So Tony? You want to see people and you want us to defeat so you I think we should probably not have any drinks, because I think then they're restricted, there's further restrictions on drinks. Maybe this is not working, so I'm just going to do an audio good, audio recording as a backup, maybe all right old business, any old business. I do have one then we'll go to new business and I do have a quick Bob press mentioned something at my public Safety committee meeting. He did say how come the liquor licenses approvals are not being done on the public Safety committee meeting. Why are they done on the economic development or what's what committee does it the economic development? Why is not it public safety? I do not have an answer to that. Does anyone have an answer to that voicemail that we've always done because this person is involved in how many times did the authorities called for that bar or whatever? I do not know, I'm, okay with it being under economic development, because if it was public safety, then I probably have to put the committee. Maybe we should not rely so heavily on the police. I mean there are other agencies involved with running a business, a liquor license establishment. I mean we and we do not just so it's the Economic Development committee should we can be concerned about businesses, not just liquor, license establishments and it's all it's overall safety. It's anything that has to do with a licensed premise: each and everything you know any other new business. Yes, is it possible for us to get up the listing of last week right yeah? I think what we'll need now is is a list of the people that have not been attending meetings. We need another list, I think. Last year you sent the summary how many meetings so I'm having that's what I was one of the things I was on the phone to carry it all day today and the intern. So we should. We do have members of the public here. We should have republican, correct yeah. Yes, anything from members of the public. Thank you so meetings ending at 8:30, P.M, 8:30, 8 p.m.
