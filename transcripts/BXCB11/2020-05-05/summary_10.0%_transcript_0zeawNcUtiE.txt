There's somebody else from the computer, I'm going to open up to the phone people all right: Yourself, everyone, everybody!, Unfortunately again, unless somebody has a better idea, I, do not know a better way, so I'm used to phone people, again.
Getting them engaged as much as we can through social media, our website and through our providers, because it is a lot going on, and we know that our patients are suffering either suffering from griefs and deaths from family members and friends, and we are promoting our health behavior services to our community, and we know that our patients and our communities suffering from social determinants of health, that we all know that health is just not only About you- know: health care and medicine.
That, you know, is all the Bronx that we want to make sure that our vulnerable population is really still stays at home.
There are more testing sites, as you know, opening up in the city, but the New York City Department of Health really has limited us in terms of testings for our patients.
We really want to know how good these tests are they covered before we start promoting it to our community.
So we're actively trying to figure all this information out as we speak, and are you getting any word on how fast they will start opening up the test to the public in general?
We have a lot of relationships with the hospitals, Saint Barnabas, Hospitals and Mount Superior hospital in the Bronx We're trying to figure out if we're trying to figure out participant has left the meeting this these drugs are working and Really what's also important is that we want to tell our patients.
I know everybody's really scared to, but we want to make sure that our community is not suffering from their chronic diseases and worsening their diabetes and hypertension suffering from strokes and heart attacks at home.
The board doctors in the Bronx and New York City have rapidly Tran transformed their practices to online, as you guys have with your meetings to really serve our community.
Although my office is physically closed, we are taking phone calls, we're taking messages, emails , we're working, I'm out there, every day, helping and assisting in any which way I can for those of you that do not have my phone number.
Have some great supermarkets out there that have taken some extraordinary precautions by putting up glass shields and supplying all of the PPE that is needed to their employees, but I think it would be a priority to have those workers tested so that we know they're safe to be serving us, and it's for the protection of those employees as well.
So we're going to be coming together as a delegation to make sure that this administration and the city recognizes the importance and the needs and the assessments that have to be made in the borough of the Bronx.
Hi Mark, so I heard that there's some a bill proposed to basically halt all evictions until April of 2021, so until next year., and we want to make sure that our tenants are not forced out into the street not evicted for non- payment rent due to these unique circumstances that will be on their control, that we should have safety nets in place for them.
I would be more willing to understand and work with it, but when the banks everybody's in a moratorium, what you should all be aware, is, nobody can be brought to housing court right now and be evicted for the next 90 days in the states stepped in the city.
The delegation on the city, Council for the brother, Bronx is coming together to push back, and I know that we're working with our elected officials up in Albany also to make sure that we get what we're entitled to.
So I was just because badass is mostly made up in two and three family homes, so Org petition asking for the suspension of real estate, taxes, water and sewer charges that are coming up also in July their quarterly, as well and for our small businesses, sales, tax and income tax.
I'm, not saying that the fight is over the city and the state are claiming that they need those funds to make sure that every all of the other safety nets are in place from police to sanitation, to hospitals and healthcare.
We're trying to figure all this out now at the city, Council working with our colleagues in Albany on how to come up with a creative way to make sure that especially our small property, owners.
It's, going to require city, state and federal to come together to assess the needs and make sure that we do not cut services that are important, but also make sure that we spend every dollar as if it was our own money.
We can have a longer conversation about it if you'd like, but I, you know, But it's it was something that I could not vote for on issues of just generally speaking on cover 19.
You can get all the information from Caitlyn, but this is going to be so that we can we're going to have different folks talk about some of the issues that are facing, people that are employed right now, and some of the solutions that are being proposed, as well as some assistance, and hopefully the state will get its act.
We have all heard about the fact that there just was no way that they could handle as much new influx as they've got of people that are unemployed, so we're working with the state to kind of get them to do it more quickly, but we're going to have that on May 5th, which weirdly enough is next week.
There's, one in particular that we just got a win on just a couple of days ago, and that is, there was a whole issue about reimbursements on mental health services to community health, centers and reimbursements that they were not getting from the state they required.
It required patients to actually come into the community health center to get telehealth services for mental health services, and it was kind of like you're putting people at risk.
Most of these sites are driving only, and we want to make sure that we can provide some for folks who do not have access to a car and so are working to expand testing capacity.
It is not really going to prove possible if we can't do contact tracing, which means testing individuals, testing very widely, not just people who have symptoms, not just people who are potentially hospitalized, but everyone hopefully, and then figure out who they have been in contact with, which is what places like Taiwan and South Korea did.
It is one of the things that, and we had this conversation in person before I know that there's many members in the There's many folks in the in the community board that disagree with me on this, and I.
So just a reminder that if the principal elected is in the meeting like the center here, Council member Joe and I Family member Fernandez is here , It was just in regards to the state, probably at some point, maybe looking into mandating tests for major corporations.
We want to make sure that we, yes, that we, like, I said when you, when you take someone and you quarantine them even away from their family for 14 days.
But you know what I do know that the senior centers in my district have tried to really keep in contact with the folks who they serve on a regular basis to make sure that they can provide food if necessary that they can provide some other services, so I had thought about, for example, the tablets that we're getting to the children in schools right to make sure that, particularly for those folks who do not have computers at home.
The first thing I wanted to just bring up, because we were talking about antibody testing- Is, that I work for two of the major healthcare corporations.
I know a lot of people are concerned that they want this test to be available, and I just want to put it out there that we're working on it.
A lot of researches is being conducted, and just like you mentioned before, we are actively taking information, of course, from other countries overseas, but because we do not know the the immunity of the people that may have already contracted Covid-19 and if you can get reinfected or not.
Before we have it open and available to the public The second thing I wanted to also ask you if you knew a little bit more about this, like Fmla, That's happening, so there are people and who are essential.
We have this high turnaround time because we may have people who are essential healthcare workers who are working with Covid-19 to treat the patients and we need to be able to allow people to be home Covid-19, not continue to spread it while trying to save lives of other people that also have code.
You know, I, think that there's a shortage of healthcare workers and so I would like to actually have a conversation offline about it.
So I want to make sure that we get back to legislating so that we can have a thoughtful conversation with the governor and with the assembly about how to do something about canceling, rent and doing it in a way that helps tenants who currently do not have the ability and no So many tenants, acrosss the entire state that are worried.
I can't ask a small business owner pay for this, Even, Though I know you got no revenue, I do not care like we have to be thoughtful about it, so I agree with you, but if we do, but if we do not, if we do not act aggressively, the impact that that's going to have on the entire on the entire endeavor, I mean we're having issues with homelessness If, we do not, if we do not proactively deal with the fact that people are not going to be able to pay their rent because they have not had income for two months.
We could have a longer conversation about that, but the last point I wanted to make was that we'll get through this together because we're resilient bastards, the Bronx is a brazilian group of folk, but let's make sure that as we get through it, we at the other end do not go back to the way things were because then this is going to happen.
Whatever is open, senior centers, to make sure that they have at least some sign of sanitation in their entrance, but also I want to be able to share it with Community Association.
So now I'm in communication, with the state department of finance to see if they can find any trace of that- My communication, with the attorney general's office, I, requested to do a teletown hall with her, so we're going to get that in the works, and hopefully you know with enough participants.
Please help out your landlord, but if you can't understandable and if you know you need help advocating for that, I'd be happy to do so as to why you need to be protected from your landlord if they are like the ones that the Senator mentioned that are trying to this time.
Anybody wants to contact me, please go through Jeremy So. The update that I received from the city, I think today was that they're still on track for opening up the homeless, shelter.
I had been in communications with folks in Cec 11 a long time ago about another school, but I just want to make sure that people continue to communicate with me on those things, One of the things that we have done.
There will be an information update, so I just wanted to put it out there, because I know there are a lot of people within the community and parents etc that are looking forward to that.
Also we're asking that people just keep your ears and eyes open for any incidents of child abuse that may be going on because of the lower contact with mandated reporters, we're, not sure what is being done or if it's happening, if there has been an increase, a decrease so just be vigilant about child abuse and that's pretty much it from the dean's office.
I also want to thank Council member Joan, I for mentioning the disadvantages that our small businesses are facing at this time with the legislation that has been coming from the federal government.
I know that particularly CB11 has had a lot of issues with their postal services, So I just want to give a quick update on that, particularly at the Allerton and esplanade post.
And I want to thank everything that has been said and done, but there have been days that people in the 104,69 area code or zip code have not gotten their mail for two days at a time.
I, know that there's a shortage of staff, but just today, no mail in this area and what is being done to address that right, and so it's in moments like these, where we hear from the community that we can reach out to our congressional liaison and find out exactly about that zip code.
We're not seeing this come up and work very closely with our congressional liaison and the Bronx postmaster to ensure that everyone's getting their mail and that we're flagging everything that you folks are seeing on the ground.
Along, with my contact, information, Senator Rivera covered the budget pieces and all what's going on in Albany, so I'll just go straight to the district office, we're all working remotely, as everyone else seems to be we're all.
You we're getting calls about PPE access to food, probably the same kind of calls that every other elected's office is getting We're trying to connect people up with the resources they need.
If any questions we're going to move on to State Senator Bailey's office.
If you'd like to know any more information about things that Senator Bailey has been doing in the community.
