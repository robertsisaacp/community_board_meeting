It is april 30th 2020 This is the community Bronx community board 11 full board meeting for yeah april 2020 Let me quote the agenda for everybody: I think you call that yes, I called the current agenda, which is uploaded as late as 5 pm, right, Can, I, race, who's using a computer, see the agenda I will zoom in Anybody would like to volunteer to be sergeant of arms.
Unfortunately again, unless somebody has a better idea, I, don't know a better way, so I'm used to phone people again right all right again: I'm going to share the agenda again: try to okay, Yes from the union community health center she's, the director of wellness and health promotion there and she's going to talk about health care fears, social determinants of health and behavioral health and questions are for board members.
We've come up with resources that you guys have all shared with us available for the community and we're having our doctors talk about these things to our patients, We really want to also emphasize the importance that right now the numbers are of transmission, for covid's are lows, our admissions are low, but we are all very on alert, especially for our vulnerable population.
That, you know, is all the Bronx that we want to make sure that our vulnerable population is really still stays at home, Still as precaution, all our essential workers to please take the same precautions to wear masks hand washing, so we're really promoting as much as we can for everyone to stay home to stay safe to protect ourselves and our community, and we really care about all of us in the community.
We really want to know how good these tests are they covered before we start promoting it to our community, so we're actively trying to figure all this information out as we speak, and are you getting any word on how fast they will start opening up the test to the public in general?.
We really want to make sure that you tell the community about not our services Doctors in the Bronx and new york city have rapidly tran transformed their practices to online, as you guys have with your meetings to really serve our community and I'm gonna go back to the agenda jeremy Our take-home messages is, please stay home to help stop the spread and also protect our medically vulnerable population You all hear me well, but I first want to extend my sincerest condolences to all of those that have lost family members and loved ones during this crisis and pandemic I come true from the devastation of loss of life to all of the uncertainties.
That education is a priority that our seniors are attended to and everyone else in between so Resume they're open to the public When it comes to our budget hearings Yesterday when I shared the small business committee hearing alongside jeremy, did you just interrupt me?
I would be more willing to understand and work with it, but when the banks everybody's in a moratorium, what you should all be aware, is, nobody can be brought to housing court right now and be evicted for the next 90 days in the states stepped in the city Now. There was a proposal made that until april of 2021, you could not be evicted not that a landlord can't take an action against you, but the marshal would not evict a tank It could be a disaster for the housing market all together, because it would be a total collapse, but not excluding at least small properties, in particular two three and four family homes, and that bill also covered commercial tenants as well We want to make sure that our tenants during this crisis are not evicted.
We've got real issues here, 100 right and absolutely health and safety are first and foremost, but the next thing right, obviously, is our income and how we keep the economy going and how we keep our families and how we keep our kids even in school, right So. What keeps coming knocking on our door, the bills they're, not stopping con ed's, not stop You, know, then give people free electricity for three months give people free water for three months like why hit people when they're down the city should you know, should really step in and help people during these times, and here's there's a couple of way through our utilities and our necessities that they could help us.
Just, like you, spend your money, you make sure that you can afford it, and every dollar you make They were allocated 49 billion dollars for the state, how much the Bronx gonna get out of that first and second, the city was always in surplus, and you just mentioned these 80 billion in surplus They, don't give any cuts to the people, including even dp , We've, been squeezing our renters through utility charges and we've been spending that money, and maybe this is an eye opener, an opportunity for local and state and federal government to hit a reset button and re-evaluate what we've been doing.
We've been overspending, we haven't been putting that money or spending as wisely as we should, and we go back to the basics It's going to require city, state and federal to come together to assess the needs and make sure that we don't cut services that are important, but also make sure that we spend every dollar as if it was our own money and that's how we should be looking at this budget you're.
My office number and my email address for you, as well as her own My colleague is on with natalia fernandez the assembly women we're going to be working together to make sure that we do the most we can, and this is our priority so whether it be protecting you or being a voice for you, it will also include bringing home the bacon and I'm relying on natalya to work with me to make sure that this district gets all of the funding that it deserves.
We all know we have all heard about the fact that there just was no way that they could handle as much new influx as they've got of people that are unemployed, so we're working with the state to kind of get them to do it more quickly, but we're gonna have that on may 5th, which weirdly enough is next week.
We want to expand testing capacity and in places like the Bronx, we definitely to make sure that we do that before we before we come back.
In most cases, so you know not true accurate, but we want to make sure that if people are that they can give it to somebody else, we want to make sure that they're kept in a place where they don't give it to other folks and I see you that can be the case, but in general we're trying to look at the data Once we start getting these tests that senator rivera is talking about, we will be able to make these decisions and will help, but we don't have that yet This is all really hard for us, we're all working through this, but hopefully we'll figure out all this testing and antibody testing soon, brian or I'm.
This is for the senator, yes hi The first thing I wanted to just bring up, because we were talking about antibody testing , so we started to do antibody testing in a couple of sites across the city and that's being run by the new york state department of health.
So I took the test myself yesterday and you have to be basically an employee of h, plus h, which I am, and you have to be invited also to take the test because it's part of research a lot of people are concerned that they want this test to be available A lot of researches is being conducted, and just like you mentioned before, we are actively taking information, of course, from other countries overseas, but because we don't know the the immunity of the people that may have already contracted Covid-19 and if you can get reinfected or not, This is something that we are just still conducting as part of research before we have it open and available to the public and then the second thing I wanted to also ask you if you knew a little bit more about this, like fmla that's happening.
So I want to make sure that we get back to legislating so that we can have a thoughtful conversation with the governor and with the assembly about how to do something about canceling, rent and doing it in a way that helps tenants who currently do not have the ability and no there's so many tenants across the entire state that are worried about So. If you completely cut off the rent, you're cutting off their money, supply I agree, which is why, as I said earlier, and an attempt and council member joe- I can't say to them, now: you're going to have to pay it, even though you're going to get no income or no revenue from your tenants like we have to be balanced out so, but because they're not getting revenue, because the tenants have no revenue.
We could have a longer conversation about that, but the last point I wanted to make was that we'll get through this together because we're resilient bastards, the Bronx is a brazilian group of folk, but let's make sure that as we get through it, we at the other end do not go back to the way things were because then this is gonna happen again.
I am getting a shipment of hand sanitizers so about a hundred gallon bottles that I'm going to try to map out to give out to right now essential businesses, whatever is open senior centers, to make sure that they have at least some sign of sanitation in their entrance, but also I want to be able to share it with community association If you know, or can utilize the bottle of sanitate sanitizer, please let me know hopefully I'll get that in the next week or two much like to what the senator said.
But if you can't understandable and if you know you need help advocating for that, I'd be happy to do so as to why you need to be protected from your landlord if they are like the ones that the senator mentioned that are trying to this time.
If anybody wants to contact me, please go through jeremy So. The update that I received from the city I think today was that they're still on track for opening up the homeless, shelter, Yet I, let's see who else is on the agenda Having a hard time with my damn computer with the new york city comptroller's office, One we've been working from home We had a town hall, along with senator biasy that had over I think it was 400 people in the tendon I know.
So these meetings should not be the first time I hear of things and I am home and would love to speak to some of you all there's a lot of information and it needs to get flushed through and become transparent and she rallied all of them off, because she knows them like the back of her hand and probably the end of may or the beginning of June There will be an information update, so I just wanted to put it out there because I know there are a lot of people within the community and parents etc.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any assistance, Let's see , I forget who's here, christina catherine from the Bronx district attorney's office, Everyone I A family member or friend, the da's office were working remotely at the time the entire office The all court appearances and trials have been held virtually in conjunction with pd We are handling the more violent cases that fall under felony charges and any instances that have a victim any crimes that may have a victim attached to it, because, as excuse me, I'm sorry because there's a senator gustavo mentioned that there is a high increase in those who are incarcerated becoming contaminated with the virus infected with the virus.
I've also sent some documents to jeremy, which can be shared with the board members and the constituents of community board 11 Our crime victim assistance unit is still up and running, and so, if you look on the guide, you can get information on how people can seek resources, be it be it therapy or whatever They may need Also we're asking that people just keep your ears and eyes open for any incidents of child abuse that may be going on because of the lower contact with mandated reporters.
This is unacceptable and I mean yes, I know that there's a shortage of staff, but just today, no mail in this area and what is being done to address that right, and so it's in moments like these, where we hear from the community that we can reach out to our congressional liaison and find out exactly about that zip code Do, you know which post office serves that zip code?
If you'd like to know any more information about things that senator bailey has been doing in the community.
You read that al motion to request senator alexander hold I'm going to mute to do you need the motion again now closing opposition regarding carnegie hill's proposal Let me read that restate that for everybody, because I'm not sure you got cut off, I mean because some people are not seeing the computer screen So a motion to request state senator alessandra biagi, send the new york state office of addiction services and supports an email or letter of opposition regarding carnegie hill's proposal for 2500 williamsburg road Anybody wants to keep that second jeremy or abstentions.
