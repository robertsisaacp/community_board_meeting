And so it is 604 p.m. this is the community board 11 Public Safety Committee meeting of April 22nd 2020 I'm, going to yeah I. Do you want to talk at all, or do you want to just up over to the CNY I'll just say real, quick? Thank you all for joining this webinar or telecon, whatever you want to call it at this time. I know we're in challenging times, and we appreciate you. Dialing in this is local information. I know we hear the governor speak the president, the governor, the mayor, but this is a really local, and this is this: opens it up for our community to listen in to what's going on locally, so I just want to start off by thanking the essential employees, the FDNY and the NYPD. Thank you very much for all that you do. We really appreciate you, especially during times like this, when it's a national emergency, so we appreciate you and that's all I have I think we're good to get started with the agenda. We can start with the FDNY, so fabrizio yeah I'm, here, okay you're on this two one, zero two number right: correct, yeah, okay, so I'm happy all right! Don't have the agenda in front of me. Okay, so go ahead. Radio, we're saying I have general talking point of exactly just providing an overview currently of where we're at as the department in terms of overall call volume response times and medical leave. That really addresses where the department is that right now in overall hub in 1910 demux, just to give an overview ultimately, on those three points that I just made on the local approach in terms of overall structural fires versus our statistics on a more local look, I'd have to circle back with you guys, but I can provide me any info both this. If we want it and we want to fine tune it so more little statistics as well: okay, Tony going to Jeremy, don't need ya, knew yourself, please Tony! Here's me is mute yourself. I know: please meet yourself meet your phone, so that's yeah! Alright, I'm gonna have to stop sharing screen sure cuz. I can't view I'm going to go back to you. Alright, so go ahead. Fdny! Oh my god me you and I needed everybody. Gon meet you hold on alright, go ahead for easy! Oh you were saying alright yeah, you hear me alright. So in previous weeks the number of medical school calls fight and was very high over a sustained period of time. In late March, we were doing more than 6,000 calls a day. This was a challenge because not only were we the busiest that we've ever been, but we also were experiencing a high level of medical leave among EMS members. However, we took several steps to challenge to handle these challenges. We activated the National ambulance contract, which was organized beautiful Emma and brought 250 and Flinders, and five hundred personnel from around the country to assist here in New York City at various signs. We have up to 150 of these units, helping FDNY within the 911 system. Additionally, we also have called upon private hospital already work within the 9-1-1 system, which are voluntary hospitals for the surge and to take on additional tours. Additionally, we've graduated an EMT and a paramedic class early does have more members out into the field. We've also implemented the responsive, which are vehicles paired with EMT and firefighter, who has CF Rd trained into the total to cover medical run. One thing is that we, and one key point to highlight, is that we may be moved early to the process as we knew that there would be demand everywhere by the time the crisis became full. With these changes and lots of overtime. Our members have been able to rise to these challenges and complete the mission at hand. All value more recently has been. A trend has been trending in a positive direction. Over the last couple of weeks, we've seen an increase in call. The last few days have been between 3,500 to 4,000 calls, which is still high, but is much crude in comparison. As I mentioned later, arts, where we were experiencing over 6,000, we'll continue monitoring to see whether calls continue trending in the right direction. We're aware that other areas have plateaued or even experienced surges after they seem to be past. The peak regarding response times response times are fluid and are affected by a variety of factors. When call volume was highest. Respond. Time were also higher. The measure that we took to deal with that increased call volume we're also about bringing down respond times more units on the street and more personnel. We're able to get to the next call faster response times are also affected by turnover from time at hospital when emergency departments are backed up and overloaded. If our ambulances longer to deliver the patient gets back out. The next call we worked with Hospital to try to improve turnaround times and the delivery process as much as possible and onto the topic medical leave. We closed subtract for medical leave and it's been much higher during these last five weeks we instruct all members who are experienced symptoms to stay home so that they don't risk spreading the virus to their fellow members or members of the public. These rates, also trended, has also turned it positively lately we're at one point: medical leave among firefighters and officers was over 20 percent and among ethnic members was over 25 percent. The numbers a stand that close to 12% for fire and close to 16 percent for EMS. These numbers still highly look forward to them improved further that they are improved and trending in the right section. Members who are experiencing symptoms have the option to department provided hotel rooms if they wish to quarantine away from their family this week and spreading I started last week we began testing symptomatic members for wish to be tested and we're close to complete the all those members who wanted to be tested which we were working with: various health care providers and 54 locations, and next week we will now start testing those members that did not show any sense of whoever wants to get tested. Is there anything wraps up my updated there anything specific that I can answer any questions running these updates. So you see here get back to us on specific. So obviously, within our district retail, the agenda we had or a concern about. What's in our district engine, 90 lighter 41 engine 96 squad, 61 battalion 25 million overall run. Ultimately, the core value I think we're concerned about both okay I mean I. Could I could check in with the battalions or with the division, both the EMS and fire and I could circle back in terms of seeing how that impacted both ends of irony mmm yeah. Now that was very good information. Thank you very much for it. If we can get something more specific for our community board jurisdiction, that would be great whenever you have it. If you can just send it to us, send a brief summary. We can forward that to the rest of the members, Theresa you're, good, more local statistics if elected, and they did get your email about it for children, education, I, think yeah. So one thing is the FDNY. Despite the fires and Jeremy, you know, I think we've been quite responsive. I know there was that major alarm fire a couple weeks back on Kruger, which we provided and started providing the information. That's when we are really transitioning to the digital platform, but it's safe to say now that we are loading. Video content. Every day we've been sharing, with de we've, been sharing with not-for-profit organizations with all the community boards for those that know firing life safety, education right now, physically, as at a hall where, traditionally, our firefighters had established outreach campaigns where they've worked with different community-based organizations, schools, senior, centers, NYCHA faziz, anything community-based, ultimately, to provide fire and life safety instruction. Since right now, Cogan has basic put all like outreach at all. Well, we basically now transition everything digitally and we are uploading new content weekly. At this point. Right now we have developed videos that are used, focus PSAs that highlight all aspects of general residential fire safety. We released an eight-minute lesson that takes into account what a typical lesson would be within a school based setting, which again was a mission. Earlier we did share with this air city do-e, the archdiocese and the charter school systems we shared with all external partners, including all community boards. The pass along one thing to note in the blocks were hopeful, making a connection right now or cutting a deal with Bronx men, because apparently, with certain do-e sites or students, they don't have the tech as of yet, and some of the curriculum has been being aired in community television, they're, going to start airing the FDNY in between curriculum and in between and they're, going to start entering the FDNY lesson to all bronc through the Bronx Network we have a 45-minute adult presentation which provides general residential fire safety, which is on the current website. We are going to be breaking up that general read for fire safety presentation into four segments to make it more digestible for a more older population as well. For those that don't have it. The website again is wwf/e. Nym are all one word, FDNY, smart or since you mention it, they knows about the fire. We had a fight on Kruger I forget the exact address, basically right at the start of the of the this crisis. Here where families were displaced, it was a big fire. One of my board members reached out to me about it. I will share it information with the board, since I forgot to do that up until this point I don't know if you recall that fire by chance, whatever you can give us whatever you can give us as appreciated if I can get that real, quick yeah fire was that 25 28 Kruger Avenue there's a three alarm fire and the Red Cross provided assistance. You know there are 20 registered families, including 64 people, 43 adults, 21, children, Jeremy, you mentioned it was a three alarm fire that occurred at two parts. The Kruger Avenue for FDNY fire marshals cause was accidental electrical cooking, toaster, oven smoke alarm was president operational. Total patient count from our end was for one patient transported in critical condition and three patients with non-life-threatening injuries. That's much the report that we had again a cause was accidental electrical. It looks like due to a cooking toaster up done if they have any questions on that or anything now so far, let's hold on well from the committee Public Safety Committee members. Do you have any questions so far because I think you're you can you yourself were waiting for the public until the end, so we know he gave us good information. Thank you, okay, good! Thank you, yeah no question and then I did ask I did so. If mommy's there Joey chefs Joey chefs will join the meeting via phone, but not computer. You need to text me or email me so I know so. I can unmute your figure where you going on the meeting. If you need to question anything so then, with that being a set, that being said, I think we're done with the FDNY right. Yeah we're good. We can move on to the NYPD and if the FDNY can hold until the end of towards the end of the meet in just in case, anyone has any other questions. I, don't think this would be long anyway, I'm gonna new you for now Fabrizio and then and then I'll meet you after the FN NYPD. So Epson can you I knew yourself. You want me to do it. I'm, a new community fan guys chase started with James Graham hello. Everyone first I just want to I want to thank everyone, specifically, the community, the business owners and all of our politicians. There's been a lot of support by everyone for the four nine precinct and I just wanna. Let you know on behalf of the floor. I'm preaching I speak on everyone that we really do appreciate the support. One of things I just wanted to get into it's on the agenda is our staffing levels to give you a little bit of a baseline this one time precinct has approximately a hundred and fifty full duty officers, basically officers that are that can go out. Troll the streets usually dorm, normally during the course of the year losing about seven percent or maybe ten to fifteen officers, are out sick at any. Given time during the beginning of the corona virus outbreak. Talking probably last few weeks of March, we started to see a shocking three he's going out sick at one point, probably the earlier part of April we had approximately 40% about precent or about 60 police officers were out sick. So obviously, you know we kind of looked limited in our capacity, but a couple of the things that we were able to do is we cancelled and suspend the whole training, well unnecessary training for the offices. So what that does that puts more officers out on the street for us? Also, all four appearances were canceled and we were getting backfill from other units, so other units throughout the department like drug enforcement units ATF units things that nature they were being repurposed, come to 4/9 and different prisons in Bronx to backfill the offices. So, although we had a number of four nine offices that were out sick or minimum Manning and on patrol staffing would still virtually be the same. Currently as today as I speak, we have a total of 29 officers that are out sick about 19 percent of the command and during the I guess the last six week we've had a total of 29 police officers that tested positive for the Covid-19 19 every day. We're seeing more and more cops coming back to work as a Monday next week were projected to get eight more officers out sick and, of course, the rate at which we have officers going sick is dramatically decreased during the last six weeks. Regretfully, we did have a civilian member of our staff. Passed away is geo. Kameena brown bar. She was a civilian. He had 4/9 she's worked here a couple years. She did our roll call great lady, really nice I used to talk with her every day. She was an integral part of our staff and she's going to be greatly missed. Just a couple of things that we're doing here from the NYPD level regarding the corona outbreak will seeing a large amount large increase uptick in 311 and not on one calls as it regarding social distancing, and you know, people calling on different commercial businesses as far as people, not amazed executive orders, so we're being proactive. We do have particular offices on each tour that are dedicated specifically for those purposes generally we're seeing compliance with the Mays order. Not early on, we did have I won't get too much into detail machines, maybe -. We did have one business on Mars Park that failed to comply with a couple warnings and we had to write a couple summonses and as of right now, their liquor license has been suspended and they're, not in operation, but generally the 49 as a whole for what we've seen generally in compliance amazed, detector, boys. Another question is: what's the crime looking like for the last month or so I'll just give you a little synopsis, starting with the whole year before and I'm proof. We actually are up in crime, slightly 10% increase we're down in all categories, except for burglaries and grand larceny. So the auto that's going to continue over into our last month or less four weeks. Overall, though, we have a 19% reduction, we have major decreases in robberies, we're down 63 percent of robberies, 48 percent and all felony assaults, almost 50 percent, and on grand losses. The only two areas that we're seeing increases are basically property crimes. Those gonna be burglaries and on grand larceny is in the auto and up the last four weeks we've had 13, burglaries, verse, 5, that's an increase of 8 or 160 percent. What we're starting to see is commercial businesses. Commercial businesses are starting to get hit. You know they're, some of them are closing down for an extended period of time. They don't have alarms and when they come back to check it on their shop they're, realizing that their location has been burglarized. One of the things that we've done. We requested additional resources from patrol Barra Bronx. They granted us a your extra sergeant and eight police officers that we're deploying on the first Platoon. That's on Midnight's, that's from 11 o'clock at night little 8 o'clock in the morning and basically their sole function. They're going on they're going to the business districts. You know Mars park over on Allen sand, Avenue, Boston, Road, White, Plains, Road lighting and they're going and checking the different commercial locations. They checking the padlocks to make sure everything is locked up and if they see anything suspicious, you know there are questions on these individuals who are out there at this point. The other area that we're seeing a increase we've been fighting this all year. Long, it's all brand washing autos, the hot cars are basically any newer model, hotness any model Accords to your B's pilots and Acuras and Honda's all the same company. Basically, what we're seeing is there's a organized Steff ring operating in the Bronx. I was right now, primarily the operating in the four nine and four. What I understand there is a. There is a case into these individuals, so we anticipate, probably in the next month to show this case is gonna be taken down, and hopefully we see a sharp decline in all Geo lace. Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a little bit of time in order to build a solid case against individuals like this. What else can I say so I think as far as crime generally the city and the Bronx has seen a decrease in crime, except for property crimes like I said geo laser up, not just in the 49 but in the Bronx as well as burglaries and it's a citywide does anyone have any questions is about the crime or anything else going on going on, so anyone saw the Public Safety Committee didn't we have shooting at Kruger recently yeah a few on Kruger? Yes, so this past Sunday at about about 5:30 at night, it was a dispute between two individuals, one of the individuals, an older gentleman. He pulled out a firearm. He struck his adversary, one time in a leg. He ends up leaving the scene. The four nine squad is a great job. Your elbow identify the perpetrator, the TV's removed use of clothing hospital he's not likely died. He was in stable condition about two hours later officers from the floor. Nine recent observed the male perpetrator, walking down quite plants, road, be able to grab him and they were able to grab the gun. This individual has an extensive history. 58 years old- and he probably will spend the rest of his days in jail. Thank you happen and captain. Thank you for that. I just want to confirm something. If you can confirm the crime overall, whether it was an increase or a decrease year-to-date and just the past month, can you go over that just the overall increased or decreased between the two yes increase? There is an overall increase of 10% so now think that it's driving the increases year to date and on grand loss, news from the auto and for the 28th day we're actually down in crime, approximately 19%, with Dan and all major decreases in all crime categories again, except for burglaries and our grand law cities of the autumn, and let's have something I think: that's it for the veritas mean I. Think that's it's for the committee. Unless again they owe us I have the other two community members in and I, don't know about it. Any other committee members have any questions for the captain. I think we're good there Jeremy do you want to just go over some quick stats for, since the hospitals we invited the hospitals to join, but they could enjoin so Jeremy if you want to give us just a quick briefing, yeah, obviously I'm, not sessional, but let me share my screen real quick. You know some of this stuff. A lot of board members have received stuff already so three activity permits, which the precinct reviews they've been cancelled, based reactivity, permanent festival parade, has been cancelled, all the way to the end of June currently, and some be aware of the some other things I've shared fatalities from New, York, State, como comorbidity, or have you wanna call? It is very important to you see here at the bottom of my screen. Those are using computers if he primary as a death underlying cause of death. Aside from Covid-19, nineteen is people with hypertension, followed by diabetes that Veck statistic that diabetes that was happening in china. I forget exactly what the first cardiovascular disease, which can include hypertension, I think, was the number one contributor, death or china very there's I, don't want bore people with stats. You know I would publish stats almost on a daily basis in terms of what our zip codes we're doing. Lately I haven't checked for maybe two days now it's been dropping verses like a 7% increase. Every day it's been dropping down to like two percent increase in terms of the those infected and you can get this I can get all this information is public if you know where to find me for stats by community board, I hope to get that I would not move your breath, but with the city one other thing: I, don't know with the city. Their rates by age rates by sex still in New, York City more men are contracting over nineteen, more men are being hospitalized almost twice as many men are dying from codes in nineteen right here. Download data is we can get the exact, zip code information, it's gonna, take you to a different site because the testing is done by at month, Montesano I. Believe- and you can find this exact information up-to-date with four to two data. That's today, number of people, testing positive of total, a majority of those being tested in the Bronx are testing positive, but more than half of those being tested are testing positive, obviously, not good pain. You can see 104 6 zero, the current positive stats 1900. So that's more than half right. All this information is public. You want to know where to find it. I want you to talk to me outside of the meeting. I. Think that's I! Think that's good enough. For now we did invite Jacobi and monster of Medical. Center and Jacobi could not come monster. I, don't think we ever heard back from so I unless there's anything else, any other committee member Jeremy, thank you that was good. Okay, that was good. Any committee members have any questions for Jamie. Has anyone been in touch with Barbara about? What's going on over there, yeah I saw yes, I've been in touch with them. I did so I'd reset them over the weekend didn't hear anything Assemblymember Fernandez, you might saw my email forwarded me a press statement. They put out on Friday, let me III could find an email, just read it to you. Basically, you know that their argument has got to put everything in context. They have 720 beds or something like that, so naturally, they're thrown for their tend to get they're likely to get higher positive results. I know that last time, I checked I think when we had this phone call on Monday they were, they were being you know, other boroughs Queens and they were they were catching up, and the other thing to keep in mind is that at least according to what I've read and seen is. This is not reported data Crowley I, don't know how self-report it is. If you have you know, that's per ticket you're involving the coroner or the medical officer, but that's what I've read and not every place is a not every place was listed in that sheet because they didn't have more than five deaths. There's probably something else I could add to it. If there's something specific, you are know from King's Harbor, just let me know, ask me: yes, I'll try to get it. I'll try I'll reach out to them, but I have, after once, I got the press once I got the statement from them, I emailed the contact, and he was very good about responding to me right away and they said they're going on P currently I keep hearing too much feedback, so they were gonna PPE, currently they're stocked enough. So I really don't any other questions, some specific variety yeah. Do they? How many cases do they have now do we know and what? How are they treating the patients? What are they doing with them once they are as positive? Okay, I, don't know. If that's public, that's something I have to ask. How make you I know how many total I gotta keep everybody want to know currently how many, how many patients are positive, not just fatalities right, because the list that came out by the state was technologies. Ya know just a total number of cases that they may have or have had so far. Okay, I can ask for that. Yeah and just are they quarantine, II the patient separately from the patient, having tested positive if the information on how they're actually treating the patients? Basically when they test positive, no I, don't know if you saw in my email that the somebody was making an argument from the from the nursing home trade association or something like that they were criticizing the state for their policy of taking having nursing homes taking in hospital patients, I think and then I think the governor was kind of caught off guard by a question related to that. That's just something else to be aware of: I'll follow up Veronica with your questions, all right: Thank, You, Jeremy, I appreciate it: okay, the other committee member I, muted, every toss names on the phone I, just I'm you there any Molony any other I know you just joined us late, but we have the FDNY. We had NYPD well I think we should open up to a public yeah, hey yeah I agree and we can go in order if anyone has any one full anything for the FDNY. If not, then they can drop off and then we'll go through the preset. If no one has anything for the precinct, then they can maybe drop off. These are optional. If they'd like to drop off or not we'll continue normal business, we don't want to take any more of their time and before I everybody to for those who are using computer. You know there's this chat function. If you're not familiar with how to use this program, you can always text message me that's what happened during leadership ID. Ideally, if somebody else is talking, you have a question, you know, do, send a chat. Send me a text message something so at least we can kind of have some type of work. Nurses. Are we trying to talk at once, I'm going to mute, everybody plus there's anybody, it's able to unmute themselves and has a question there's a question in the chat Jeremy if you want to read it. So what is the availability of testing for everyone? I mean I, know, I, know, I, know NYPD. You guys can kind of front-load people FDNY should be able to front-load people for testing. I. Think that's what happened in the case with the civilian employees. She you got attested right away. Unfortunately, you know that doesn't help anyone else. I don't have an answer to that. I know. I know when I was sick, it was you had to basically be dying to UM get tested and when I have a conference call if the VP's office, maybe two weeks ago, they basically said that's the same policy. I know I had a friend he got tested. Cuz got hauled away in an ambulance, so I, don't I, don't have an easy answer that question world. So somebody else had a question for the four nine Bernadette yeah hi. This is unrelated to Colvin. It has to do with the situation that happened on Fillmore Street about a girl that was missing. I was just wondering if anybody had any update on that. It was on just looking over here. Fillmore Street was on so hard about that I moved. It was on April 14th. It was a missing 14 year old, Hispanic, girl and I didn't see any Amber, Alert or anything. But I was just wondering if there was any follow up. I'll burn that I'll have to get back to your net back. You look line if you like, but, for example, alert, is very specific criteria when it comes to an Amber Alert. You may not believe this, but you know on a given day in the four nine we may have anywhere from zero to ten fifteen missings a day. It's basically where they get classified, as in this particular case when I underst, then it was kind of more of a runaway okay and not and not a missing okay. What happened with Amber Alerts? We try not to use the Amber Alerts unless specifically fits the criteria, because, like the old adage, if everything is important, then nothing is important. So if an Amber Alerts going off, you know on your phone, every 15 minutes you're going to stop looking at it, so it's only reserved for the really extra special ones. Okay, I do have a I do have another own old business and it was an answer to a question that Tony had asked in a leadership with regards to the emergency rooms. I did get occult is that? Okay, if I just respond to that now, yeah I won't know any question: is that something related to the FDNY, because I do I want to try to get them out of here? First, okay, no, it's not I could wait. I have a question Jeremy for the FDNY. Yes, okay, I'm gonna yeah go ahead. You ask your question, then I'll unmute the FDNY go ahead. Okay, I was just curious where the fire on Kruger Avenue was so I. Don't have it in for me so ratio. Do you have that in front of you? It was two five to eight Kruger Avenue one I'll pay you the cross to hold on. So that's north of the Parkland. Okay. Thank you so yeah, that's between between Allerton and mace. Thank you and the ratio. We had a question about a fund. Is there some type of fund for families? I know the F the Red Cross gets involved. You can you elaborate on the extent that they get involved, if possible, I can't really speak on the fun for the family. So that's more of a read. Clauses are direct question, I mean the FDNY. It doesn't really get involved in terms of the funds for impacted families or anything I could connect you for apps. This caller offline with the public outreach your community and tears from red cloth. Yeah. Thank you. I think. You've done that already would have the better input. I wouldn't have the internet on any on any funds for a full dollar for those displaced. Are any of the families impacted? Okay, so I'll follow up on that Diane any other. Okay, any other FDNY questions. So no it's not that I'm gonna say goodbye. Freeze you for breezy! Oh thank you everybody and thank you all right and then so Bridal do you want to do you want to follow up with that I? Don't there's! Somebody else have a question: yeah I can make it quick. I got a call back from the chief of staff from Assemblymember Karina Reyes, Glen, Delos and I had asked two questions. I had asked about getting masks for something commuted. You know for the community because some people do not have access to mass they're going to look into that. Of course, I do know that a candidate that is running or the new york 14 district Michele Caruso Cabrera, was actually able to get mass sent to the senior Mycenae fiorentino this morning, which were very grateful for I, don't know the amount but that she did get them to them to the seniors, so that I wasn't expecting that. But the one thing I did ask because I know that Karina says she's in the she's in the trenches right now and she's keeping herself distanced from everybody, because she doesn't want to infect anybody. But in answer to Tony's question in other words, which er would be, would you go to if she would have some information and she said they're all overwhelmed, but it would depend on the symptoms of the person if somebody is in critical distress go to the closest one and it's amount of wait time. But if somebody is not in critical, going to lower Westchester like to say Lawrence or even going to Barnabas, st. Barnabas is a possibility and I was I did not know this, and maybe everybody else does, but bar st. Barnabus does have a special specialty. I guess they're like Jacobi is trauma they do have with asthma. They do which deals with respiratory so that I was not aware of. But if there's an issue with respiratory st. Barnabas does they're overwhelmed, but that would be the place to go. I don't know the amount of ventilators they have etcetera, but I just got about an hour ago. Okay, so for the Thor nine, because I, don't I forget about them and I want to cut them off or cut them out when they cuz they probably go. I know we got a question about homelessness. There's been an increase, maybe or concerned that there's more panhandling that that's genes, question gene Baraka, it's somebody else, maybe had a question about that. You want to elaborate on that sure. So on Allerton we've been hit since the businesses have been shut down and most of the families are staying indoors. The streets have been overtaken by the panhandlers and the homeless population since there's a stay at home order. What's the what's the city or state doing to ensure their shelter for these individuals? Well, jira goes to the homeless population. You know we do continue to do outreach, but as far as us being able to physically remove them, mother, Mays, executive order and Bernanke shelter. We have not yet not an informed way to do that. There's no standing water as it right now where he can. We can remove them to a shelter like with a cold weather emergency. We have not been instructed by the department. Do you have Thank You captain? So my question is Jeremy: why haven't they made that order because they mandated that the officers you know make enemy with the people here, because they're, finding people I don't know if I'd haven't had reported cases here in the 49? Actually, I've heard the opposite that the officers are being very cordial but in other parts of the city, residents are being arrested, detained because of escalation of the stay at home, orders and social distancing, but there's no order or executive mandating to take care of the homeless population. So we're largely concerned so captain I don't know if you must speak a little bit further on this I would assume just simply it's. Why are you gonna get in I mean? Would it would it? Would it be very difficult for you guys to force everybody into a homeless, shelter would I mean yeah group of individuals hanging out and 15 people hanging out yeah. We will break them up, we will disperse them. You know, like you said we are issuing warnings. If they refuse, then we will take enforcement action as necessary, but you know again, three or four homeless individuals on a corner. We don't we cannot. We do not take them and remove them. If they volunteer, we will be more than happy to help them replace him in a shelter, but most times they refuse to go and we're not able to force them to go. At this point, there's no there's no standing mandate or directive. Okay yourself. If you're not mute yourself, hey questions before 9:00 I'm, gonna, I'm, gonna, I'm, gonna, mute everybody except me: that's using computer. Has the question mute everybody, because it's just too much feedback right now. I just want to follow up with one thing: I, don't know if it's necessarily the 4:9, but what's the standing procedure. If a man is sleeping outside on the streets- and we don't know, if he's a ill or just intoxicated, it's there a process in order. But if that comes over as a 9-1-1 call, it's likely a police officer will respond and police officer will assess the situation, determine if the individuals, intox sleeping or no unfortunately do a. If the person is in talks, then likely we will call a an ambulance and have removed to get a medical treatment. If he's just sleeping, he or she sleeping will usually wake them up and had the moves, and so let me mean I mute everybody, sort of people who called in and didn't use a computer, it's ready for nine precinct and they go. Please join lemme. Let me meet everybody and then I'll unmute you hi Joanne, okay, I had heard a couple of weeks ago. The mayor had said that he was looking to put homeless into hotel rooms. Is that anything? Does that anything? That's real, realistic or is that had been abandoned, okay, ice directors for nine again? This is something that may spoke about, but nothing has been pushed down to the low levels at NYPD. Where, again we can you know you think about it. We would have to take an individual who doesn't want to go force them into a back of the police car and then take them to a hotel and force them in there again. We are not at that point. We are allowed to do that, nor have we given any directive or basically any supporting law. That would support us in doing something like that. Okay. Well, thank you. You're welcome, okay I'm gonna unmute everybody hold on just infer the people, I called in any questions for the for final call, me Tony Ching, your hourly rate with monthly CA. One more time did you mention only that the mayor is, can still operate awesome a so only I knew you so well. You know all activities are canceled up until June until the end of June is that okay or the captain am I correct on that. Do you know this? You correct up to the end of June right. That's! Currently, it could be longer that we don't know yeah I, know. Okay, thank you. I! Don't want to keep asking. Thank you very much. Okay, I'm gonna, I'm, gonna, unmute, councilmember Joanne eyes office. You wanna I, know she texted me over the weekend mark Monday that the council members spoke to Kings Harbor that they said they had over 700 beds. The deaths are overinflated, they gonna covet $0.19 cases sent to that from mathy fewer as well, which accounts for most of the numbers. So let me find Farah and I knew her as C. She has to add to that, if I can find, if she's still in the meeting, yes yeah be mute, everybody cuz, there's feedback all right. Sorry, you're, unmuted! Okay! Thank you. Yes, thank you for mentioning that the councilman has been speaking to them. He has been reaching out to a lot of nursing homes because we are offering kovat cleaning and some of the common areas. If it's needed, like Providence, rest nursing home, we just did a cleaning he's I, also just wanna. Let you guys know not that we have them, but we have been able to organize getting much-needed PPE to some of the nursing homes if needed. So like Providence arrests, we got them. 400 math we're working with some of the Knights of facilities to get the seniors some math. So if you know of like a facility like that or they're asking about it, you can also reach out to us to try and facilitate that as well. You know we also had a request from and seeing jugen nursing home. They desperately need sanitizers, so we're working closely with the governor's office to get some much-needed supplies in the district. I just want to make sure you knew that yeah. Thank you all right, so I'm yeah, hey the committee I just had muted everybody should meet you all unless I'm, probably participation, I'm gonna we're going to turn our back over the committee for old business new business. Any anybody else, public comment, ID in a minute made mute everybody I hate, you want yeah, hey and the committee. Do you I, don't have anything we can move on to? Does anyone in the committee have anything before I move on to old business, so we can wrap it up. Hopefully, within an hour no I don't know Ellie. Do you have anything just mean or not all these I'm gonna call now -. Unless there's an all right, I think we're good. We can move on to old business. Does anyone have anything for old business? I, don't hear anything, I, don't see anyone speaking so we'll move on to a new business. Okay, all right looks like I'm, not on mute, because it's too quiet all right again. Thank you all for dialing in I know. This is a tough time and I thought. If any committee would hold a meeting this month, it would be Public Safety for sure and very good questions, very good engagement by everybody, including the committee. Thank you very much for your attendance we'd like to adjourn at this time and I. Don't think we need to vote on a German or a second or anything like that four committees I believe, but no one else has anything else. We'd like to adjourn at 6:56. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody.
