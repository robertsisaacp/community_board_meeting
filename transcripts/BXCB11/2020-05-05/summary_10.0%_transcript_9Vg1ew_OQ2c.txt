This is the community board 11 Public Safety Committee, meeting of April 22nd Dialing in this is local information.
I know we hear the governor speak the president, the governor, the mayor, but this is a really local, and this is this: opens it up for our community to listen in to what's going on locally, so I just want to start off by thanking the essential employees, the FDNY and the NYPD.
Radio, we're saying I have general talking point of exactly just providing an overview currently of where we're at as the department in terms of overall call volume response times and medical leave.
For children, education, I Every day, we've been sharing, with de we've, been sharing with not-for-profit organizations with all the community boards for those that know firing life, safety, education, right, now, physically, as at a hall where, traditionally, our firefighters had established outreach campaigns where they've worked with different community-based organizations, schools, senior, centers, NYCHA faziz, anything community-based, ultimately, to provide fire and life safety instruction.
One thing to note in the blocks were hopeful, making a connection right now or cutting a deal with Bronx men, because apparently, with certain do-e sites or students, they don't have the tech as of yet, and some of the curriculum has been being aired in community television, they're, going to start airing the FDNY in between curriculum and in between And they're, going to start entering the FDNY lesson to all bronc through the Bronx Network We have a 45-minute adult presentation which provides general residential fire safety, which is on the current website.
If they have any questions on that or anything now so far, let's hold on well from the committee Public Safety Committee, members.
You know we kind of looked limited in our capacity, but a couple of the things that we were able to do is we cancelled and suspend the whole training, What that does that puts more officers out on the street for us?
Also, all four appearances were canceled and we were getting backfill from other units, so other units throughout the department like drug enforcement units ATF units things that nature they were being repurposed, come to 4/9 and different prisons in Bronx to backfill the offices.
A couple of things that we're doing here from the NYPD level regarding the corona outbreak will seeing a large amount large increase uptick in 311 and not on one calls as it regarding social distancing, and you know, people calling on different commercial businesses as far as people, not amazed executive, orders, so we're being proactive.
We did have one business on Mars Park that failed to comply with a couple warnings and we had to write a couple summonses and as of right, now, their liquor license has been suspended, Another question is:: what's the crime looking like for the last month, We actually are up in crime, We have major decreases in robberies, we're down: 63 percent of robberies, 48 percent and all felony assaults, almost 50 percent, and on grand losses.
I think as far as crime generally the city and the Bronx has seen a decrease in crime, except for property crimes like I said geo laser up, not just in the 49 but in the Bronx, as well as Anyone have any questions is about the crime or anything else going on going on.
If you know where to find me for stats by community board Their rates by age rates by sex still in New, York City more men are contracting over nineteen, more men are being hospitalized almost twice as many men are dying from codes in nineteen right, here.
Basically when they test positive, no I, don't know if you saw in my email that the somebody was making an argument from the from the nursing home trade association or something like that they were criticizing the state for their policy of taking having nursing homes taking in hospital patients.
You know for the community, because some people do not have access to mass they're going to look into that.
You guys know not that we have them, but we have been able to organize getting much-needed PPE to some of the nursing homes.
