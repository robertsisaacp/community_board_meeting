This is the community board 11 Public Safety Committee, meeting of April 22nd Dialing in this is local information.
I know we hear the governor speak the President, the governor, the mayor, but this is a really local, and this is this: opens it up for our community to listen in to what's going on locally, so I just want to start off by thanking the essential employees, the FDNY and the NYPD.
We're saying I have general talking point of exactly just providing an overview currently of where we're at as the department in terms of overall call volume response times and medical leave.
Have the option to department provided hotel rooms if they wish to quarantine away from their family this week and spreading We began testing symptomatic members for wish to be tested and we're close to complete the all those members who wanted to be tested which we were working: with, various health care providers and 54 locations, and next week we will now start testing those members that did not show any sense of whoever wants to get tested.
We can forward that to the rest of the members, Theresa you're, good, more local statistics, if elected, and they did get your email about it for children, education, I know there was that major alarm fire a couple weeks back on Kruger, which we provided and started providing the information.
Every day we've been sharing with de we've, been sharing with not- for- profit organizations with all the community boards for those that know firing life, safety, Education, right, now, physically, as at a hall where, traditionally, our firefighters had established outreach campaigns where they've worked with different community- based organizations, schools, senior, centers, NYCHA, faziz, anything community- Based, ultimately, to provide fire and life safety instruction.
If I can get that real, quick yeah fire Was that 25:28 Kruger Avenue there's a three alarm fire And You know there are 20 registered families, including 64 people, 43 adults, 21, children, Jeremy , you mentioned it was a three alarm fire that occurred at two parts: The Kruger Avenue for FDNY fire marshals cause was accidental.
If they have any questions on that or anything now so far, let's hold on well from the committee Public Safety Committee, members.
You yourself were waiting for the public until the end We can move on to the NYPD and if the FDNY can hold until the end of towards the end of the meet in just in case, anyone has any other questions.
Talking, probably last few weeks of March, we started to see a shocking three He's going out sick at one point, probably the earlier part of April We had approximately 40% about precent or about 60 police officers were out sick.
You know we kind of looked limited in our capacity, but a couple of the things that we were able to do is we cancelled and suspend the whole training, Well unnecessary training for the offices.
Also, all four appearances were canceled and we were getting backfill from other units, so other units throughout the department like drug enforcement, units, ATF units things that nature they were being repurposed, come to 4/9 and different prisons in Bronx to backfill the offices.
As today as I speak, we have a total of 29 officers that are out sick about 19 percent of the command and during the I guess the last six week we've had a total of 29 police officers that tested positive for the Covid-19 every day.
She did our roll call great lady, really nice Just a couple of things that we're doing here from the NYPD level regarding the Corona outbreak will seeing a large amount large increase uptick in 311 and not on one calls as it regarding social distancing, and you know, people calling on different commercial businesses as far as people, not amazed, executive, orders, so we're being proactive.
If you have you, know You're involving the coroner or the medical officer, but that's what I've read and I emailed the contact, and he was very good about responding to me right away.
You know for the community, because some people do not have access to mass they're going to look into that.
You know we do continue to do outreach, but as far as us being able to physically remove them, mother, Mays, executive order and Bernanke shelter.
So we're working closely with the governor's office to get some much- needed supplies in the district The committee I just had muted everybody should meet you all unless I'm, probably participation I'm going to we're going to turn our back over the committee for old business, new business, any anybody, else, public, comment, ID in a minute made mute, everybody, I, Hate, Hey and the committee.
