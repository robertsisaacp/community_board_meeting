The reason why many of us believed very strongly that we needed to do, but we needed to do bail, reform and I still believe that it is an important thing that we did was because for many generations the criminal justice system, unfortunately criminalized poverty He spent 20 minutes in front of a judge and because he was a millionaire, he got to go home and chill until the court date that just happened a few weeks ago, as opposed to that somebody who was a constituent of mine, kalief, Browder a 16 year old boy who was arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack spent three years in Rikers Island, two of them in solitary confinement until the charges were dropped committed suicide later on from the PTSD that he got from being in Rikers Island from being accused of a crime that he did not commit and a crime that he didn't want to plead to.
We had the district attorney here a couple of months ago and last month, Maybe we can have the community board, send her a letter and tell her to get in touch with your office, and you know, and I will tell you that our that just the district attorney has been sitting down with one of the main sponsors of the bill, senator Jamal Bailey, and they have been having conversations about by the way there has been some In. That conversation, that is literally a lie and I know it for a fact, because I was in Albany when my colleagues, particularly Jamal Bailey, who again a Bronx senator, and he was one of the people that was main one of the main people behind this, as well as Senator Sepulveda Who, was the chair of a crime, victims, crimes and corrections.
Appointments, It doesn't matter if there isn't enough evidence in the case against you, because that single decision that got made for you to be held in on bail is the thing that will ultimately unravel the fabric of your life, and so I saw countless times Other thing I want to stand up here and tell you is that, even though it has only been a really short period of time, bail reform is actually working and I hear the concern So, in our discovery law there is already a provision that allows judges to issue protective orders anytime Actually.
We have a real opportunity as a community to say, maybe there's another way We can do something better, because actually studies show that incarcerated people who are struggling exacerbates all of those underlying issues and really does make it more likely that we're going to see them back in the criminal legal system you just put, sir, is that on just somebody to click it, please don't touch the buttons unless it's red, just let me know so What about the people that are not innocent Let them out two days later, they're committing a crime that puts all of us into danger, Is it based on an article in the New York Post, or at some point do we have to actually let our criminal legal system work.
Information might be put out into the universe in an article and one of the things that's important to note when it comes to judicial discretion is somebody who is out on Let's, say you know a felony case and gets read in another So the question is: If somebody comes through one time on a first offense, let's say right We are essentially dismantling our entire legal system, which I think most of us feel enormous pride in That 's, a poor excuse for this law If I may I'm, not sure there was a question in there That person had a long history of being in and out of the criminal legal system and under the old standards that we had the ability to hold that person in jail.
I, don't think We couldn't hold an official meeting because it wasn't enough people, the education community You can go to our website - and our contact informations there I recommend emailing everybody on that contact, so the whole staff and the chairman of the board.
In reference to his statement, senator Gustavo and Natalia Fernandez, or taking a position that they not going to amend justice reform or bill reform Now, we have the governor It's, not a Republican thing , it's a democratic membership of the assembly and the state Senate that are talking about amending justice reform So. If we understand here and praised this, you know I when I've rather praised some of the people and some of the kids that go and get five A's, not five jail or five summonses or criminal things.
The people are suffering out there in the streets, That's right, Efrain, gonzales, homeless, shelter, hello, everyone actually live in community board.
I was really shocked that anyone would want to put a homeless shelter, certainly on a in an area where it's industrial , it doesn't say too much about what they think about homeless, but Don't believe that in that we should have it near a Lehmann, high school or a daycare center, and that's what we're Having and I want people in Community Board 11 to understand that both of these community boards really are cohesive in a lot of ways.
A lot of homeowners in community for 10 more in community board 11, but we do share the same councilmember most of the time, and so I am against that I'm against people coming out of Riker's to go to a homeless shelter when there was no screening process about what you're gonna see this doctor you're gonna do this there they're talking about substance, abuse clinic in the homeless, shelter What I want people to understand is, even though you don't see it in the in the in the blotter.
No violence, we're gonna, talk against bail reform , We can't accept anybody going in there and attacking the people that change things in our community.
Shelters I support the community board also to go against this homeless shelter being put there Second one is that in your community, when they speak about putting people out on bail, I'll give you a live story.
Now, okay, I, ask that of Mayor DeBlasio on February 4th two weeks before that homeless, shelter, meeting okay , mayor de Blasio said basically that we have an influx of adult single men, All of a sudden, because the no cash bail law went into effect and any person in jail how to be let out if they were on bail You have these people now out on the streets, the homeless and they have to be found home and I will say that if you let this homeless shelter be built for 200 adult men, you will have level 1 and level 2 sex offenders in there.
The mayor said that community board 11 homeless people have been placed elsewhere, He tried to say, they've been placed in Queens in Manhattan, in Brooklyn and he said he's going to replace them with people from the Bronx now the homeless provider, who, by the way, has a corrective action plan because they can't account for their time.
Okay has said that they will take him from the community board, the Bronx and the city, all right.
That are not true and I need to have the opportunity to be given due process and have a QA, because you're affecting my business and I could have gone anywhere and I didn't go to Brooklyn Scarsdale, where my mother lives, I came to the Bronx and I'm, not getting the support that I should get as a minority and I think that you should look at the people that have been open.
One second, can people in the back please step out into the hallway or if you're, going to talk So as I mentioned, the borough president is hosting an LGBTQ career, fair on March 20th at Hostos, Community College from 1:00 to 4:00 pm Next, two announcements I have are for the board members I know, Community, Board 11 has done a pretty good job at submitting their reappointment applications, but if there are board members that have not sent that into our office, yet please do so the deadline for that was February 7th We are well past that so please forward that over to our office as soon as possible.
I think the best part of the whole thing is anybody 11 or all that can vote So. You can get kids involved voting, especially if they're doing something for their own school and if you need any more information on that, please call the office seven one Thank you, council member Kings office, robber, press parking calendars, bike, smart official guide to cycling in New, York, City, pamphlets and on March 12th, councilman King will be holding his state of the district state of the district me It will be at PS 41 33:52, Olin, Villa, Avenue doors will open at 6 pm.
