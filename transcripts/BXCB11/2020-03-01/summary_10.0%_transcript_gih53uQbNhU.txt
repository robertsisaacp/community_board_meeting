If you are, if you're eligible, you can save money for applying for property tax exemptions, and you can come directly to this event in my office to speak to the Department of Finance representatives.
I know that obviously, this Community Board is one of the ones that has the most homeowners in it in the Bronx.
Related matters develop a response from our conference, and then we have a process in a couple of weeks called the one House budget, which is when the Senate will present its version of the budget as we as we go towards passing a budget on time on April 1st We can have a conversation as long about this as you as you would like.
He spent 20 minutes in front of a judge and because he was a millionaire, he got to go home and chill until the court date that just happened a few weeks ago, as opposed to that somebody who was a constituent of mine, kalief, Browder, a 16 year old boy who was arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack spent three years in Rikers Island, two of them in solitary confinement until the charges were dropped committed suicide later on from the PTSD that he got from being in Rikers Island from being accused of a crime that he did not commit.
That needs to be tweaked really good, because if you have somebody, like you, said the gentleman you were talking about no prior convictions, you know clean as a whistle If they are arrested of a new crime, they're considered innocent until proven guilty.
That is a legitimate concern and we need to actually what we're having the conversation right now during the budget about how we give them the resources necessary, so that they can put the staff on in hand so that they can provide for the law to be observed.
Thousands of people who have been able to go back home at the end of the day and not have to stay overnight or for a month or for a year or for two years, have been able to keep their jobs, have been able to keep access to their children, have been able to go back to the shelter that they live.
We had the district attorney here a couple of months ago, and last month, Maybe we can have the community board, send her a letter and tell her to get in touch with your office, and you know, and I will tell you that our that just the district attorney has been sitting down with one of the main sponsors of the bill, senator Jamal Bailey, and they have been having conversations about by the way there has been some.
If there is something that is put in front of me as I, try to do with every piece of legislation, I will take it into consideration and I will look at what is there, but much like the speaker of the of the assembly, who has taken the position that he needs more information to see how this is working.
In the South Bronx and we represent tens of thousands of people every year and what I can tell you from my 20 years as a public defender is just how incredibly necessary this bail.
Other thing I want to stand up here and tell you is that, even though it has only been a really short period of time, bail reform is actually working and I hear the concern So in our discovery law there is already a provision that allows judges to issue protective orders.
Actually, there should be a protective order and that information should not be turned over and when it comes to bail, judges have so many tools at their discretion, so they can put money on electronic monitoring.
They can send them to supervised release, they can issue an order of protection and if a witness is intimidated or threatened in any way, the judge actually has the ability to put that person in jail.
We can do something better, because actually studies show that incarcerated people who are struggling exacerbates all of those underlying issues and really does make it more likely that we're going to see them back in the criminal legal system you just put, sir, is that on just somebody to click it, please don't touch the buttons unless it's red, just let me know So What about the people that are not innocent Let them out two days: later, they're committing a crime that puts all of us into danger.
We're gonna be really focusing on census, so census work for the Allyson library Our focus is census, so I'll be a lot about that, but we are going to be doing a census kind of 101 to inform people what the census is.
There's questions we'll move on to our next guest speaker gallery sessions figure it's Vinnie, Marie Lyon regarding the PS 108 annex I did speak at last month's community board meeting regarding this issue.
We really need the community's support to carry us to 8th grade, Like I said, there's no quality middle school for our students, currently in the neighborhood And I'm just here to get advice, feedback, support, suggestions and how to make this happen.
If we understand here and praised this, you know I when I've rather praised some of the people and some of the kids that go and get five A's, not five jail or five summonses or criminal things.
Efrain, gonzales, homeless, shelter, hello, everyone Work at Einstein, monster, Fuhrer and I Actually live in community board, 10.
Having and I want people in Community Board 11 to understand that both of these community boards really are cohesive in a lot of ways.
A lot of homeowners in community for 10 more in community board 11, but we do share the same councilmember most of the time, and so I am against that I'm against people coming out of Riker's to go to a homeless shelter when there was no screening process about what you're gonna see this doctor you're gonna do this there They're talking about substance, abuse clinic in the homeless, shelter What I want people to understand?
I was made aware at that meeting from councilman Marc Jonah, and it offended me that there were people attacking members of community board.
It is unacceptable for anyone to attack any member of a community board because they have an issue the way we fight those issues is we come together.
We can't accept anybody going in there and attacking the people that change things in our community.
Shelters I support the community board also to go against this homeless, Second, one is that in your community, when they speak about putting people out on bail, I'll give you a live.
The mayor said that community board 11 homeless people have been placed elsewhere.
Okay, however, and he said he's going to replace them with people from the Bronx.
Okay has said that they will take him from the community board, the Bronx and the city, all right.
If you didn't know couple board members reach out to me last week or if not the week before about the renewal application, which I did not receive from the borough president's office until yesterday, so they have, they never received the initial reappointment.
You know for people with incomes, less limits of 66,000 come to the office.
Drumming master, Thank, You Jerry before I get into the report there was I was the chair of the Land Use Committee and many people are not on a community board when Blondell Commons was a Uhler that had nothing to do with anything.
Thank you: council, member Kings, office, robber, press parking, calendars, bike, smart official guide to cycling in New, York, City, pamphlets and on March 12th, councilman King will be holding his state of the district state of the district.
As, you all know, the a Clark has been making her rounds to Precinct Council meetings, as well as community boards to talk about three components of the criminal justice, reform, bill discovery and speedy trials.
There are two other types of shelters, other than homeless shelters, as eventually you'll get to Hazel motion to request stats from the city, because they're the city's great about publishing stats for each community board and how many are in the shelter system, whether they originate from waters, place or Jacobi, Medical Center, and not really $5.99, rhinelander Avenue or something is another story, but I am pushing and with the housing committee's, help we're pushing for stats on people outside of this city that come originate from outside to see that come into the shelter system, because I was told it could be up to a thousand people, which is a pretty big number, so be curious to see where those people come and what are the stats onto my domestic violence?
