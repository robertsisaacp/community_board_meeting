Is this: Is this memorial plaza This comes from a board member sylvia mazzella, and if you look at the details, they want a veterans memorial wall for all the Bronx who's falling missing in action personnel Next one is the reconstruct upgrade park or amenity to the pelham parkway park, Upon parking, mall.
If there's money available Does it matter to OMB Agencies, right that are dealing with these requests correct to OMB who how we rank these like.
We do the work here, or we at least do the brainstorming and if anybody wants to submit a make a suggestion any day of the year, like that, like the like As a former budget chair who sat at budget negotiations with jeremy, can I just explain a little bit of this?
That often, but I can close, I can reach out to parks department to confirm you know what I would say, get rid of it and use the money.
You know what, if there's money, to use it for the other playgrounds that we're okay, Or yeah, get rid of all the other ones and just keep each chest or garden since that's the one that needs it, the most that's another way.
If saying, are we saying in the parks right, like each agency, has a responsibility, so we're gonna pick one thing to focus on for each of the agencies that have requests and then, For this budget And we're only going to focus on east chester garden, because the parks department has agreed that is the most needed.
But in normal times, do we have like a targeted budget or amount that we're looking to ask for this We just know without govern , there's less money to right, but what I'm saying is like Is, the total amount of requests that we have on our list contingent upon a specific budget amount that we need to adhere to.
Okay, it's probably going to allow money, but not as much as east, chester, gardens right.
I would check, because ever since school started, going remotely all of a sudden, every school had some kind of they all got like ipads, one of those things called smart ports, not smart, boards.
Right, okay, number, two discuss this additional police, office- I think money can be better spent.
Okay, I think she wants to try jeremy, just because similar requests were in part of the capital.
Parks wanted the community board to pay the half of it since once a year, we generally had our carnival there and since they, Since they let us have the grounds and we get money.
It doesn't have to be a committee meeting because you don't One and one and two of the same Have a public hearing and the committee meeting right, but I'm saying: Should we do that before or after we vote on it as a board?
Okay, so statement of community district needs and community board budget requests fiscal year, 2021, there's a picture of the city with gaming.
11 has three NYCHA developments, but among the three right now our most pressing need is an east chester garden and it can be worded that way.
I mean that could help with our budget requests like we had that you know roadway general roadway request , I'm just saying like if there was a way to look at the three one data that complains that come in our district I, don't know street unauthorized street parties or something right, then that could inform one of our prior community one of our priorities, because this is a big complaint in our community or something like that.
And, it's that can probably be the case, but I, don't think it hurts to understand what people are complaining about is the little things like that are taken care of right.
And like little things that are getting fixed, piecemeal, could point to a larger problem that we might not see until you look without see if other people are having similar issues right again to deal with these issues, Like, for instance, like fixing street lights, you know we might fix one or two, because we know about them because they're brought to our committee, but you know what.
We be active about maybe reaching out to each of the committee chairs to see you know, sort of give them a call, send them an email, and maybe we can split We each take two people or something or one person, and then jeremy sent out emails to each committee to every board member asking them to if they had any prior budgets that anything they wanted to put in this?
Okay, I'm, not talking about the general board members I'm talking about because we were talking about that committee chairs are supposed to be like committees have certain things to them to follow, and so like, for instance, I, don't know.
We are sort of making decisions and assumptions without a discussion with a broader public right and If. These people have reached to more members of the community.
That's what I thought we were talking about, but what natalie I think is getting at is because we're going to try to base the statement off of the budget request that we want to make sure our budget requests are solid and we have maybe buy-in right.
You saw my email, I recommended that the committee chairs, maybe some others, and not one person- did that Fine, I just think whether we do it now or next year or whatever that the idea that we are being a little bit more inclusive and proactive in you know telling people like this is what is being done so that it's not just, but if they only, they don't want to bother, and they just want another community at the full board.
Have a committee meeting to recap: The next budget share: just did it and put numbers next to it, and I went into the community board office the day before to look at the budget priorities and they weren't ready.
Is, where we don't have a request for of an agency at all like HPD or DOB right, and these agents of germany should be attending the meetings before budget departments are done.
All, right upon me, community, board, chairs and district managers.
