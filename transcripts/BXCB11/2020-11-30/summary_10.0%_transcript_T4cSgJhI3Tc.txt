We do not need a second for this motion: community board members, not community members, oh yeah, community, Board, member, sorry, good Point, Community, board members and staff, so the FOIL guidelines will be distributed to community board members and staff, discussion, okay, anyone abstaining or anyone against all right, so I'm gonna say that passes.
Anyone, abstaining or anyone against Okay passes unanimously and the last one for tonight, motions regarding the complaint on alleged incidents that have been occurring, I guess since March 22nd of 2020, this year.
Do you mean by routinely for the calendar, since I'm, going to be the one doing this.
We as I've put out before just remember that we in reality at this point, We need a lot more than 72 hours, because you know the I'm relying on the city like I, said earlier.
There's a calendar that you is posted for each month and we everybody knows when the meetings are supposed to happen, like this meeting happens on the fourth Thursday of every month, well of most months, So in that calendar, and instead of waiting for the agenda to be posted, why don't we make sure that, in that calendar that monthly calendar, the links with the dialing numbers are posted and that's how you get around any issues with agendas being posted or when it's being posted, so that calendar is very limited in its ability, you're talking about calendar with the instructions or the agendas with the instructions, because they're, two different things, the calendar and the agendas.
