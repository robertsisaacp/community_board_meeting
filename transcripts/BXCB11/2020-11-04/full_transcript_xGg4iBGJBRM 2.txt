Recreation meeting- and it is seven o'clock 701 and we're going to start our meeting with who we have in attendance, which is myself brother, Dominic, Edith and Lisa. So I and our gracious harriet will be recording the minutes. Okay, so is there we want to start off with making sure that we are okay with the June meeting minutes. I do not have them in front of me, but if whatever we did in June, we just want to be able to vote on whether or not we agree to accept those minutes. I vote to accept. I second it. Okay, thank you so very much and that is eat it. Okay. So now we're going to move on to strategizing through Covid-19, which we really wanted to just get back to the business at hand that we would that we had started out doing. We wanted to go visit, other parks and try to just look at the conditions of everything. But since Covid-19, you know, you're told to stay in you're told to not go out and you still want to try to do things, and I see other people doing things, but I do not know how and what we're going to do if we want to start going back out and venturing out to different parks to check and see the conditions. If anybody has a problem with that, pat, can you hear me yeah? Yes, I can babe. The big problem is the person that I'm under the impression that we were going to get the money from the city Council is having a great deal of problems on his own. So excuse me, yeah, in other words b you're putting the caught before the horse. I mean I was under the impression we'd be able to get some sponsoring from the city councilman in that area, which is Miss king. If I'm not, if I'm not correct, you're right and he was referring to what, but he was just sanctioned- and I do not think you're going to see any cash from him anytime soon. Well, there's going to be an election before Christmas. Okay. At least we just have to be patient for his particular area for his particular position, because they we need to get someone to replace that. You know that spot. Can I say something yes, ma'am, okay, the commissioner said she can not give us a bus because of this Covid-19 business. So it's going to be very hard for us to get around okay, so at least secondly, it's very dangerous for all of us to pack ourselves into a bus when they're telling you no crowds, but we would not. It would not be a lot of people in the bus, whoever needed to get in the bus that did not does not have transportation, and then I know I would be able to. You know, follow the if we, if you know like, if I had my car and then I would have been able to take somebody in that in my car right and which we would still be, you know separate or behind each other or whatever. But I understand all of that, and this is why I'm in a dilemma, because I want to make sure that we still can do some things that you know as a unit as a team. But what can we do that? I think I think our hands are really tired other than getting a hold of somebody from the parks Department to clean up our parks, both Bronx park east at north, near you and Pelham Parkway South, there's not much more. We can do now. Okay and a lot of the playgrounds in themselves, you know, could use a little sprucing up also right. I know the Department of parks they're really down on the amount of people that they have working. You know between layoffs and coronavirus and stuff, like that, so I mean they're really working with a sparse crew. Mm-, hmm, you know it's like a Skeleton crew calling construction, so we could just ask Iris to do the best that she can. But the thing is now that Orchard Beach and the pools are closed, that maybe she could have some of these pep offices go around in the parks and instead of you know giving her a hard time. You know with having people come to clean it up. Maybe the pep officers can prevent people from making them look like they're a mess and dumping. Exactly yes, do I know for a fact that Mark Jonay has clean up committees on the weekends. He did Pelham Parkway South a few weeks ago and he's doing Pelham Bay Park. He does drugs neck, but unfortunately the slobs that use our parks do not care, they just throw anything in their hands on the ground and it makes it look even worse than it is, and it's not only that over here people you know we have a parking back in and people just opening up their trunks or the back of their vans, and just you know, dumping furniture and garbage, and I I'm talking like bags of garbage and some of these people. I guess maybe have a store or something like that, and I'm just guessing at that, because they're throwing beside the stuff is all recycled. Cardboard is in one kind of thing: cans and bottles are in another. You know what I'm saying, so they do not want to pay for private sanitation right, they just come over here and they dump it. I mean I asked it to put up a camera like what they use for hunting right. In other words, you know they tack it onto a tree or something like that and it's a motion, detector and you know when somebody's actually walking in and starts snapping pictures. You know, maybe you get a hold of somebody like that. I mean we tried to use the cameras from my building over here. It was able to pick up the making the model of the Van, but it was not able to pick up a license plate because it was too far away. You see a lot of the a lot of the problem. Also is sanitation, says it's Park and Park says the sanitation. I think we would be wise. We got a hole in the head of the sanitation to find out to clarify where are the borderlines? Well, my thing my thing is that when, when, during the summer time when they were having some, you know when they had Channel 12 in whatever TV station that was out there and not with you dumb, but one of the other young. Ladies that's supposed to be a community board. 11 member, she was expecting the parks Department to bring out all these bags and to you know, to do the cleanup or to provide whatever they want. They claim they need to provide, which you are an adult, and you know when you're coming out there to picnic what you should bring in order to help your environment and they're, claiming they're blaming the parks Department. But then, who are they they're grown individuals? Why can't you look at your area and figure out what you need to do? No one should have to tell you to clean up behind yourself and not put the pole by the tree and doubt douse it and then just shovel it up and pick it up and put it in something that you know you can disperse it with. But then they do not think the problem with that is that a majority of the people that come here and use the park are not people that live in the neighborhood. In other words, when you see actually neighborhood people, you know people who live on this block or like a block game or two blocks in and they come over here and they do whatever they have to do. I mean they police themselves, it they clean up after themselves. They tie up the garbage and you know they leave it in the front where the trash cans are or if it's too big, you know, they'll tie it up and leave it in. You know black bags, you know for actual garbage, you know some cans and, like they've, been using the white, you know hefty bags. You know for stuff like that for the smaller stuff, but you get the people who are just totally out of the neighborhood. I mean with these big vans they actually drive into the park and leave the vans there and the day that I was there with the reporter. A couple of pep officers came by and they just passed by well, these people were barbecuing with open flames and the reporter asked them. She said you know you're barbecuing over here and it's illegal and basically with the guy response was well police officers. Just came by. He did not come over here and tell me anything. So I guess right. I heard that, yes, that's what I'm referring to so either parks has, to you know, put a little more a couple more dollars in some signs and let them know and point it out to them that it has to be big enough for them to see and read so that bring your own brown paper bag, so bring your own bags that you're going to put your garbage in whether or not it's recycling you can bring the clear bags. You can bring the black bags, whichever you know how to recycle, but so many people do not recycle. This is why they have this problem. You know, that's how that's why we have this problem. I understand, but the point is it's not the bags and stuff like that, and you know it's not the signage, because the signage is up right. The problem is that there's no penalty that these people are paying for not observing it. I mean if they give out a couple of summonses. Yes, you know twenty five fifty dollars, then the next one's a hundred and then you know it just keeps on going up like the pooper scooper law. Dominic, there's no one to do that, there's no one to enforce it and then, when the police are there the park police, they do not do anything. They walk right by. I understand that, but they should they should. Would he call it enforced law and they would only have to do it a couple of times a word gets around and people will get the idea that listen. If I make a mess at a place- and I do not clean up after myself, I'm going to get a summons. Yes I'll, give you a little example. If I may take a minute, there are people in my building that made their little girl a year birthday party two weeks ago at the park over here and I was downstairs and they bring home black bags. I said: what did you bring home? He says the garbage, so they brought it home to put into my garbage. What's the fight, what do they do for what they live? Two or three blocks from the park? Exactly I mean they're residents. I think it's wonderful. They did not want to leave it in the park. Okay, I understand what, because these people care, like Dominic, says they live in the area, so they care about the area. Well, hopefully, we can get them some kind of like a little certificate for doing that and give them plenty of people make a big thing out of it and join the summer and let them let people see that this is what you, what we're looking for, others to do in the community. Even if you come from way across the bay there just come over, enjoy the enjoy the place and then clean up behind yourself and put it where it belongs. It's just like repeating them. It's just like you're going to kindergarten. You got to teach training, it's crazy, but it's what it is, and it's not that the signs are not there Matt put a lot of signs up. They do not bother to read them. Yes, well. What can we do during the during this the upcoming summer? What we can? What can we do to help them help the Parks Department? I think we have plenty of time to worry about the upcoming summer. Okay well well, yeah, I'm just saying well because I know, if I have to you know I can start coming through during the summer and just checking in and just having you know, I'm giving the parkway a support system, because we do not have that problem over by me right and be supportive of your area that area and our area in order to be able to make sure that people are learning. How to you know, really do what's necessary to keep it clean. Well, hopefully, this virus will be gone by then, and we can all take a good part in keeping everything with the right way. Yeah, hey guys. I do not know if you're hearing feedback when people talk, but I know I definitely am so. I think it might be a good idea if we all mute ourselves unless and then just unmute yourself when you're getting ready to talk yeah. That's how I feel okay. So now, if we're, if we are finished with the strategies through Ko Covid-19, we can go on to openness. Anybody for old business, okay. So now I'm going to speak on old business because I did reach out to Al over the when we were at the fortnite precinct and I'm still waiting for the letter to get funding from my elected officials. So I know that's in the making, but I just wanted to throw that in there and then we can move on because that's the only other thing, that's all business. For me, okay, well, I spoke to Jeremy is working on it, so you should have it shortly. Okay, thank you. You're welcome! Okay, excuse me, pat what election official are you looking for funding from? It was not it King Senator, not just not just King Senator Jamal Bailey Carl hasties. I know I can't go outside of my district, but I would have. I would have went to John Mark John as well, because I know he supports a lot of different things, but because he's not in my jurisdiction, I do not know who I, who else I can go through. Why do not you try B.I.G, okay, yeah. She may give a helping hand if you could find her okay honey. So you can. I guess if you can harriet, we could add that name on to the list that Jeremy is putting together. If you do not mind, yes, okay, thank you all right. So if that's done now we're going to go into new business, okay, Pat, I have something I'd like to enlighten everybody. It has nothing to do with the parks, but I am very concerned about the Pelham Parkway area and I think everybody should be 2134. Barnes Avenue, that's the big new building on lydic, that's been empty for years 2134. Ladies bonsai, it is coming ahead for a house okay, starting in about two weeks. It will be for lbj people only 25 and over they can stay for 30 days and then they have to move on they're, going to try to give them training and find them apartments and jobs. I can't see how they'll do that in 30 days, but that's what we heard. Okay. Well, I am concerned because of the school I'm happy it's going to be that kind of a halfway house. You know and not a methadone clinic or whatever, but I would like to make the public aware of what's going on. Thank you, okay. Dominic, do you have anything to say for that? No, I was not aware of it. I mean this is the first time hearing of it yeah. Well, not many people Natalia made the announcement last week at the Precinct council meeting anything Lisa. You have any comments on that. I do not. I have something new that I want to bring up, but I do not have any comments. Okay, I'm talking about it all right. So all right! So thank you edith for bringing that to our attention. At least I know I can you know go by there as well. Since I drive, I can go by there and check and see what's going on several days when it's nice and then just check it out and see what's going on and give you some feedback on that as well yeah. Well, I walk down only two blocks from here. It's okay, two blocks for me: yeah, okay, sweetie, okay, baby Gotcha! All right! Thank you all right Lisa! So I wanted to bringing this issue up on behalf of my father who who often lived in the district, but he begged me to bring this up at the Community Board. So apparently he and some of his some of his older friends he's retired. Now they used to have a spot over in Orchard Beach. Well, really Pelham, Bay Park, not really the beach, but going towards the beach in the area, and you guys probably know a little better than me, but the area where it's like a small parking lot and then, if you keep going, I think it goes into the police firing range okay. So there was like a little picnic area where you know where he and some of his other friends used to just you know, hang out and play dominoes and just you know just hang out, and he said that whole area has been closed off to them and now the only way that they can that they said that you know that was kind of like their little area. They, you know, they said they were not loud. They did not litter or anything. So he just wanted to know if I could find out why that area might have been closed off to the public as opposed to any other areas of the park. I like that area because there were no kids, it was just quiet, it was just kind of down and there in their little their spot Lisa. If I were you, I contact Mark, Jonah. Okay, he would give you the information or find out for you. What's going on, okay, Lisa yeah, I was under the impression that off of that circle that goes into Rodman's neck. As soon as you exit the circle, I thought it was NYPD or law enforcement only. I do not know I like. I said I I'm sorry. I do not have the full information, but I just know that he said that they were able to hang out there for a while and then suddenly they closed it down with all these barricades. He could also, in the meantime, go to Orchard Beach on a regular basis and if they decide that they want to go to Orchard Beach now there is no parking fee. There are benches. There are Barbecue pits, I mean what I see people doing over there now they're out there playing music. I mean physically playing music like with bongos and right instruments. People are putting little tables out like what they do with football games. They call it tailgating only they're not eating what they're doing is some guys are playing cards. Some people are playing dominoes yeah. Some people are just sitting down in like a circle and they're staying, believe it or not nobody's up on top of one. They got their beach chairs out and they're sitting five or six feet apart in a big round circle with their cars surrounding them, so that they're protected, I guess from the whatever it is, and a lot of people are there on a regular basis, nice days and it's not by the beach area, it's closer to the I'd, say Northwest corner of the parking lot. If you, if you're good with the directions yeah, I think I know exactly what you're talking about as soon as you go in you go. You do not go in through the entrance you're going through the exit. They have it combed off; in other words, they split the exit in half where the right- hand side is going into the park, the left- hand side is coming out and there's really not a lot of you know traffic going in and at one time, and what people are doing is that they're parking directly in that lane closest to the grassy area. Some people are even hanging out on the grassy area that faces the road. You know faces that little bay where they do the boat races. You know where the college kids go in and do well. I do not know what they call it rowing or whatever yeah the crew. They call it whatever. It is, and you know it's close enough. I think they might have one public bathroom open if you're going to get there you're going to go by car, so you just get in your car. You drive to the other end of the parking lot and you know what's going on that's great I'll. Let him know because I know that he was the main reason they were upset was because that, like that area was free and then like this happened during the summer, and so they were like. Why do we have to pay to go into the beach? If what we want to do is just kind of sit down and play dominoes or sit down and play cards, so I will mention that to him well dominant. Can I ask you, can I ask you a personal question? Okay, is anybody in that crew over 65 they're all over 65.? Okay? So if they go Monday to Friday, the parking fee is cut from eight dollars. I think to five dollars: okay for senior citizens. You have to go in on the left- hand side, even though, for me, I think that five dollars is being ripped off. Considering that it's a public beach yeah, you know what I'm saying and the swimming and everything is free. It's just the deal that the city cut with who's ever maintaining the parking lot dominic after May 31st or whenever is not it free. No after labor day is not it free. The weekend, the Monday after Labor Day is free right, yeah, that's what I'm saying so right now they can go for nothing. Thank you for nothing now, but they extended a week after labor day. In other words, if labor day is say, Labor day is the fifth right. First free day would be the 12th cause the whole next week, get it they charged. Okay, thank you guys. You're welcome. Okay, so I see that Debbie came in hi, deb, hello, Debbie, oh she's, just texting so she's just she's, not on okay. I made her a panelist, okay gotcha, all right, we'll do okay, so I'm just reaching out to debbie, because we've been talking about old business and now we're in a new business. So we would just want to know whether or not she has anything to add on to what she's heard so far. I do not see anything in chat. Okay, so she said she has a chat. You see her chat pet. I do not see any chat Babe! Let me see she says there are three bathrooms are open. It was closed due to the stuff going with riots and NYPD. All I heard was about that was Orton. I have no idea, I can see, there's three bathrooms open in Orchard Beach, three bathrooms. Those three bathrooms were open. Now they were closed during the summer with all the riots. Okay alrighty. Well, I think this was a very productive meeting. I know it's only 7:27. I move that we close and Edith says we remove that it's closed who's going to second I'll. Second, it. Okay, all righty, I'm right! Please, everybody stay well stay healthy! Everybody stay well ate it. They did not get a chance before you stay well and have a good time at the wedding everybody else you stay safe, be careful dominic, I'm going to have a drink with a mask. I want to see that I'm going to wait a minute hold on hold on I'm going to make somebody, so I can put a straw through it. I know that's right. Somebody was just putting something up: who's, a panelist, I'm not sure Debbie, says Rodman's. Neck is closed due to the rights. Okay, complaining about no public input. I am not public Robert yeah, okay! Well, thank everyone. So much for being so supportive for our parks, Recreation committee meeting everyone have a blessed night and stay safe and we'll talk soon.
