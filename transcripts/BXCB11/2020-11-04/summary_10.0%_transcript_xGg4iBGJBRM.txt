But since Covid-19, you know, you're, told to stay in you The big problem is the person that I'm under the impression that we were going to get the money from the city.
Other than getting a hold of somebody from the parks Department to clean up our parks, both Bronx park east at north, near you and Pelham Parkway, South I, know the Department of parks, they're, really down on the amount of people that they have working.
You know we have a parking back in And people, just opening up their trunks or the back of their vans, and just you know, dumping furniture and garbage, I'm talking like bags of garbage and some of these people.
I heard that, yes, that's what I'm, referring to so either parks has, to you, know, put a little more a couple more dollars in some signs and let them know and point it out to them that it has to be big enough for them to see and read so that bring your own brown paper bag, so bring your own bags that you're going to put your garbage in whether or not it's recycling you can bring the clear bags.
Okay, I understand what, because these people care, like Dominic, says they live in the area.
I can start coming through during the summer and just checking in and just having you know, I'm, giving the parkway a support system, because we do not have that problem over by me right and be supportive of your area, That area and our area in order to be able to make sure that people are learning.
Well, really Pelham, Bay Park, not really the beach, but going towards the beach in the area, and you guys, probably know a little better than me, but the area where it's like a small parking lot.
If you keep going, I, think it goes into the police firing range There was like a little picnic area where you know where he and some of his other friends used to just you.
He just wanted to know if I could find out why that area might have been closed off to the public as opposed to any other areas of the park.
You know traffic going in and at one time, and what people are doing is that they're parking directly in that lane closest to the grassy area.
