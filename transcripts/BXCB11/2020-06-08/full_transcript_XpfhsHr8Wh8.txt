Is going on, I would put together a quick PowerPoint or something, and we would utilize that to present to Matt Dorian and ultimately, if we're looking for a capital project that was the path to take. Does everybody remember that or have any comments about that Yeah right, basically we're talking about playgrounds more than the park itself, and it had to do with capital improvement in the East Chester projects, in other words, I, think they've they're in the process of trying to accumulate some money to redo that playground in basketball court and basically, what they wanted to know was what are the options and what they could put in there? That's why we were going to the different areas to see what type of apparatus was available to put in there and how many things you could put in there. You know and fit it comfortably with the basketball court, if I'm not mistaken, you're, so right and that's what I was going to put in old business or new business. But this is what we wanted to do, but since this pandemic you know they tell you to either stay indoors or whatever, and this is why we I'm puzzled, but I do still go and help visit. My you know other neighbors that seniors that need help with different things, so that was taking me away from the Parks Department project, but the same token, that's why I wanted to make sure that we get a meeting in so I can get the strategies from everybody how we're going to move forward, and if we can I can pick up, someone in the car I can eat. If I can get. Whoever wants to ride with me, we can meet I can't not go into I can not go into a con. I appreciate your you know, offering I can't do that I'm too high a risk. Yes, baby, okay, Julie I think we might be better off Iris. Also volunteered a van that A1 Van I understand that, instead of one van, maybe we could get to that'll put us socially distant and the best thing about it is that the Van would actually be able to drive into the park and directly into the playground. I mean I. Have some personal issues too, where you know walking distances might create a problem for me right and the best thing is I mean if we get a parts department, vehicle, everybody's gotten alerts or something thunderstorm. That's a great point, so you know, perhaps the committee can decide when we'd like to do that and not to put us on the spot, but I know she has a good working relationship with the park Bronx park. Commissioner, maybe at some point we could you know lean on her to reach out and see if we can coordinate it when we feel the time is right. Let me tell you what the problem is with that I mean I. Would love to do that? I've been trying to get ahold of Iris on my own because we do have a relationship and I can't get ahold of her. So I do not know, I know they're, not working in the office. She was in the office. I met with her a week and a half ago, oh okay, because I had been trying they're considered essential personnel, so they do have to go in at some point telling me that husband was yelling at her because she's one of the few people that's actually going into the office. Now, whether or not he decided to work from home or not, is another story, but she did volunteer at the last meeting. The suppliers would have an to take this around wreath for one I'm sure she's not going to having a problem with two, and you know what I'm saying so we have no first of all, nobody, we never have those full nine people at the meeting. So let's say worst comes to worst I'm, sorry, but it depends on who wants to go anyway. I understand it, but when I'm saying is, if you have eight people mmm, okay, those vans are big enough to put four people in each one of them to have them socially distant from one another, because they think they're like three or four rows of seats number one outside of the driver's seat, so I mean you put four people on one four people in the other. If only poor people show up or five people show up, you can probably basically get amend if they put stuff like that yeah and there's no way to do that. I mean it seems like because if the Van holds a dozen people put four or five people in there should not be a big deal coordinating on a certain day in time and then we're going to go to I, guess: East, Chester Gardens is the name of the park right. So you know- and you know we just get the ball rolling on that. Let's see it may not come to fruition for a couple of weeks anyway, and things may be a little bit loose. You know we're supposed to open up New York City phase. Two I think on Monday right so phase, one I'm, sorry phase. One sorry Laurent says you're not getting face two until July two supposed to be under 15 July valuated, based on what the numbers I saw him on TV to say afternoon, and he says we're looking at the beginning of July. That was the mayor. Okay, maybe if you can put it out there, that'll be great see if you reach out to Iris. Put it out there, what you know as you get information you can communicate to the committee and Weekly Jeremy and Cara Mia' forwarded perfectly I. Do not have what you would call nimble, fingers all right, I think sister, that was that was fun. I will call you and check on you as well, because I really have to check on or on all of my committee. You know that's what I do I do. Not try to you know, discriminate against anybody. I know I eat. If is my baby, but you know we have you know even Joe. You know I want to be able to communicate with everybody, so I'll be checking on you as well everybody's good. So I guess with that said right. That was the that's kind of where we left off sister. So yes, I, think that you know we can see what kind of luck we get my virus see where she's at see how receptive she is right now in response to environment that we're in and then we'll take it from there we'll get that ball rolling. We all know you know we do have some constraints, so you know you want to try to put something out there so that I can say, as things start to ease up, we can hit the ground somewhat running and do what we do. Okay, let me get one second, when I'm an where we could have that to this am I in for weekends. Only am I asking her for 7 o'clock at night, my asking her, for you know middle of the week. I mean I. Go you know any day anytime, but I mean some people might have to go back to work and stuff like that. So give me a rough idea of you know what I'm going to try and solicit from do not say you know. If my compliment would be just obviously, we want to go during the light hours right and maybe when it's too hot in the day, so maybe either a morning or you know like a later afternoon, all depends and then maybe honor you know maybe on Saturday I think might be best. I know we can vote on it. Absolutely, but I'm not opposed to you during the week, because I am working from home now. Currently, so that's just me so I am open and flexible. Are you open? During the week we go up in there in the week any time, any time, weekends all week, I'm working from home, but like I'm I can't just up and leave yeah. You have to be at a certain place: I am free after 4 o'clock, so I mean I could do any weekday after 4 o'clock and then any time on the weekends okay. So basically the best thing would be a Saturday. What I'm talking about doing a Sunday, but that's what we discussed last time would be on a Saturday, so everybody would be able to doing yep alright. So we got that out there. Dom, we'll put it out there we'll ask about you, know avann√° to for a Saturday. You know Saturday in the future. Yes couple of dates, you have an iPhone or an iPod, but we can not no I'm Maura I'm. On my regular phone. Okay say we can find a way we could try to figure out a way to making virtual real with us computer. Of course, I had to Imperial alright, so you can fold it our computer, can't you yeah figure something out: okay, Lisa. We can't figure something out. I will figure something out so that Edith could be with us virtually I'm very happy to hear that. Thank you. Welcome I, appreciated, ok, so that takes care of all business, because that's what we I would have been discussing for the Oh business was the capital project and reason for visiting different parts of you conditions and also to you know, to review the equipment so that I could put something you know. I can make judgment for what I can put in East Chester. So now, since we have two new businesses, the new business will go back to Joe and the tree that we want to save, because that's something that's very important as well. So Jeremy, if you could, can you pull up that picture again on the tree yeah and if everybody's looking at the chat so there to see bailing staff just generalized, it there's a reason for doing that, so both Harry and I have post rights and ability to control the meeting. This is a small meeting, but I wanted Harry to join the mean, so we could test this out upcoming meetings. So Harry is currently the host one on the other one. Okay, so you so that's the tree right there. All the way to the left that is has been deemed. It was in question for a good year and a half whether it was going to remain or not it's an it's. A very old white swamp just a minute and that tree you can see is a tree. That's very welcomed in the warmer sitting at the bus. Stop waiting for that Bronx 12! That shows up it needs to. It needs to come out because of a water main pipe. That's underneath it. You know again, it's just another blow. If you look, if you look just past the L like where the bus would be going like to the right, we lost some trees over there as well. I guess, because that water man is right in that area. I know the parks has done a pretty good job with you know, trying to mitigate as many trees as possible, but on the Technical, Working Group monthly meetings that we have. It was brought up that this tree does in fact have to go. It really is not replaceable. You know the comments you know in the past. Were you know if this was central park? It would not happen if this was the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It would not happen because they've actually relocated trees like this believe it or not. I know it's a tremendous endeavor, not saying we'd want to spend a hundred thousand dollars to try to save that tree. I. Do not think it's a good use of taxpayer money, but I just want everybody to realize that you know again, it's it has to it has to come down, and you know that area there's been a lot of work right. That was phase one of some mall work that was done and exposed to work its way further east I just wanted to bring it to the to the committee's attention that this is happening and Dom brought up. A good point, you know, is it? Is it because it's not feasible at all to reroute or just because they just it's-? This is easily the easiest path or the path of least resistance. You know, I was told that it's not really feasible, I'm sure this, you know I'm sure there might be a little bit of both in there Dom. So my question to you is there anybody that we know in this field? That is not part project that could actually tell us the truth as to whether or not it's feasible or not. Well, we'd have to have we'd, have to have a civil engineer, review the plans and then basically question the DDC and there's nobody that we know that would do this on the arm, in other words, as a volunteer or nobody in this line of work. I do know a civil engineer. He actually has looked at some stuff during phase one of the reconstruction I could reach out to him and see if he would be willing to look into it Jeremy is there any money that we could use that of whatever budget there is in order, maybe to pay something for this you're going to find somebody has a has just business with the city. Somebody has a vendor ID number, a valid one, so I do not know. If you want to speak, this person go and find out. They do business with the city. Yeah I mean we have money, we can do something with, but that's not the issue. First I would say first fire. This guy can do it on the arm. You can't find out, he does business with the city. You know what I'm saying I mean I. Do not know what these people get, but I mean if you got it rolled five hundred or something like that if he says he's going to do it on the arm, just as a sign of good faith. You know you know, if the guys honest with us and stuff like that, we can afford it. You know we might meet him later on sometime and he says: hey, you know these are honorable people, you know, let me do what I can for them. Jeremy do we have the actual engineer drawings this area? Do we know if we could get access to them or we would have to purchase a copy? I could ask you I mean they might be able to get to accommodate some them. Would you just? Could you shoot a short note, maybe to her and just ask her if we can have access to the engineer, drawing of that water main that is going to uproot that tree? Okay might be amazing to say something like can we before we go do all this? Can we see if they're even going to be willing to change it, because if you remember, we had this whole conversation a few meetings ago surrounding loreto Parque and the way that the way that the redesign of the park was and how somebody on our committee I forget what was pointed out, the bass that, when people are hitting the baseballs, are going to go into oncoming traffic and is there anybody that seems that and they were like? No once you already have a punch, we already have contractors, you know, plans have already been drawn up. It does not matter what you say now, there's literally no way that they were going to change it at all. So I do not want us to go through all of this and find a way that they can reroute this water main and for them to say yeah. It does not matter the balls already been rolling. We can't stop it at this point. You see. That's a that's a good point, because you know again: the plans are where the plans are, they were making assessments and I think they were waiting up until the very end to actually see where things you know, things on paper and things in the field could be very different, so I think they were waiting until they were getting close to see the trajectory of the of the pipe of the water main that's going in. So you are right. You know if it's, if it's there and we would want to deviate a bit. Dom said five yards one way or five feet away. That could that happen? Perhaps would it be a change order to the contract? Would there be a cost to it all question marks that would probably derail the whole thing right. So I just want to say, like I. Do not want us to spend money to have a civil engineer, look at possibilities. If the Parks Department is like we can't it does not matter what possibilities you find the deal is done. We can. We can't change it. So I was going to find that out. First Joanna, if the parks department, I'm sorry, the Parks Committee of CB 11, wanted to hire a civil engineer to look at the routing of the existing water main. Would that be something that D DC would be open to if this person could deem the you know? Another solution, you know honestly, if I can put my two cents in I, do not think thing that we're willing to do anything honestly because of the experiences we've had before that they will not. You know, deviate from their plans, but I think you have a very good idea. Lee said that before we go into any of this, we should really find out whether it's possible for them to do anything like that yeah. That might be just as simple as an email from Jeremy to Joanna. To ask the question. I know: there's a big difference between this and Loreto Parque Loreto Parque came before the Parks Committee was voted on numerous times. It was brought to the full board. The full board voted on it and approved it, and I mean it was all because they were worried about Senator, Klein and him getting the wangal wagon in there for the concerts, which, eventually after they in the process of doing it, he did not win the election and the concerts are down the tube, but that was brought to our attention. We were asked about it. We went over it. We it was the Parks Commission, the parks, what he call committee and the community board that all suggested. That I mean we had a lot of people there from the community all weighing in on this. It was not only to the actual committee itself and I mean that's what the people wanted know that we're going to waste all that space, because just did not get into office. I understand that everybody took it for granted in the bottom line right, but I think we should find out for sure before we jump into anything, of course, that it can't be done. But if this guy's going to do YUM, you know what I'm saying- and you know five hundred dollars really is not a lot of money. When you talk about something like that- oh boy, of course, so Jeremy. How would we handle? Would that be a request that would come from you or one of us yeah the change room Jeremy? Would you send a quick email to them asking so you're talking about what their plans are? Their intentions are, if they're going to take it down, resolve it just yeah. Just if we could, you know the parks. The Parks Committee came up with an idea because of this tree. Everybody does not wanted to come down if they were to hire a you know a civil engineer to review, and you know he saw he saw a possibility with DD C consider another opinion. So I can ask so, let's back up to I. Remember so let me just so I know we did a site visit you and me Joe and George Dolch and other people, and my recollection of it was so parks that basically they left it up to us. If we want to save the tree or not- and that was at the time that was the decision- I can't remember- this is 2018, it might've been 2018 and so I think. They also said that we could save the tree, but I'll probably die in three years anyway, and then they offered do you remember what they offered in terms of they said? Well, you know if we take it out and we'll put a hundred thousand dollars towards tree plantings or something do you remember they make some type of offer like that. I. Do not remember what exactly but I do remember standing around the tree and you know they were like listen. Do you want us to try to save this one decision now and I was like yes do you can to save that tree? I, do not recall what kind of restitution they were offering at all yeah I mean they. Obviously they could not say I mean they did not think they could say that they would have to do other things all right. So I think this question would be Jeremy's. Just listen. The Parks Committee is willing to hire a civil engineer to take a look at the plans. Is this something? If civil engineer sees a you know, a different approach is DDC willing to. You know compromise it exactly because they may be trying to do this week. Right, who knows one I do not I do not I know, I mean Durant, call you or George mulch we just the last time we spoke and George and I have communicated yes about it, but Joanna has not spoken with me directly about it. Okay tried searching my emails to do something with her. Okay. Thank you point. Oh Lisa, you I did not want us to waste any time and money I agree, so Dom's I guess going to get the ball rolling on Iris she'll, send an email out to Joanna and see if we even have a shot at this okay, but let me know whether you can get her or not all right, yeah keep trying all right so now moving forward. This is still new business and we have ten minutes left I, guess maybe ten minutes we have whatever left. We do also have a board member who's. Officially, a member of the public tonight side of you, I, open up for public comment before in going to all business new business, or you want to it's up to you, Pat I'm, just saying you remember the public to the to the public speak. Now you can go ahead. Please hold on the mute her. You can your her, since you have that of stability. The attendees okay and she's, the caller, that's muted, Natalie Medina and your gimme yeah I just wanted to because I was hearing some stuff from Facebook live before I was ever get stuff on the phone I wanted to add that I did take pictures of all the park before the parks were shut down. So I have photographed all the Seabees 11 parks. That's number one. The iris was had a teleconference today at 4 o'clock, so Iris is a hundred percent reachable I've seen her numerous times at Orchard Beach during the Covid-19 crisis. So she is 100%. Reachable click on participants. No, do you have the participant list on the right? I do not see her name she's under attendees. You got a click under attendees, hello, right, brillo, Pad, Charles's, name, ok, I do not even see pet roles on here participant; okay, all attendees nothing's coming up on my end or me. If he's the last person I have so, but you do not have attendees, you do not see the phone number audience just serve it clear. Why I'm having hair you do this is cuz I mean help. I can't be doing everything myself. I need I, need a break every now and then I do not know. You mean if I second, that so you have the list of participants on the right here. It says: community Board, 11 staff, Debbie, dumb Joe meant Lisa, soda and petrels I mean if I go any further. There's bolt all participants Harriet. You got a look at the very bottom where it says you more to the side. She has a different screen. Noise do not remembers, do not forget you. The host I do not so below those lists. The people on the right now it should be panelists and then attendees. It should be-. If he's calling you your for and then a name-. So I can see it yeah all 10 DS I'm, not getting all the names- people, Natalie is one of them and I just take over the claim. The Ho stroll. Okay, thank you. Oh you know what it is. The chat, if you have the chat open, that's what it is. You got ta close the chat and X out on the right with the chat. That's alright saw it. No that's the wrong. Let's leave the event, all right, sound! It's on the it's right below the list of participants on the right. It's Max, the question- and- answer thing: okay, you can close that as well as the chat anyway. I am new. Did you Natalie? Can you talk yes hear me I'm, not officially a committee member but I'm working on it I think I think you guys need to recruit me I like to formally tonight what require at least right, at least at least for a while I think the you guys are discussing on their old business. The idea of surveying parks and I think it's a great idea and I just wanted to ask a question. I think Dom suggested something about one of the parks that you were looking at. What kind of equipment fits there and like what kind of things you can fit in? How are you evaluating that like? How are you going about sort of you know, making those suggestions or evaluating those things well under the impression that it's the East Chester housing, the area over there by East, Chester houses and Pat Charles, will eventually go to the people over there show them what is available to put in and I guess we would ask for their input as to what they would want to put there. Is that not correct that? Yes, it is that's why we are going to visit other parks and not just to review those that particular part of our agenda of the project is also to see the conditions of other parks, as well as for East Chester Gardens residents, to see what other parks do have. What other playgrounds do have that we would be able to include, because we have little of nothing. So we want to be able to fill up the area where the children play. We still want to be able to give opportunity for teens to have something that they can utilize. You know, adults, you know even seniors whatever equipment that they have the exercise equipment they have in different areas. So we would like to try to put in some things that would the residents something to do during the summertime. Besides just basketball and little or nothing else, to do the swings and the sprinklers outside of assessing what shape the parks are in. There is a limited space as to what the people in the East Chester Housing houses can utilize and if I'm not mistaken, the basketball court, it's something that they definitely want neat. Is that correct it's been done, but it still has to be redone because of the pipe. What I'm saying is that's something that they want to have remain: yes, okay, so in this space, that's available the basketball court to be refurbished and what else you're going to put in with the basketball court? Well more than likely be left up to the residents of East Chester, you know housing. Can I interject? Let me tell you: when back to put in our exercise, equipment and Bronx called East, we were not asked what we wanted. That's why I'm just sitting here and listening I understand the basketball court. Yes, that's a definite, but can we say what the residents they want to have put in, or is it all up to them to put in what they want? No, because we're going to we have to solicit the money first, nobody volunteered any money for this. Up to this point, I mean first, we have to say what we want. Thank you see. You know if the people agree to it, okay get somebody to sponsor it and if they sponsor it, see how much it that they'd be willing to pay for Dorian said Edith was that you know we go through that process right, we take photo video. We discuss what we want they're going to come up with the actual budget of what things are going to cost so I mean you know if we want or something like that or something for the kids like those medal, those you know like metal ones that they have the Pelham, Bay Park or even over at the roller, skate the skateboard park over there. That's what Matt said that you know they would look into making feasible and help us put the bunch together, okay. Well, what I'm saying is, after we do these surveys, and you know that community decides what they would like do we actually had to say of what we would like, because when Jimmy funded ours we had no say in anything they, but then what they wanted to put in my question, I mean I. Do not know that the answer is yet, but I would think that we most certainly would have a say. You know, I do not remember I, do not you know. I was not a part of the mini when you, when you had done it last time where you went was not dis involved. You guys we were not asked anything out of committee in Parks and I bound the parks Committee since I'm on the community board. We were in bed hold on a minute eat it. There was a big difference. The big difference is Jimmy vakidis on his own. In other words, nobody was asking for it with some money. He put some over here and he put some in Pelham Bay someplace that we would most certainly have a save because we're asking what we're going to be asking for particular items and we're going to be asking certain people for money. I mean I happen to agree with the fact that the community should have to say what they want in their area, because they know very well what they can utilize and what they can't so I'm just agreement. It is yesterday I, know I just want to interject and say that when I was going around taking the pictures, some of the people of the neighborhood that happen to be utilizing stuff, it was saying they would. There was asked me what I was doing so I told them I'm, taking pictures to try to improve the parks and whatnot right. I was knighted, I was not aware of, and I do not know if the if the men in this group here have ever heard the turn of a double rim on the basketball hoops but I know like the people in these neighborhoods. They would ask me: oh and it was numerous parks I'm saying they do not want double rips. So, yes, people need to reach out to the people of the community. People think sister Charles sister cha, that's how community so she's the Chargers do speak with her people. This is this is why I need to speak now. Okay, because I understand what everybody is saying: okay and Debbie, if you did come into East, Chester Gardens and you first day so then I listen to me very carefully. Okay, if you came and I'm there, I would have appreciated it. If that you had pain, you would have spoken to me to. Let me know that you were there and I could have come with you to be there to make sure that everything that you were doing and if there was any questions, because I've been explaining to the to my residents that this is what was this is what's coming up. This is what we want to do. Okay, so I would respectfully I went there at the beginning of the Kovich shut down. Everybody question. The question is all you have to do to reach out to me, especially if I'm the chairwoman of the committee and you're coming into my neighborhood in order for me to know what you're doing I would appreciate, if you would do that, listen I would I. Just went there to take pictures, which was an overt death twice acts of me: okay, we're good yeah. You know you just want. You know wanted to just know that she was going to be absolutely. You could have gotten some feedback. So let's move forward. So, let's move forward and we're going to make arrangements to make sure that we can get the Van and we'll set up a date, and we are all agree, take a vote and agree on how we're going to move forward and then once we do get these pictures, we will be able to come back to East Chester Gardens residents give them the information of what we see with whatever they have in other parks that we would be able to fit in he's just a Gardens area for that playground to give more access to much more than just a monkey bars and some swings and just a sprinkler. We need more than that. So that's why we? What we do this project, this capital project, so if we can come together in unity and respect each other to come and do this together? I would appreciate that so now we're moving forward because it's already 8 o'clock and I do not know what not you want to finish. What I'll do now is real, there's new business because there's something else that happened in these Chester and my and my playground with the tree. That fell a big tree that fell so I'm, going to I'm going to push that back and we're going to put that into our next meeting from July and then real sweet no meeting in July the next comedian, September. Okay, so then real wait until so then, but I'm just saying, I want to make sure to be just get off this phone and the meeting. If we want to take the meeting and close it now, we can do that. If not comment, I have a comment about the tree that fell down in your Park I mean yes have been removed. Did anybody get hurt? Is it still a safe condition, because I do not think if you play them off, if it's not, they I think they did take, did take it up. I believe they did I'm not saying I have to go and look at it myself, I'm, not sure what but I know fell down it broke the fence. I do not know whether or not they cut it up and they pulled it off or not. I still have to go back and look and see if that was done, but that was both kind pad is fixed. I. Do not think we should wait until September and I think that's an urgent matter. You should contact Madame, Edie Utley, because I know time is of the essence. I know people want to get off the phone and I know that the meeting is over at 8 o'clock, so I just want to deal, but you have an emergency situation there. You guys can stay on as long as you want. I was not paying all the time, so do not worry about. If you want to go and check it out sister and you need any help with that, you can give any one of us on the on the committee. A call I'll be happy to help definitely I'm open to you pack. Whatever you mean, give me a call and I'll be get back to you on that, to see whether or not they cut it up and they hold it off or what you know. Cuz I been able to go out there and check it mail, that's great, to miss an email, close okay, I appreciate that. Thank you sure all right. My last thing is that there's a lot of algae on my trees as well, this green over this out green algae. It is growing everywhere in my in my development. That's the pollen! That's blowing roll over I do not know if that's pollen. This is just that's not pound. This is just green algae.
