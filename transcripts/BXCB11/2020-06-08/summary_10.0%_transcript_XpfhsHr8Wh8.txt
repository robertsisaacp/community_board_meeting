Yeah right, basically we're talking about playgrounds more than the park itself, and it had to do with capital improvement in the East Chester projects, Other words, I, think they've they're in the process of trying to accumulate some money to redo that playground in basketball, court and basically.
And You know and fit it comfortably with the basketball court, if I'm, not mistaken, you're, so right, And, that's what I was going to put in old business or new business.
You know other neighbors that seniors that need help with different things, so that was taking me away from the Parks Department project, but the same token.
Some personal issues, too, where you know walking distances, might create a problem for me right and the best thing is I mean If we get a parts, department, vehicle, everybody's gotten alerts or something thunderstorm.
Perhaps the committee can decide when we'd like to do that and not to put us on the spot, But I know she has a good working relationship with the park.
If is my baby, but you know we have you know even Joe. So, yes, I, think that you know we can see what kind of luck we get my virus see where she's at Let me get one second, But I mean some people might have to go back to work and stuff.
During the week we go up in there in the week any time, any time, weekends, all week, I'm working from home, but like I'm I, can't just up and leave Welcome I, appreciated, ok, so that takes care of all business, because that's what we I would have been discussing for the Oh business was the capital project and reason for visiting different parts of you conditions and also to you know, to review the equipment, so that I could put something you know.
I know it's a tremendous endeavor, not saying we'd want to spend a hundred thousand dollars to try to save that tree.
Can we see if they're, even going to be willing to change it, because if you remember, we had this whole conversation a few meetings ago surrounding loreto Parque and the way That the way that the redesign of the park was and how somebody on our committee I forget what was pointed out, the bass that, when people are hitting the baseballs, are going to go into oncoming traffic and is there anybody that seems that So I do not want us to go through all of this and find a way that they can reroute this water main and for them to say yeah.
If the parks, department, I'm sorry, the Parks Committee of CB 11, wanted to hire a civil engineer to look at the routing of the existing water main.
And I mean that's what the people wanted, Know that we're going to waste all that space, because just did not get into office.
Oh Lisa, you I did not want us to waste any time and money, I agree, She'll, send an email out to Joanna and see if we even have a shot at this All right, This is still new business and we have ten minutes left I Officially, a member of the public tonight side of you, I, open up for public comment before in going to all business new business, or you want to Just saying you remember the public to the to the public.
Are you going about sort of you know, making those suggestions or evaluating those things well under the impression that it's the East Chester housing, the area over there by East, Chester houses and Pat Charles, will eventually go to the people over there show them what is available to put in That particular part of our agenda of the project is also to see the conditions of other parks, as well as for East Chester Gardens residents, to see what other parks do have.
I mean I happen to agree with the fact that the community should have to say what they want in their area, because they know very well what they can.
