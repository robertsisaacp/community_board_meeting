Is going on I would put together a quick PowerPoint or something, and we would utilize that to present to Matt Dorian and ultimately, if we're looking for a capital project that was the path to take Basically we're talking about playgrounds more than the park itself, and it had to do with capital improvement in the East Chester projects, in other words, I, think they've they're in the process of trying to accumulate some money to redo that playground in basketball court and basically, what they wanted to know was what are the options and You know and fit it comfortably with the basketball court, if I'm not mistaken, you're so right and that's what I was going to put in old business or new business This is what we wanted to do, but since this pandemic you know they tell you to either stay indoors or whatever, and this is why we I'm puzzled, but I do still go and help visit My. You know other neighbors that seniors that need help with different things, so that was taking me away from the Parks Department project.
You can probably basically get amend if they put stuff like that, I mean it seems like because if the van holds a dozen people put four or five people in there shouldn't be a big deal coordinating on a certain day in time, East Chester Gardens is the name of the park right Let's see it may not come to fruition for a couple of weeks anyway, and things may be a little bit loose.
During the week we go up in there in the week any time, any time, weekends all week, I'm working from home, but like I'm, Welcome, I appreciated, ok, so that takes care of all business, because that's what we I would have been discussing for the Oh business was the capital project and reason for visiting different parts of you conditions and also to you know, to review the equipment so that I could put something you know So now, since we have two new businesses, the new business will go back to Joe and the tree that we want to save, because that's something that's very important as well.
I know it's a tremendous endeavor, not saying we'd want to spend a hundred thousand dollars to try to save that tree.
All weighing in on this It wasn't only to the actual committee itself and I mean that's what the people wanted know that we're gonna waste all that space because just didn't get into office, and you know five hundred dollars really isn't a lot of money.
Everybody doesn't wanted to come down if they were to hire a you know, a civil engineer to review and so I know we did a site visit you and me Joe and George Dolch and other people, and my recollection of it was so parks that basically they left it up to us if we want to save the tree or not, and that was at the time that was the decision.
If you have the chat open, that's what it is I'm, not officially a committee member , at least at least for a while I think the you guys are discussing on their old business Are you going about sort of you know, making those suggestions or evaluating those things well under the impression that it's the East Chester housing, the area over there by East, Chester houses and Pat Charles will eventually go to the people over there show them what is available to put in That particular part of our agenda of the project is also to see the conditions of other parks, as well as for East Chester Gardens residents, to see what other parks do have What other playgrounds do have that we would be able to include, because we have little of nothing.
I mean I happen to agree with the fact that the community should have to say what they want in their area, because they know very well what they can.
