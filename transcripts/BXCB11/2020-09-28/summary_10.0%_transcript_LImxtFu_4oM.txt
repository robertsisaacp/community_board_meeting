Ensuring that the current board and future boards accurately represent the racial, gender and other demographics of our community by ensuring that overt or embedded racism, sexism and other inequities are not included in our bylaws website.
Another comment review ensuring that overt or embedded racism and gender inequities are not included in our comments, posts or statements to the public.
This from another community board, so CB8 has established a racial committee.
I spoke to several board members and we felt as though a racial committee did not cover enough of the inequities that we may face in our community, and so we've decided to move with a more general overarching, name, the equity committee, and this entire statement was written by me with nothing borrowed from anyone, okay.
My point is that I expected to pass through the committee and come to the full board next month for a vote.
