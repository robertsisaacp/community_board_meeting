I, guess to anyone who either once who wants to make another nation I'd like to make a nomination, says: Joanne Rubino for a first vice chair, Are there any other Actually before I do open it up Sometimes, you do not even know who you're voting for so it's become so hard to say we're hoping for someone we do not even know.
You know the names I thought we would have names and everyone can make a decision who they want to vote for, but to just come tonight and be put on the spot.
But if anyone has any questions, I'll take questions, ethics committee I mean he spends a lot of time outside of our scheduled meetings, with the work that he does like to make sure that he gives his all.
I responded and if I was not aware only making myself clear so in June, I was not available during the pandemic Allow for the nominating committee to cast a single vote for the single nominee.
I'm here people, so the person I did not hear from before was bernadette, which she said she most likely can't make the meeting Melanie Lahose, Sylvia, Mazzella and Norris.
I can follow up with people, okay, So I think we can just close the voting We could just declare who is the first vice chair and we and the exact the exact results will come later with the minute Thank you baby.
You, know yes, captain the t, detective I want to thank the the residents of the 4- 9, the community whole establishment for the support behind the fortnite priesthood.
I know a lot of people reading different things in the newspapers, so I want to put things into perspective for everyone.
Anyone on the board or anyone in the community wants to you, know, coordinate with us to do stuff donations or anything on the the NYPD 49 precinct.
We're, going to have an executive board meeting later on next week to discuss a proposed bylaw change about the equity, Let's, see a treasures report bronco.
There are a couple answers or increases that we did not get answers on, but once I do receive those answers, I'll be sending out a finalized one to Jeremy and he'll, distribute it to email, okay, Secretary's report, June minutes, were, I think, uploaded.
All right, a second in Germany, okay, so Hazel made a motion, approve the June 2020 full board meeting Unless, there's anything else, district managers report.
Anybody wants to committee chairs when we do your agendas, Blonde Avenue, Homeless Shelter.
There was a news article that told everybody that there was a second homeless shelter going on Blondell Ave. There's a motion on the on the agenda regarding the original proposal.
It's, just I plan on going to that meeting, because I want to talk about some personal issues that have come up over the summer.
Unless anybody else needs to hear more from me, please do not, let's save it, for offline and move over to committee reports, the motions we have to vote.
They are to rename the nominating committee to the nomination nominating an elections committee to require board officer candidates to provide a written or oral statement to the community board at least 72 hours prior to each election, stating why they are seeking the position and third to allow nominees for board officer positions to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or May meeting.
That brings us to the third change, which is to allow nominees for board officer position to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or may meeting just to give a two sentence.
If there's like a circumstance that does not allow someone to attend a particular meeting, I mean we were in the middle of a pandemic, this year, so those are very legitimate excuses or whatever is going on in a person's life.
It's officer positions to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or may full board meeting.
May and June that we had this discussion, whether or not we could change the elections to a different month We really can't because the bylaws have it locked in there so to allow people to accept in earlier months, really or later months does not really work out, because the elections are fixed in June, which is one thing exactly so that that's why it's written that way, so it does say or in person.
So you can't say we have no way to go because we're in a comfortable home, because I'm very tired, right, now, all right that that's you But I do not see the need to off- board the members of the community who are in this meeting now when the rest of us can stick around till the end and have this discussion you and your prior commitments, you know.
Yes, all right, I'm, going to move off the agenda and until somebody makes a motion we got other motions to vote on, for example, health and social services, which I think is your committee Sandy.
We just had the meeting with the various people right about the shelter and whatever We met with some politicians and whatever to discuss the homeless, shelter We made a motion to send written correspondence to the city and others, like our elected officials, can share.
There won't be as hopefully something zone goes haywire with life all right, but the idea is we have we met You know that it with this shelter, that's supposedly going to come to Blondell Ave Avenue.
We would drive it not that we would rather have senior housing or a combination of senior or affordable or if we have to have a homeless shelter that it be for families not for just homeless men and this when conjunction with Community Board 10, because the area literally is in both districts or near both districts.
Well, I, still question: If a homeless shelter is being proposed for our community that currently houses zero, Why is like.
There's, one open near my high school a few years ago and in their own, like Married Avenue area and everyone as opposed, was opposed to it, and people moved out.
I mean I just want a counter to say that a lot of the areas that have pre- existing shelters, for example, like Community, Board, six and seven, have quite a lot of homeless.
You know problems for small businesses issues when it comes to just quality of life and safety in those communities, and I.
Discussion, corresponds to the city of New, York or elected officials, and Committee Board 10, asking for the proposed and only homeless, shelter on Blonde Avenue, be instead converted to number one senior housing, accommodation for housing.
You just repeat what exactly we're voting on, because everyone's cutting in and out Motion is to send to the city of New York elected officials and Committee Board 10, asking for the proposed men only homeless, shelter on blind avenue, be instead converted to senior citizen, housing, combination of senior citizen and affordable housing, affordable or a homeless shelter with the families.
Okay, I'm just going to use this elections ballot thing that I was doing name for the motion against or abstain, Jeremy, quick question for you, If I, if I want it the letter to be written, a different way, well just abstain from it, because if to me, if you move homeless, shelter for families to number one, I, like that better.
Yes, you could put homeless shelters for families as number one Okay, thanks or a combination of all the other thing is or a combination of you know the order you could, you could combine, say, affordable housing with some homeless shelters for families, so that could be done.
Because I have to leave pretty soon, but I was saying that someone said that there's a methadone clinic over there and to put up all men, shelter there with a methadone clinic We want to put seniors there to with the methadone clinic there, so I'm a little confused, because are we going against it because it's all men, because we can not judge people today, because all these noise we're hearing half of these people do not live in our community but they're still in our community.
Is it where you put the homeless shelter or where the people going to hang out?
I do not want to get political about this thing, but there's a lot of mental health issues that need to be addressed with male shelters, and I.
They're they're, not here, legally, there's a lot of issues that are going on there, but the emphasis is try to keep the family together and try to really make ends meet You know I grew up in the Bronx.
If they have a need for a home, a male homeless shelter, then maybe we need to look into it more before we say no, do not bring it here, because you have to understand, as he say, what's going on with mental illness and look at the streets that we're living in and watch.
Two years ago, we were warned that we were going to get homeless shelters in the community, which is not a bad thing.
They did not want it in their community and at that time I believe Mark told us that you know.
We do have a nightclub building on Boston Road, so we do have senior housing You know a lot of people have been out of work since March and even though there is a moratorium on evictions right now, it's set to expire on October 1st, because it's not extended.
I. Do not think the senior housing is going to work because we already have that, and I really truly feel that homeless.
That's, the type of shelter that is operating on Jerome Avenue, so I do not know if oral anybody else would want to respond to that, but they are looking to be a full service.
I. Think everybody can agree that we want to make sure that these people, if they come to the you- know the homeless population comes to this area.
Let's vote on the motion and move on And then we'll work on whatever, but the city's going to do what they want.
Only homeless, shelter, I mean for some people.
Sylvia did email with me how he wanted to vote, but I do not know if he was in the media at the time of roll call.
So I will formally on the record, object to you, going to the executive session on addressing my complaint towards this unnamed community board member now.
Again, I know it's a long night for everybody, but thank you for your dedication to the board and working for your community.
The address is a phone store, I'll be with the councilman king on Saturday at an event, right, acrosss, the street As for the homeless, shelter on proposal on Blondell Ave, Avenue, westchester, Avenue and Community Board I asked the mayor why he was pushing adult men and women homeless, shelters over family homeless, shelters.
Please let our office know And, we'll try our best to get you guys in contact with the appropriate people.
So before we even call for the motion, I believe it's best to go into executive session since we're discussing personal matters of a community board that might lead to possible discipline.
I, think it's something that every board member should be accountable, for we have the annual training, which is the ethics course that everybody takes this One second jeremy is trying to get his Wi- fi back on.
I asked Jeremy the same question and he said that we had to stick with this one, because I work for the city, And I think they do not use that you can have people anywhere.
, so I do not know what my ability is to kick people out, because that's what this comes down to It does not look like it's coming back up.
That includes community boards because we're a public body, but we may close portions of the meeting by going into executive session and the subjects that may be discussed in closed meetings are what Yahei, what yahei said.
Any member of the public I wishes to rejoin, I'm, not sure when the meeting will come back online, but I do not know.
