I, guess to anyone who either once who wants to make another nation I'd like to make a nomination, says: joanne rubino for a first vice chair, Are there any other Actually before I do open it up.
But if anyone has any questions, I'll take questions, ethics committee I mean he spends a lot of time outside of our scheduled meetings, with the work that he does like to make sure that he gives his all.
You know just having a meeting tonight nominating a person, I, don't know how it was sent out, but I always thought that you know people would be aware.
Excuse me that may help that may help jeremy Okay , bear with me all right, I'm, going to read off names of votes.
What's, that noise What's happened, jeremy, but he's voting fiat all righty, okay, joe I can follow up with people, okay, So I think we can just close the voting We could just declare who is the first vice chair and we and the exact the exact results will come later with the minute Thank you baby.
I know a lot of people reading different things in the newspapers, so I want to put things into perspective for everyone.
Anyone on the board or anyone in the community wants to you, know, coordinate with us to do stuff donations or anything on the the NYPD 49 precinct.
Thank, you guys for your work and the time and effort you put into this the executive board as soon as now that we have a new first, vice chair, we'll be having our leadership meetings.
We're, going to have an executive board meeting later on next week to discuss a proposed bylaw change about the equity comm police committee to discuss that and see.
All right, a second in germany, okay, so hazel made a motion, approve the June 2020 full board meeting Unless, there's anything else, district managers report, so I just got an email from the city that it was finally uploaded.
Anybody wants to committee chairs when we do your agendas, blonde avenue, homeless, shelter.
There was a news article that told everybody that there was a second homeless shelter going on blondel.
It's, just I plan on going to that meeting, because I want to talk about some personal issues that have come up over the summer.
Let's save it for offline and move over to committee reports, the motions we have to vote, on.
They are to rename the nominating committee to the nomination nominating an elections committee to require board officer candidates to provide a written or oral statement to the community board at least 72 hours prior to each election, stating why they are seeking the position and third to allow nominees for board officer positions to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or may meeting.
That brings us to the third change, which is to allow nominees for board officer position to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or may meeting just to give a two sentence.
Is there then vote for the opponent if you feel like he's, not there, but we shouldn't require it So joanne when joanne said it was definitely two people.
If there's like a circumstance that doesn't allow someone to attend a particular meeting, I mean we were in the middle of a pandemic, this year, so those are very legitimate excuses or whatever is going on in a person's life.
It's, the same promotion, it's officer positions to accept the nomination in writing within 10 working days of the nomination or in person at the April or may full board meeting.
So to allow people to accept in earlier months, really or later months doesn't really work out, because the elections are fixed in June, which is one thing exactly so that that's why it's written that way, so it does say or in person it says either in writing within 10 days or in person.
Anybody want to vote against this motion or to abstain, hearing?
So you can't say we have no way to go because we're in a comfortable home, because I'm very tired right now, all right that that's you I , think that's okay, but I don't see the need to off-board the members of the community who are in this meeting now when the rest of us can stick around till the end and have this discussion you and your prior commitments, you know.
: Why don't we take some time and move this meeting along a little quicker and maybe we can get everything in and people can go to sleep on mute if you're trying to say something, jeremy, I'd like to just say something to christian.
Yes, all right, I'm, gonna, move off the agenda and until somebody makes a motion we got other motions to vote on, for example, health and social services, which I think is your committee sandy.
We just had the meeting with the various people right about the shelter and whatever In august we met with some politicians and whatever to discuss the homeless, shelter We made a motion to send written correspondence to the city and others, like our elected officials.
There won't be as hopefully something zone goes haywire with life all right, but the idea is we have we met You know that it with this shelter, that's supposedly going to come to blondel avenue.
We would drive it not that we would rather have senior housing or a combination of senior or affordable or if we have to have a homeless shelter that it be for families not for just homeless men and this when conjunction with community board 10, because the area literally is in both districts or near both districts.
Well, I, still question: If a homeless shelter is being proposed for our community that currently houses zero, Why is like.
There's, one open near my high school a few years ago and in their own like married avenue area and everyone as opposed, was opposed to it, and people moved out.
I mean I, just want a counter to say that a lot of the areas that have pre-existing shelters, for example, like community board, six and seven, have quite a lot of homeless.
You know problems for small businesses issues when it comes to just quality of life and safety in those communities, and I.
Discussion, corresponds to the city of new york or elected officials and committee board, 10, asking for the proposed and only homeless, shelter on blonde avenue, be instead converted to number one senior housing, accommodation for housing.
Motion is to send to the city of new york, elected officials and committee board 10, asking for the proposed men only homeless, shelter on blind avenue, be instead converted to senior citizen, housing, combination of senior citizen and affordable housing, affordable or a homeless shelter with the families.
The letter to be written a different way, well just abstain from it, because if to me, if you move homeless, shelter for families to number one, I like that better, but oral, can I talk?
Yes, you could put homeless shelters for families as number one Okay, thanks or a combination of all the other thing is or a combination of you know the order you could, you could combine, say, affordable housing with some homeless shelters for families, so that could be done.
Don't want to get political about this thing, but there's a lot of mental health issues that need to be addressed with male shelters, and I.
Legally, there's a lot of issues that are going on there, but the emphasis is try to keep the family together and try to really make ends meet You know: I grew up in the Bronx.
Life is, and I think that the government in new york city really have more addressing mental health issues with men, especially males, I have to see what type of shelter is shelter.
If they have a need for a home, a male homeless shelter, then maybe we need to look into it more before we say: no, don't bring it here, because you have to understand, as he say, what's going on with mental illness and look at the streets that we're living in and watch.
Two years ago we were warned that we were going to get homeless shelters in the community, which is not a bad thing.
They didn't want it in their community and at that time I believe mark told us that you know.
So we do have senior housing You know a lot of people have been out of work since March and even though there is a moratorium on evictions right now, it's set to expire on October 1st, because it's not extended.
As a matter of fact, right now, I've been helping several men in Manhattan and Harlem and Queens, and it's horrible how men are being taken advantage, of, Because if they don't have an advocate which I'm advocating, it's a sin, how people are going through all these issues with their apartments, with these landlords, with just getting the appropriate size apartment that they put their they They give it to somebody else who they claim that they want to give it to, because a single man that has nothing to do with him not being able to get a one-bedroom apartment that he should be getting to accommodate his needs.
What they're proposing here, that's the type of shelter that is operating on jerome avenue, so I, don't know if oral anybody else would want to respond to that, but they are looking to be a full service.
I. Think everybody can agree that we want to make sure that these people, if they come to the you, know the homeless population comes to this area.
Let's vote on the motion and move on And then we'll work on whatever, but the city's going to do what they want.
People are tired of hearing that it's okay, Hopefully, okay, christian, is against valerie that promotion against their abstain, valerie, bab, okay, Yes in favor, April left, rabbi, hughes, right, no and gal nick When I said against, I was against a men's shelter.
It's a letter to have motion or okay Yes or four means you want something other than men's.
Sylvia, did email with me how he wanted to vote, but I don't know if he was in the media at the time of roll call.
Don't know why you're going into executive sessions when none of those eight subject areas applies to my complaint, so I will formally on the record, object to you, going to the executive session on addressing my complaint towards this unnamed community board member now.
Again, I know it's a long night for everybody, but thank you for your dedication to the board and working for your community.
Just want to let you know that the office is actually open.
As for the homeless, shelter on proposal on blondel, avenue, westchester avenue and community board nine had the same.
When cases come and just getting people to come to speak out on behalf of the crime, that's happening in their community and also like, I said, to bring awareness So The March against gun violence and the 52nd precinct actually takes place at 6.
Please let our office know And, we'll try our best to get you guys in contact with the appropriate people.
So before we even call for the motion, I believe it's best to go into executive session since we're discussing personal matters of a community board that might lead to possible discipline.
I asked jeremy, the same question and he said that we had to stick with this one, because I work for the city, And I, think they don't use that you can have people anywhere.
