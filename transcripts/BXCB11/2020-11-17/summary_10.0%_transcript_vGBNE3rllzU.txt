I'm recommending that all the chairs, when they start their committee meetings, they assign someone to take minutes just to take the load off of them.
It's not you for doing it for every leadership committee meeting anything on that from anybody, or does anyone want to say anything on that.
We didn't get a chance to vote on it because we didn't have enough of the committee in order to you know to be able to spread it out, but we did table it and.
I. Don't see why Harriet should have to do everybody's minutes, and you know, in addition to all the work that she has to do for the office.
So mine doesn't matter with me good for you, okay, so well, we'll move on we'll go to item number one in the agenda, which is the October leadership meet in minutes.
I usually take notes in my other committee meetings, but this one was a little different, so I didn't take the minutes.
So I, know someone raised the issue that every committee meeting.
You know we may have a motion from public safety, community development or ethics because they're meeting next week, but that aside I, don't think the other committees had any emotions am I wrong about that.
I invited a guest speaker Sean the same person that came yeah to my committee, meeting.
Okay, so because I think it's important that he make a presentation for the full board, so I'll reach out to him about speaking in the gallery.
So I, don't know if he can do that in two minutes and people are going to have a lot of questions because questions were brought up at the committee meeting.
But, if you know guest speakers usually come to committee meetings and not to a full board, meeting.
I, you know I thought he should make a presentation to the board, but it's okay.
Sorry came up at a parks meeting just from what I know so and historically hazel.
That high word order pass by law, proposals, attendance, treasurer's, report, secretary's, report, October minutes, which I emailed out my report committee reports, leadership motion to publish the conduct, mean statement that was voted on in October but was tabled.
Next is the draft December and January meetings calendar, so Jeremy.
So I got an email saying that all the boards city-wide meet in December, except hours.
10 also does not meet in December, I'm, not sure about the other boards.
The December meeting was the holiday party, but I don't know how official that was.
We have a full board meeting in December.
We should also have a leadership meeting in December to go over to make sure you like what we do now go over the agenda and then go over to the calendar for January.
Committees are one thing if they want to take December off, but if we're mandated to meet 10 times, with the exception of July and August, let's just meet the 10 times, and maybe because we have a lot to cover.
I mean I, think that chairman can call full board meeting any time.
I think it would just do it as a statement that we will be having a December meeting.
Unless, you know you have an agenda, that's because, unfortunately, some committees.
Unless you know you have an agenda and you need or want to have a meeting, fine equity is having a meeting.
You know you're going to have agenda items fine, but if you're not sure yet I would hold off okay.
So I might be out of the office for the next two weeks, but I will be working from home unless I mean I could use some time off, but maybe after the full board meeting, because there's a lot to do until then.
