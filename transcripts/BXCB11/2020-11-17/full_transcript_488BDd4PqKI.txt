So today is November 12th 2020 at 6:40 p.m. This is the executive board meeting of Community board 11. we do have a quorum. We have the Chairman Albert D'angelo Size Chairman Yahaya Bead, the Secretary Veronica Ufranozon and Hazel the Secretary. So we have everybody. That's currently on the executive board. That's on and I wanna. Sorry, I'm doing that now. I, because the way this new platform works is I, don't believe, I have a record of who's actually in the meeting unless I state it during the recording, whereas the other system I could go back in I could see who actually logged in okay. The first thing on our agenda is the the new review from the right from the border president's office. You want to speak on that Jeremy I yeah, you got you broke up on me. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that part. I said the audit, where they're ordering our minutes in our agenda- and you know you just want to you- know- fill us in on that- oh yeah. So no! This is what we were talking about briefly before I mean this will be in my report. I mean I sent out an email earlier today that the controls office is auditing. All 59 community boards regarding our minutes agendas and so related to item number one, the October meeting minutes for the Executive board. Nobody did them or volunteered to do them. I told how I could probably have an intern do them. I do have the recording I did get the city to publish the recording today, that was for the October executive board meeting but technic, but officially we still need written minutes regardless of having a recording online. It's not sufficient enough, so I don't think they want to volunteer to do minutes for this meeting. Is there anybody on the executive board that that I can write legibly and all we need basically is bullet points? We don't need big explanations, just bullet points. How about the secretary? Isn't that the secretary's duty I according to bylaws, I'm not sure it's her duty to do minutes for the executive board Meeting but Hazel. Would you be willing to yeah sorry I, don't have a problem? Okay, so just yet bullet points, you're, pretty good I! Think about that I did like your housing minutes. I did cut them down and sent them to you, but other than that I think you're, pretty good about being succinct. Okay, so do you want me to do that? You know what I really need from every what I really need from whoever is going to be responsible. I need one person from each committee executive board I need somebody responsible for, especially if you can't do something you know type of a paragraph, and it did ideally I want somebody that can so for October I'll. Have it at the end? Well, why don't we save that for leadership, because we'll talk about that, we have the committee, all the committee heads on leadership yeah. Well, let's just worry about tonight and Hazel will do tonight's minute, so, but what I want her to do is after we get the October ones to review and make sure they look okay to her. Oh okay, yeah long story, short I, won't I want that too. I want somebody responsible for actually looking at him and saying yeah. These are okay. So do you want me to start taking a minute now, I mean taking notes now, yeah, don't mind, I mean I can also put the recording online. So if you want to go back to look at the recording for whatever reason, okay, all right I forgot everything that was said before that this. So I'm sorry, so we just talked about. The first thing was the auditing of our minutes and our agenda. Okay, we need to be better everyone's going to order those audit- those things in our you know so. Yeah we'll mention that again at the leadership meeting, where you have the heads of all the committees there, so they can, they can talk to their their committee personnel. The next thing is the replacement of Don or not to replace Don Tom, as you know, resigned from as first second vice chair. We never had a position of second vice chair. We totally instilled that a number of years ago, I noticed there is a petition saying there's no reason to have a second vice chair and I'll. Just like to knock it around and see if what the people on the executive would feel to me, it doesn't matter whether we go with the five that we have or he had the other one. It really doesn't matter hazel, since you are taking the minutes. What do you think well, I signed up I signed the petition, so I know I. Remember when I was on the board. We didn't have that right. So it's to me you can eliminate it all right. So let me can I clarify for everybody, because Franno probably doesn't know what he's I don't think Fran is too may be aware of what or Veronica may I don't know. Are you know no idea what you guys are talking about? Okay, all right, let me see if I can, let's go down, explain it. A number of people said that since the second vice chair, really we you know, we have a first vice chair that in case of there's anything that needs to be done or I'm not there can take over. We didn't need the position of second vice chair. The number of people felt the same way and they signed a petition saying: do we really need a second vice chair? Can we bring it up to a vote and see if we can eliminate the position altogether and I have no problem either way, so I just want to run it by the the rest of the executive onesie. How you felt about it? Okay can I make a comment. Sure. Okay, wouldn't you need to amend our bylaws first, since the second chair exists at Kern before you do anything else, absolutely well, I! Think, first of all, if we decide to do away with the the position, then you're right we're done. We have to go through bylaws and make a by-law change before we do away with it. So let me just clarify everything. So it is a bylaw proposal and it was, but you wouldn't want to make the proposal before you have the executive order, decide whether we're going to have it or not, because if you make a proposal to do a change in the bylaws and the Executive Board says no we're going to keep second vice chair, then we're wasting time. So first, the executive order would have to decide whether you know for or against, and then we bring it up to the leadership and then to the general. You know general meeting and then, if they decide to do away with the position, then we have to go back and change the bylaws. So you know that's what again I know Hazel said she's for doing away with the position frano, you have a position on that yeah I think unless we change the bylaws I, wouldn't even say: do it or don't do it and also it's coming out of left field? For me, I'm wondering who signed it. How come not everybody in the board got to know in advance about this request. It seems like it's a sneak sneaky way of doing it. I'm sorry: well it's a good question because I you know, I saw the petition. I wasn't aware already either, which is fine and I have no problem with the petition I. Just you know it wasn't put out to the General general membership. It was just put out I guess it was started by a few people and they just decided to put it out there for everybody to see which is fine. So do you want me to make a point of order Al just to clarify good, so any bylaw proposal can be by any single board member, so it so I know it was suggested by one person to do a joint sign-on letter or something like that. So what I can bring up I can bring up what was sent. I could send it to you, franno, whatever you prefer yeah like our past bylaws, you know, Christian did the equity committee I think at some point he I don't think requested, sent to the entire board or we just I mean it just needs to be sent in writing to and that's what happened here. So it doesn't to my knowledge. It doesn't need to go to the entire board, but it would be nice. It is on the agenda for the full board meeting, okay, but Jeremy. My point is, and I'm sorry if people take offense to this, it seems like this was a sneaky way of doing it. Instead of send it to the whole board and say, are you willing to sign this petition yeah? But you can say that, but you could say that, but when Darrell made his proposal back in June, he didn't he just made it by himself. He didn't send it to the entire board and sent it out. So that's legally, that's all that's destroyed the decision. A decision hasn't been made. A decision was requested. I was requested for a change which again I have no objection to. If that's what the majority of people want right now, I just want to find out what our executive board feels then we'll bring it up before the leadership this evening and then before I have a question on the next Thursday who signed the petition. Is it just board members that signed a petition, yeah I, believe so yep, okay, yeah, I, didn't see it and Debbie says she didn't see it either. So I guess there's a few board members that didn't get a chance to sign it. I myself, don't have a issue with not having a second vice chair. That's fine I would have liked to see the petition too to Franco's point. I would have liked to have seen it first too, but as a decision I don't have it doesn't matter to me I, don't mind not having a second vice chair, I won't know just because of the way it was approached. Okay, yeah, it doesn't matter for me either. So whether it's one way or the other okay who did I miss Hazel, I, don't know Yuri did his. That's it right survey, all right, so we'll bring it up before the the leadership tonight. Yahei meant to the leadership committee and see how they feel about it. Then we'll put it out next Thursday as a recommendation or there's not a recommendation depending on what the executive Board feels I mean the way the leadership meet feels legally. You can't vote on it next week. Well, we can bring it up. We can bring it up to the full membership yeah legally, you have to bring it up to the full board. That's it! You don't vote on it. You can't legally vote on it. Well, we won't vote on it this this Thursday, but the following Thursday have to vote on it yeah it would be June January, but in other words, if the leadership committee puts it forward as a positive. In other words, the leadership committee goes along with it. Then you present it as the leadership committee suggests, and then let the board make their mind. They don't have to go along with the leadership committee, but they can at least they know what the yeah their chair, people feel yeah. Why can't we vote on it this month our bylaws say a proposal is made to the chairman must present the proposal, and then you have to vote on the following month, because remember this is our bylaws and we shouldn't make changes that quickly. They should actually be thought out. Well thought out before you make rapid what I mean look it. This may be not being issued, but if you want to make other changes it can you don't want to just change them quickly? This is our governing document outside of the city target and whatnot, and just you know, for the future, as your friend or brought out when something comes up. When somebody petition out you know which anybody has a right to do, it really should go before the whole board should get notification of it. This way, it doesn't look like something's being done behind closed doors, I mean I. Just hope, I mean it's not a big deal, because the vote's going to be by the entire board anyway. But you know it does seem like a few people got together and said: let's do away with the position which is I have no objection to as Veronica and Hazel both said, the position is not something that's necessary. I feel like, but I think that the way it was done, I agree with Frank. It seems that it was done. You know like through the back door and that shouldn't be yeah I mean somebody should maybe make a proposal that in our bylaws that after it's presented, writing to Al, maybe it needs to be given to the entire board electronically or whatever, that you know I think that's just common sense. I think that should be done. It's not our bylaws, though yeah, but you know it's common sense. I just want to send something: I saw the petition, I read it and I signed it. I didn't feel like I was doing anything sneaky because we were within our rights to make the proposal. So I kind of am offended that people are saying that it was like a sneaky thing to do. It really wasn't. We did it within our rights and you know if people feel like they were left out. I apologize for that I wasn't the one that generated it. I just signed it, so it was just a proposal. It wasn't a conspiracy, yeah, I'll, say: I. Remember you I think going forward Jeremy. If you do get a petition from a board member, because I know you sent it to me and Al and the rest of this. No, it went to Al directly as the first fight, so I want to make sure you saw it, but neither you or Al told me to send it to anyone else. Well, that's my fault in the future. Let's make sure that it doesn't. You know if it comes to me whenever it comes to me. It goes to everyone else, so I'll send it. I can send it right now, the entire board. That's fine! This way, they're aware of it before next week's, maybe anything else yeah. The next thing on my agenda is attention. The attendance review in January, where we review the attendance of on membership people that are missed meetings, one of the things that we have to stress is that people need to attend meetings, whether it be virtual in-person, whatever not only the General Board meetings, but also committee meetings. It's not fair for a committee to hold the meeting and no one shows up, and you don't have a forum and you're wasting everybody's time, we're on this board to serve the community. We serve the community by serving on on our different committees. I think it's impinging upon us to make sure that we're there we're supposed to be so. We do have a rule on the in our bylaws. It says if you miss five meetings, for whatever reason you come up before the board for for review, and if the review doesn't hold with the membership, then we will request it to be removed from the board. I think we have the whole truth of that. It doesn't make any sense to you know we have one member who's been sick and his death of his wife. So basically he's a ex-officio member, and that happens to be Benny preciosa. You know so we're carrying Vinnie. Only because of you know the situation in his life and eventually he will he will step down. But that's you know I he's going through a bad time. I don't want to be the one to pressure him into stepping down at this point, but then again, but that's up to you guys if you want me to do it, I will but I feel that you know he served this ward loyally for a number of years, the death of his wife, him being sick, knee replacements and things like that. So with Vinnie, you know I just at this point, just assume he's an ex-official member and leave it at that. But I think everybody else, who's healthy and you know, wants to be on this board- should be attending meetings. We're open for any comments from anybody. I honestly think five absences is a lot. Maybe you should bring it down to three. You know because five is okay. If you missed four, that's like half of our meetings already I feel like you've already hurt the community, whether it's intentional or not, you know and then I guess. If it does get brought up in front of the entire board, then that person can explain you know their case. Maybe we should look at it this way. Instead of allowing people to go up to four absences without having to explain themselves, especially I think those hurt the committees more than the General board, I think those five absences and Jeremy correct me if I'm wrong includes you know, includes the the meetings right. It doesn't matter right, it's exclusive, so in other words, that's sick, well, I find you're sick, but five times, you're, not sick by time. That was a problem proposal from last year and does that think that includes the committee meetings also doesn't Jeremy? If I'm not mistaken, I'm not sure I think we left committee out of it I. Think committee is it's still the old way where you have to have three in a row or five total unexcused, so yeah I mean look. The biggest thing is that we start putting people on notice and we I would so we should be looking at last year last year's attendance, but it with Covid-19 it. It's become really difficult. I've noticed so we had at one point: we had three. You were allowed as many excused absences as you wanted, but you had three unexcused absences and you were brought before the board I think we made that five in total, so whether you call in sick or you whatever it is, you're allowed five, and then, after that you know, it's Katie bar the door. I think we included committees in that too. Yes, I, don't remember to tell you the truth. I, don't remember I thought so, but I'm not sure I mean we'll have it together by January yeah, let's check out again I'll talk to David about the bylaws, see what he, what what's in the bylaws and what it states and then we'll go from there, but we do have to. We do have to tighten the reins on on absenteeism. That's not right! It's not fair to the members of the committee. It's not fair to the members of the community they're doing them an injustice by not showing up and the other thing and I just wanted to mention. You know we're going to bring that forward into the leadership committee. If you don't mind the fact about the somebody on there on each committee taking minutes, you know simple, nothing elaborate, just bullet points so that they can be out and they can be out in a couple of days. You know they're sent to the office. You also could the office can type them up and send them out. It makes it very easy and we don't have to worry about getting 18 million FOIL requests for for minutes, they're out there. You know in a couple of days all right, I have nothing if anybody has any new business or all business. I think our next meeting is up. It's 701, okay, yeah right on time, motion to adjourn. You got it motion to return. Okay. Second, one terrific see you in about a minute, in fact, don't go away, one second, what hazel I know who's. Second, no I didn't anyway, it's media 701 either way. Do we have to hang up from this one or is it a different yep? It's a different, signup yeah. All right then see you guys next time yeah. Maybe if I find a second sign up. Okay, let's see, let me know, can you send me the.
