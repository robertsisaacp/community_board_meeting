That was for the October executive board meeting but technic, but officially we still need written minutes, regardless of having a recording online.
I don't think they want to volunteer to do minutes for this meeting.
I according to bylaws, I'm, not sure it's her duty to do minutes for the executive board Meeting, but Hazel.
I need one person from each committee: executive, board.
Well- let's just worry about tonight and Hazel- will do tonight's minute, so, but what I want her to do is after we get the October ones to review and make sure they look.
The next thing is the replacement of Don or not to replace Don Tom, as you know, resigned from as first second vice chair.
We totally instilled that a number of years ago, I noticed there is a petition saying there's no reason to have a second vice chair.
A number of people said that since the second vice chair, really we you know.
The number of people felt the same way and they signed a petition saying: Do we really need a second vice chair.
The executive order, decide whether we're going to have it or not, because if you make a proposal to do a change in the bylaws and the Executive Board says no we're going to keep second vice chair, then we're wasting time.
It just board members that signed a petition.
I would have liked to have seen it first too, but as a decision I don't have it doesn't matter to me I, don't mind not having a second vice chair, I won't know just because of the way it was approached.
Depending on what the executive Board feels I mean the way the leadership meet feels legally.
You know it does seem like a few people got together and said: Let's do away with the position, which is I, have no objection.
We did it within our rights, and you know if people feel like they were left out.
You do get a petition from a board member, because I know you sent it to me and Al and the rest of this.
That, was a problem proposal from last year and does that think that includes the committee meetings.
