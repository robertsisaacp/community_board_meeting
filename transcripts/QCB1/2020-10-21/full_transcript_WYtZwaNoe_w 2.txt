Speaking or resorting to R6A, there are R6As mapped immediately west of the site and also a c42a, which is an R6A equivalent, provide the existing conditions at block. 701 here is the site where people of anezia is located and, as you can see, as you move east down the block, there are existing five and four- story, pre- war buildings that are existing non- complying buildings, additional existing conditions along the block front between 41st and 42Nd street, showing additional buildings that are built to four and five stories: here's some other site conditions and then moving into the lanny sections. We're requesting the board, review and vote on this evening. A zoning map amendment from the existing r5 and r5c12 zoning districts, Qnr 6A and R6A c12 zoning district, and also a zoning text amendment to designate the project area, a mandatory, inclusionary housing area. Here's a proposed project, so I do want to highlight that at the Community Board one landings Committee. We received a number of recommendations from board members to reduce the building height from eight stories to six stories. So the proposed rendering was presented to the to the landings Committee and also being presented here this evening, which shows a building that is, we believe, is more in with the development along 28th avenue. Additionally, the land Use Committee had asked us to change from mandatory inclusionary housing option 2 to mandatory inclusionary option, 1, which we were able to accommodate. So the proposed project will have 51 dwelling units, of which 13 approximately 13 will be mandatory, inclusionary housing units pursuant to option one additionally will be a new home for piccolo venezia, as Chris stated earlier, six thousand nine hundred twenty square foot space for Piccola, and we will also have 66 parking spaces that will be located at the surface and the majority will be located below grade. The Community Board had expressed their concerns at a previous meeting about traffic conditions within this block and the surrounding area, and we heard those concerns and provided more parking than what is required here so that we can accommodate the additional overflow on in the evenings and peak times when people of an exit venezia has their most patrons okay, revised site plan as well. Just to show you for context, we also made change of unit distribution at the committee's request for more two- bedroom units. We significantly reduce the number of studio units and increase the number of one- bedroom units. As you see here, and then here is the proposed affordability mix for the project, which will comply with MIH option one there will be units at forty percent, sixty percent and eighty percent amino who's going back. So that concludes our presentation. If there are any questions, we're available to answer them and thank you for the opportunity to present this project, we're really excited about the redevelopment of the people of Venezuela, hello, everyone. I just wanted to disclose that I can not vote on any land use issues that go through euler, because I work for the City Council and my boss sits at the Zoning Committee who made that statement. Please this is me DOT Chahanski. I can. I just ask you to repost those inclusionary housing stats of the apartment jacqueline. Did you hear Mr stiller's request to post the inclusionary numbers again? Can you hear me jacqueline sorry we're just having an issue with it's easy? Yes, I can do it. No. I can do that. One second, thank you Dominic. Can you believe yourself now? Can you mute yourself now? Thank you yeah, so just to walk you through this chart. It's the MIH program requires a proportional mix between the market rate units and the affordable units. So we have. We have five studios within the project, so there's one studio that will be MIH and then 45 of the unit mix is one bedrooms and 45 is two bedrooms, so we have an equivalent numbers of one and two bedrooms at forty percent, sixty percent and eighty percent AMI, and that's because MIH option 1 requires a weighted average at 60 with 10 percent at 40 percent AMI and it's 10 of the residential floor area. Thank you, Jacqueline. Does that answer your question? Dominic? Yes, it does I'm waving here. Sorry, it does oh okay! Well, I can't see you because, okay, there you go. No, I was like do any. Can you mute yourself now? Thank you. Does anybody else have any board members have questions, and maybe I should turn it over to you right now. This is Daniel. I have a question. Okay, Jim go ahead, yeah. What is the AMI for this area? It is approximately 69 000. and that's based on our 2018 statistic. You know with the new census there will be new data on Astoria's numbers. Thank you, gentlemen. If there's any other boredom of I have a question. Okay, is there any money? Maria? I have a question who is appalling? Yes, I have a question on the parking spots that you have are any of them going to be for your customers, or is it only for the tenants, so we have 19 required residential parking spaces for the 51 dwelling units and then the rest. The 47 addition parking spaces are considered committed parking spaces that will be available for the restaurant during peak times and they'll also be available for residents if necessary, but they are not specifically for residential use and that's going to be operated and maintained by a third party consultant, and there will also be valet for the restaurant, on the weekends and in the evenings. That's because that was always the problem with pickle of the parking. It was always double park, cars all over. It was a busy area and a busy restaurant. So that was always an issue now, with the new tenants with departments there. Now it's going to be even more yeah difficult just to give you an idea and I'll, let Chris chime in as well right now, there's 22 parking spaces, so we're tripling the number of parking spaces provided for the restaurant new development. I have a question: can you hear me? Yes, how many of the parking spaces will be handicapped size, spaces and the other part of the question is for people who live in the building? Will they be able to go to their vehicles directly from the building or they have to go on the street and go around and like that? Okay, I'm going to just pass this question off to our architect. Natalie Hennessy, hello, everyone there's a the five percent is the requirement for the handicap accessibility. So we have two parking spaces for handicap, and one of them is for ambulances. So it's a much bigger spot and then to answer the other question is you're right. The entrance to the residential is right right around like within 10 feet of that of that concrete walk. That's there from the parking lot and if I were a person in a wheelchair, how would I navigate from that door to that parking lot? Everything is it's on grade, so it's level you just go on the there'll, be like a pedestrian ramp and then you can come around and go in because it's right at grade level at sidewalk level and this will be covered for if it's snowing or raining or something like that, there'll be a canopy. Yes, thank you. Okay, thank you. Are there any other board members who have a question or Elizabeth? Do you have a comment to make? I just have a question for the applicant. You sent out the recent revisions just this week and actually the end of last week and I'd like to know if you filed them with city planning, though we did not officially file them with city planning. Yet we just made the changes. We had distributed the letter to board one on Friday, but we will. We have informed them that we are changing the project and then we will be filing the required materials with them as well. Do you know when we can do it as early as this week I can coordinate with. I know how is on this call as well. Thank you. I have a question. George left, for you. Yes go ahead. How many seats the restaurant has it is going to have yeah Chris? Do you want to answer that? Okay, yes, it's going to have approximately 125 seats. It seems it seems to me that all the parking lots is going to be. There is going to use the restaurant right or wrong. No of the 66 spots at 19 are for the building and just as a point of reference, we have 200 seats right now and we are using. We have 22 spots available to us, so we're going down to 125 seats and basically tripling the parking capacity. Thank you. Thank you Maria. I have a question. Yes, so smoothie good to hear your voice by the way very good to be joining. Is the restaurant currently open with the 25 allowed proceeding, we will be reopening on Thursday very good. I will make a reservation. You can see our work in the background, fantastic restaurant, fantastic! Thank you. We miss everyone as any other boy, never have a question. Okay! Is there any member of the public who wishes to speak forward against this application? Okay, if I can interject, we have somebody from actually the block here, 42Nd Street that would like to speak on behalf of the of the project. Are they on the school? Yes right next to me now and please introduce yourself good evening, everyone and thank you for allowing me to speak tonight. My name is Natalie Dichiro and I have deep roots in Australia in the neighborhood, including the area immediately surrounding piccolo I've known the restaurant and its owners. Can you speak louder? Please? Okay, I've been, I have known the restaurant and its owners for many years as I've been on the block. Since I was a child, they are very good people who are truly a part of the Astoria neighborhood and the neighborhood would not be the same without them. Anyone who lives in Astoria knows of their name of their name and who they are and how much they care for the community. They care for their patrons their employees around the restaurant and the neighborhood. Some of us in the community want change and others do not. In my mind, this proposal takes care of both sides. The restaurant will remain in the neighborhood, which is very important to you with it will come a thoughtful design. Building with affordable apartments, including additional parking, will be good for those who live in the neighborhood and for those who are just coming by to enjoy the restaurant. I hope that the Community Board will support this great project of the small family- owned business of the district. By approving this plan, I thank you does not have their phone muted or their. Somebody is not muted comments. Can you figure out who that is, please no. Somebody has their phone and the computer on okay, someone has your phone okay, George! Let's see you and Elizabeth, can you yourself? I do not think it's you, but okay, I'm much better. Now! Thank you, Natalie. Is there any other member of the public who wishes to make a comment? Okay, hearing none! Thank you we're going to close this hearing and we will take a vote during the business section, the land Use Committee report. Thank you. Thank you all! Hey! Moving on your time. Thank you. Thank you. Elected officials. Do we have anyone who wants to make a statement Joe from Queensborough Hall, if I'm a chairwoman? Yes, of course, hi folks, hi florence good to see everyone, two very quick event notes. If I may veteran's day, the borough hall is having a virtual event and it will be on November 10th and I will send out a flyer to Florence and Marie as soon as I have all the details, but it will be virtual Bro, President Lee sends her regards and thanks all for their service and, lastly, voting October 24th early voting starts. We suggest strongly that if you early vote before you head out, you check more than likely your early voting poll place is not the same as your regular voting poll plates poll place. So if you did not get anything in the mail check online to see where you're allowed to early vote and anybody in a red zone which I do not believe is your area. But if there is a red zone where you live on the 22nd, if not tomorrow, they'll be reevaluating what area the red Zone. So, if you're polling places in a red zone, you could be moved, but I think we're going to be lifted. Do not hold me to that. We'll know either tomorrow or the 22nd from the governor and the mayor, but please make sure that you look up your polling place for early voting. Thank you. Thank you all be well hello. This is Deborah Harrington from. Is it okay? If I speak, go ahead, okay, good evening? Everyone! Hello. Excuse me sorry, hello! Yes, who was the first person who spoke? I did not hear who it was Joe from Queen Joe from bubble wall, okay and he said early voting in red zones and what else did he say, check your polling place before your early polling place before you head out, because it is probably not the same polling site that you go to on election day if you go early voting check? Okay, thank you! Okay! So those were the only topics. You talked about right, yes, ma'am, but I could not hear you okay, him me! Thank you! Thank you, hello. Okay, yes Deborah! It's deborah again, just a couple of things. The Queensbridge community garden has opened Sugar, Ray Marston had done a great job over there there's also a community fridge if anybody's interested it's at 10,003, 40th, Avenue, 4-, 0 and Queensbridge. Also, I want to give a shout out to evie for the Ravenswood community visioning that she worked on along with the rest of the housing committee. In addition, the council members celebrated the reopening of local community compost sites and food scrap drop off at the big reuse, Queensbridge compost site with composting caused by our budget. The council member believes that we must keep the programming going to guarantee a more sustainer and greener City. The council members joined transportation alternatives on the Queensboro bridge, calling for the south outer roadway to be converted into a dedicated pedestrian path. Opening up the northern roadway for Bicycles Council member has committed the funding. Please donate, please who's the Council Member Council member Van Gramer Bremer. Thank you. Thank you. A council member has committed the funding to make this happen along with council member Kalos, and our officers will be meeting with D.O.T. Commissioner, on the bridge next week that occurred on October 6th, they went for a walk acrosss, the bridge on both sides and the commissioner trottenberg sent over a couple of plans to the mayor's office, and we are waiting for him to pick one of the plans so that they can act on it. Libraries who is speaking, who is speaking Deborah Harrington from Councilmember Van Bramer's office, Debbie hi, okay, hi, okay. I think that's it. Thank you all right. Can I speak? Would it be my turn for Congresswoman Maloney? Yes, Sony, oh okay, anyway, thanks for having me here to just give a quick update and I'll start out by another shout out. Another shout out for evie who's been really helpful, bringing food to Queensbridge on fridays and to Ravenswood tomorrow, along with other people, who've been working with, like the farms to families program, Jonathan, Forgash who's been bringing it who's, part of Queens together to the means Bridge houses on fridays. So there's been tremendous work on meeting the needs of the community fantastic and anyway, Carolyn has been she's just back from Washington, but there she has been working on holding the pharmaceutical companies taking them to task over the prescription drugs, something of course that our administration said they would be doing and have not done so. She's been focusing on that she's also been working trying to get through, and you know I guess. Negotiations are still going on over an updated and probably smaller heroes act, but hopefully one that will actually include some money for New, York, State and New York City we're all. I guess we should not hold our breaths now, but let's keep our fingers crossed about that, because it's desperately needed. Also. Another thing: that's now I guess. Finally, totally over is the census that was cut short of where we're gone, I think means probably is not fully counted, even though the government may be telling us that it is the federal government but and Carolyn's job. There will be trying to make sure that what has been counted at least figures are not played with by the people who want to play with it, and I know that's going to be a case. That's coming before the Supreme Court. So there's a lot of stuff going on there so held a couple weeks ago, she held a conference on the waterfront in long island city about climate change, and this had to do with the report. A new report by the Congress, and it was particularly focused on economic and health impacts that climate change could have on the city and the state and, of course, it's very relevant to us as being a waterfront community along parts, certainly of the area of community boards. One and community boards too, and our your Richard Kazumi was part of that and spoke eloquently about everything he's been doing and, of course, so shout out to Richard and his organization, the old Astoria neighborhood association, which is a really good one and tomorrow they'll, be speaking of other waterfront events. There's going to be an unveiling of a mural which is being painted about newtown creek, it's on the side of the hunters, point community middle school and it's done it's supposed. I have not actually seen it yet and I do not know if it's finished, but there's going to be a press conference there and hopefully the congresswoman will be able to attend that that's at noon tomorrow at Center, Boulevard and Borden Avenue. Okay. So that's it thanks a lot and as always, if you need to go to Maloney.House.Gov for any updates or thank you Amy. Okay, thank you. Is there any other elected official of their representative, I'm with Congressman Ocasio- Cortez hi Daniel? How are you hello thanks for having me my name is Daniel Bontius, I'm the operations coordinator for Congresswoman Ocasio- cortez. Last week the congresswoman hosted a virtual town hall alongside Representative Earle Blumenauer, who represents Portland Oregon. The event was focused on environmental justice and housing justice and the unique challenges that both of our districts face. If you were not able to attend, you can watch the recording of the town hall on our facebook page at Rep. Aoc to stay up to date with future town halls and other events I'll share the newsletter sign. Ups in the chat for everybody, as Ernie mentioned, the house is currently out of session, but I do have some updates from last month before that happened. The congresswoman and Senate minority leader chuck Schumer urged FEMA to release federal funeral assistance to the families of Covid-19 victims. The representatives reached out to FEMA requesting this assistance in the spring and received no response. Since then, however, President Trump has authorized FEMA to use other needs, assistance for all the Covid-19 major disaster declarations through the lost wage assistance executive order. This presidential authorization would give FEMA the authority to provide disaster funeral assistance to New York state and any other state that requests it. So the members urged FEMA to utilize it and we'll keep you appraised. Apprised of any updates on that. In late, September congressional leaders reached out reached an agreement to fund the government through December 11th. The bill provides an additional eight billion dollars for nutrition benefits, extends waivers for the National School lunch program and the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children and extends ebt through September 2021.. The congresswoman voted against H.R 4447. This legislation would have prolonged our dependence on fossil fuels, while the legislation takes an important step to support environmental justice and renewable energy, it not only fails to address the climate crisis we face, but includes unacceptable giveaways to fossil fuel corporations. The congresswoman urged democratic leadership to remove troubling elements of this bill and put forth transformative legislation that fundamentally addresses the global climate crisis. Before the end of this Congress, like the green new deal and as Ernie mentioned, there's still negotiation for some version of the Heroes act. There was a lot of reports on that movement today. You know we do not have anything final right now we keep getting mixed word about whether we will be going back to Dc before the election or not. So frankly, you all know as much about that as I do. If you watch the news so and as Ernie mentioned, that the census is wrapped up, the congresswoman is dismayed with the actions of the trump administration to actively undermine the count. These actions were clear attempts to harm those in our country and our district that are routinely left behind by this administration, but our community stood up for each other and under extraordinarily difficult circumstances to ensure that the count was as thorough as possible. So I want to give a big thank you from the congresswoman in our whole office to everyone here who participated in census. Outreach. The reports from New York, City census, in how New York City did in comparison to other large cities around the country compared to 2010 overall, is really good. Considering the challenges we were up against. So thank you all for that. Our can. Our office continues to assist constituents with with casework, and while our staff are following social distancing guidelines and working from home, we continue to accept cases at our website ocasio-cortez.house.gov or over. The phone at 718- 662- 5970, provided an update to the City Planning Commission yesterday regarding the borough- based jails. The city asked the Cpc to amend the public place euler to change the date from December 31st 2026 August 31st 2027.. As the city dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic, there were delays related to procurement and engagement. The city remains committed to the project, including continued engagement with the communities. On this plan. The NYPD is undertaking a department- wide initiative that is aimed at transforming policing in New York City, we're asking folks to complete the reform and reinvention collaborative feedback survey. That's found at surveymonkey.com r reform collaborative as Joe and folks mentioning the deadline to request an absentee ballot is October 27th and early voting starts in four days from October 24th to November 1st the city's partnering, with curb to offer five dollars off for the first 5,000 people going out to vote for early voting who participate folks can download the curb app and use the early between October, 24th and November 1st and, lastly, we are encouraging all new yorkers to get a co- vigne, as well as a flu shot. Please go to nyc.gov covettest, find your nearest test site Nnyc.Gov flu to find sites near you where you can get a flu shot. Thank you, Jessica! Is there anyone else hi? This is Harris with Comptroller Stringer's office. Could I go yes, you may thank you so on October 14th I'll just report on one plan on October 14th, the comptroller's office released a plan called lifting up new yorkers. This plan addresses this recession. It was part of our economic analysis in the office regarding the recession that we're in right now and how it's different than other recessions, in that it's disproportionately affecting low weight jobs, and it's also accelerating long extending trends with digitization automation and E- Commerce. So the plan in short, asks that community colleges be tuition- free in New, York City. It calls for a universal expansion of CUNY asap at all community colleges and asap. If folks know it's a program that provides textbook vouchers. Transportation Md, like for in New York, City MTA cards and specialized advising to students at the community colleges. It also asks for Universal paid internships. We know from our studies that 20 of CUNY students get do an internship, and only 12 of them do a paid internship that automatically puts them way off tracks compared to the job market and other institutions where students are regularly engaging with Internships. It calls for creating a CUNY tech core to help small businesses adopt digital tools. It asks to align private industry and workforce training for the 21st century, focuses on apprenticeships and it's basically a 21st century Workforce development strategy to make sure that we come out of this crisis stronger. That plan is now available. It's it's been put out by the website. I'll share the link here in the chat too, and the comptroller's office developed this basically as a plan to address what we're going to see happen, which is thousands and thousands of new yorkers at risk, particularly folks that have already been marginalized with this Covid-19 crisis, but also before generational and systemic race. Thank you hands. If is there anyone else? I think so all right. Thank you. I'm cool for the emotion tip, I'm sorry, okay, Chad after 20 September 20 minutes. Can I get a motion. Please is everybody really? Could I get a motion again? Okay. Second, okay, thank you chance to report. Well, Joe, no Sereno and Jessica both beat me to it. I was going to do a report on voting based on the bubble board meeting last night, so I won't bore you with the details that they gave you. What I did find out, that I thought was great is: if you have friends and neighbors who have absentee ballots, you may collect it to them, just make sure they sign the envelope and date it and they can drop it off at secure ballot boxes that will be at every poll site. So this is a great way to get everybody out to vote. Who really can't leave the house and you can vote at the same time and do a neighbor a good job? That's my report. Thank you, violence! Simon! Do you have a report good evening, ladies and gentlemen, today I borrowed the borough cabinet meeting. We met with the mayor's office of media. We learned that the mayor's office of media now is also handling the hotel and the restaurant outdoor dining. They have assured us that they are going to reach out to us and they are going to either contact with us. We have questions regarding the outcome. They have also picked up. The responsibility for 25 and 95.1 radio during this time have been working with the film industry in order to maintain lower occupancy rates. Unlimited casting crew are allowed to work together. Thank you for your time and I wish you wonderful rest of the meeting. Thank you from our committee reports, Airport theory report good evening. Everyone yeah good evening, everyone just to caution.

The entities with which we've agreed to stipulations are marked the 114Th precinct, provided a report stating that there were no significant issues with any of the businesses on the list. In light of the 114Th precincts report, I'm going to move to vote to approve the applications and stipulations on the list with anyone. Second to motion. Second, thank you is it. Is anyone opposed to the approval? If there's no opposition, the motion is going to pass unanimously. All right. Thank you. Everyone stay safe and healthy. Thank you. Everybody, environmental protection, yeah. The only thing I wanted to say is that on October 9th we had a walk through of the dilapidated section on the promenade opposite of Astoria houses, where the playground is, and it was nice to see that there was a collective effort. A lot of people were interested. We had Miss koger there, vanessa Joe, Nasserino, Congressman, Convert, Congresswoman, Maloney Florence every we had a couple of community board members there as well, and so there is a big push to try to get this fast tracked. As you know, parks is going to start their process in repairing the sidewalk and the fence at the end of October the end of this month, but army Corps of engineers has been brought in they're all going to try to work together. Miss Congressman, Congresswoman Maloney had asked for a meeting to be put together in about a week or so, and all the players are going to get together and try to make sure that all of the points are addressed so that any of the weather type events that are to come will be addressed in any of these enhancements that are made to that area. So we'll keep you pro. We will keep you posted as to the progress on that have a great night. I would like to give a big shout out to antonella for all the work she's done on this project, so thank you, Antonella. Thank you Mary, but a lot and the rest of the group since you're up right now. I want to thank you personally as well as Kathleen and katie, if they're here and, of course, slarmons and congresswoman Maloney and Mrs. So thank you. Thank you Marie! Thank you: okay, health and Human services, Judy hi. So in September we had our meeting and the meeting was really to go over the capital and expense budget. Unfortunately, we did not have a quorum and we have not had a quorum for the last few meetings. So it's something I wanted to speak about. I do think that there were other people that were on the call that were interested in joining the the committee. So I'm leaving that to you, murray and Florence. I asked him to reach out to the office to join the committee, so we could have a quorum moving forward and we added some additional items on the capital on expense list. I'm going to end it with by saying please, as we go into this full season, please make sure you're getting your flu shot. It's very important right now to have a flu shot and that's my report. Thank you, Judy Okay, Land, Houston, Sony, Elizabeth or Jeffy. I think it's going to be Elizabeth yeah. Yes, it's in my lap this month, I'd like to granted. It was late, but I did send a report to the Community board. I hope you got a chance to read it, but I'll do a brief summary about this project and what transpired at the committee meeting the land Use Committee meeting. First of all, I want to apologize for misspelling on the report. It should be mix not miss. The finger did not work, so I wanted to let's see okay, so you meant you heard mentioned about the fact that aft the committee, the committee itself, had a little problem coming to an agreement. We had two motions that were not passed. I think the committee was very supportive of the concept of having a better restaurant and additional housing in the community, but was worried about the impact of the number of cars in the area with this with the restaurant and the amount of residents and also the size of the building, the height of the building in relationship to the existing community, the existing community is R5, which is a low- rise community. It's like three and four stories. Maximum the buildings in the immediate area surrounding the project are five, four five and six stories, but those are pre-, sixty buildings that were there before the R5 zoning became effective. So, yes, they are overbuilt for the R5 zone, but they were there, like probably around the 1940s 1930s were constructed. In light of that the community, the committee finally came to an agreement on a conditional approval which it to recommend Commission conditional approval to the Community Board and based on the condition that first, the maximum building height would be no higher than six stories and, secondly, that the income levels for the affordable units would come under the jurisdiction of option one so that it would make come. It would allow a a lower affordability ban for the income for the applicants for the apartments. So with that, I will if there are any questions or clarifications that any board members have. I can. I can do that now before I ask I ask for a motion for vote free, yes, sudhi. It's time I have to disclose that my wife works for aikman, so I am not able to vote yes, I thank you. Thank you. Tom Voody, Yes and Donald Clarification parking and parking will be only for the use of the restaurant independence. No for a rental parking for that which is not going to the restaurant is not residential someone that wanted to make sure that's what it would be well. We do not have a motion on the floor yet rudy, so if you want to amend it or edit, you can do it at that time, but the committee did vote. One of the motions that failed was a recommendation that the parking in excess of, what's required by zoning, be used only for the restaurant. That motion failed to pass in committee. So are there any other questions? Okay, so I will ask for a motion based on the this is Amy Howe I'll motion to approve the conditional approval. This is Roseanne. I second the motion. Thank you. The motion is on the floor for discussion. Anybody have a comment now. Well there being no comment. Can we have it? This is a real cult mode. It is a euler item. Florence I do not have a list of borders. Amy Howe will be doing the volkswagen. Shall I start now. Let me restate the motion. Okay. The motion on the floor for vote right now is that recommendation approve conditionally conditions include maximum building height no higher than six stories and that the income level for the affordable units come under the MIH option. One Amy are we ready yeah? Yes, thank you. Roseanne Alvarez, yes, George Alexiou, yes, Danielle Alberti, yes, Lauren, Amore, Zappson, Andy, yes, Angela, Ed, Weber's, not here, louise portly, yes and bruno one was here earlier and okay Jerry Caliando.

Currently, review at Socrates is monuments, and if you have not gone, it's great check it out recent news that their executive director is stepping down and there's no news yet on who will be replacing him. So we just want to thank John Hatfield for his work over the past almost decade, this Saturday October 24th at the sitting area on Hoyt Avenue and 21St Street Astoria urban agricultural alliance. If you are not talking, can you please mute yourself? I see here's some heavy breathing happening the Astoria urban agriculture alliance Astoria. My name is Katie Allman, I'm the co- chair of the Parks Committee and if you're do not have a question, can you please mute yourself, so we can keep it moving. I just wanted to announce this event, because this group is looking to convert the sitting area on 21St, Street and Hoyt Avenue north into an public garden and they're working with the Parks Department and green thumb to do that. So, if you are in the neighborhood in around this saturday, the 24th between 10:30 and 2 P.M, please go there. Astoria fridges and the story of food pantry are collecting items for donation and the connected chef will be. There also there'll, be a composting workshop and also information on growing edible plants. Lastly, at our committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, we had the parks Department present the much anticipated plans for the renovation of Rainey Park, which was made possible through funding from former borough President Katz, the City Council and from council member Van Bramer overwhelmingly the committee approved and appreciates and supports plans some items for everyone to know. The plan does not include renovations to the field house, which is in pretty bad shape or the waterfront espenod, the baseball diamond will be removed and the basketball court will be moved to the south end of the park and finally, there will be designated barbecue and picnic areas for the community use since Rainey Park is heavily used by people having family events and parties and barbecues. The playground, which is in terrible shape, as we all know, will be replaced by a toddler playground and a big kid playground. The committee supports these changes and I'm not sure if the plans were shared with the entire board, but I'm not exactly sure on the next steps for how that works, Marie and Florence. If you can shed some light on that, all right, I'm sure they are coming back to the board at some point right, katie everyone, please mute. Like I'm hearing a lot of static. Okay, I think it's better. Now, okay, thank you. Katie, we'll follow up on that. Thank you, public safety and or Tony. I do not think Tony is here: okay, transportation, Bob, Piazza and rich Waxman. I think mitch is here hi. Last night we had a presentation from the New York City Department of Transportation detailing the expansion of CitiBike. This is apparently phase three of CitiBike and they have asked for our comments and input. As far as the placement of additional CitiBike racks around the community, they sent over a link today. I know Florence emailed it to me florence. If I could ask you to disseminate to the rest of the group, so everyone can put their two cents in as far as where we'd like to see a CitiBike rack appear in the neighborhood. Beyond that we, it was a fairly short meeting and we adjourned at a decent time. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, our youth is andre here. I do not think he's here: okay, we're going to move on to new business. We have the campaign expense, a report which you should have all received, and I hope you look them over in case. You wanted to make any changes. I excuse me who's speaking. Can you mute yourselves? Thank you which army is going to take over this part and to the Kaplan expense? Yes, hello. Everyone thanks, hello. Everyone. The capital expense report, is probably one of the most important functions of the community board. It lays a map for what our vision is for the community for the future it can. They can have both items that need immediate remediation and also conceptual stuff. I would like to see happen sometime in the future. There's been some items that have spent 20 years on this on this list and actually, after the 20 years, like long Island, City High school, they actually eventually were approved. So, if something here that you particularly think is important is on here, but you do not think it's maybe highly prioritized at this point understand that it will find its way up normally to become a more important item at some point. One thing to keep in mind this year because of the city budget. It may be difficult to get a lot of new items funded. I think that we are hoping this year that all the items that were listed as Cs or continued support do receive their already promised funding. I think that's one of our most important goals this year, so there are two different budgets. One is the expense budget and the other is the capital budget, as Maurice said. I hope that everybody had a chance to look it over and we'd like to thank also all the committee chairs and committee members that came up with the new items. I think it ran pretty well this year. So with that, does anybody have any suggestions that they'd like to make either changes or additional items on this list? I think they make a motion to accept the, as has now written. What can I have a question? Sorry, thank you. We just had added an item to monitor radiation from the cell towers. The 5 g cell towers and I know Florence got a really important letter from someone in our community where they posted a tower right in front of his house, and his two tenants are moving out because of or have moved out because of the 5 g pull right outside of his house and he's concerned about his his child and himself in the house with this constant radiation into his house. So I'd like to move that up they're starting to roll out 5 g poles. There are not any studies right now with the current 5 g. So if there's any way, we can move that up so that we can show that there's some priority. I would really appreciate it on behalf of these people that are being affected right now, which item is that now? That's on the expense list? Correct, yes, and thank you florence for putting that on there I'm looking for it now it was towards the bottom number 47 right. Thank you. Yes, everyone! Please would you like to make a motion to that effect? Yes, I would like to make a motion to move that item as far up as we can move it too. As far do you have any specific idea, though, as far as we would like it to, can you if you can come up with well, I guess we can leave it up to Florence, okay yeah, I mean as long as I mean if we can get some some support on it by a local Congress, P council people. That would be great. Whoever can jump on the bandwagon to provide funding would greatly be. It would greatly be appreciated. Well, I'm sorry Antonella! We should put it in the top. Ten. May I say anything. Thank you, okay. So what there's a motion on the floor to move item 47 richard? Yes, can't make a motion to number six. That program is not active in our district. It's you number six number! 47! Okay, that's fine! Thank you guys. Thank you, okay, okay, so there's a motion now to exchange item six for item 47. have them cross paths, so this is just a show of hands: correct Marie! Yes, it is there any other yeah. Well, I could ask on this particular item. Is there anybody against this? If there's nobody against it, then it would be considered unanimous and moved. So, let's go back to the original motion that was made to accept this as rhythm it was written, except for the emotion that was just passed again. Is there anybody against this broad network of local doctors and hospitals? Well, seeing nobody's against it, it would be carried, and we thank everybody for all the work this year that they did. Thank you everyone again, I'm going to ask everybody to mute themselves. Okay, up to the public session, we had two people correct me. If I'm more informant, which I'm going to tell Tom, I think Margaret Rodgers wants to speak Tom. Do you hear me? Yes, I'm asking Tom. If he hears me, oh okay and I do not see it, but please proceed. Margaret Vargas go ahead! Yeah! Yes, okay, hi everyone and thanks to Community Board one for giving me an opportunity just to make a couple of announcements from two. I think you know really great organizations, especially in the field of housing. One is from the justice for all coalition and very briefly, just want to say that next year, 2021 Stanley morse, who is the who is the organizer of justice for all, is going to be running for Queensborough president. So there'll be a lot more news about that. This is pretty early in that because it's for next year, but anyway, he's done huge amounts of works in housing, with NYCHA queensborough, Queensbridge, Ravenswood, etc. Also from them, they've really been working with people here from Cuba Queen Community Board, one on the gas outage at the Astoria houses. I mean this is really a horrible situation. People there have been living without gas for months and months, we've gotten giannaris, who has written a letter to russ the head of NYCHA to make some firm deadlines and promises that this will be resolved. If other organizations and elected officials would do that, it would be great. Maybe CB1 would want to consider it, but it's a horrible situation to be months without gas, one minute one minute: okay, thanks and then from the west, Queens Community land trust. We co- sponsored with community Board, one actually two visioning sessions at Ravenswood to discuss what Ravenswood residents would like to see happen with the department of sanitation building on 21st street yeah. We work closely with evie on that and also a lot of community board members were there at the last one, which I think was really good, because we got a committee of young people to work on and that's the first time at any of those meetings. I've seen that many young people who really made the presentations and put forth their ideas for what they'd like to see there. Thank you, thank you. Is there any other member of the public who wishes to speak Marie? Yes, I do not know. This is something that has been on already, but there's a raised hand. Okay, signal for somebody on seven one, eight, two, seven, eight, six, seven, eight! Six! Obviously do you have a public comment? Oh no, that was from before you can oh, I do not know how to put the hand back down Gotcha. Okay, thanks Daniel, okay, Florence! I think you told me there was someone else who had emailed. I apologize for asking you now. Yes, Madam chair, it's health first and the woman's name was Tamara. I do not know if she's on Tamara from health first Tamara from health first, are you here, mara? Okay? Maybe she left is there any other member of the public wish to speak? Okay, there is a number two seven, oh, that was Daniel Nancy Silverman. I I'm sorry Nelson Woodman Tom. Can you mount into the chat and look for the base chain because I'm seeing Nessie Silverman is next and then we have to see if there's a race hand? Okay, I only see most people are just have the name up. You did not see what I'm saying. Nancy Silverman has a raised hand. Can you see that okay? Can I see that no okay nancy dad okay to go ahead? Go ahead because he can't see it, but I do see it two minutes. Yeah. I got the two minutes and I have a clock on my computer. Please do not interrupt me every 30 seconds, hi everybody as a former community member, a community board member, but current community member. I am very interested in what goes on with the Community Board and what I am finding as a community member. What I have been hearing for years from other community members is that notices and information does not get out from this community board to the members of the public. So, for example, while I would like to attend some committee meetings, the only way I can do that to know as a community as a community member. The only way community members can know is, if there's a committee meeting is if they constantly monitor the website, because there is no notification, there is no email list. Despite being my asking to be added to an email list, when I, when I was no longer a board member, there is no, there is no notification of the public. So, for example, there was a transportation committee meeting last night that I did not know about. I would have liked to attend that there have been other meetings that I would like to attend. I do regularly and now I regularly check the website of the Community Board, but you know it only goes up a week in advance or so, and we are all busy. So if this community board is committed to the input and information and interrupting constantly of community members, if we are, if you are interested in having involvement of community members, this community board has a lot to do to and be inviting and to community members ten seconds to address your concern. I believe we are definitely working on that, but I really think correct me when I'm wrong. This is also going out on social media and we are we it's not going out on social media. There was no notice of I mean I could have missed it, but then, if I'm working and in addition to that, we are currently actively working on a mailing list. Okay and I think that community board members should be told how to behave towards members of the community, because that comment by Rosemary- I do not know if that was directed to me or somebody in her house, but do not know okay, it could be someone in the house. Thank you thanks. So much Tom you're welcome. Is there any other member of the public? Who would like to make a comment or let us know about something of concern. Yeah Maria, I see somebody named Maria. Zoyas Soyuz also asked just has a hand top yep well, okay, in a chat box sheet: okay, Maria Sawyers, Maria she's, not muted, she's, still on where's Zoe Z- O- I- s yeah. She said yes in the chat, but she can but she's in the chat. He said yes, but Maria's own to everyone. Yes, over, my mic is not working. Okay. Would you like to put your comments in the chat? Maria? If you can hear me, can you put your comment in the chat that there is one I have concerns regarding 31St Avenue open streets? Okay? Is it too much to ask you to type the mouse because your mic is not working? Where are you okay? If is that? Okay, my son is disabled and we are denied access over and over okay contact deod contacted DOT yoga teacher, very aggressive, Maria Zois, okay like why can we not compromise? Where is Ellis all right, Maria, I'm going to have Florence seven days a week flomets. Can we look into this tomorrow and contact eot? Maybe have you called the office about this? Marie I've been working with her okay, I've been working with them, okay, so we'll follow up with our DOT regarding what's permitted on an open street tomorrow. Thank you, Maria. Is there anyone nor the messages? I'm sorry, no other messages. Okay! Is there anybody else who would like to speak, whose Mic is working? No! Okay! Excuse me all right. Can you hear me? Yes, Max, yes hi. I do have a few comments. If I may have some have a moment. Go ahead, two minutes. So thank you, everybody to the members of Community Board one for the time to comment. So my name is Max Nazario. I'm a resident of Astoria, I'm a subway writer and I'm a cyclist, I'm speaking this evening to implore the members of Community Board Community Board, one to support the department of Transportation's proposed expansion of our district's CitiBike network. I understand that some opposition has been conveyed due to dot's proposal to place. The majority of the 32 proposed docks on the road bed rather than the sidewalk, thereby reclaiming and repurposing street parking for non- drivers. While these concerns about parking are not unfounded. I'm sure that my neighbors in Astoria will agree that in this time of social distancing, it is important for our district to prioritize forms of transportation that allow us that do not dirty our air that allow us to spread out and that do not threaten the physical safety of the majority of CB1 residents, who do not own private automobiles. Our sidewalks are already extremely narrow and overcrowded without additional, without additional space being taken up by CitiBike docks that are also on the sidewalk rather than the road bed. The lack of parking in CB1 is not the result of too little parking. It's the result of two minute cars. Thank you. Thank you thanks. Thank you any other member of the Public Judy. Do I see you have your hand up? No, oh, okay! No, there is an additional message from Maria Zois. Please take into consideration the accessibility of the disabled when installing CitiBikes. Thank you, Maria, we'll pass that concern on. Thank you. Is there any other member of the public who wishes to make a comment or issue a concern? Okay, so can I ask I'm sorry motion to adjourn? Yes, I was asking for a motion to adjourn. You read my mind Tom. I did second interaction. I just want to say thank you all for being here. I really appreciate it great turnout. Thank you good night, everyone good night, everybody. Thank you! Bye, good night, happy birthday Marie! I do not have birthdays anymore, going back.
