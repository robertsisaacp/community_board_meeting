Additionally, the land Use Committee had asked us to change from mandatory inclusionary housing option.
The Community Board had expressed their concerns at a previous meeting about traffic conditions within this block and the surrounding area, and we heard those concerns and provided more parking than what is required here so that we can accommodate the additional overflow on in the evenings and peak times when people of an exit venezia has their most patrons Okay, revised site plan as well.
I just wanted to disclose that I can not vote on any land use issues that go through euler, because I work for the City Council and my boss sits at the Zoning Committee who made that statement.
The 47 addition parking spaces are considered committed parking spaces that will be available for the restaurant during peak times and they'll also be available for residents if necessary, but they are not specifically for residential use and that's going to be operated and maintained by a third party consultant, and there will also be valet for the restaurant, on the weekends and in the evenings.
Building with affordable apartments, including additional parking, will be good for those who live in the neighborhood and for those who are just coming by to enjoy the restaurant.
I hope that the Community Board will support this great project of the small family- owned business of the district.
We will take a vote during the business section, the land, Use Committee report.
If you did not get anything in the mail check online, to see where you're allowed to early vote and anybody in a red zone which I do not believe is your area.
Also, I want to give a shout out to evie for the Ravenswood community visioning that she worked on along with the rest of the housing committee.
Libraries, who is speaking, who is speaking, Deborah Harrington from Councilmember Van Bramer's, office, Another shout out for evie who's been really helpful, bringing food to Queensbridge on fridays and to Ravenswood tomorrow, along with other people, who've, been working with, like the farms to families, program, Jonathan, Forgash who's been bringing it who's, part of Queens together to the means.
Trying to get through, and Negotiations are still going on over an updated and probably smaller heroes, act, but hopefully one that will actually include some money for New, York, State and New York City Finally, totally over is the census that was cut short of where we're gone, I think means probably is not fully counted.
A new report by the Congress, and it was particularly focused on economic and health impacts that climate change could have on the city and the state and, of course, it's very relevant to us as being a waterfront community along parts, certainly of the area of community boards.
Transportation Md, like for in New York, City MTA cards and specialized advising to students at the community.
I'll share the link here in the chat too, and the comptroller's office developed this basically as a plan to address what we're going to see happen, which is thousands and thousands of new yorkers at risk, particularly folks that have already been marginalized with this Covid-19 crisis, but also before generational and systemic race.
I was going to do a report on voting based on the bubble board.
In light of the 114Th precincts report, I'm, going to move to vote, to approve the applications and stipulations on the list with anyone.
I would like to give a big shout out to antonella for all the work she's done on this project, so thank you, Antonella.
I think the committee was very supportive of the concept of having a better restaurant and additional housing in the community, but was worried about the impact of the number of cars in the area.
It's time I have to disclose that my wife works for aikman, so I am not able to vote yes, I thank you.
No for a rental parking for that which is not going to the restaurant is not residential.
We just want to thank John Hatfield for his work over the past almost decade, this Saturday October 24th at the sitting area on Hoyt Avenue and 21St Street Astoria urban agricultural alliance.
I just wanted to announce this event, because this group is looking to convert the sitting area on 21St, Street and Hoyt Avenue north into an public garden and they're working with the Parks Department and green thumb to do that.
There will be designated barbecue and picnic areas for the community use since Rainey Park is heavily used by people having family events and parties and barbecues.
Thank also all the committee chairs and committee members that came up with the new items.
Also from them, they've really been working with people here from Cuba Queen Community Board, one on the gas outage at the Astoria houses.
We co- sponsored with community Board, one actually two visioning sessions at Ravenswood to discuss what Ravenswood residents would like to see happen with the department of sanitation building on 21st street We work closely with evie on that, and also a lot of community board members were there at the last one, which I think was really good, because we got a committee of young people to work on and that's the first time at any of those meetings.
So, for example, while I would like to attend some committee meetings, the only way I can do that to know as a community as a community member.
