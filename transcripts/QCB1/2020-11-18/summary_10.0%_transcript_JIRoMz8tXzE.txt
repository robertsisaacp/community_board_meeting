Thank you for having us welcome everyone to the November 17th meeting of Community board, one Queens.
Good, evening, Captain Jenkins, and welcome to community board one Queens and please feel free to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about what's going on in the 114.
You know, like I, said as an introduction happy to be here.
Of what side, Queens bridge and Ravenswood got to do some interesting work, there, a lot of work with the you know, the federal prosecutors, as well as our local state out of Queen's district attorney's office.
You know working with my partnership, my partners, community affairs, NCOS.
Listen to community concerns, quality of life overall conditions, and you know, formulate a plan to address these issues that I've seen.
Well, you know a lot of the biggest crime increase that I've seen since I've been here.
You know the body shops and the and the repair shops being that they have limited space when they want to work on vehicles and.
Someone will use that as an opportunity to jump in the car and drive off I attribute a lot of that also to the outsold outdoor dining, because people are trying to go into the restaurant or these 24 hour shops or a food truck, and you have the outdoor, dining tents or huts, which is giving them limited sight on their vehicle.
I. Believe I took a call from Jimmy Van Bramer councilman Van Bramer about less than seven days ago in regards to gatherings and the lights, and that issue was directed towards the housing development commander and whatever can whatever plan he has with where he places his vehicles or how what he does with the light.
I, think you know in terms of the agency's approach, but it's really traumatizing the children who are like nine and 10 years, old.
I left a message for you, the other day, but I know that department of transportation has reached out to the 114th many times and said we would get some new barricades because they've been damaged, they're falling, apart.
Any major gang activity issues in this community board at this time.
We did see an increase of like shootings, or what have you and just Sunday detectives came to each of our homes in front of in my building, I'm, asking about a shooting.
Is not where they're able to freely be able to get back into the community centers get back into different activities to keep them occupied, and we I remember before I'm sure you have heard this before Brian when he was in that unit about how we trying to rid a lot of young people from joining these games or any other variations of games, because sometimes they go outside communities and other games are influenced by each other.
We could get it on an open, forum, 100 right that the small minority does get a lot more attention and the overall good that does happen in the developments.
And, like you, said, a lot of the minority, get the majority of the press, and, unfortunately, there's Astoria.
And also, you know, start to spread that outside of Queensbridge into the other development, basically into the entire community.
Let's, not get this mistaken as it's only a housing issue like I said a lot of our crime is being driven off development with property, crimes.
You know it seems like crimes of opportunity, nothing that I can contribute to a gang, but.
But is there any way we can bring back some form of the community Council and the NCO meetings, because I think they're important.
My question: Can you speak about the impact of the significant influx of homeless people to our dutch hills neighborhood and how that's affected your metrics of crime.
I was muted thanks for your answer, so you've, given the facts on the increase in homeless, but I didn't really hear any increase in your like changing your procedures and also I'd, be curious to know which of those four hotels are the permanent ones, and thank you well.
Captain Jenkins, we I just have a final question that came in the chat, sure about advertising or letting the public know about the build the block meetings.
Moving, on public hearing item the New York Landmarks Preservation Commission approval to facilitate replacement of 11 windows on the West facade of the queen's father, clock tower I.
You know no garbage trucks on that street unless they're picking up garbage on the 20th, Avenue or they're plowing 20th.
It's going to be opportunity when Covid-19 is over, that you know whenever that is.
Is that you know housing, preservation, development, HPD committed to going through a community process, because, right, now, the western Queens community, land trust and the Ravenswood tenants have been holding meetings along with Community board, one on the future of that site.
This it'll be public use or 100, affordable housing on public land, and they have to work with the community to come up with a vision for what it is.
I think there's some concern also about 11105 and the lack of testing sites in the area, because the city Mg lines are blocks, long.
We know that there is going to be more contact, trace, testing and tracing in 1.05 they're working on that.
Thank you for all the help you gave along with Andrew or excuse me with Andres and Lisa Stone from the Ps 171 Claudia Kover for working on getting the four-way stop at 12Th, Street and Astoria Boulevard.
Rich is a borough president and Carolyn Maloney and Congresswoman were all there to support us and introduce themselves to the residents of the you know of this and hearing their concerns about how they're dealing with this issue, as well as being involved with this test and trace for Astoria and long island city of the project.
This is what a community is all about, right, we're in a pandemic, and we have this tragic incidence where the house, you know the buildings at a store of houses, has no heat and no cooking gas and community has come together and rallied around them.
We're meeting tonight to talk to you about one of the last phases of that work, which has to do with repairing and replacing the windows on this building.
Dutch kills park at the meeting of kind of Queens, Boulevard and Northern Boulevard, and the approach to the Queensborough Bridge there's some images of the building.
Here for Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who also wants to wish everybody well thanks for giving me this chance to update her activities a bit and wish everybody a safe and happy Thanksgiving.
We were all at that event, Sunday at Astoria houses and the problems at NYCHA, and especially there have been something that Carolyn has been trying to work: on.
You know 45 families that have been without gas for over 50 days now, and this is especially critical with how are they going to cook for Thanksgiving, and that's one of the reasons that and a shout out to Evie to all the work she's been doing getting them hot food on saturdays.
Thank you for all your prayers that you do all that you all send to the residents of Astoria houses, because we are dealing with tough times and also I wanted to mention about a thing that even com, communication.
Although our utilities are not separately paid, but it is included in our rent, so he's working on with NYCHA and other officials, or whoever else needs to be involved in these talks to see to it that those residents who are suffering and the story is suffering and not only the fact that we got so much construction going in and around us that it has become a hardship on our quality of life.
Yes, go ahead, sure, just very quick update for folks we're doing a survey, a city-wide survey on work and family as affected by.
Today we had the district service cabinet meeting for the Queensborough President's office, and today sanitation made a presentation regarding winter scheduling, a lot of the local homes and businesses in our area.
A lot of the restaurants in our district have made substantial financial input into these outdoor dining areas and D.O.T and sanitation want to work with them so that during they may not be the snow.
Yeah I want to wish you all a happy and a healthy thanksgiving and, as Marie said.
Wear, your mask, wash your hands and do everything you need to do, because when you honestly like I'm, not watching the show okay committee reports, community and economic development rod, thank you.
Good evening we had our third zoom meeting regarding the work at Astoria houses, esplanade.
We're actually going to have it right at Radial park right next door, and that is to kind of again call attention to the issue of the residents not having gas.
So, we'll let you know when that happens, but wishing everyone a good thanksgiving, oh and we will be actually frontline foods-- is going to be providing thanksgiving meals to any family within the building.
The members really didn't have very many questions, except clarifications about what was happening within the building itself and then the recommendation that they agreed upon that they voted unanimously was to recommend approval of the certificate of appropriateness for this work and for future window.
What we did not bring up was the fact that we need a letter of support from the board to share with the parks, Department.
The committee unanimously supports the plan, and the only thing we're going to ask for is for there to be consideration in this project and also in all future projects in our district and city-wide, for greater accessibility for those that, just for it to be more inclusive.
There will be designated grill stations, but in General Rainey Park, as everybody knows, is highly used by families and groups as a place to gather and hold events, including barbecuing, so to formalize that in a way there will be set picnic areas but understanding that people will not only use those areas.
That came up during the meeting and unfortunately the parks Department only held one official meeting, and there was a large group of dog owners that came and said that the way things are working right now is fine.
So I also know in my community visioning work that there was a big pool for a designated dork space, but because of off leash hours and a really big love from that from dog owners in the community.
There is a need for some kind of designated space for dogs, but it's not going to be at Rainey Park.
And I do also want to say that, in regards to the dogs at Rainey Park and in response to to Tarad, there was a lot of support to keep the off leash.
Just at Socrates Park in general, I know, they've been a lot more strict with dogs on leash in Socrates, so.
There has been a big dog issue at Socrates Park, but I think that they've gotten that under control.
They built it underneath the Triborough bridge, because many people wanted to keep the off leash hours in Astoria.
Policy, and I wanted to talk about New, York City, which has an obesity issue right now, where 22 of the population is obese.
I agree with the people who are having the problem with Crescent Street Bike Lane, because it comes all the way down into dutch kills and we're having a terrible problem.
We have a problem on 36Th Avenue that we've been trying to deal with where they moved the bikes onto the street and took the parking spaces away from in front of the businesses.
And I want to know who I need to talk to other than D.O.T to get this resolved.
I live around this area and every time I walk by or drive by, there's no one really in the streets at all.
If, my father who's, eight years old needs to go to the hospital, am I supposed to get out of the car and move a barricade when it's not even being used like we have an Astoria park, that's been remodeled.
We spend lots of money getting that park done so that people can be in the street, which is not even happening.
And I want to let you know that I will be a regular.
I can see the barricades every single day and sometimes now the problem is people will go there early at 7:45 and close the street for no reason.
I just wanted to say that I have been volunteering with the 31st Avenue, open streets, and it's been a really positive.
Probably one of the people who uses the open street, the most.
In terms of like the protection of the street, people are saying how it's an inconvenience.
Nobody is using 31st avenue when you know that so because the complaints are either one at a time for the rest of the community.
Please, because the complaints from people who are against the open street are saying two things: they're like one.
Anyone, else, okay, I, would like to get a motion to adjourn and just want to wish you a happy thanksgiving before we do that.
