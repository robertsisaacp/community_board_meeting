Yes, the it is handicap accessible pursuant to code were required to provide a lift, an ad, a lift which will allow anybody who needs that to have access to the pool, and will that Currently, by the landlord and as a part of that renovation, they will be providing a an ad, a accessible handicap ramp along 34th Street, which is a main entrance to the Swim, School and 88 bathrooms, and all the ADA requirements as if it was a new use, correct.
It is just so important for us to get the funds we need for education, but that's not why you had me on the call So I'm just going to say thank you for all the work that you are doing and please we are here, follow us on Queen, I have not seen you since you moved into your new office at home as it were, but I have not seen you correct.
So I try to work together to make it a better experience, and There are people who are having preliminary hearings right now, instead of grand juries.
You know the interesting thing about running many offices in my life and in my past life is that we actually saw this coming very early, So. We started realizing that grand jurors we're not showing up a lot earlier than a lot of people realized it.
Can only say this to you between me and between me and the borough, president and police and the Cure violence groups and the protesters we've been in contact a lot But I do know that when we had issues we were able to call up people straight away and say: what's going on out there, I can only tell you that it was much more safe.
Tonight, share our proposal for the Crescent Street protected bike, lanes.
It does include a protected bike, lane that runs north- South in Astoria, and so overall.
This plan calls for building out a connective network throughout all five boroughs to link neighborhoods together, and so we are here to make good on that commitment to bring a protected bike lane to Astoria.
That's the case, protected bike lanes can help to calm traffic, shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians and calm the turning vehicles with some of those painted markings that you see with the islands.
The pink lines are the shared lanes or sharrows, which are helpful for connecting different bicycle routes together and the dark green lines are the protected bike.
Our next step in building off the network is bringing a protected bike lane to the middle of the neighborhood and also building out some additional connections.
We started a workshop process in February on this year and we hosted this to gather feedback about the routes and designs and various destinations that people wanted to connect.
This workshop in February vast majority were residents of the district, and some of the themes that we heard from participants were an overwhelming support for a bike lane that connected the RFK and Queensborough bridge together this bridge to bridge connection specifically on Crescent Street.
There are a lot of questions about how this would work in front of their building and so we're continuing to meet with them and discuss how the design would function at their location.
We talked about two different design concepts for a north- south protected bike, Lane.
This map shows how a conventional bike route network and a protected lane along Crescent Street would fit together.
Those are simple bike lanes that do not change the travel lanes or the parking lanes just very straightforward, and this would complement a Crescent Street protected path.
So recently, D- O- T has been introducing temporary bicycle routes throughout different neighborhoods in the city to provide quick short- term transportation options for this time, when it's challenging for some people to travel by subway and bus when those options are limited and we do expect to see more people continuing to ride.
People are receiving, so bike lanes help facilitate those.
It involves either repurposing a parking lane or a travel lane into the to a bike lane, and so, as I mentioned so far, the barrel lane is in place between Queens Plaza North to 34th Avenue.
We use the additional travel lane on the east, side, that's repurposed into the bike lane and then the majority of the project is the green line on the map from 38th up to 34th Avenue, where the parking Lane has stripped it off from the curb in place of that.
So: the bike lane is separated from the travel lane by that what we call a floating parking lane and so to get into our standard proposal to the design following the temporary route.
The project route of Crescent Street is located in a vision, zero priority corridor, which means that it has a relatively higher rate of crashes involving pedestrians, and so this is a high crash corridor with nine people killed or severely injured over a five year.
Pedestrians, cyclists, people traveling in cars, and what you can see here is that people all different types of users are experiencing injuries along Crescent, Street and, as I mentioned earlier.
So the majority of our project proposal includes a parking protected bike lane and before we show this.
It's also an important It creates a new transportation connection at a really important time, as I mentioned earlier, that we expect to see a lot more people starting to ride as their main transportation.
So going through the different project segments will go back by block these sections are broken down based on the existing conditions of the street, so we're going to start at the southern end, And we'll work our way toward the north.
Many of you know a lot of times, people will use that third right turn lane to kind of jump ahead of the other cars.
This uses here is a painted buffer and flexible delineators to separate the vehicles from the bike lane and with the parking along.
The next segment is the largest portion of this project, and this is that parking protected, bike, Lane design we talked about earlier.
We did look at the traffic volumes and turning movements, and so at key locations where we saw that there is more traffic along this stretch, we're planning to introduce some right turn lanes, leading up to the intersections, as well as some rush hour regulations on the West side to alleviate places that have a little bit more traffic.
When we've installed protected bike lanes at unique locations such as hospitals, Health, centers, schools, hotels that have some different unloading and loading needs for passengers, we use special.
We provide a wide area where people can eggs with their vehicles in that tan So when a cyclist rides over it, they can feel several bumps and it alerts them that something is changing, ahead, that they need to pay attention.
So, when does redesigning the street to include the parking protected bike lane.
A lot of different sections and I just wanted to give you an overview of how our proposal actually really breaks down into two different design types for the bike: lane.
Where you know a vehicle could pull over to drop someone off without blocking the traveling, but without encroaching on a bike lane as well.
You know I've seen some of them on Second Avenue in Manhattan places like that, but I think that at this point, since bicycles are going to become such a large part of our transport community for the foreseeable future, I think we start.
We use in- house crews, it's part of our business as usual' expenses, but What we've really found and I think what New Yorkers really appreciate and what our city needs are safer streets and especially in the time of Covid-19, where some folks are still trying to figure out how they're going to get to school to their families to work.
South connection is going to provide a reliable, safer transportation option for the folks in Queens, and particularly in your community board.
The, there's a pop- up lane now for Crescent Street, which is intended to help us during Kovach, because biking has increased.
But it has given us a chance to see a lot of different, curb uses that we can accommodate and design interventions to include with the more standard proposal, so in some way, as we've been able to really test out the new layout as well.
I know there are a few people from our bike unit that are also tasked with going out once a week.
I, just said: unmute, okay, quick question that just came up with a committee meeting, especially you're, on the outer world way of Queen's Queensboro Bridge, what, Will vehicles and there are dozens of different vehicles- are actually authorized to ride.
You know sorry give way to two vehicles going straight: Can we educate the community so that everybody, so that interface of bicycles and automobiles and an interface of pedestrians, is more, is more managed and the role the rules?
What was what will be the best way for us to flag that to you in order for that to be repair, because you're definitely challenging, and sometimes you have to get out of the bike lane down to the traffic A number of potholes were just recently filled already on the route, and we are working to see whether there is surfacing Obviously alternate side.
I'm, not sure I have to double- check, but when that does get lifted like the mayor, did that a couple of weeks ago, just so that the Sanitation trucks could get in when we sent our crews out , we can't get to all of them like in the parking lane, or You know, people, as they were when meeting to the temporary bike.
Actually I just wanted to bring out to the larger group a couple of the smaller details we discussed on the transit committee meeting about this presentation, notably Helen I , believe brought up the kind of sewer grates that the bike lane will be running through which Are not too good for bicycles, and we also discussed the creation of a bicycle lens traffic signal at Queens Plaza to protect bicyclists as they make that right turn: acrosss.
You guys dressed the issue of people using wheelchairs, powered or manual travelling in the bike lane quite often which a users would rather ride in the street, because then they do not have to go, up, curbs and down curves and all those issues Obviously you know we do have a policy division and within that policy division we do have someone who specifically deals with people with disabilities and advises our urban planners and designers and engineers, etc.
I would be interested to see if someone in an electric wheelchair has ever been summonsed, because you know people need to have an accessible way to get from point A to point I'm, not the authority on that And I'm, going to have to take that back to legal I can consult with NYPD And that people with powered wheelchairs, where there is no bike lane on just a regular old- fashioned Road.
But if they're in a protected, bike, lane and bikes want to come behind them or whatever there's going to be a traffic jam in there.
Much of the city has a huge problem regarding vehicles, parking and bike lanes, putting cyclists at lists and lack of enforcement.
With this section, where we have one traveling, it is important to provide the ability for an emergency vehicle to pass through that bike lane and for sweeping and sanitation as well.
One thing that we are, including with this proposal, is there, are a few locations where we're updating some of the regulations on the West curb which can be used as a quick pull over spot for delivery instead of blocking a bike lane.
We have had seven emails, mostly in support of this bike, lane and I 'm, going to ask Amy and Richard to read them into the record.
His email says, please make a permanent protected bike lane on Crescent.
I am writing in support of the bike lanes being planned for Crescent Street between the Triborough and the Queensboro Bridge.
It would really help along the Crescent Street bike lane with all the supermarkets and such again.
Crescent Street is the ideal location, because it's the only direct route for people living north of 34th Avenue I'm, also hopeful that the addition of the bike lane will help slow traffic on the street, making it safer for pedestrians.
I. Do hope that the bike lane on Crescent is approved and no one is willing to cave into the where Will I Drive and where will I park.
Members I would like to say that the recent bike lane has been an absolute, absolutely terrific and welcome addition to Astoria.
Lastly, I would like to say that, with everything that is happening during Colvard, 19 I am looking for new ways to travel, to and from work while having to enter a crowded, subway I, generally love taking public transit, but will be limiting my commute in order to reduce the chances of coming into contact with the virus.
I would like to thank you for your work and helping implement this bike.
We currently have partial bike lanes on 29th and 28th streets allowing for bike travel to and from the Queensboro Bridge, but they are neither adequately maintained or protected when traffic increases drivers often take their road rage and careless habits out on law- abiding bicyclists I have seen it and suffered from it.
A protected bike lane on Crescent would increase safety and traffic flow for commuting, Astoria LIC cyclists tremendously and serve our community well, I'm, Scott, Phillips and last.
One I write to express my support for and encourage you to vote in favor of their proposed bike lanes over Crescent Street Astoria.
In addition to improving the safety of our community bike lanes will promote participation in physical activity and support.
They voted unanimously in support of the Question Street Bike Lane, with the stipulation the duty would accommodate any specific matters or issues raised by the Community Board office.
Having, said that, the Committee Board one area, Astoria, older storia, Woodside and parts of Long Island City- is currently yet 52.7%.
Also I wanted to let you know that we do have a self- response rate map that is available to the public by visiting the 2020 Census Gov, where you could look at your community.
My message to you is very simple: today, you understand your community are the people and their priorities and their needs, and you know how effectively deliver the senseless message to them in ways that Census Bureau can never cheat.
I wish you all great health and welcome to all of the new community board members I'm, looking forward to speaking with you all speaking with you all and working with you all much more closely.
You have all of you together here that I'm introducing of you, the good people that had been working for the community long time And it's my pleasure to be with you, and it has been excellent, that the thing that you've been doing the bike, land and I saw the board work on the ferry ride and all of those things that, when I'm being couple of meeting before so I'm very excited to work with all of you And we will together will make better storia and Queens.
Juliet and I have been a resident of a story for 44 long years, An active community leader in my Campina community in New York And I've, been attending your meetings in a story, a matter as an observer, and tonight is my first meeting with the community Board as an official member Very, big Irene from sending the generic office just trying to get in okay, hey guys, Irene.
They have to report to the community board when there's a transfer of ownership of more than 80 percent of the business here, there's going to be a hundred percent transfer of ownership to a completely new owner of the applicant entity, The business is not currently open from what we understand and the committee has been told by the new owner that it was actually closed.
You are committed to whatever power you think, being a Seabee member brings to board members who do the hard work of serving our community by ensuring fairness and transparency and who get to know the issues in the action.
The support of staff, requires a district manager who is competent and committed to allowing board members to do the work not getting in their way.
This kind of thing happen over and over again and within two months out of all my 57 years, I've never lost this amount of people Ever Thank you for all the work we have all done: together.
