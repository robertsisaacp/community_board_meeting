Please her pain, it's the district attorney on I'm cousin, Denise Vista, with Amato Law Group I, wasn't able to hear the chair for as well I'm with the law firm of Amato law group We're here tonight in connection with goldfish Swim School special permit application to the board of standards and appeals, they're seeking a special permit pursuant to section 73 36 for the Swim School to be located at 33, - 12 36th Avenue in Astoria Currently, the property is improved with a vacant two-story building that some of you may recall was formerly utilized as a nightclub The area surrounding the subject.
There is the drying area, the changing Hut's for the children to change after the lessons, and maybe if you just want to go to the photo, then so you get a better idea of what the swim school will look like these photos are taken or another, so I'm getting back to the swim school there's always lifeguards on duty, as you can imagine, that's very important, and if that I'll, just so There is a second one in Garden City on Long Island as well, and then there are two approved schools in the city, one in the Gowanus section.
We have a national crisis when it comes to equality across the country which I have joined in full force, and we are here today trying to reopen the district attorney's office and moving on So. My district attorney accounts on Facebook on Twitter You will see my speaking out on George Floyd on the police officers from Minneapolis on the equity that needs to enter our system and all the work that we are doing on it and I look forward to people actually viewing it and following the page that you can keep up-to-date We have 700 employees at the DA's office, 320 lawyers and the rest as support in various capacities.
and, if they're being held, you know for hearing or something like that, because we do know that right now the Kovach spread is very dangerous in places where people are held in close confinement You know the interesting thing about running many offices in my life and in my past life is that we actually saw this coming very early, so we started realizing that grand jurors we're not showing up a lot earlier than a lot of people realized it If. If they had to be processed at all or Manhattan, if they showed symptoms of Cobra, if they did not show symptoms of kovin, they were normally and processing on their own with social distancing and then transferred to Rikers.
Just so you know in Florence there will be someone at your community board from the DA's office every month, so we will now have a representative there to take back any constituent issues or anything that we can be helpful with, or even if you just need information on a case or something like that, we're happy to help within the purview of how we can it's cats at Queens da DOT, org Next up is project manager, I'm a project manager with the bicycle unit.
We're going to share some of the background on why we're proposing this route and some of the details on what the project looks like how it would work So. Over the last few years, we've seen a growing interest in cycling in Astoria and improving bike access throughout the area, starting in the summer 2017 We saw a lot of new people riding and in the first full summer of city bike being in place.
Protected bike lanes can help to calm traffic, shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians and calm the turning vehicles with some of those painted markings that you see with the islands This map shows the existing bicycle network in Astoria.
We talked about two different design concepts for a north-south protected bike lane First one is Crescent street number, one on the map linking the two bridges together.
People have been talking about it for quite a while, and it's widely supported by advocates as well as area elected officials This map shows how a conventional bike route network and a protected lane along Crescent Street would fit together So at the workshop.
So recently D-O-T has been introducing temporary bicycle routes throughout different neighborhoods in the city to provide quick, short-term transportation options for this time, when it's challenging for some people to travel by subway and bus when those options are limited and we do expect to see more people continuing to ride as this goes on, it allows for people to social distance.
The first block We use the additional travel lane on the east side, that's repurposed into the bike lane and then the majority of the project is the green line on the map from 38th up to 34th Avenue, where the parking Lane has stripped it off from the curb in place of that second travelling So. The bike lane is separated from the travel lane by that what we call a floating parking lane and so to get into our standard proposal to the design following the temporary route.
Pedestrians, cyclists, people traveling in cars, and what you can see here is that people all different types of users are experiencing injuries along Crescent Street and, as I mentioned earlier, these complete street redesigns really bring the ability about in the potential to reduce some scratch race We have the data to prove that these types of designs that we're proposing tonight and that we've installed previously over the years, how that trend of 15% injury reduction, so the majority of our project proposal includes a parking protected bike lane and before we show this These two photos generally shown that the parking projected bike lane includes a bike lane running along the curb this specifically as a two-way bike lane one in each direction.
So the proposed condition repurposes one traveling on the east, curb into the two-way bike lane, and then it combines the other lanes together into two So people can still turn right onto Queens, Plaza north.
People will use that third right turn lane to kind of jump ahead of the other cars, and then there are three lanes merging together into the intersection The next one between 41st Avenue to 40th Avenue currently has one travel lane and parking along the West curb So in order to provide some additional capacity and take off some of the pressure in case there are backups leading toward the bridge.
It's quite narrow for cyclists traveling in two directions, with the parking on both sides, so the proposed condition would mirror the image that you see on the lower right This uses here is a painted buffer and flexible delineators to separate the vehicles from the bike lane and with the parking along The. Other curb the flexible delineators here actually allow for emergency access for emergency vehicles if there is a need to pass them since there's only one traveling The next segment is the largest portion of this project, and this is that parking protected bike lane design we talked about earlier This is between 30th Avenue to 30th Avenue, where there are two travel lanes as well as parking on the east curb and the West curb the proposed design repurposes.
There's also an opportunity to realign the curbs and build out a curb extension to help clean up the intersection as well and improve some of the queuing between the bridge and the Green Bay impressive Street A lot of different sections and I just wanted to give you an overview of how our proposal actually really breaks down into two different design types for the bike: lane There's a parking protected bike.
Appe have a lot of room to enter and exit their driveways with all of our projects, There's an opportunity to improve crib access through visiting any curb regulations or meter updates There is interest we're always able to look into that as well as potential for loading zones and other tools, and generally, as I mentioned, we are adding some of the right turn lanes and some of the rush-hour lanes There's different places where the street opens up a little bit more than just the single travel lane, and so one of those examples is at these drive waves There's some extra flexibility, where you know a vehicle could pull over to drop someone off without blocking the traveling, but without encroaching on a bike lane as well.
You know I've seen some of them on Second Avenue in Manhattan places like that, but I think that at this point, since bicycles are going to become such a large part of our transport community for the foreseeable future, I think we start We need to start to build infrastructure that promotes safety not just on the streets, but also through the intersections and we've had a bicycle.
Well I'll have the traffic controls on second avenue One of the reasons why the bike lane is along the east side of Crescent Street is oh, that turns the left turns which would run across the path or actually a lot lighter, even on the other side of the street You know heavy conflicts in some of the ways that you would see on Second Avenue, for example, so this product doesn't include the separated phasing along the whole corridor Necessarily.
You know the budget of D-O-T They tend to be safer for all street users, especially for pedestrians You know the cost We use in-house crews, it's part of our business as usual' expenses, but what we've really found and I think what New Yorkers really appreciate and what our city needs are safer streets and especially in the time of kovat, where some folks are still trying to figure out how they're going to get to school to their families to work.
A north-south connection is going to provide a reliable, safer transportation option for the folks in Queens, and particularly in your community board there's a pop-up lane now for Crescent Street, which is intended to help us during Kovach, because biking has increased it's very obvious visually as you're driving as you're walking.
I know there are a few people from our bike unit that are also tasked with going out once a week, I just said, unmute, okay , quick question that just came up with a committee meeting, especially you're on the outer world way of Queen's Queensboro Bridge , What - will vehicles and there are dozens of different vehicles-- are actually authorized to ride in the bike lane The vehicle traffic law, you know, is obviously you know words on paper.
So I would request some education, maybe some signage that emphasizes that a vehicle whether it's got two wheels and it's a bike or it's a car You know sorry give way to two vehicles going straight: Can we educate the community so that everybody, so that interface of bicycles and automobiles and an interface of pedestrians, is more, is more managed and the role the rules?
We will, but just the other day, I was driving around the borough and I did see some outdoor advertising So I know that there are posters in several places throughout the city, so there is kind of that type of touch point with the general public Actually I just wanted to bring out to the larger group a couple of the smaller details we discussed on the transit committee meeting about this presentation, notably Helen I , believe brought up the kind of sewer grates that the bike lane will be running through which are not too good for bicycles, and we also discussed the creation of a bicycle lens traffic signal at Queens Plaza to protect bicyclists as they make that right turn across the two lanes of traffic toward the bridge, You guys dressed the issue of people using wheelchairs, powered or manual travelling in the bike lane quite often which a users would rather ride in the street?.
I would be interested to see if someone in an electric wheelchair has ever been summonsed, because you know people need to have an accessible way to get from point A to point and I'm gonna have to take that back to legal and that people with powered wheelchairs, where there is no bike lane on They are, in the right hand, lane a car would be able to go to the to the left lane and go around them, and there would be no problem But if they're in a protected bike, lane and bikes want to come behind them or whatever there's going to be a traffic jam in there and he says wheelchairs can use the bike lane using bikes, I'm Just, passing that on okay pleased to meet you the question from the public, if you don't mind, Commissioner or whoever.
It saves us from the unsafe routes that put us in danger and put drivers in impossible situations to Mora Let's, say this, one is from Gabriel Torres and he writes resident of the area for 28 years It would really help along the Crescent Street bike lane, with all the supermarkets and such again and I have one more from Jesse thistle who writes I'm writing to share my support for a two-way bike lane on Crescent Crescent Street is the ideal location, because it's the only direct route for people living north of 34th, Avenue I'm.
Okay, The first is from Jennifer chocolate party and as a longtime, Astoria resident mother and frequent bicyclist I'm excited to learn that a permanent Crescent Street two-way, protected bike lane is in the works, especially since the temporary one is an absolute deathtrap Prior to the current pandemic situation.
Members I would like to say that the recent bike lane has been an absolute, absolutely terrific and welcome addition to Astoria I've, never felt as safe as I have, while riding through a street and no longer have the anxiety of either checking over my shoulder for a speeding, car or concerned that someone would open their car door directly into me and push me too The moving traffic I've also visited local stores and restaurants, which I would have otherwise not visited because of the cars on Crescent Street and traditionally moved way too fast for comfort There are so many downsides to this bike lane, as it is not fully protected.
I would like to say that with everything that is happening during Colvard 19 I am looking for new ways to travel, to and from work while having to enter a crowded, subway I, generally love taking public transit, but will be limiting my commute in order to reduce the chances of coming into contact with the virus.
The next is from Scott Phillips, an avid cyclist who takes the opportunity to use his bike whenever weather permits, I strongly support the construction and maintenance of a permanent bike lane on Crescent Street We currently have partial bike lanes on 29th and 28th streets allowing for bike travel to and from the Queensboro Bridge, but they are neither adequately maintained or protected when traffic increases drivers often take their road rage and careless habits out on law-abiding bicyclists I have seen it and suffered from it several times.
Astoria LIC cyclists tremendously and serve our community well I'm, Scott, Phillips and last This is from our Assemblywoman Arabella Samantha's respected members of Queens Community Board One I write to express my support for and encourage you to vote in favor of their proposed bike lanes over Crescent Street Astoria The Transportation Committee has rightly expressed their support for this issue, and it is my hope that the board will do the same and approve this proposal.
Yes he crepitation committee had a farm They voted unanimously in support of the question street bike lane with the stipulation the duty would accommodate any specific matters or issues raised by the community board office in regards to the finalization of this plan.
Your state has to be six point, seven percent response rate New, York City, the five boroughs at fifteen 1.9 percent Queens currently has 51.9% Having said that the committee board, one area Astoria older storia, Woodside and parts of Long Island City- is currently yet 52.7%, so your district is certainly doing well for that matter.
You have all of you together here that I'm introducing of you, the good people that had been working for the community long time and it's my pleasure to be with you, and it has been excellent that the thing that you've been doing the bike, land and I saw the board work on the ferry ride and all of those things that, when I'm being couple of meeting before so I'm very excited to work with all of you and we will together, will make better storia and Queens.
An active community leader in my Campina community in New, York and I've, been attending your meetings in a story, a matter as an observer, and tonight is my first meeting with the community board as an official member, very big Irene from sending the generic office just trying to get in okay, hey guys, Irene, Yes, okay, I would for the boat ride on the Astoria that we have how we can make more effective, which committee I should join, and we can talk about it because you know I see I know that there has been two years that we have that.
You are committed to whatever power you think, being a Seabee member brings to board members who do the hard work of serving our community by ensuring fairness and transparency and who get to know the issues in the action Thank.
If we don't hear from them to just see how things are going just to check and see how people are handling their lives, I've been to try working along with others in the community You Evie, as well as with Queens, together with Jamie, trying to provide food and other materials about the Census and other, and even the coronavirus way they can get testing just making sure we check your wellness checks throughout the communities, just the story along on the city, and it's just that would be great, that we can all band together, sometimes just put away our differences of negativity and come to or something cuz This is bigger than what we are and we need each other to be there for one another, and this is very important because we all are suffering it doesn't matter, Just asking that everybody please ban together along with us as one because all of our lives matter and all of our quality of life matters, and if we don't make something occur.
