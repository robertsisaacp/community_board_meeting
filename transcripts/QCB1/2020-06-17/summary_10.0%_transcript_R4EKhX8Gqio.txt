Yes, the it is handicap accessible pursuant to code were required to provide a lift, an ad, a lift which will allow anybody who needs that to have access to the pool, and will that Currently, by the landlord and as a part of that renovation, they will be providing a an ad, a accessible handicap ramp along 34th Street, which is a main entrance to the Swim, School and 88 bathrooms, and all the ADA requirements as if it was a new use.
The only thing that happens, on-site every single day is arraignments and most of the executive staff and Chiefs are on site, but we do the arraignments on site because if anything goes wrong, we want to make sure that people's rights to an Iranian more than 24 hours are never violated.
Can you tell us what kind of social distancing and sanitation procedures are being used as they're processed You know for hearing or something like that, because we do know that right, now, the Kovach spread, is very dangerous in places where people are held in close confinement.
You know the interesting thing about running many offices in my life and in my past life is that we actually saw this coming very early, So. We started realizing that grand jurors we're not showing up a lot earlier than a lot of people realized it.
It, should take about 20 minutes I'd like to hold our questions until the end, we're going to share some of the background on why we're proposing this route and some of the details on what the project looks like how it would work.
We saw a lot of new people riding and in the first full summer of city bike being in place.
It does include a protected bike lane that runs north-south in Astoria, and so overall.
This plan calls for building out a connective network throughout all five boroughs to link neighborhoods together, and so we are here to make good on that commitment to bring a protected bike lane to Astoria.
Why, that's the case, protected bike lanes can help to calm traffic, shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians and calm the turning vehicles with some of those painted markings that you see with the islands.
The pink lines are the shared lanes or sharrows, which are helpful for connecting different bicycle routes together and the dark green lines are the protected bike.
Our next step in building off the network is bringing a protected bike lane to the middle of the neighborhood and also building out some additional connections.
We started a workshop process in February on this year and we hosted this to gather feedback about the routes and designs and various destinations that people wanted to connect.
This workshop in February, vast majority were residents of the district, and some of the themes that we heard from participants were an overwhelming support for a bike lane that connected the RFK and Queensborough bridge together this bridge to bridge connection specifically on Crescent Street.
There are a lot of questions about how this would work in front of their building and so we're continuing to meet with them and discuss how the design would function at their location.
We talked about two different design concepts for a north-south protected bike: lane.
This map shows how a conventional bike route network and a protected lane along Crescent Street would fit together.
Those are simple bike lanes that do not change the travel lanes or the parking lanes just very straightforward, and this would complement a Crescent Street protected path.
So recently, D-O-T has been introducing temporary bicycle routes throughout different neighborhoods in the city to provide quick, short-term transportation options for this time, when it's challenging for some people to travel by subway and bus when those options are limited and we do expect to see more people continuing to ride.
We use the additional travel lane on the east, side, that's repurposed into the bike lane and then the majority of the project is the green line on the map from 38th up to 34th Avenue, where the parking Lane has stripped it off from the curb in place of that second travelling.
The bike lane is separated from the travel lane by that what we call a floating parking lane and so to get into our standard proposal to the design following the temporary route.
The project route of Crescent Street is located in a vision, zero priority corridor, which means that it has a relatively higher rate of crashes involving pedestrians, and so this is a high crash corridor with nine people killed or severely injured.
The chart in grey shows the different user groups, pedestrians, cyclists, people traveling in cars, and what you can see here is that people all different types of users are experiencing injuries along Crescent, Street and, as I mentioned earlier.
So the majority of our project proposal includes a parking protected bike lane and before we show this.
It's also an important It creates a new transportation connection at a really important time, as I mentioned earlier, that we expect to see a lot more people starting to ride as their main transportation.
Many of you know a lot of times, people will use that third right turn lane to kind of jump ahead of the other cars, and then there are three lanes merging together into the intersection.
This uses here is a painted buffer and flexible delineators to separate the vehicles from the bike lane and with the parking along.
The next segment is the largest portion of this project, and this is that parking protected bike lane design we talked about earlier.
We did look at the traffic volumes and turning movements, and so at key locations where we saw that there is more traffic along this stretch, we're planning to introduce some right turn lanes, leading up to the intersections, as well as some rush hour regulations on the west side to alleviate places that have a little bit more traffic.
When we've installed protected bike lanes at unique locations such as hospitals, health, centers, schools, hotels that have some different unloading and loading needs for passengers, we use special.
So, when does redesigning the street to include the parking protected bike lane.
A lot of different sections and I just wanted to give you an overview of how our proposal actually really breaks down into two different design types for the bike: lane.
There's, some extra flexibility, where you know a vehicle could pull over to drop someone off without blocking the traveling, but without encroaching on a bike lane as well.
You know I've seen some of them on Second Avenue in Manhattan places like that, but I think that at this point, since bicycles are going to become such a large part of our transport community.
We use in-house crews, it's part of our business as usual' expenses, but What we've really found and I think what New Yorkers really appreciate and what our city needs are safer streets and especially in the time of kovat, where some folks are still trying to figure out how they're going to get to school to their families to work.
A north-south connection is going to provide a reliable, safer transportation option for the folks in Queens, and particularly in your community board.
There's more cyclists using the Queensboro Bridge to get to Manhattan, that's not being very well maintained Yes, so the temporary Lane, as I mentioned earlier, is a work in progress.
I know, there are a few people from our bike unit that are also tasked with going out once a week.
What was what will be the best way for us to flag that to you in order for that to be repair, because you're definitely challenging, and sometimes you have to get out of the bike lane down to the traffic A number of potholes were just recently filled already on the route, and we are working to see whether there is surfacing Obviously alternate side.
But when that does get lifted like the mayor, did that a couple of weeks ago, just so that the Sanitation trucks could get in when we sent our crews out , we can't get to all of them like in the parking lane, or You know, people, as they were when meeting to the temporary bike.
Actually I just wanted to bring out to the larger group a couple of the smaller details we discussed on the transit committee meeting about this presentation, notably Helen I , believe brought up the kind of sewer grates that the bike lane will be running through which Are not too good for bicycles, and we also discussed the creation of a bicycle lens traffic signal at Queens Plaza to protect bicyclists, as they make that right turn across the two lanes of traffic toward the bridge, Helen or Dominic.
You guys dressed the issue of people using wheelchairs, powered or manual travelling in the bike lane quite often which a users would rather ride in the street?
But if they're in a protected, bike, lane and bikes want to come behind them or whatever there's going to be a traffic jam in there.
So with this section, where we have one traveling, it is important to provide the ability for an emergency vehicle to pass through that bike lane and for sweeping and sanitation as well.
One thing that we are, including with this proposal, is there, are a few locations where we're updating some of the regulations on the West curb which can be used as a quick pull over spot for delivery instead of blocking a bike lane.
I am writing in support of the bike lanes being planned for Crescent Street between the Triborough and the Queensboro Bridge.
It would really help along the Crescent Street bike lane with all the supermarkets and such again.
Crescent Street is the ideal location, because it's the only direct route for people living north of 34th Avenue I'm, also hopeful that the addition of the bike lane will help slow traffic on the street, making it safer for pedestrians.
Okay, The first is from Jennifer chocolate party and as a longtime, Astoria resident mother and frequent bicyclist I'm excited to learn that a permanent Crescent Street two-way, protected bike lane is in the works, especially since the temporary one is an absolute deathtrap.
I do hope that the bike lane on Crescent is approved and no one is willing to cave into the where Will I Drive and where will I park.
Lastly, I would like to say that, with everything that is happening during Colvard 19 I am looking for new ways to travel, to and from work while having to enter a crowded, subway I, generally love taking public transit, but will be limiting my commute in order to reduce the chances of coming into contact with the virus.
I would like to thank you for your work and helping implement this bike.
We currently have partial bike lanes on 29th and 28th streets allowing for bike travel to and from the Queensboro Bridge, but they are neither adequately maintained or protected when traffic increases drivers often take their road rage and careless habits out on law-abiding bicyclists I have seen it and suffered from it.
A protected bike lane on Crescent would increase safety and traffic flow for commuting, astoria LIC cyclists tremendously and serve our community well, I'm, Scott, Phillips and last.
One I write to express my support for and encourage you to vote in favor of their proposed bike lanes over Crescent Street Astoria.
In addition to improving the safety of our community bike lanes will promote participation in physical activity and support.
They voted unanimously in support of the question street bike lane with the stipulation the duty would accommodate any specific matters or issues raised by the community board office in regards to the finalization of this plan.
Also I wanted to let you know that we do have a self-response rate map that is available to the public by visiting the 2020 census, gov, where you could look at your community.
My message to you is very simple: today, you understand your community are the people and their priorities and their needs, and you know how effectively deliver the senseless message to them in ways that Census Bureau can never cheat.
I wish you all great health and welcome to all of the new community board members I'm, looking forward to speaking with you all speaking with you all and working with you all much more closely.
You have all of you together here that I'm introducing of you, the good people that had been working for the community long time And it's my pleasure to be with you, and it has been excellent, that the thing that you've been doing the bike, land and I saw the board work on the ferry ride and all of those things that, when I'm being couple of meeting before so I'm very excited to work with all of you And we will together will make better storia and Queens.
Juliet and I have been a resident of a story for 44 long years, An active community leader in my Campina community in New York And I've, been attending your meetings in a story, a matter as an observer, and tonight is my first meeting with the community board as an official member Very, big Irene from sending the generic office just trying to get in okay, hey guys, Irene.
They have to report to the community board when there's a transfer of ownership of more than 80 percent of the business here, there's going to be a hundred percent transfer of ownership to a completely new owner of the applicant entity, The business is not currently open from what we understand and the committee has been told by the new owner that it was actually closed.
And you know, I did take a look at the mayor's guidelines with respect to social distancing and they do state that, to the extent that there are issues with dangerous situations to life or property.
This is something we can work on over the summer- How and really just try to drive home the point that we need to have transparency, if we're all volunteers and we all care about our community.
You are committed to whatever power you think, being a Seabee member brings to board members who do the hard work of serving our community by ensuring fairness and transparency and who get to know the issues in the action.
The support of staff, requires a district manager who is competent and committed to allowing board members to do the work not getting in their way.
This kind of thing happen over and over again and within two months out of all my 57 years, I've never lost this amount of people Ever Thank you for all the work we have all done.
