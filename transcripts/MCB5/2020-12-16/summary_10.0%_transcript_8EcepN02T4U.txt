Nonetheless, If we do not have quorum as we go forward or if we lose it any vote that we have will be ratified by the executive committee, so I will start now, because we are at 603, and this is a special meeting of both backs and the land use.
I just want to explain why we're here and why we're having a special meeting Bex with the land use Committee and why James, Matthem and Kirk Cavanaugh are here from the Flatiron bid again to talk about the Flatiron bit extension.
Is we're here to vote on the application for the extension of the Flatiron bid expansion, which is a process that follows the you look review.
That piece is done and we were part of that process back in February and March the Vex Committee, and now the flattering bid has filed the formal plans with the department of City planning DCP for the bid, expansion and DCP have referred this out for community Board review like the Euler process.
This also had a little bit of a change, so there's a new aid to assessment rate, which is a change from when we offered our support of the Flatiron bid expansion.
You know like if there are any technical questions that need to be addressed on the land use.
I will do that, but I will certainly shy away from you, know, guiding the conversation in any way, shape or form, and any comments and questions that I make will be, as a member of this committee being present, but not entitled to vote.
I know our friends in the Bex. Committee have gone through this as recently as a few weeks ago, but I figured just kind of get everyone up to speed to on who we are and what we've been working on for the past few years to get us to this moment that we're very excited about in terms of proposing our expansion of our service area in the nomad and 6th Avenue and 20th street corridor.
In terms of pushing to move on this expansion of our services, a look at the assessment budget and formulas that are required to underwrite the services and programs, as well as the outreach, engagement and support that we've been working on over the past year, both pre and post, Covid-19 outbreak.
These, are the boundaries that were ultimately approved back in 2005 2006 through the legislative process, roughly from about 21st street on the south bits and pieces of 6th avenue up to 23rd street, and then we taper in as you can see towards Broadway up until about 28th street, and then we taper out on the east side from Park Avenue south over to Lexington, to include the Baruch college campus and these you know this neighborhood.
You know in our relationships with the institutions here, whether it's Madison Square Park, Conservancy, Baruch college, the businesses, property owners and residents has been a constant and we think we've done a lot to make a big difference in terms of both the quality of life, the look and feel and the economic vibrancy of the neighborhood.
We've certainly noticed that we've had an uptick in street homelessness that we've been working closely with our city partners on addressing in the neighborhood, welcoming them as their neighbors, but also making sure that you know we're also managing certain streets street conditions as they arise as well, so we're working there with our partners.
Many of those came back being similar to what the services that we've been providing and working day in and day out, to provide to the current bid boundaries, whether it's around cleanliness, public, safety, ambassadors, homeless, outreach and service provisions.
You, know a touch of streetscape improvements and in horticulture and urban design, enhancements around safety and transit access and then particularly lately, business, support, district-wide marketing to try to draw as many eyeballs and dollars to our ground floor businesses and regulate and navigate regulatory burdens.
We think this is an important time to address those and bring those forth for consideration and again open streets, open, dining, Broadway vision, There's a lot of things that the expansion of the bid will enable us to take on in earnest.
You know our clean streets, Our cleaning crews are out there at minimum 7 A.M to 7 p.m. Every day, extended hours during peak months, They've been true bureaus this past nine months out working in the community, helping to keep it clean and safe throughout this.
They're out working building relationships with individuals without shelter or homeless, neighbors panhandlers street homeless, every day during the week, typically from seven in the morning through the early afternoon, and you know trying to build that trust and help people access services if they choose to access them through safe haven, shelters and so on.
A little bit, but you know we spent a lot of time, telling folks what we're up to making sure that people feel that Flatiron nomad the greater neighborhood is a place that they want to shop in work in and take a stroll.
Hopefully, As we move forward with the expansion, as we, you know, become a greater community, a larger community beyond just flat iron and 23rd street, and again business support working closely with the department of small business services, our state, federal and local partners here on relief efforts and advocating for much needed support now more than ever.
This is how it's been done since the late 70s, when the bid pro the first bids were created and it almost acts kind of like a cam, a community assessment kind of like how malls would work where there'd be a common fee, that a fee that's paid by each vendor in that case, to make sure that there's common area support throughout the district, so we're currently a 3.
So per the bid assessment formula that we use each benefited property owner's annual contribution is based on as I mentioned earlier square footage, and we do that through the following classes.
Retail, commercial, professional classes is your typical commercial building in space we generate a formula taking that budget and dividing it through the total amount of assessed commercial square footage that comes out to about 16 cents, a square foot, That's what the bid property owners currently pay.
It's been very important that we, You know we felt going into this as a steering committee that we kind of pegged that amount, particularly in the initial years, so that no one you know current bid prop bid paying properties are not assessed.
Any questions on that before I move, on, Okay, so, on the topic of community outreach, engagement and support, This is a very important thing that the steering committee seriously took and that the department of small business services who's the kind of the guardian of this effort throughout the city instills in every expansion and formation initiative.
This included flooring forming a steering committee of businesses, property, owners, residents, resident organizations, creating a statement of need for the expansion, doing a needs assessment over the past two years, developing a modified district plan that met this.
Met, Those needs holding public meetings, conducting ongoing outreach and documenting support and then submitting a proposal to the city, department, small business services and then.
Again, We reengaged things again once we came out of the initial freeze through the pandemic, and we've been really doing what we can to provide various levels of Covid-19 relief and recovery efforts in the expanded area for the businesses and, of course, All that you know has helped yield an additional amount of support over the fall.
You know you may have seen you may have come across this, especially if you live in the neighborhood in the expansion area, some of our mailings that we've done multiple times over the past year.
We did those both in the lower part of the district and in the northern expansion area and then in terms of what we've been doing as I mentioned pandemic business support.
As a you know, as we represent interest both on the property owner and the business side of this, we've provided direct promotional campaigns from the all in flat iron and all in nomad to drum up some business for our restaurants and dry good retail over the fall, we've distributed, masks to businesses, I think it ended up being somewhere between 50 and 60,000 mass that we distributed on behalf of the city to businesses across the bid of expansion area and beyond.
But you know whether it's through the open restaurants and open streets can't work that we've been working with the businesses and community on or just a vision for a safer and more accessible public realm for all sorts of for everyone.
We continue to work on that to this day, and in each case you know they're, just fortunately, I think partially because of I think the great work and trust that this particular bid and my predecessor and its board have instilled in the community over the past 15 years.
I think we should turn it over and look for questions from committee members I'm going to unshare for the time being.
Just have a quick question, which is that if this was never meant to reach residents and if residential buildings in the co-ops and Congress have never been assessed, I mean, aside from the nominal dollar, I'm a little unclear about the rationale about why property owners should be assessed on the residential square footage of their mixed-use buildings.
We had conversations with the city with department, small business, services, city planning, and would it was advised that we take a look and not just keep, have a narrow scope of sixth avenue, but perhaps consider a district-wide one, and you know.
You know that great of a need for the bid services, some of there's some spillover- benefit on 20th street.
And, I, Think I understood your the breakdown of the different building, categories, I'm, just a little unclear on mixed-use small buildings that would have retail on the ground floor and then residential above, which is, you know very typical of buildings, south of 23rd street.
I've studied up on and kind of worked with the community, our stakeholders, of course, which are a wide array of them, whether it's on the property side, the business side, the residential side, I mean we're in the business, is making sure that this neighborhood gets back up on its feet as best as it possibly can.
We do have a very different feel around sixth avenue and the current bid boundaries 24th, Street and south than we do up in the expansion area.
One of the things we look forward to with working with the community on the visioning plan and next steps is we don't want to just you know, copy and paste what we've done in the current bid, we'd like to look at things a little bit differently.
And I would look forward to those conversations and really just you know, providing the services that we're used to providing, but in a way that's appropriate for both the current and the expansion.
You know I'm going to disclose fully why I'm present, but not entitled I live in a building that is on 20th street 2-0.
We absolutely do service the side streets day in and day out when it comes to just you, know, cleanliness and public safety.
I, you know, I, know we work closely with a number, particularly mixed use, residential buildings, too.
So yeah- and one thing I'd like to add with one street in particular, is that it isn't in the expansion area right now, But we did work hand-in-hand with a lot of restaurants along the block between Broadway and Park.
So my question, as you all know, I'm, a big supporter of the bid, but I'm speaking in my capacity as a small businessman in the district, I'm, the owner operator of New, York, City, Seminar, Conference, Center sixth avenue in the 20th 23rd street.
To, even think about you, know, just the public realm maintenance responsibility that we're providing and taking off their minds to try to make sure that their workers and their customers feel good about coming into the neighborhood and shopping here.
You know we work hand in hand with the city's Department of Transportation Sanitation police, homeless, services, economic development, small business, you name it just like this board.
