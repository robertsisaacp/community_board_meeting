Well, I saw megan's email looks like you had 30 or so people at least again 30 machines, 45 people , I, don't think anyone here doesn't know me, but I'm, clayton, smith, chair of parks and public spaces committee for cb5.
Last month we heard from the municipal arts, society and new yorkers for parks about their proposal for the position of the director for public realm.
This is brought to you by the Flatiron partnership, but also with our friends at van allen, institute, and it is permitted through new york city department of transportation's art department, and we look forward to opening in about a month.
We do have overnight security on the north, plaza during the installation this year, I kind of just pushed it and wanted it to be frank, but the real another reason is.
Is there any kind of increased concern about just having somebody monitoring that over the course Have our public safety ambassador team, on the plaza during the installation And, then the overnight security once in a while, we'll get a queue of people on a beautiful.
You know real crowding, but we'd like people to engage with it and enjoy it, but we're not Lines down the block Are there any questions or comments from members of the committee?
I know anyone else on the committee, but we often bring things out to the plaza at different times and sometimes find some way to connect what we do with the artwork that happened, in, in particular with the hammocks, because when a hammocks disappeared were able to bring in these this other artwork and the lighting structure , There's room in the image that you're showing in the lower pebbled area is a place where we could lay out these 15 foot by 50 foot, vinyl logic puzzles, which are a great favorite.
Even in the summer time, with the with the blanking now fill me in the summer, the cells, the the solstice with the human sundial, the sundown, that's right, And, it's very often a dog rather than a human, but it works pretty well Now. We aren't sure you know we're looking toward ways to open.
We're also here to help in terms of any kind of creative solution to a pop-up installation that maybe like on an open street or something that we can do with you all D.O.T, the community board.
We did lose a few trees in the storm that now it seems like weeks ago, but we're making sure we're keeping you know the park clean and green and safe.
Untold stories of people, and so she has researched the history of madison square park, and some of you may know, this.
I do want to just let members of the public and the committee know kind of the rules that we're functioning on in the park.
If you're, a member of the public, no one's calling in so you can also use the raise hand feature, and while we just wait a couple minutes for that, I want to just applaud you guys for your work.
So especially this year, there's been a lot of thinking and planning that has gone into what we hope winter village will be.
I will say that we're still waiting on permits from the city we're working with them, showing them the same type of plans, we're showing you I, will also say: I loved listening to the madison square, park, presentation about all of the wonderful things.
I can do kind of a preamble first, so I would assume that most of you have are familiar with winter village or have been at some point If. You live and spend time in the Midtown area , it's traditionally an ice, rink holiday shops and a seasonal, restaurant or food hall concept, as we've done in the past couple.
We, definitely have a lot of empty office buildings around the park right now, And, it's just the kind of bustling nature of bryant park in a typical year.
We feel that ice skating is very easy to socially distance and is one of the few outdoor recreation opportunities that exist in the winter in new york.
To be quite frank, I mean it's been a hard year for small businesses in new york, city I will say the next two slides show the holiday shops layout from the old winter village.
You can see with the dotted red lines and those will be pretty much free of shops to preserve those desire lines for people in the neighborhood office workers as they return, so that if someone doesn't want to be involved with any part of winter village and bryant park, they don't have to be and also help.
Then it's also about you, know, trying to knowing that shops do better when retail is near retail, so we've broken those out from each other, and we do have a plan that we're working with the city on, I believe, with parks, So that.
I know that one issue is that some of these kiosks are returning year after year and kind of have claimed their stake in the kiosk that they always have, and so I think it's been a mix of trying to work with the vendors, and you know, change things, but not so much that they feel like they don't want to participate in the activation.
We also have, I, think, seven unisex bathroom stalls in the rink area and then another three or four near We're, trying to do kind of an outdoor, pop-up bar area where there used to be a food hall in that north east corner of the deck If you are still kind of having two separate areas for people who have their own skates and those who don't People have to wait, even if they have their own skates or So. The way it worked in past years was actually there weren't two separate areas for people with their own skates and not.
They'll have bought them online that way so, and actually that gray box kind of near the fountain, the gray rectangular area we're planning for that to be we're, calling it the skate, services, booth, right now, but a place where it's not a point of sale, system.
And I, think more people are planning in advance to make purchases or or you know, pursue an activity or an event.
If there's any way that community board 5 can help with getting the word out about certain things or with you know, getting a response from a city agency to help you out with something any way that we can help further things along I think we're going to be looking to new yorkers to come to bryant park this winter in a way that maybe they we didn't need them to.
As much I mean we still want new yorkers to use it, but we were spoiled by all of the tourists that come to Midtown during the winter, and I think this year.
