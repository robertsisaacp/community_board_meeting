I do not think anyone here does not know me, but I'm Clayton, Smith, Chair of parks and public Spaces committee for CB5.
You know that wildly interesting with the bright yellow, but that was about seven minutes after the installation was finished into Mid- November It's, going to see a second home in the coming weeks, so sneak peek to that it'll be at the corner of Water Street and Fulton Street in lower Manhattan for the next three to six months, Depending on how it kind of holds up, but that's very exciting, to see a second home.
Coach on point of action is a collection of nine individual units through six on the north Plaza three on the south, which for the first time in our seven years, this will incorporate both pauses.
This is brought to you by the Flatiron partnership, but also with our friends at Van, Allen Institute, and it is permitted through New, York, City Department of Transportation's art department, and we look forward to opening in about a month.
We do have overnight security on the north Plaza during the installation this year, I kind of just pushed it and wanted it to be frank, but the real another reason is.
For these art installations in the winter, but is there any kind of increased concern about just having somebody monitoring that over the course Have our public safety ambassador team, on the plaza during the installation And, then the overnight security once in a while, we'll get a queue of people on a beautiful?
You know real crowding, but we'd like people to engage with it and enjoy it, but we're not Lines down the block Are there any questions or comments from members of the committee?
I know anyone else on the committee, but we often bring things out to the plaza at different times and sometimes find some way to connect what we do with the artwork.
We're also here to help in terms of any kind of creative solution to a pop- up installation that maybe like on an open street or something that we can do with you all D.O.T, the community board.
We have chosen for many reasons to you, know to not do any programming in the park, because when we do it, people mob to our programs, we we are doing a few things which I'll talk about here in a second We are working on the ways that we communicate with the public and you'll see some new kiosks in the park, and this is just a way for us to make sure that we're communicating with We're also working on a new website and really thinking through our social channels to keep people informed about what's happening in the park.
We thought it was important and imperative for a public art program to work with an artist who could respond to the despair and the exultation and turmoil of this time that we are living in.
Go, ahead, Robin, so Abigail Deville is an artist who looks to history to to Summon past stories, untold stories of people, and so she has researched the history of Madison, Square Park and some of you may know.
And also I'm, amazed at how quickly you put this together when it comes a similar question as to Kurt with the socially distancing as far as people viewing the work.
I do want to just let members of the public and the committee know kind of the rules that we're functioning on in the park.
If you're, a member of the public, no one's calling in so you can also use the raise hand feature, and while we just wait a couple minutes for that, I want to just applaud you guys for your work.
I will say that we're still waiting on permits from the city we're working with them, showing them the same type of plans, we're showing you I, will also say: I loved listening to the Madison Square Park presentation about all of the wonderful things.
Have about our summer in the park we have been open and staffed and doing things like hand, washing stations and very small scale.
I can do kind of a preamble first, so I would assume that most of you have are familiar with winter village or have been at some point If. You live and spend time in the Midtown area , it's traditionally an ice, rink holiday shops and a seasonal, restaurant or food hall concept, as we've done in the past couple.
We feel that ice skating is very easy to socially distance and is one of the few outdoor recreation opportunities that exist in the winter in New, York City.
You can see with the dotted red lines and those will be pretty much free of shops to preserve those desire lines for people in the neighborhood office workers as they return, so that if someone does not want to be involved with any part of winter village and bryant park, they do not have to be and also help.
And I do not think we can require, for example, masks for every person in the park, the entire time, but if there's ever an a start and an end of an experience like going ice skating or going into a shop or something like that, we can absolutely require and will require masks for people in those.
One is that I assume it looks like there's a little bit of a cluster of vendor booths at the Fountain Plaza area and off of Sixth Avenue, and If the reason why you're not using the southern pathways of the park is because you're reserving that for the egress from the rink is that right , We're trying to keep it keep a clear space around the rink, certainly so that entrants to from the west and exit from the south of the rink are preserved.
The other reason to that is, you know: we, I think, if we spaced retail out, so that each kiosk was an island on its own And, then it's also about you know, trying to knowing that shops do better when retail is near retail, so we've broken those out from each other, and we do have a plan that we're working with the city on, I believe, with parks, So that.
They'll have bought them online that way so, and actually, that gray box kind of near the fountain, the gray rectangular area we're planning for that to be we're, calling it the skate, services, booth, right now, but a place where it's not a point of sale, system.
And I, think more people are planning in advance to make purchases or or you know, pursue an activity or an event.
If there's any way that community board 5 can help with getting the word out about certain things or with you know, getting a response from a city agency to help you out with something any way that we can help further things along I think we're going to be looking to new Yorkers to come to Bryant park this winter in a way that maybe they we did not need them to in the past.
As much I mean we still want new yorkers to use it, but we were spoiled by all of the tourists that come to Midtown during the winter, and I think this year.
