This vote of the full board will become the official position of the board and will be sent as our official recommendation to the BSA and any other relevant parties, such as our elected officials or city agencies, and the discussion item will proceed on a similar format, except that we do not have a formal presentation, but we will follow the same order where we will have a question period for members of the committee.
The project is a proposed hotel that is located at 58, 60 West, 39th street, and we have the team of applicants present with us and if you want to take it from there and give us your presentation, great.
This is an application to the board of Standards and appeals for a common law vested right to complete construction of a hotel development at 58.
In this case, the foundations were not complete, so the developer's recourse is to apply to the BSA for a vested right.
New York law says that a developer is entitled to a vested right if substantial construction and substantial expenditures have been completed prior to the zoning change and also where the developer would suffer a serious financial loss if it is not permitted to continue its project under the prior zoning.
The application includes materials demonstrating that the developers spent just over 11 million dollars on the project prior to the zoning.
You know we're looking at two to three years, pursuant to the uniform land use review procedure with really no guarantee of success, because we do not know if the building is designed, we'd even be able to meet the special permit.
I also want to point out that this application is to vest a 31 story, hotel development that you can see here, because that is what was approved by the department of buildings at the time that the zoning change went into effect.
Assuming that this application is approved, the developer intends to acquire excess floor area from the parcel to its west, which you can see here and to cantilever over that parcel right.
We believe that this enlargement would be permitted as of right and the larger developments again assuming the vested rights application is approved and the zoning lot is enlarged would be a 34-story hotel with approximately 173 rooms and 62,000 square feet of zoning floor.
Part of the rolling also says that the the ruling stands that they were worried about inappropriate architecture and that whatever hotels that were developed in the neighborhood show some sort of respect or coordination with the local buildings and from what I can see from your drawings and your pictures and the actual neighborhood itself.
The cantilever would be constructed pursuant to the acquisition of the development rights from the parcel of the West, as I mentioned, but you know with respect to the architecture and issues of supplies of hotels in the area.
Did recognize that hotels that were under construction would have an ability to vest they put a special vesting provision and they acknowledge that even developments, not meaning that special vesting would be able to rely on the standard vested rights, which is essentially what we're doing.
Another question from Clayton go ahead, so I have many questions, but the one that I just wanted to ask right now was also about the cantilever you blew through that somewhat quickly, but I believe that the logic you laid out was that, because the zoning is different in the lot above which the cantilever would exist.
Since, the point where the zoning tax change went into effect, has any work happened on that site, or has it been completely stopped and shut down construction stopped?
You mentioned that the the audit that you ordered on the office development profitability versus the hotel profitability showed a serious loss, right, correct?
If I read the the application- And, the report correctly, it looks like there is a large hotel development on 38th.
This development, emerging zoning laws and putting those rights into our building.
The underlying zoning of that particular lot requires that any new commercial or hotel building be set back from the lot line in order to give a 20-foot rare, yard.
You know the principle is pretty simple: when you have a change in the way you can use the land and you had a vested interest in doing a particular project and you spend a lot of time and money and then all of a sudden, boom.
Let's say that you know this hotel is already halfway up the ground Basically, the way the BSA now I'm, referring specifically to the BSA and not other municipalities in the state of New York.
The BSA has looked at these cases, which I mean it happens all the time you know The zoning What the BSA looks at is how much money was spent and the way the rules are, you know excavation- should be completed.
It, is exactly the same thing for the exact same reason, the exact same zone, zoning text, a main amendment that basically passed and that we supported wholeheartedly and so warmly- You know with great enthusiasm, because we do believe that hotels as a conforming use in a manufacturing district is not appropriate as of right and it can be appropriate by special permits so that we have a chance to address all the concerns that hotel development poses in our manufacturing districts, not to say that they should not be built and we're very clear in our recommendation and our support of the zoning change.
So you see certain vested rights cases where sometimes it was a smaller developer or smaller project They did not realize the zoning changed and was not paying attention to anything or did not have any sort of records, and they do this stuff on the back of a napkin.
We've clearly demonstrated that we've completed excavation all support of excavation, and we have made you know: significant progress, substantial progress, potential, construction on the foundation, and it's all It's all in that in the application.
What you see as the mechanical was actually a shell space that we intend to locate the 20,000 square feet that will be transferred to this building after the Cantilever air right is purchased the twenty thousand square feet It seems when you, when you look at the subsequent pages and I'm, not going to suggest one second, that we do that, but it seems that you're deducting this area from your usable occupiable.
Yes, so right, I do want to explain that you know there was a reason for putting the mechanical force.
You know that the applicant has a vested interest and that the vested law applies here, that they have spent enough money and that they have completed enough of the building to justify continuing building the building.
You know whether we like this building or not, or you know other aspects of it, but it's really to determine if we believe that there was enough construction in terms of you, know, like substance and investment put into this building, and also whether this particular type of development, a hotel, 31 story with you know a very different type of you Does that deviate from the new zoning or not?
Looking at this, and considering this you know very specifically and sort of narrowly on the question of the BSA application.
And, that to me is the main point that I would want to hear more from my fellow committee members, because I do not believe that finding justifies granting of the waiver I you know, I won't say that you know on the various questions that you know the BSA application, raises.
Quite a you know an accomplishment to start construction in sometime in or like to be issued a permit in July and then to be 75 70, complete with foundations.
You know, a commercial building that is conforming use or a hotel that is non- conforming.
I think that the route of the BSA permit is actually not the proper one, and I would really encourage the applicant to look at other options, whether going for conforming use with a commercial building or exploring the other.
You know I think in this case there's a number of questions such as the timeline of the foundation and, as you said, to me, it also kind of comes down to whether or not it's complying with the with the spirit of the rezoning and the contextuality of the of the area.
If we believe that the route for the applicant is actually to pursue a special permit with the Department of City planning, then in essence we are not in favor of the BSA action.
, so I think I think the motion you know if I hear the comments from the a number of members is to actually recommend denial of the the BSA action and instead to urge the applicant to consider a conforming use or to consider a special permit under the existing zoning of this particular lot.
We also know that there is a number of new developments in the newly rezoned east Midtown that are adjacent to park Avenue and are going to require to actually grip some of Park Avenue, and this is an opportunity also to address the disrepair of the train.
Other groups that are present in the area, and You know I felt that it would be good that community board five has an official position so that when the time comes for the you know ripping off of of Park Avenue and the reconstruction of the malls, we do not end up with a DOT telling us.
You know this area a real part of the public realm, so we have with us And it's great to see everybody on the committee , it's nice to be able to talk to the this particular committee about this important issue like in the in the neighborhood and what it means not only for CB5 for the Grand Central, Partnership District, but obviously for the city, as I.
I know this board also considered when it supported the initial concept plan, which became the concept plan and one of the items that sits in that plan and is still alive, has to do with expanding the Park Avenue Malls and sort of looking at Park Avenue in a new way as part of potential funded projects that can grow out of continuing reinvestment in the Midtown East area.
What we did not know at the time was that Metro North was planning this incredibly extremely important, but also overwhelming project that, at this point, is sort of calendared for at least two decades, which I think.
