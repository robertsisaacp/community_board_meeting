We have a lot to cover this evening, so I'm going to ask if someone has already asked the question not to repeat it, to try and be respectful of people's time.
I'm, the Manhattan borough director for the Department of Social Services, but I'm also joined on the line with my street outreach DHS colleagues, so just want to allow them to introduce themselves before I jump into it.
This security on site and security that also canvases outside of these hotel locations as well, and then the goal of them canvassing outside of the shelter site, is just to ensure that you know residents are being good neighbors in community if our clients are observed or are identified, staff is trained and advised to provide clients with PPE masks if needed, and also encourage them to you know if they're not being compliant, they will case conference them and work with them and assess if this is a good environment or a good location of space for them, and so we have security at all these sites, temporarily that we're temporarily utilizing we canvas outside of these locations.
To, you know kind of see some uptick in the exits in terms of clients exiting out of permanent out of temporary shelter and into permanent housing or supportive housing on the street homeless, outreach side.
You know we have streets, outreach on the line, but I'll allow breaking ground and speak to the work that they're doing but want to say, citywide we're still out canvassing.
We brought on a lot more bed capacity for our street homeless population, So you know folks.
We don't see an alarming increase of individuals coming into the system, but just saying that to state that you know, shelter is still operating, We're still 24 hours.
We have a mandate to provide temporary shelter for any individual in need, so I think I, hope, I kind of covered.
You know we are following the guidance of the CDC and the State Department of Health, so whenever they make a determination as to when it's wise and safe to exit our clients out of these settings and back into congregate, shelter, settings, I will be the first to come to the community and convey that message on what that will look like I know that we're in ongoing dialogues and conversations from city hall and other you know state officials on what this will look like, But we don't have anything concrete to share just yet, as it relates to the timeline.
So just want to take the opportunity to thank many of you that I've worked closely with on those efforts, So I know.
We call those tier two facilities, so we're hoping to pull out of close down, pull out of commercial hotels and provide you know, put families in a tier 2 facility setting where they can be provided with additional support services that can live on site and can have their own kitchens.
So there's a couple of ways in which we're engaging people and what we do is we contract out with non-profit providers in each borough, And they're responsible for providing that 24-hour day homeless, outreach.
It's all oriented around placing individuals getting individuals who are on the street inside, and that is the basis and doing everything they can when they encounter people who are homeless, who want to come inside everything they can to get them.
We have staff in the field and then staff who are in the office kind of operating from a command post, for if you will, and what they're doing, is they're, also engaging individuals on the street, Responding to reports of homelessness and then triaging and coordinating with a lot of our partner agencies in real time, as well as the outreach teams, so they're engaging somebody.
They provide mobile and street based psychiatry, as well as a mobile medical team that is comprised of nurses and nurse practitioners, in addition to the psychiatrists, so a multi-disciplinary team that includes licensed social workers, psychiatrists, nurses and so forth, and essentially we are out there 24 hours, a day, seven days, a week, trying to bring people inside and barring that linking them to the appropriate services based on their presentations and throughout this community.
I want to ask the committee if they have questions that they would like any one of the three that who have spoken to answer.
We have outreach teams every night working at a series of the end of line stations to catch those individuals as they come off the street as they come off the train, sorry and try to talk to them about coming inside and providing transportation to a series to a shelter if they wanted or destabilization bids.
We're utilizing them at end of line, but also in our day-to-day work and to offer people a place to come inside and again very low threshold, and in the moment, in real time when people are interested we're saying to them, we have a place for you to go right.
You know the teams are able to do assessments on the street and make direct placements for the street homeless population into a into us into a stabilization, bed.
So therefore, We work very closely with DHS and collaborate in real time, If need be of individuals that might need shelter, whether it's immediate, whether it's long-term.
Therefore, they will lead to employment if they, you know, need, obviously mental health, services, substance abuse services, Those are things that we will connect them with and work with them in a more I would say in about a short intervention, period.
You said that they can become your client within 90 days or you work with them for nothing, no, so like they could be basically be within our case load for 90 days or less right, so, depending if they just need to be connected to specific services.
Know, do I would say: Covid-19 wellness checks and ensuring you know they ask them a series of questions, making sure folks feel well and are okay, but they meet with the caseworker.
They connect them with different linkages in that community or in that area, to off to ensure that they have the supports that they need going forward.
People should take to send help if they see a homeless person on the street in crisis or having an apparent mental health issue or creating a pro a problem that may be drug use.
I guess, I could answer related to mental health and maybe even crisis a little bit when it comes to individuals that might be approached or might be appearing as if they might be going through a crisis or have some mental illness that might need assistance, I, think calling NYC.
One of the questions that we received is from the 29th Street Association is they are seeing an increase in homeless people living on the streets and.
I'll, let breaking ground expound, but in short I would say you know it's a pandemic and in the pandemic our street homeless population no longer has access to general things that we would.
You know they no longer have access to Starbucks, maybe or Mcdonald's where they would use restrooms or want to say public libraries are now closed and those are locations in areas that our street homeless populations took full advantage.
I think it's just folks have been somewhat at a standstill at home, I'd say, but I would turn it over to the street outreach teams if they want to weigh in, but obviously that's just a general assessment.
Don't think that the sheer number of people who are truly experiencing street homelessness has increased at this time.
They wanted to know if you're, seeing any positive Covid-19 results in your population and if that happens, how do you deal with that.
I know that they also have their own somewhat, like a checklist of questions that they ask folks, betting down on the street and the same.
You know, I want to give a really good overview, there, but really quickly, every single person that we engage, we put through a Covid-19 screening and if they indicate any positive symptoms, we immediately contact this number that allows them to either enter an isolation site or if the situation is severe enough and they're interested, we'll transport them to receive medical treatment, and we have brought a number of people to hospitals.
So, if folks are on the street and unwilling to come inside, we're at least making sure that they are not presenting with any of these symptoms and that they have the PPE to keep themselves and the folks in the community, safe and the office of medical director for DHS is heavily involved in tracking any suspected Covid-19 cases for isolation or quarantine.
So every four to six weeks, every individual site, every shelter, has testing providers that come on site and do testing when we think the maximum amount of clients are present within the brick and mortar.
I mean we're more than willing to work with anybody if they have a homeless individual or they know of somebody who's in the street, we're more than willing to partner with them and do what we can to engage the individual and bring them in off the street, and we can certainly talk offline about the specifics and I wouldn't be able to speak to exactly what the regulations are and what they're able to do, or not.
But, you know again, we work with parks and we work with other agencies and organizations throughout the city, and we work together in whatever way possible to get people inside so great.
The goal is to keep individuals coming into the system close to their support networks and their communities, so not particularly keep them close to their zip code, but keep them close to the boroughs where they're receiving services of support, and so this is a borough-based plan and in this plan the goal is to give you know every community a site depending on what the system looks.
If you state that you're you know, you're asking for Street homeless outreach support, it will go to our JCC unit.
I know people the teams are, They may be frustrated with it, but the teams are responding and it can just be a very long process, but Nick can certainly speak to it, but his team does not give up and what they are doing is they are going to continuously engage people around coming inside and connecting to services.
You know some people particularly been on the street for a long time.
I, Don't know if you want to address that and the question then becomes will neighborhoods have less control over what happens.
Our Covid-19 numbers in the system went from 1,000, plus cases that we were tracking down to 41 currently, so that kind of speaks volumes, I want to say the metrics speak for itself, I think it speaks volumes, to.
We have worked on a ton of different advocacy and policies in New, York City that have helped drive down the smoking rate to what it is now, which has been the all-time low at 13.
However, you know, In the face of all of that, We still have groups and communities that have high much higher smoking rates than the average, and we really are working on health, disparities, health equity and really working to close those gaps within our city, because there are certain policies, unfortunately, in our city that do not help reduce tobacco use, they're, not as strong as they can be to reach certain underserved groups that are being negatively affected by tobacco use and one of those large health, disparities.
I want to ask the committee if they have any questions Luke, if you can, let me know, I'm.
This is very timely because we know that tobacco use is a exacerbator for Covid-19 related symptoms, and we do see that Covid-19 is disproportionately affecting certain communities, So this again doesn't need to be happening.
And I do know that we will take questions, but they wanted to come in and make sure that the the committee and the community board at large could play a certain role in this educational aspect and I.
There was talks about introducing a bill that also covered menthol tobacco, products, However, I think it just needed more talks amongst the community and certain things to figure out how they would do it making sure they did it.
But I do think it needs to be reintroduce the community and talked about, and you know more awareness.
That time we are proposing, after many several years of planning and outreach to expand our service area upwards, to 31St street, as Renee mentioned up sixth avenue, and that corridor really, including the nomad area of Midtown south here and kind of squaring the district fully making this rather than a blob around Madison, Square Park.
You heard some of that earlier tonight with department of Homeland, Services Social services and the outreach teams, but in addition to that, there's just as I like to say, there's a good amount of tender, love and care that just needs to be looked after and provided on a daily basis when it comes to the kind of curb appeal of the greater area, and we do that every day in the current bid.
And we've worked with our business partners in the expansion area to help with open streets and outdoor dining Broadway has been a pretty good success as an open street one of the first of its kind in Manhattan, and we're really happy to see the number of businesses take advantage of that for dining opportunities to keep them afloat as well as 20th street down on between Park Avenue, South and Broadway, and so over the years I've mentioned this before.
When we mentioned you know, we've surveyed every businesses we've surveyed residents, we've kept that stakeholder connection strong to inform what types of services would resonate in the district in the expansion area.
If, we were to provide services on a daily basis, and, of course, cleanliness, public safety, we're at the forefront of that, as well as homeless, outreach, streetscape, improvements, horticulture, urban design, safety enhancements for the neighborhood and ongoing business, support, district marketing and regulatory navigation for businesses, and then, ultimately.
Certainly got a big dose of that over the past nine months and again, prioritizing local business needs for economic recovery, which is obviously going to be a driving force of the work over the coming years.
Sanitation, public Safety, Marketing, Social services, which includes homeless outreach in collaboration with the city, are public improvements and beautification work and then General administration and a reserve.
In order to do the you know, the real work, particularly on sixth avenue, between 23rd and 31st, street.
This point, we've done conducted needs assessments, developed, an expansion, plan, we've held public meetings, we conducted ongoing outreach and documenting of support, and then finally, after we met with with Bex in February in April of the spring, we did submit our proposal to the city and the department of small business services, who is the usher of this of bid, expansions and business formations and that you know at that point they review and determine whether or not it's going to go into public review and legislative approval.
So that they're both places that people want to be in, but can also you know, places where business residents can feel safe being in.
Looking like the beginning of December, So we wanted to come back to just refresh everyone's memory and again ask for your support and also you know, field.
Well, I would say: I, don't know, I, don't think we consider them worried, Otherwise we would have expected to hear from them in act and getting back to us saying that they do not support this in terms of how the assessment is passed.
So I can get back to you, but if anyone has any questions about whether or not their you know, property business residence is one in the district they can reach out to us.
She's, urging us to support extending the boundary on Madison Avenue to the southeast corner of 32nd Street, and she wants to know.
Okay, seeing none I'm going to move back to our committee members, I know.
When we bring this back to the committee and Tne together, because it's not just a vex issue, we'll have all the information that we need and answers to questions that we can post tonight, I'm gonna turn the presentation over to Zach who's, going to give us a brief summary, and then we can move to the questions or comments that we think we need the answers to great thanks.
You, know the street vendor market is.
You know on the next few slides, I kind of give an overview of some of the legislation that was proposed back in 2018 when a few of the New York City, Council members, you know wanted to increase and significantly increase.
You know significant of these, in that it deals with the number of street vendors.
Vendors is relatively weak, and so, If there would be a you know, a market increase in the number of street vending permits.
You, know, I, don't think most of us are walking on the streets.
There is the largest kind of group that advocates on behalf of street vendors is called the street vendor project you know and similar to the bids they make claims that I think are.
I, think you know a fair point that they make is that the number of permits hasn't been increased since 1983.
Regards to the economic interest impacts on Manhattan, You know, which does have the disproportionate number of street vendors.
You would you should know that I think that's helpful to you.
Folks, I just have tremendous respect for Muhammad at the street vendors project, and you know, we've given time to the to the business improvement district, albeit on a separate topic.
I mean you talked about where you know how they specify exactly where the street vendors can not be.
Has there been any talk of like a cap on like the number of vendors that are positioned on a certain block or a certain group of a group of blocks just to make sure that we don't have everyone crowded into the same kind of like micro area, because if I, don't know, I, think I would support a bill that expanded permits.
I'm, assuming that was a new enforcement unit in NYPD that she was talking about, but I just wanted to confirm that, and if so, you know, I feel like now, especially with our board's kind of recent conversations about the NYPD.
I. Think I would want to know whether there could be a different agency that might oversee regulation of street vendors.
When we move forward again on a very complicated issue, we have as much information that you think that you will need to consider as we you know, actually get.
But, you know I, don't think I understand kind of what the average resident of the community board.
The community district would think about this, and what the average employee right, like I, think the street vendors serve a lot of construction, workers.
They want to have kind of a nicer meal, sometimes, but like a street vendor to me, that's like serves a different need.
It's like classic gatekeeping, but I'd also want to like make sure we're thinking about people who work and live in the neighborhood.
You were a cafe, You probably wouldn't want a street vendor serving coffee right outside your door, because you know that's immediate competition.
