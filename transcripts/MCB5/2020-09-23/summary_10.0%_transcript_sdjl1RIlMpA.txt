It is a presentation by the grand central terminal, train, shed rehabilitation, project team, so without further ado.
We greatly appreciate making the presentation to community board five and we're here this evening to present the grand central terminal, train, shed rehabilitation program and provide you with some information and answer any questions that you may have so we'll move through to our next slide.
I will discuss park, avenue malls the overarching, program, schedule, construction mitigation and next steps, and now I will turn it over.
Here's kind of a section through park avenue the train shed, which we just showed the yellow outline for, is If you're, not so much, then you know the picture above is more of what you're used to seeing the streets, the roadways, the park, avenue mall and the hustle and bustle of new york when underground there's this whole network of all the trains and tracks and the metro north train shed next slide, please The roof structure and the membrane is not in the best of shape, and it's allowing the water from storm, water and etc.
The grand central terminal is 30 acres, so that yellow area that we showed on the first slide, it's about 30 acres and the park avenue malls is one acre of that.
One only goes halfway across the train shed at this location from on the west side of park avenue and the west portion of 48th and 47th street.
The intent is to do this work in conjunction with the 270 park, avenue redevelopment, which is currently underway, sector 2, which is from 53rd through 55th street.
Looking north at the sector, one location- You can see that we have two layers: the upper layer in the lower level of the train shed and then followed by the street above, and you can clearly see that the viaduct roof, which you saw by the earlier photos that it's in it's in severe condition, and it is supporting not only the people but the cars and obviously it needs to be maintained to allow for train operations to continue unimpeded next slide.
The same principle will be taking place for the sector work just at a larger scale and of course we will be seeking approval from new york city department of transportation.
We understand that the malls are going to be dismantled to allow for us to do our reconstruction of the viaduct roof, and we are now working closely with new york city D.O.T, as well as the mayor's office capital project development team, in we're listening closely with them and working with them to figure out what ultimately, they are going to decide to put in that space, and ideally.
The second phase will be a design build team which won't take place until the next capital program, and then we have the priority.
One work into more stages, which are not shown here, Will be submitted in conjunction with maintenance and protection of traffic drawings that we need to de submit to new york city DOT for approval of those movements of the vehicles and pedestrians.
As sean pointed out, we were not keeping up with the level of deterioration, so the decision was made that if, in the current capital program, which is 20 to 24 and any future capital programs, that we would start to undertake a significant replacement of portions of the roof, which we dubbed those sectors for lack of a better name sector, one just so happens to be coincident with the work on the replacement of the office building at 270 park, because it's they.
The sort of budgets were given by the mta and the need all the areas eventually need to be to be done, where our intention is a complete replacement eventually of the entire roof of grand central, which is which would be park avenue from 46 to 57th.
There's, going to be a second escalator added over there to the one that's already in place and The That's currently, there will be relocated further south into the sidewalk area, so that's being addressed partially by the by the train, shed there's a lot of other work, that's more tied in with the eastside access project.
Sure we've been dealing with new york, city, D.O.T traffic signal department, Yes, that is a part of the sector, one in all future sector, work that we will be incorporating such signalization.
Is that going to change as a result of any of the work, and would that further protect the train shed from deterioration, or is that not a factor?
