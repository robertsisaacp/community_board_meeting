It is a presentation by the Grand Central Terminal train, shed rehabilitation, project team, so without further ado.
The project manager for the train chip project and also joining us is the owner, ruben Vice, President, Capital programs and MTA Metro north railroad, You may know, we're all being transitioned into the Mtac D Department, but we still call ourselves Metro, North and next I'd like to introduce Leslie, Black she's, director of community engagement services for the firm of Fitzgerald and Holiday Inc Everybody for having us join your agenda.
And we're here this evening to present the grand Central Terminal train, shed rehabilitation program and provide you with some information and answer.
Any questions that you may have I will discuss: Park Avenue malls, the overarching program, schedule, construction mitigation and next steps, and now I will turn it over.
So, here's kind of a section through Park Avenue, the train shed, which we just showed the yellow outline for, is The image below You should be very used to this image below if you're, not so much, then you know the picture above is more of what you're used to seeing the streets, the roadways, the Park Avenue Mall and the hustle and bustle of New York when underground there's this whole network of all the trains and tracks and the Metro North train shed, The roof structure and the membrane is not in the best of shape, and it's allowing the water from storm, water and etc.
The grand Central terminal is 30 acres, so that yellow area that we showed on the first slide, it's about 30 acres and the Park Avenue Malls, is one acre of that.
The intent is to do this work in conjunction with the 270 Park Avenue redevelopment, which is currently underway, sector 2, which is from 53Rd through 55th street.
Here you can see a typical section, looking north at the sector, one location- You can see that we have two layers: the upper layer in the lower level of the train shed and then followed by the street above, and you can clearly see that the viaduct roof, which you saw by the earlier photos that it's in it's in severe condition, and it is supporting not only the people but the cars and obviously it needs to be maintained to allow for train operations to continue unimpeded.
Look, that all of the work that is being proposed here at sector 2 will again traverse the entire width of the train, shed.
You can see at that center span, where the individual stringers are some 55 and a half feet, long, so rather large pieces of steel that we need to deal with during construction and part of which will be to have rediversion of the traffic flows, to allow us to get access to areas and be able to replace steel from column line to column, line.
The same principle will be taking place for the sector work just at a larger scale and of course we will be seeking approval from New York City Department of transportation.
We understand that the malls are going to be dismantled to allow for us to do our reconstruction of the viaduct roof, and we are now working closely with New York City D.O.T, as well as the mayor's office capital, Project development team, in we're listening closely with them and working with them to figure out what ultimately, they are going to decide to put in that space, and ideally.
The second phase will be a design build team which won't take place until the next capital program, and then we have the priority.
We just wanted to provide you with an update because you live and work here with respect to the different accessibility and all of the pieces of information that go into helping you get around as construction goes on.
So, with respect to access, sidewalks will certainly still be available and buildings will remain accessible and we will install temporary sidewalks and overhead protection in place around construction, and these elements will be dynamic and will shift as work.
We are meeting with building owners on a regular basis to provide updates, and I believe, Shawn walked through many of the elements with respect to no pilings and underpinnings, sidewalk advancements and business access, please and site restoration, and once we are done returning things back to what they were with respect to in- kind or enhanced site restoration and all of the elements will be taken into consideration, including sidewalk, finishes, Landscape street furniture, roadways and curbs crosswalks and striping pedestrian crossing signals, and, of course, lighting and signage.
The diagrams that you showed seem to be mainly focused on working on, say, half of the street and retaining at least a couple lanes of traffic at the same time, and then flip- Are there going to be situations where a block of Park Avenue will be totally closed?
There's, going to be a second escalator added over there to the one that's already in place and The That's currently, there will be relocated further south into the sidewalk area, so that's being addressed partially by the by the train, shed there's a lot of other work, that's more tied in with the eastside access project.
