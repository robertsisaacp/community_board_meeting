We will leapfrog that item and we will jump right to Madison Square Park Conservancy, who are joining us to discuss revised plans for the food market in Worth's square I believe it would probably be who've the new committee members to have a little bit of context around what we are hearing tonight in the thumbnail sketch of this long history is that for many years there was a food market twice a year in word, We there was a lot of support in the community for this event, but there was also a lot of concerns around navigation issues and signage and other things, and over the course of many years we worked with the Conservancy to address those concerns and improve them year after year, at the time that the contract expired for that particular event, and it was time for a new one.
How, a new iteration of this food market could better address the public benefit in response to that, not in response to that, but over the course of several months, working with the Conservancy and the Parks Department on the language for the RFP, a lot of community board five and the public's questions and concerns Those concerns included pedestrian navigation, down, Fifth Avenue along the east side of Worth's square sight lines above the event congestion, so that there's a possibility for navigation through Worth's square and a lot of interest in the identity of the vendors.
I think it may be a lot less because there's no workers in the park, but I would say that the people that come needed a lot more and so I, don't know who have.
This is a brand new layout proposal that has passed muster with the parks department, so far, pending some social distancing, stuff like sign-in to that, and it's the first time we're presenting it here to the community.
The community highlighted points still some kind of interaction, although frankly we're not sure how exactly to do that in action with social distancing, but we can imagine that it would be people behind the glass behind the service counter explaining some of their products and Italy right now is working hard on getting those upstate farmers as partners for any kind of program starting the 30th.
There are two types of patron: The first type would be those receipt in the inn within the confines of Wirth square and to maintain social distancing, we're working with the parks Corbin on what we can get approved in terms of floor markings in combination with active attendees or ambassadors.
The idea is with a single line through the seating area: : We can maintain that 6 foot, minimum social distancing and once people are sitting at their tables, of which this model calls for 32 top tables.
We are free to ask questions and comment, as we please tonight on this issue, but I believe that it is appropriate to leave it to the psql committee to determine how to move forward, given that this particular seasonal license.
Only good thing out of coronavirus right now with this proposal is that we have one set up in one:: take down not two setups and two takedowns, but we've maintained the 28 days of operation The concession process through the parks department is highly regulated as the controllers review and has the Law Review, and so, as we are trying to work.
Don't think it's tenable and then, of course, weather gets in the way, forgetting anything about a second wave We raised everything to run the part, so the revenues from this event are important: And, I, think, additionally, the ability to shop outside to go and get food and things that you can then eat whether you take it to go and go sit in the park or you take it to go in the home or It's really important to have access to outside services.
Maybe you maybe you hopped in when we were explaining the pure concepts, the concept that doesn't involve a pandemic, that what we're looking at right now is one kiosk that serves beer, wine and prepared foods, which is most likely ice cream and How are you how what's the plan to keep the social distancing at that station?
It's a dynamic thing from an Operations standpoint, the more people you can service the better you're going to do from a revenue standpoint, but to do that safely and also for the first time in a new location like this, the more complicated you make, these plans, the more these plans can go awry, Has that been kind of thought out in terms of traffic and the bike lanes both on 25th Street and on Fifth Avenue This is a fence.
So I think the trade-off is important, so Todd, I'm gonna, just piggyback on your question and But the issue is just that: , it's not an academic exercise, as we saw over many years with our concerns about 5th Avenue pedestrian navigation in the past, with eats I agree with you, but people just don't walk to Broadway I mean some people do, but many people just walk down the middle of Fifth Avenue Obviously.
There is no walkway down fifth, that then the west side of Fifth Avenue for the public unless you're coming through Italy, so Clayton and Todd to your point There isn't a great plan to stop people from walking in traffic down Fifth Avenue.
Sort of is personally, like the parks department and the Conservancy frankly put pressure on Italy to come up with a solution to provide outside access to food.
If the restaurant is entitled to use a lane of traffic for seating, they may self-certifying I mean how you know what is the degree of traffic right now at that spot, like how An open, question- Maybe.
Think that there is something about bringing back a little bit of spirit to the city that is so important right now, And, you know some are supposed to be fun and people want to be outdoors, And I think that either maybe traffic patterns can be changed or pedestrian walking patterns can be changed.
I think it would behoove us to put our concerns and questions and support and all the things that we discussed today into a letter that can go out as soon as possible to the parks department and also do T to investigate this particular issue seems like it might be the one that we would have the most concern about, but also to pledge our public support generally for moving ahead with a revised, socially distant version of this event.
Listening to what Keats at the said had to say in the fact that it's just a short-term solution, you know we can't obsess about perfection, especially since we've lived with all sorts of issues with that space and past years , I think we should simply state.
You know that I'm in the neighborhood And I see everything that's going on Brian, especially given what the whole idea of having we're trying to generate more street traffic and the most important thing is just people getting out and walking around so, But I wouldn't make that you know I wouldn't make that stumbling block to get this done right simply.
Will we're not going to take this to a vote, but I will just move informally that we put these comments and questions into a letter, the biggest one being the fifth avenue, navigation, but, most importantly, being on record supporting the revised iteration of this event for two cycles in a row.
This was something that had been tossed around and Beck's a little bit about summer programs for youth this summer in the parks, citywide Kim. I, wonder if you wanted to just frame this conversation and with your specific questions as well sure things, so I had been thinking a lot about what youth will have to do this summer.
We recognized the Summer Youth Employment, Program, being somewhat halted, and, of course, programming in general, being late to be released, and so I had questions around how parks was creating a recreational calendar for youth this summer and just so fearful that there won't be things for kids to do, and you know, without opportunities to either work or our skills or be physically active and engaged that they could turn to other behavior and so I think providing you know positive calendar of events and things like that would be really helpful.
Already I also had questions about how we could better utilize community-based organizations that are experts at providing programming in our parks and how we could provide them with an expedited process for permitting for this summer and if that was being considered since they know how to do this really well.
That's the point just that we could, with the direct questions as things move along I, think we would want to do our part to stay in touch with them and see what news we can get as it happened, because it is mid-july.
And I'm curious, if you are moved to propose a resolution to ask the parks, department and City Hall to look at these specific questions, rapidly, obviously taking public health into consideration, but knowing that the community has the support to look into that and to and to seek some solutions.
You want to do a letter, well, either a letter or a resolution, because if we write a letter, it can come from the committee as we've done before quickly If it's a resolution, you're concerned that we would have to wait for the film or that's right, And I think the most important thing right now is for City Hall.
Just to hear that we are paying attention to this issue now, My only concern and And I kind of had it with the last the last issue that you talked about, because that's also brand-new One. Other point like I, think this is part of a bigger conversation.
You know the systemic inequity that continues within marginalized populations and thinking about kids that don't have access to paid programming are the ones that take advantage of free, Park, Recreation.
We could change it to a letter, how's that great We absolutely agree with you and I only mentioned Brian Park, because it's in your district, but the program that we are working on for youth recreation for the summer.
The resolution is the way that we will end up moving forward, a fantastic things, Clayton, so I proposed a resolution to the parks department that outlines that, as I had mentioned, before, with an entire generation of kids being at risk of you know being left even further behind because of the corona virus pandemic and because of long-standing systemic inequities.
Park they've been working on that for several months, but it's been formalized now in the resolution last month, so they are coming to us to ask for our support for their proposal to move forward with advocating for a permanent, exhibit.
