That, you have already attended committee meetings and, of course, full board, but this is the first time that you've actually been here for parks and public spaces, so for everyone's benefit, I have lived in CB 5 for my whole life and while I do not go to school, In CB 5 I have worked in CB 5 at the at the farmers market in Union, Square and I have been involved with Gail with Gail Brewers youth committee last year, so I've been very involved in youth politics and it's very nice to meet you all I believe it would probably be who've the new committee members to have a little bit of context around what we are hearing tonight in the thumbnail sketch of this long history is that for many years there was a food market twice a year in word and we there was a lot of support in the community for this event, but there was also a lot of concerns around navigation issues and signage and other things, and over the course of many years we worked with the Conservancy to address those concerns and improve them year after year.
So at the time of the RFP, that was when community board five formally weighed in on the best ways to shape the public conversation around How. A new iteration of this food market could better address the public benefit in response to that, not in response to that, but over the course of several months, working with the Conservancy and the Parks Department on the language for the RFP, a lot of community board five and the public's questions and concerns became baked into the text of the RFP itself, thereby ensuring that those concerns would be addressed since they would be required of any operator who would be ultimately selected as a part of the process.
Those concerns included pedestrian navigation down, Fifth Avenue along the east side of Worth's square sight lines above the event congestion, so that there's a possibility for navigation through Worth's square and a lot of interest in the identity of the vendors There was always an effort and an integrity on part of the event to have local, small businesses and restaurants, showcased, of course, but with a new iteration of the event, We wanted to prioritize that and have a deeper conversation around that We would have already seen the first iteration of this new event, as it normally happens every year in May and because of kovat Thank You Clayton for the introduction, I'm sure you on the Madison Square Park, and we are the organization that funds a hundred percent of everything that happens in their pre Covid-19 days.
This is a brand new layout proposal that has passed muster with the parks department so far, pending some social distancing stuff like sign-in to that, and it's the first time we're presenting it here to the community board.
May was cancelled due to coronavirus and we were looking at possibly adding October but frankly, with everything that's going on with coronavirus and then the pressure of the city from the city to activate something we are now looking at a start date of the 30th of July and then going through the 56 days, total to the 23rd of September Other thing: that's been changed from the pure concept is at this time we're not preparing any food on site It's not really a restaurant and that's one hundred percent due to department of health complications and the fact that they can't even review a new plan, let alone vet.
I, don't expect that our position on the alcohol license would have changed no matter what, if anything, if we approve of the improvements given to the layout of the event generally, then, if anything, there would be more support and just to read, are we playing that we Accessibility I'm happy to hear people's opinions on that but I'd love to hear from other committee members I'm.
: I think, maybe you maybe you hopped in when we were explaining the pure concepts, the concept that doesn't involve a pandemic, that what we're looking at right now is one kiosk that serves beer, wine and prepared foods, which is most likely ice cream and If you follow my cursor every six feet, there will be a floor marking and that's where you stand when you're waiting to get served over Claire and we have a security position over here, Obviously the more points of sale.
It's a dynamic thing from an Operations standpoint, the more people you can service the better you're going to do from a revenue standpoint, but to do that safely and also for the first time in a new location like this, the more complicated you make these plans, the more these plans can go awry Has that been kind of thought out in terms of traffic and the bike lanes both on 25th Street and on Fifth Avenue This is a fence line.
You can still do it, but you can't do in so much of the city anymore as go inside a restaurant, and this offers the opportunity to sit with a friend and eat some food So I think the trade-off is important, so Todd : It's not an academic exercise, as we saw over many years with our concerns about 5th Avenue pedestrian navigation in the past, with eats I agree with you, but people just don't walk to Broadway I mean some people do, but many people just walk down the middle of Fifth Avenue Obviously, but if NYPD has weighed in on this or anything, but what will you do when people do walk outside of the planters down Fifth Avenue, because that's going to happen.
That is so important right now and you know some are supposed to be fun and people want to be outdoors, and so you know it's 56 days and I think that either maybe traffic patterns can be changed or pedestrian walking patterns can be changed.
I think it would behoove us to put our concerns and questions and support and all the things that we discussed today into a letter that can go out as soon as possible to the parks department and also do T to investigate this particular issue seems like it might be the one that we would have the most concern about, but also to pledge our public support generally for moving ahead with a revised, socially distant version of this event, what I see is framing our conversation, After listening to what Keats at the said had to say in the fact that it's just a short-term solution.
I think we should simply state There has been such a reduction in traffic down Fifth Avenue You know, given the reduction of general business activity in that district, that it might not be such a big deal for 50 days to take away that Lane You know people could walk down and I see everything that's going on Brian, especially given what the whole idea of having we're trying to generate more street traffic and the most important thing is just people getting out and walking around so, but I wouldn't make that you know I wouldn't make that stumbling block to get this done right simply , we asked the department we express our concerns about the OT if it's possible what's possible if it isn't in the future post pandemic Obviously.
Will we're not going to take this to a vote, but I will just move informally that we put these comments and questions into a letter, the biggest one being the fifth avenue navigation, but, most importantly, being on record supporting the revised iteration of this event for two cycles in a row and I will wait to consult with the psql chairs and with the key chair of the board as to how we want to rope into alcohol portion of that visa Be our letter, so that we're on the up and up, but in whatever way, we'll make sure that the letter goes out in a procedurally sound way that it is as helpful for you right now and as rapid as we can manage.
This was something that had been tossed around and Beck's a little bit about summer programs for youth this summer in the parks, citywide Kim I, wonder if you wanted to just frame this conversation and with your specific questions as well sure things so I had been thinking a lot about what youth will have to do this summer.
Of course we recognized the Summer, Youth, Employment, Program, being somewhat halted and, of course, programming in general being late to be released and so I had questions around how parks was creating a recreational calendar for youth this summer and just so fearful that there won't be things for kids to do, and you know without opportunities to either work or our skills or be physically active and engaged that they could turn to other behavior and so I think providing you know, positive calendar of events and things like that would be really helpful.
I also had questions about how we could better utilize community-based organizations that are experts at providing programming in our parks and how we could provide them with an expedited process for permitting for this summer and if that was being considered since they know how to do this really well already.
I, don't know, but you know we're waiting to hear wondering you know we can do whatever we want in a situation like this Obviously as we're the one who put this item on the agenda and I'm curious if you are moved to propose a resolution to ask the parks, department and City Hall to look at these specific questions rapidly, obviously taking public health into consideration.
You want to do a letter, well either a letter or a resolution, because if we write a letter, it can come from the committee as we've done before quickly and if it's a resolution you're concerned that we would have to wait for the film or that's right and I think the most important thing right now is for City Hall My only concern and One. Other point like I think this is part of a bigger conversation.
That's really the extent of the activity that can happen on this item during this meeting, but I think in the coming days, we'll figure out if there's another committee that can formally hear this, and if so it'll certainly be helpful for that committee to know that this committee reviewed it as well, unless there are any further thoughts on that I think Do. You want to take like a straw poll on how the committee, without any input from the public, which is what we need to make it official?
