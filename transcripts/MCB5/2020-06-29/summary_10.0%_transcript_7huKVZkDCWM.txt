That, you have already attended committee meetings, and, of course, full board, but this is the first time that you've actually been here for parks and public spaces, so for everyone's benefit.
We will leapfrog that item and we will jump right to Madison Square Park Conservancy, who are joining us to discuss revised plans for the food market in Worth's square I believe it would probably be who've the new committee members to have a little bit of context around what we are hearing tonight in the thumbnail sketch of this long.
History is that for many years there was a food market twice a year in word, And. We there was a lot of support in the community for this event, but there was also a lot of concerns around navigation issues and signage and other things, and over the course of many years we worked with the Conservancy to address those concerns and improve them year after year, at the time that the contract expired for that particular event, and it was time for a new one.
How, a new iteration of this food market could better address the public benefit in response to that, not in response to that, but over the course of several months, working with the Conservancy and the Parks Department on the language.
Those concerns included pedestrian navigation, down, Fifth Avenue along the east side of Worth's square sight lines above the event congestion, so that there's a possibility for navigation through Worth's square and a lot of interest in the identity of the vendors.
I think it may be a lot less because there's no workers in the park, but I would say that the people that come needed a lot more and so I do not know who have.
Think Clayton laid the context I'm going to hand it over to Rory who's working with Eataly, to kind of lay it all out for us, and so thank you for your time.
This is a brand new layout proposal that has passed muster with the Parks Department, so far, pending some social distancing stuff like sign- in to that, and it's the first time we're presenting it here to the community board.
The pure concept had a pizza, station, safer sandwiches and salad, a pasta station, a bar and escuela or school for interactive lessons and cooking lessons, and things like that, This was supposed to take place in May of this year and again in September of this year following the RFP and the model that was lab4 by parks and by CB5 over the past years , May was cancelled due to coronavirus and we were looking at possibly adding October but frankly, with everything that's going on with coronavirus and then the pressure of the city from the city to activate something.
But we can imagine that it would be people behind the glass behind the service counter explaining some of their products and Italy right now is working hard on getting those upstate farmers as partners for any kind of program starting the 30th.
There are two types of patron: The first type would be those receipt in the inn within the confines of Wirth square and to maintain social distancing, we're working with the parks Corbin on what we can get approved in terms of floor markings in combination with active attendees or ambassadors.
The idea is with a single line through the seating area: We can maintain that 6 foot, minimum social distancing and once people are sitting at their tables, of which this model calls for 32 top tables.
We are free to ask questions and comment, as we please tonight on this issue, but I believe that it is appropriate to leave it to the psql Committee to determine how to move forward, given that this particular seasonal license, we have never objected.
If we approve of the improvements given to the layout of the event generally, then, if anything, there would be more support, And just to read, are we playing that we Do not even think we brought you in to the psql Committee on this issue ever in my recollection, That said, as we move forward in a discussion.
So I think that if you're, not you know, if you do not want to be a patron, We can't create a single line just to view general Worth's monument.
We raised everything to run the part, so the revenues from this event are important: And, I, think, additionally, the ability to shop outside to go and get food and things that you can then eat whether you take it to go and go sit in the park or you take it to go in the home or It's really important to have access to outside services.
: I think, maybe you maybe you hopped in when we were explaining the pure concepts, the concept that does not involve a pandemic, that what we're looking at right now is one kiosk that serves beer, wine and prepared foods, which is most likely ice cream and How are you how what's the plan to keep the social distancing at that station?
It's a dynamic thing from an Operations standpoint, the more people you can service the better you're going to do from a revenue standpoint, but to do that safely, and also for the first time in a new location like this, the more complicated you make, these plans, the more these plans can go awry What is the plan in terms of having the line go in a certain direction, either towards a 24th, Street or tour or kind of going along side on the outside of it west of Fifth Avenue?
Do not think anyone would disagree with that, but the issue is just that, it's not an academic exercise, as we saw over many years with our concerns about 5th Avenue pedestrian navigation in the past, with eats they're just going to do.
There is no walkway down fifth, that then the west side of Fifth Avenue for the public unless you're coming through Italy, so Clayton and Todd to your point, and there is not a great plan to stop people from walking in traffic down Fifth Avenue.
We 're, checking them they're, maintaining their social distance they're, getting the signage they're speaking to an ambassador, And. Then we would have to create a chute we'd have to create a another perimeter to the west of this new lane to ensure that the people who are coming into the area, which is Italy's responsibility to keep safe, are kept safe from the unencumbered public and certainly the ones who had otherwise walk in the street.
If the restaurant is entitled to use a lane of traffic for seating, they may self, I mean how you know what is the degree of traffic right now at that spot, like how An open, question- Maybe.
Think that there is something about bringing back a little bit of spirit to the city that is so important right now, And, you know some are supposed to be fun and people want to be outdoors, And I think that either maybe traffic patterns can be changed or pedestrian walking patterns can be changed.
You know improving what the shape of this event and the process of that RFP I think it would behoove us to put our concerns and questions and support and all the things that we discussed today into a letter that can go out as soon as possible to the parks, Department and also do T to investigate this particular issue seems like it might be the one that we would have the most concern about, but also to pledge our public support generally for moving ahead with a revised, socially distant version of this event.
You know that I'm in the neighborhood And I see everything that's going on Brian, especially given what the whole idea of having we're trying to generate more street traffic and the most important thing is just people getting out and walking around so, I would not make that stumbling block to get this done right simply.
This event, so I wanted to call you out and see if you had any questions or comments at the moment, muted and Miriam You know is taking in that lane of traffic and because of the amount of time that it is, and That CB5 is advocating for an increased footprint for eats so many ways and Miriam The main kiosk is going to be the full width of the worst monument in front of it.
Will we're not going to take this to a vote, but I will just move informally that we put these comments and questions into a letter, the biggest one being the Fifth Avenue navigation, but, most importantly, being on record supporting the revised iteration of this event for two cycles in a row.
This was something that had been tossed around and Beck's a little bit about summer programs for youth this summer in the parks, citywide Kim. I, wonder if you wanted to just frame this conversation and with your specific questions as well sure things, so I had been thinking a lot about what youth will have to do this summer.
We recognized the Summer Youth Employment, Program, being somewhat halted, and, of course, programming in general being late to be released, and so I had questions around how parks was creating a recreational calendar for youth this summer and just so fearful that there won't be things for kids to do, and you know, without opportunities to either work or our skills or be physically active and engaged that they could turn to other behavior and so I think providing you know positive calendar of events and things like that would be really helpful.
As far as Park usage regard regarding dog parks and girl, spaces and basketball, hoops, and things like that, Already I also had questions about how we could better utilize community- based organizations that are experts at providing programming in our parks and how we could provide them with an expedited process for permitting for this summer and if that was being considered since they know how to do this really well.
If we're going to be able to issue permits, or for the summer right now, the system that you can not it, you can not submit an application So that we know what, when our situation is for the summer.
That's the point just that we could, with the direct questions as things move along I, think we would want to do our part to stay in touch with them and see what news we can get as it happened, because it is mid, July.
And I'm curious, if you are moved to propose a resolution to ask the parks, Department and City Hall, to look at these specific questions, rapidly, obviously taking public health into consideration.
You want to do a letter, well, either a letter or a resolution, because if we write a letter, it can come from the committee as we've done before quickly If it's a resolution, you're concerned that we would have to wait for the film or that's right, And I think the most important thing right now is for City Hall.
You know the systemic inequity that continues within marginalized populations and thinking about kids that do not have access to paid programming are the ones that take advantage of free, Park, Recreation.
The resolution is the way that we will end up moving forward, a fantastic things, Clayton, so I proposed a resolution to the parks Department that outlines that, as I had mentioned, before, with an entire generation of kids being at risk of you know being left even further behind because of the Corona virus pandemic and because of long- standing systemic inequities.
Park they've been working on that for several months, but it's been formalized now in the resolution last month, so they are coming to us to ask for our support for their proposal to move forward with advocating for a permanent exhibit.
