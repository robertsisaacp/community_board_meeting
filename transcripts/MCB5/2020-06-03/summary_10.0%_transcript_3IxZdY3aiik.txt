I will open up for questions by members of the committee, so I'm gonna ask you to use the raise hand, function and it's clayton clinton, In particular the signs which read seating is available to all, regardless of purchase.
They've asked us to remove some of the things that pertain to the larger plaza details in general, so this plan set I have here, is only pertaining to the cafe So. At the moment, I don't have a photo of that plaza sign, showing that seating is open to the public.
We understand that the way they operate it's unfortunate, but you know it is what it is Basically, what we have done in the past with cafes that are located within pops, mostly in midtown, is you know, reaching an agreement with the applicant where, basically, they would elect to add signage that would be approved, or that would be That would not raise any objections from the department of city planning, okay, but that would basically specify that you know the tables are open to the public and that purchasing is not required or you know, a plate of food.
I guess I was on mute, but the prior restaurant I think the last time when we went to city planning three years ago, I don't know it was clayton that brought it up again, but the last cafe put a sign on the stanchion table.
It doesn't look like the tables and chairs are socially distanced, and so I don't think this plan will stand for our reopening of Manhattan The design of the open air cafe, you know wasn't designed in you know in the current You know, situation honestly , I, don't know when you know in restaurant, even though it's outside- A dine in service is even going to be allowed.
We want to support you in this open-air cafe and so I just would like the applicant to keep in mind that things are going to change and it will benefit this This restaurant to be able to have outdoor dining as soon as the city sets the rules So. That was my concern.
We want these outdoor cafes to really succeed in our district, so that was my whole point and I think that the committee agrees- In the resolution Do. We have any further questions by members of the committee?
New members are almost ever appointed directly to the land use committee and therefore we don't have any new members per se, but dave achilles, who has been on the board for a number of years, has joined our committee He used to serve on the yellow landmarks committee and I approached him away from my other committee so that he can come and work with us You know dave lives in the 50s in Manhattan and his neighborhood has been dealing with tremendous change and growth, not always good growth, so his perspective will be invaluable, The second part of our meeting is really a discussion item with a bit of action that I believe we should take You know sort of like brainstorming grasping you know the impact of coving cove 19 on on the city and, more specifically on our district We are we are in still in the middle of this health crisis that has a tremendous ramifications and impacts in so many areas, and you know it would be a little foolish to imagine that we're going to pass a resolution that will, you know, address all the issues or you know point to what would be the right direction.
I was personally really shocked that you know the the engagement by the mayor with the communities The first item that I would like to to discuss with you guys is you know, passing a resolution calling on the mayor to basically open up these panels and appoint community board members and certainly to involve us and the reason why I think it's really important that we are involved is that cb5 is, you know, we're the business district We are so critical to the health and vitality and recovery of the entire city.
Yes nancy go ahead, so the mayor gave a speech I've been watching him every day and he talked about how he wanted clergy and block associations to join in with him on how to plan the reopening and what we're going through, but he did not mention community boards.
So I definitely think it should be a resolution Okay other members of the committee If anything I think we could go further and advocate for a more formal mechanism of sharing information for review and soliciting feedback from community boards ongoing basis, as the reopening happens for so many different issues, You know because there have been prior press conferences and things where the phrase in consultation with community boards has been bandied about, and it is meaningless.
and I've been getting a lot of email from the neighbors recently about how they've got a feeling they've been deserted by the city government they're, not getting any feedback from council members or the mayor or anybody , so I think there's a couple of things that could happen with this resolution.
The resolution will call for community board engagement and we're going to be a little selfish, but we're going to say that you know really: : cb5 must have a seat at the table and a formal ongoing mechanism for input to be provided to various city agencies.
Would that would you know, hopefully address a problem like the like residential vacancy in a market-driven sort of way , That's a specific policy, and we don't need to marry ourselves to it, but I totally support at least addressing it as a problem in our in our resolution and saying that the city needs to approach it from a policy perspective If we're talking about a 10-year plan, do we want to include a reference to the incredible lack of planning immediately evident in the mayor's new budget that is being proposed?
you know what kind of requests we would like to make, and this is something that, at the next bex committee meeting, you guys can discuss sure fantastic Thank, you, okay, The city needs to plan resolution.
and I think a new mayor will be looking for a lot of new wins coming off of a great new report about something So, basically, if everybody is okay, we would draft another resolution in which we would call on the city to do a more thorough job to plan and have a 10-year plan that could be specifically geared towards addressing the grave urban issues that we're going to be faced with due to kovic, 19 and I.
And you know we don't really have a business committee as the other community boards may have, but you know the thought of having you know: I just heard from midtown north and they're saying that people have been leaving behind boxes of bricks and rocks around the neighborhood Some of this violence is being planned ahead of time, keep an eye out if you notice anything like that.
I would like to hear from our elected officials on how they assess the situation, what they make of it and what kind of leadership they are going to push for or implement right now, I haven't heard the mayor, certainly and I- think that you know pushing for those kinds of answers would seem like a good idea and we don't have to do it through a resolution.
I think it should be a resolution to be counterproductive and then I will open up to members of the public.
I think that the consensus that we don't feel that a resolution would be the right tool at that particular moment, and you know, obviously it's a a fast evolving situation and Thank you so much nancy for taking these photos and sharing them with the with the committee and we will be in touch offline by email so that we can get to work and prepare for the the july meeting.
