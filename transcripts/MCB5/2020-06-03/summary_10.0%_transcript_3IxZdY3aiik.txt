, I'm, the chair of the land, use housing and zoning committee of Manhattan community board 5.
The application is for a renewal of an open-air cafe that is located in the plaza fronting east 48th street.
You can see that there are 12 tables within that area designated in the dotted line for the open, air, cafe, 12 tables and a total of 48 seats between both plazas.
The seating in the cafe I would like to mention is also always open to the public.
This application seeks a renewal of the open air to permit the open air cafe in the south, plaza affiliated with the restaurant on the ground floor of the building.
I will open up for questions by members of the committee, so I'm gonna ask you to use the raise hand.
Basically, what we have done in the past with cafes that are located within pops, mostly in midtown, is you know, reaching an agreement with the applicant where basically, they would elect to add signage that would be approved, or that would be.
That would not raise any objections from the department of city planning, okay, but that would basically specify that you know the tables are open to the public and that purchasing is not required.
You know any potential users that certainly yeah some something like the card on the table would be something that appears on the plan.
Don't know that it's really incumbent on us right now to ask the applicant to redesign the cafe.
We want to support you in this open-air cafe, and so I.
Button pushed okay, so seeing non working, I'm going to open up the floor to members of the public.
Anybody have an objection to this proposal, all right, so seeing none I'll make a motion to approve with added languages which is discussed about signage and keeping in mind that social distancing will be necessary, pulling on the the city agency and the council to quickly come up with the new roles so that those businesses can operate while providing all the necessary safety to patrons pedestrians, employees and second losers, All right.
The resolution will be presented to the full board of community work, five on thursday June, the 12th, and, given that it's a unanimous vote, I, really don't anticipate that there would be any controversy at the full board.
As you know, dave lives in the 50s in Manhattan, and his neighborhood has been dealing with tremendous change and growth, not always good growth, so his perspective will be invaluable, so So. The second part of our meeting is really a discussion item with a bit of action that I believe we should take, and I.
We are in still in the middle of this health crisis that has a tremendous ramifications and impacts in so many areas, and you know it would be a little foolish to imagine that we're going to pass a resolution that will, you know, address all the issues or you know point to what would be the right.
You know, passing a resolution calling on the mayor to basically open up these panels and appoint community board members and certainly to involve us and the reason why I think it's really important that we are involved is that cb5 is, you know, we're the business district.
I think it should be a resolution, but you know I'm, certainly opening open to hearing your your thoughts on content and form of this request and advocacy.
It's upsetting, I think, for our given our position within the city to be excluded from that process, and I would urge us to put the strongest possible resolution that we could and bring it to the full board, as has been said, and then also to make sure that we have a suggestion for what the right mechanism for touching base with us would be, and the only question I have to the group is: Should we include some of our objectives or key concerns in that resolution, or should we try to do that after we are able to hopefully establish that communication?
I agree with the idea of doing this as a resolution and and putting some content in there specifically about what community board engagement would look.
It is becoming more acute and more critical now, but you would be comfortable with leaving this out of this resolution or not making it a main ask, but really focusing on getting ourselves to the you know a seat at the table.
I, don't know exactly what it is, but I do think there has to be an action plan with the resolution.
You know a whole layer of land use and planning that we basically need to our sleeves and start working on so then.
The next mayor will be the next president of the next city, council, members and so forth, and so thinking about a time horizon that would allow us to get those recommendations into the bloodstream of the policy discussion in the meat of when these people will be selected.
The resolution will call for community board engagement and we're going to be a little selfish.
While, also eliminating virtually none of the nypd's budget, I think that it is very relevant and well within our jurisdiction, as a land use committee to weigh in on that We will add language on the lack of planning that is evident in the budget and specifically pinpointing to cuts on affordable, housing.
You have these gigantic developments, going on like hudson yards and like the far west, 57th area, where there's like 15 or 20 new buildings, the fact that no idea or concept of hospitalization for these poor homeless people that don't need afford people need for affordable apartments, of course, but the way we treat our mentally ill homeless- If we can get some language in there about putting hospitalization back in and especially targeting the homeless people, Julie, I want to call on you, because I know that bex is working on that issue.
The city needs to plan resolution.
You, will mention the hospital closures, vacancy residential vacancy rates in our district and, more specifically, around midtown and billionaires row, and with a an explanation that we're going to get to work That would be a resolution.
I, think that we may want to you know, appoint ourselves, You know get organized and go to work so that you know maybe next month we can.
And you know we don't really have a business committee as the other community boards may have.
We can't answer those questions, I'm, not sure exactly what the purpose of a resolution would be: Rachel nick, it doesn't sound like there's a support for a resolution, and I think I'm, But maybe we can use the resources of the board office and the you know, police council, that we participate on to ask these questions and to see.
You, know, I'm, very glad that we're discussing the matter tonight, but I think that it's probably a good idea to hold off on a resolution for all the reasons that ej just underscored.
Think that you know pushing for those kinds of answers would seem like a good idea.
