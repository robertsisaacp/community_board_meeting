The application is for a renewal of an open- air cafe that is located in the Plaza fronting East 48Th Street.
You can see that there are 12 tables within that area designated in the dotted line for the open, air, cafe, 12 tables and a total of 48 seats between both plazas.
The seating in the cafe I would like to mention is also always open to the public.
What we were working with city planning this time around was to consolidate the tables in a more linear fashion, pull them away from the seating along the West planters and keep them more tightly circumscribed with each other.
I will open up for questions by members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raise hand.
I do know that going to city planning about it is pointless.
That would not raise any objections from the Department of City planning, okay, but that would basically specify that you know the tables are open to the public and that purchasing is not required.
You know, be a problem then for city planning , I guess I was on mute, but the prior restaurant.
It does not look like the tables and chairs are socially distanced, and so I do not think this plan will stand for our reopening of Manhattan.
I think that it is probably fair to say that you know once those requirements have been, you know spelled out by the City Council and then ratified by the mayor.
So I do not know that it's really incumbent on us right now to ask the applicant to redesign the cafe.
And I think that the committee agrees, and you know probably the full award that you know there's going to be tremendous changes We want these operators to be successful and to be compliant and to keep everybody safe, In the resolution.
So seeing non working, I'm going to open up the floor to members of the public.
Anybody have an objection to this proposal, all right, so seeing none I'll make a motion to approve with added languages which is discussed about signage and keeping in mind that social distancing will be necessary, pulling on the the city agency and the council to quickly come up with the new roles so that those businesses can operate while providing all the necessary safety to patrons pedestrians, employees and second losers, All right.
As you know, new members are almost ever appointed directly to the land Use committee and therefore we do not have any new members per se, but Dave achilles, who has been on the board for a number of years, has joined our committee.
That has a tremendous ramifications and impacts in so many areas, and you know it would be a little foolish to imagine that we're going to pass a resolution that will, you know, address all the issues or you know point to what would be the right.
The first item that I would like to to discuss with you guys, is, you know, passing a resolution calling on the mayor to basically open up these panels and appoint community board members and certainly to involve us and the reason why I think it's really important that we are involved is that CB5 is, you know, we're the business district.
I think it should be a resolution, but you know I'm, certainly opening open to hearing your your thoughts on content and form of this request and advocacy.
It's, upsetting, I think, for our given our position within the city to be excluded from that process, and I would urge us to put the strongest possible resolution that we could and bring it to the full board, as has been said, and then also to make sure that we have a suggestion for what the right mechanism for touching base with us would be, and the only question I have to the group is: Should we include some of our objectives or key concerns in that resolution, or should we try to do that after we are able to hopefully establish that communication?
That we were surprised that you know no community board members were appointed or consulted that there was no formal engagement.
Think the response by the board, president herself and her staff and other community Board chairs was actually very supportive, and I do not know if you want to speak further on that vicky now you're on mute.
It is becoming more acute and more critical now, but you would be comfortable with leaving this out of this resolution or not making it a main ask, but really focusing on getting ourselves to the you know a seat at the table.
I do not know exactly what it is, but I do think there has to be an action plan with the resolution.
You know schools, so we're going to have to work on that, and I think you know The committee should basically embrace that.
You know a whole layer of land use and planning that we basically need to our sleeves and start working on so then.
The next mayor will be the next president of the next city, council, members and so forth, and so thinking about a time horizon that would allow us to get those recommendations into the bloodstream of the policy discussion in the meat of when these people will be selected.
The resolution will call for Community Board engagement and we're going to be a little selfish.
I think that it is very relevant and well within our jurisdiction, as a land use committee to weigh in on that We will add language on the lack of planning that is evident in the budget and specifically pinpointing to cuts on affordable, housing.
If we can get some language in there about putting hospitalization back in and especially targeting the homeless people, Julie, I want to call on you, because I know that bex is working on that issue.
The city needs to plan resolution.
If everybody is okay, we would draft another resolution in which we would call on the city to do a more thorough job to plan and have a 10-year plan that could be specifically geared towards addressing the grave urban issues that we're going to be faced with due to Kovic, 19.
But I think that in the coming month, we're going to have to do a lot of work.
You, will mention the hospital closures, vacancy residential vacancy rates in our district and, more specifically, around Midtown and billionaires row, and with a an explanation that we're going to get to work And, we will come up with what we believe is a strong plan for resilience for CB5.
I. Think that we may want to you know, appoint ourselves.
And you know we do not really have a business committee as the other community boards may have.
It does not sound like there's a support for a resolution, and I think I'm, But maybe we can use the resources of the board office and the you know, police council, that we participate on to ask these questions and to see.
You, know, I'm, very glad that we're discussing the matter tonight, but I think that it's probably a good idea to hold off on a resolution for all the reasons that Ej just underscored.
I do not think we're going to be talking about that in July, but definitely you know come September.
