That applies to all of the city and all the different building typologies that we have the applicability of the different bulk regulations that I'm not really going to get into too much in this presentation are meant for those areas that are within the flip plane, but there are some city-wide regulations that I will be discussing.
Okay, So there are four different regulations that do apply to the city-wide basis, so all buildings, all areas, not just those that are located within the floodplain.
So they can't be placed in required open, spaces, The. Second, one is related to access, and so this is also saying that any of these ramps that would make buildings, ADA accessible, would also be permitted.
So typically, we see that, if you have say a retail space in a residential zone without a commercial overlay where it's a legally non-conforming use, it's allowed to be there, but it's not.
This is why we're reviewing it, and so with that said, I will open up the floor to questions from members of the committee on this citywide zoning text.
Yes, So just wondering if you could explain a little bit more I think this is where a lot of the like implications- come.
In practice this is going to be in community district 5, just because a lot of these buildings, like I, said already incorporate them into the building, but it would be allowed in open yards or rear yards of some residential buildings and just to follow up on that.
It's, a less significant ask of zoning in a way it's not modifying bulk of a building, and it's just really allowing property owners to be conservative.
Are, these power systems, and also these ADA accessible ramps, and these are both things that we think that would be appropriate, regardless of where they're located with respect to the flood zone.
My other question, is you know, as you know, We are very concerned about some mechanical voids loopholes that the Department of city planning has actually worked.
On, eliminating, and you know trying to fix the tech so that this little ploy by developers to use excessive mechanical space to increase the height of their buildings without using any far is eliminated.
This concern ill-founded on our end, I think it's always great to have those concerns and look at any text and try to identify different areas where you would have unintended consequences.
Think that is a concern here and currently does this text amendment restrict the use of sellers as mechanical space.
I think that's really important, because this is a way for architects and developers to use space that wouldn't otherwise not be allowed, and we are not in a flood plain.
So is everybody, Okay, with a motion that could be an approval, providing that generators would not be permitted in rare yards and flagging that to DCP telling them that you know.
This is just allowing them as the permitted obstructions, and so the types of concerns that you're outlining would kind of be something for both city planning and for DOB to address because of the ones that regulate the size and type for the building and again, I just want to reiterate the efficiency of placing the mechanicals in the within the building, especially when you have larger buildings like you.
This is an advanced briefing on the project which is being held prior to the public scoping hearing, which is scheduled for December 21st, and this is for the purpose of commenting on the draft scope of work, So we'll be back to discuss the building itself.
We'll then turn our attention to the proposed project by reviewing our goals and guiding principles, and then John will take you through a bit of the proposed project, mostly focusing on improvements to the public realm and then, Since tonight's presentation is really looking forward to that scoping hearing later, this month, we'll touch a bit on the proposed land use actions and look forward to the next steps and finally, of course, We'll leave time for questions and answers.
And, of course, Our neighbor to the north is grand central market, and the interesting thing apart about this site is the 456 subway line that actually runs diagonally below it.
This is of such tremendous importance that it's been a major factor in almost all of the decision making on this project, from the improvements of the transit system, to the location of the public, open space, and, of course, obviously, the architecture, the engineering and the construction of the building.
Everyone knows how crowded the sidewalks are and how busy the subway entrances can become, and on 42nd street that cantilevered restaurant really has kind of an imposing presence that blocks views of grand central terminal beyond and the engine the entrance is from Lexington to the subway and grand central terminal.
You have the foresight to realize that the importance of new high quality office space in Midtown, which is even more important in the age of Covid-19, because we all know the fact is that most companies move their offices from time to time and when they move they'll, look for the best available option and we want that option to be in east Midtown.
So you'll see this intense connectivity on four different levels above grade in the new public open spaces at grade with new sight lines and improved sidewalks one level below grade with better access to the subway and even further underground.
There will be about 12,000 square feet of retail on the project, and that includes the MTA controlled retail within grand central terminal itself and they'll also be significant public realm improvements, including subway and mass transit improvements, publicly accessible, open space and really to an extent that far exceeds the 10,000 square.
Area, height and setback, street wall continuity and other district plan elements, as well as the publicly accessible open space regulations.
We're, also making zoning text amendments to those existing special permits that I discussed in the first bullet we're reducing the number of required bicycle parking spaces from 286 to about 100 spaces, which we think makes sense.
Is with grand central on the ground level and how many of the public spaces of grand central kind of flow past right through our site, like the Lexington passage and then the three major subway entrances to the 42nd street station kind of cut into our site, the one at 42nd street, the one off the Lexington passage.
This is a cross-section of the Lexington passage looking to the south and the red line cutting through there is the existing ceiling height, So we are going to be able to almost double the height in the Lexington passage for much of its length and create a much grander, more visible, light filled entrance on Lexington Avenue and then in the middle here, where you see the 456 circles, that's the existing entrance down to the subway, which will remain unchanged and then just to the right of that is a new bank of escalators that will take people up from the Lexington passage to our office.
This is one of those office buildings where the office lobby has to be on the second floor because of all this transit stuff going on the first floor, we are not able to bring the elevator hits below grade, and so the entire lobby is up on the second level, and.
We are expecting that approximately half of the building's tenants will use this elevator bank here and the other half will use the front door which will be on 42nd street, and then you can also you're just starting to get peaks of the public realm that we're going to be proposing above here.
How, the other subway entrance from Lexington is also coming in and that has opened up all kinds of new staircases over there which are currently, You know completely hidden and very much inaccessible.
Those are the structural landings for the site, and so you can see you know how little area we have to bring the structure down for the project.
We found a way to literally set the building back, not on the first level, where we need all of the space to create all of the connections.
We've set it back on the second level in a way that creates all of this open space, and this was an idea that came to us very early on in the project when we met with Gail Brewer and she happened to have given this a lot of thought.
You know that we're hoping to kind of program with some individual, smaller buildings, I, think if we go to the you, can get a slightly better perspective on that.
That's where people can come up from Lexington, Avenue kind of a two-story thing with you know public seating both on the lower level and on the upper level, and.
Tenants, It's going to be a sizable office, population here, as well as the public, but the main way that you get to these spaces are through these huge grand staircases that come down to 42nd street right at the middle of the site.
Right at the front door to our site, So these staircases, these civic staircases, you know very much-- are going to be defining.
We've got little elevators strategically located in lots of places to make sure that all of these spaces are very much accessible for everybody and I.
You can watch or participate in the meeting using the second web link, which you can also find at the first one and, of course, we'll return shortly to present the building design and we'll do that in connection with an application that we'll be making to the landmarks Preservation Commission, seeking a report on the harmonious relationship between our building and the in grand central terminal.
That is the actual area where the building will eventually rise to because it looks like the building is bowl shaped and expanding out into the air space.
That's correct, as I mentioned, The building sets back at these lower levels and expands out as it rises, and that's how we've been able to create these open spaces.
Sorry, at the lower levels, we're able to expand those sight lines of grand central terminal and the Chrysler building, and all these other great landmarks, as well.
It requires a specific number of bike parking spots per gross square foot of the building and when you get to a building of this size, when you run the map, it turns out that you need a little bit over 200 parking spots for bikes, which you know it takes up a tremendous amount of space.
What we found is that no one really uses it, so we actually have a bunch of other buildings of similar size across New, York City, and we found that those all had bike rooms of about 100 spaces and.
We thought that reducing the bike parking space at this project to about a hundred also made sense, considering both that experience and the fact that we're you know very well serviced by public transportation.
The way to address this at this level would be to actually ask that accessibility be fully studied, okay, right, taking into account the fact that very often elevators and escalators break down, and that we have to factor this into the number of such equipment to be allocated to provide constant, ADA accessibility to all the areas.
If I could answer that a little bit more, it's David Karnovsky from free Frank, the East Midtown text, actually does provide in the provision that relates to the transfer of Florida from landmarks that if the distribution of Florida is to a site that is adjacent to contiguous to grand central, a harmonious relationship report is required from LPC and while we'll be making the distribution for Florida in a slightly different way, we are maintaining that requirement to go to LPC and obtain that determination.
The way that the floor will be distributed is across the zoning lot boundaries, because I think Michael mentioned this.
So the floor will distribute over the zoning lot lines and in connection with that, There will be this harmonious relationship, report, okay, so that was going to be.
The benefit of is essentially that when you look at this as a single qualifying site, you have the ability to generate through the special permits for transit improvements and for public realm improvements, significantly greater amounts of floor area and therefore significantly greater improvements, I'm, not sure I follow that, but.
If you sure, if you look at lot 30 alone in the Commodore side alone and apply the bonus rates to that site, alone, the amount of bonus floor and therefore the size of the improvements is significantly smaller than if you generate it.
And you'll be set back also on and then on, 42nd street, where we are setting back, but the setback is occupied largely by these civic staircases that take you up to the public space on the second level, okay.
Phase, two to be constructed by the MTA or by you know a different developer, also seeking transit improvement rights in East, Midtown.
But, once again, Mike I think it's very important that we asked that to be studied in the environmental life statement and that it becomes part of the proposal so very important to make sure it makes its way into our recommendations and that becomes part of the scope.
So, Let's start who would like to make the first comment, members of the committee on this important proposal.
Another example of the brutal brutality of some architecture that just grabs and takes as much space as humanly possible, So I think that you know, let's keep in mind, that we're really commenting on the scope.
Ej, you know I think I might make a similar comment about pedestrian connections to things that are currently under consideration.
I just want to make sure that members of the committee understand what it means that they're going to seek an approval for the definition of the qualifying site as being one qualifying site with the terminal and the Hyatt.
The way that the text works is that you know if you do a transit, upgrade you get, Three far, You know an additional 3, far so floor area ratio is basically the square footage of the base of your lot multiplied by a multiplier.
I saw any plans for any similar, and now it's not going to be the same amount, but any similar amount of media, meaning meeting event space or any kind of food and beverage inside the hotel.
You know I think maybe in the parks section of the EIS, we should flag that you know the space has to remain public.
I mean how would people even know that there's a park on the second level of this building.
Second, the issues on the public space I, think that is a concern you know.
Other comment is that you know that the density that this building is going to do on one of the busiest intersections in the world I think is understated and I.
You know I, look, there's, The transit improvement is great, but the reality is that not everyone, who's going to be working in this building is going to be coming from grand central.
The buses, the you know, the people there's going to be people who drive into the city who work in that building.
The impact on the density in this now mixed-use, commercial plus hotel is astronomical and I think that you know again in one of the busiest corners in the world.
You know that needs to be really studied because I do think.
Our board is gonna, be doing some response right to the scope at some point, so I think we have one that we did for one Vanderbilt and people could look at that and build on that.
The study may yield the conclusion that you know it's not the right, location, But I think it's a good idea to flag.
Okay, so I think we have a good list of the areas that we want to comment.
It will be just you know, a list of the areas of concern that we want studied as part of the environmental impact.
This is a an application for a BSA variants to permit the development of non-conforming, troll, story, mixed-use, commercial and residential building in an m16 district.
We're here for variance application, request, which we came before you about a year ago, almost exactly last November, The property is at 118, West, 28th Street, and if it's okay with you I'd like to share the screen with you, would that be acceptable.
That's right next door, as well as multiple residential uses on the block, we're in an m16 zoning district, we're entitled to build a 10 far from manufacturing or office.
Also, in addition to that, we've experienced Covid-19, which has had its own special effect on hotels and office spaces, and this site, which I'll go through a little bit more.
We'll go through with you, why it's not so suited for office use and why we're asking you permission or for variants to allow it to be developed as a residential, building, This page explains to you.
The left side tells you what we're asking for, which is what I just explained, which is the top left, we're asking for a BSA variants to allow a 12-story residential building in an m16 zoning.
What's allowed we're sensitive to you, We know your board is sophisticated and knowledgeable in zoning and has a very clear image of what you want to see created in your neighborhood.
I, believe your economic impact analysis was done prior to Covid-19, But have you considered that you know obviously, given the situation that we are in, that it also may not be favorable to construct a luxury or even market rate condo building either.
There is nothing there right now for office, obviously, and whatever there was for hotels, is surely gone as well, so that that's how we feel about residential.
Well, The setback is a 20-foot rear, yard, but I think the question that was just being asked: is: What's the setback for the as of right, commercial, Austin.
If, you can go to the plan for the as of right, commercial I think he was asking me what the setback is in the front.
Okay, so please go ahead and tell us specifically what, in what ways this building is not going to be conforming as it pertains to the use to the bulk to the height to the rear yard and the setback requirements.
So, even though it might sound a little counter-intuitive that rule is actually not applicable in an m16 zoning district, but I, see where she's going.
You know a few pointers for members of the committee, so this is a BSA variance in order for a BSA variance to be granted, The applicant needs to satisfy five findings.
I think that this is the best use for this building.
This were to be in a residential or a commercial district, The sliver rule would apply, and the essence you know behind the sliver rule is that a very narrow lot should not be developed higher than either the width of this, The street or 60 feet, whichever one is greater, so I think in that case it's the width of the screen, the street, which is 75 feet, so I think that the applicant is asking a lot.
A use change you know, bringing residential development in a manufacturing district is something that really we don't.
As a result of that, The amount of light that will come to the sidewalk will be that much diminished as opposed to a building that would be, You know conforming use, because then it would also have to conform to the bulk requirements of this district, and you know, I agree that the site is very narrow but as narrow as it is for a commercial development.
I think that it is very narrow for residential development and although the numbers are made to appear that you know they support the case for hardship.
The bulk was conforming to the zoning requirement, The residential analysis would be different and it would be much closer to the result that we have with the commercial development and then finally, You know, overall, we've been dealing with these applications that come to us over, And they're, located in this area.
Laila I, have to compliment your foresight, because when we were discussing the zoning change and the special permit requirement for hotel use, you said this was going to happen, and now here we are so we were anticipating this problem.
And I think we need to protect the commercial use that you saw was going to be coming under attack.
I mean when we evaluated the zoning tax amendment, For you know, hotel special permit and manufacturing districts.
Is it time for this area of our district to be rezoned, there's a great case for it, but I really feel that you know the BSA approach is not the right.
You, know the ability to build residential on a very narrow, plot.
I think that you know that the lot is narrow for commercial building, but also for residential building and I.
You know, I'm, not sure that the layout that we saw as being proposed is necessarily the most efficient layout for commercial use.
You know shifted to the occupants of those residential units, so I wouldn't be able to support a use.
You know like a more systematic use, change in this district, That I think that the route is Arizona.
I would be perfectly okay with that, but I would be willing to support a use change for this area, because we've seen what hotels have done to that street and to the flower market.
I. Like, I, don't think, there's I, don't know if there's an elevation, but I can go back to the diagram that showed like all of the buildings in the area and like the building.
The Nancy, The adjacent building you know, is a hotel.
We should also take the opportunity to comment that a rezoning, a more systemic use change should be entertained by the Department of City planning to provide the unnecessary relief in a way that would not amount to spot zoning which this Vsa action would amount to all right.
Pursuant to section 15-20 b of the zoning resolution to waive the four area: preservation requirements of section 25-21 for permitted commercial and manufacturing uses to allow the conversion of an existing 11 story, building to group use two which is residential, use, so brace yourselves, because it's almost like what we just did, except that it's totally different.
Think there's even a couple of sites that have no buildings.
and there are three lines: here: one is on the in the top on this side of the street and on the bottom numbers, not so important, but it tells you how many stories each of the buildings are and how many residential units are on each of the blocks of the two sides.
I think don't view these as favor as a whole building or as favorably as a residential unit.
The part that is important to also understand is that there is a preservation requirement and when I use preservation, it is in a land use context, meaning that a commercial use should be preserved, and you know technically, The building should have some commercial use and should not be 100 residential, and in that instance, the applicant wants a 100 residential use to become permitted.
I, think you were referring to this concept right here, where it says less than five thousand square feet one floor plus in buildings of more than six stories.
It's about 4,300 square feet and comprises about 10 of the building's floor area right because I think it's even a little more 10.
I just want to express my support for the conversion to residential use, affordable housing, as I think.
I. Think that a true mixed use would be great, but I see that the applicant is already making a gesture with keeping the ground floor as commercial, so.
You know the first one is the use that residents and other stakeholders of Cd5 would have of governor's island and also the implications and the precedent that such development could set for other public open, space.
You, know commercially viable to pay for the park, itself, which I think is.
Page 16 is a comparison that justifies the zoning change and they're like comparing governors island to other development projects around the city, which you know one could argue.
But has a lot of you know is mostly open space and those two zones, and this shows that the shadow impact on what those two new developments would be in a March September zone.
You know it is zoned for residential.
Think that the implications here you know as far as we are concerned are really you.
You know I think that it's relevant for us to comment on what do you.
Just to be clear on your second point, like we're saying that the we're saying that the presentation as proposed for this development would negatively impact the open space that we're advocating for.
