Hi, sorry for speaking, I'm just making sure Austin can hear me because he's taking notes, okay cool. He said yes, thank you all right good evening. Everyone thank you for being with us tonight. This is the land use, housing and zoning committee of Manhattan community board five. My name is Leila Lo Giziko, I'm the chair, a few words about how the meeting is going to proceed. Tonight. We have five items on the agenda. Four applications and one item for comment. The applications will be presented by their respective applicants. Each applicant will have an opportunity to give a full and uninterrupted yet concise presentation. Once this presentation concludes, members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions. Then I will open up before to members of the public. Members of the public will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments. Applicants will have an opportunity to respond to these questions and comments. Once this period concludes, we will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter. Members of the committee will comment and discuss the application and we will make a motion. We will take this motion to a vote. This vote will become the position of the committee. This position of the committee will be forwarded to the full Board of Community Board, five, which meets on Thursday December, the 10th. This motion will be discussed by the full board and the full board will vote on the motion. The vote of the whole board becomes the official position of community board 5. A few words specifically about tonight's meeting. I want to make you all aware that we have an extremely full agenda with some important items that are in front of us, so in order to swiftly go through these applications and give them their due process. I will ask you a few things when you ask questions, and this is both for members of the committee and members of the public. Please stay on point address the item that is in front of us when you ask your question, don't preface your question as to why you're making the question we know you're qualified to ask the question. Just ask the question and be as factual, specific and concise as possible during your coming period, there will be a limit to two minutes for members of the public for their comments. If I see that we have a very large number of members of the public who wish to comment in order to accommodate everyone and be mindful of all the applicants, I will limit comments to one minute. So please keep that in mind. You are welcome to submit more lengthy comments through the board office. The address for the board office, the email address is office Cb5.Org. You can also go on the website Cd5.Org and find ways to communicate with us and with all of that being said, we will jump just right in the first item on the agenda. Tonight is an application for a zoning tax amendment that has been introduced by the Department of City planning for zoning in coastal flooding zones. I think we have the team from DCP with us and the floor is yours, so jump right in please concise presentation really much appreciated. Of course, can you hear me? Okay, great okay, so just a brief introduction, my name is Matthew Petras I believe I met some of you last year in person. I'm excited to see you now. So, as the chair mentioned, we have a text amendment that we're proposing that's called zoning for coastal flood resiliency, and this is really to make permanent a lot of the regulations that we put into effect after Hurricane Sandy. So it's trying to make it a little the city more resilient from the building perspective. So here are three maps each showing the annual chance floodplain on the left. We see the one percent in blue you'll notice that CB5 is not included in any of these maps. It is landlocked and none of the topography would lend itself to flooding in this area. But you can see that a lot of the air, a lot of New York itself is affected, and so we have about a million New Yorkers who are living in the floodplain. That floodplain is quite diverse. We have different ponds in Queens. We have different islands around Manhattan. We have the rockaways, which are different houses that we see here in the lower left, and then we also have more central and larger buildings. This slide is really just to say that this is a city-wide text. Amendment that's trump that applies to all of the city and all the different building typologies that we have the applicability of the different bulk regulations that I'm not really going to get into too much in this presentation are meant for those areas that are within the flip plane, but there are some city-wide regulations that I will be discussing so here's this is the big one that I think everybody should walk away with. Is that the zoning for coastal flood resiliency text amendment is making permanent temporary zoning rules that have already been adopted, and so those happened post Sandy we learned from those regulations. We've made some adaptations to them, but these all of these regulations are really designed to make it easier for buildings to meet building encode. So, if you're located within this flood plain, you have to meet certain building codes to make your building flood proof or allow for certain uses to be located outside of the flood plain, and so this text amendment is to make it easier to meet those code requirements. There's four different goals, only two of which I'm really going to talk about, because the two that are related to buildings don't really apply here. I'd be happy to go into more depth in the Q&A about those if anybody's curious, but I'm really just going to focus on what is applying to this community district. So the first is extending the applicability. So currently, the applicability of the zoning for coastal for our zoning rules is just in that one percent plane. And so, if you look at the map on the left, it's all the area, that's in orange! That's where our rules currently apply. The proposed rule would extend that to those gray areas that you see on the left. So it's actually instead of having the one percent annual chance flood plain, which is the 100 year, flood we're extending it to the 500 year. Flood as well, and so it's saying that you can have these flexible rules further out, because we're projecting that sea level rise and climate change is going to make it harder for the city to be resilient because we're going to see flooding further and further into the upland of the rivers. This slide could be called community district 5 in applicability, but it I just named it applicability, as we can see here, the 100-year flood and the 500-year flood, which are shown in blue and orange, don't apply here, and so that's why we're not going to I'm not going to be talking about any of those building specific regulations more just the citywide ones. Okay, so there are four different regulations that do apply to the city-wide basis, so all buildings, all areas, not just those that are located within the floodplain and they're related to four different areas. The first is power systems. The second is talking about ADA access. The third is the sighting of nursing homes or vulnerable populations in the flood zone, and then the last is a really technical one. That's putting in place a disaster recovery framework to make it easier to respond to disasters, whether they be induced by climate change or economic or in the pandemic that we're currently in so the first is related to these power systems and so power systems when they flood, as some of you may have been aware, during Hurricane Sandy, there was a there have been power outages, and so this is allowing for generators in any type of energy, storing infrastructure to be elevated in open spaces. So currently, these are not considered permitted obstructions, and so they can't be placed in required open spaces. So your front yards and your backyards, but this text amendment would allow those to be located as permitted obstructions in those areas. The second one is related to access, and so this is also saying that any of these ramps that would make buildings, ADA accessible, would also be permitted obstructions. The third point is about the vulnerable populations, and so we saw that nursing homes in particular, were some of the hardest hit types of buildings and uses during Sandy, and that's really for two reasons. The first being it's really difficult to evacuate once you're flooded and this population is reliant upon medical care, sometimes constant, medical care and evacuation. There is sometimes essential to the well-being of the residents in those homes. The second reason is because a lot of the folks that are in nursing homes do rely on medical equipment for their well-being and, if there's a power outage, which often results from flooding that could jeopardize their safety as well, and so this text amendment would prohibit the sighting of nursing homes in the one percent annual chance floodplain, so that again, that's nowhere in community district five, but anywhere in this map in gray, you can no longer you wouldn't be able to place any new nursing home facilities. Everything in light gray is fine. Okay, the last regulation that we're proposing is a disaster recovery framework, and so currently the process is. We rely on executive orders from the mayor to respond to any type of disaster that the city is facing. On the left we see in 2013, there was a much wider gap from when a hurricane Sandy happened to when those first regulations to respond to that disaster were put in place, and so that was through the emergency order and then almost a year later, that's when we had adopted temporary zoning text rules, and so we were relying on those emergency orders to get us through that disaster. This. What we're proposing is a it's somewhat of a menu of options to respond to different types of emergencies, and so, within the zoning resolution, we're proposing to put different types of provisions related to damage and destruction which you can reconstruct upon after a disaster, different bulk modifications, different types of construction timelines or vesting provisions for special permits or discontinuous of non-conforming uses. None of these would be in place for automatically. They would have to go through as a text amendment and so, but they it would allow it not to be written during the recovery period. These would already be written. They would just be selected. The disaster would be identified in the time period where these rules would apply would also be identified, and so right now we are actually, as part of this text, amendment utilizing this new framework to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, and so there's two different regulations that are proposed as part of this menu of options and two that would be allowed to that would be approved and those are related to the lapting of special permits and authorizations which, if you didn't know after 10 years, special permits are no longer valid if they haven't been used or if there hasn't been substantial construction done and then there's also the discontinuance of non-conforming uses. So typically, we see that, if you have say a retail space in a residential zone without a commercial overlay where it's a legally non-conforming use, it's allowed to be there, but it's not. It wouldn't be allowed by zoning if it was new. If that goes away for two years, typically, it can't come back, so this is kind of putting pause on both of those things. It's saying that we're in a an unprecedented disaster, a pandemic and saying we're going to put pause on both of those things until the disaster is over and then we're going to continue those that normal business after the disaster has ended. So those are the four provisions that relate city-wide. Those are the ones that apply in community district five right now, as you're aware we're in the referral period, all the community boards are opining on this. There are some specific local actions in areas that are more vulnerable to flood flooding and resiliency matters, and so there's some local actions going on as well, but we're receiving feedback now and so we're happy to take any questions you have moving forward great. Thank you very much for members of the committee and all attending this meeting. I just want to explain why this is on our agenda. Clearly, we are not directly targeted by this text amendment, but we felt it was important that we hear about it and also what we have to keep in mind. Is we want to make sure that there's no unintended consequences that would you know like hit CB5 like a loophole that would you know sneakily, be there and be used in a way? That would be not the intended way of this text, which otherwise I think everybody agrees is really a good text. So this is why we're reviewing it, and so with that said, I will open up the floor to questions from members of the committee on this citywide zoning text amendment. Once again, please focus your questions on the applicability of the text to CB5. Unfortunately, we don't have the luxury of asking. You know questions out of curiosity, so questions from members of the committee on this proposal. You can use the raise hand function at the bottom of your screen. Yeah Rachel hi, just wondering if we can go back to the slide that talked about the I, think you phrased it like maintenance, like the first part that we talked through. Was it the mechanical systems? Yes, so just wondering if you could explain a little bit more I think this is where a lot of the like implications come. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what this will mean for our district, in particular sure, so this would apply in the district per zoning. The applicability in practice may not be utilized as much here as we would see in lower density residential districts where there's yards, and they have this single generator. That's sitting out in the back oftentimes these mechanicals in commercial buildings, as you're probably aware, are located they're already, elevated, so they're already within the building within the structure. This is just saying that if there are any of these energy storing, if any of this energy storing equipment is located outside, you can now elevate it, and you can now place it in an open space. I'm not sure how relevant in practice this is going to be in community district 5, just because a lot of these buildings, like I, said already incorporate them into the building, but it would be allowed in open yards or rear yards of some residential buildings and just to follow up on that. The rationale for it not just applying to the one percent in 0.2 zones is because a lot of the power comes from outside of those zones or what exactly is the rationale behind that? Just I'm clear on that. The rationale for allowing this to apply in both, though one percent and the 0.2% and outside of that as well, oh and outside of that as well yeah. So it is. That is a point, yes, that the power is drawn from different areas. The other reason is this is not a very it's a less significant ask of zoning in a way it's not modifying bulk of a building, and it's just really allowing property owners to be conservative. Our projections right now wouldn't put any type of flooding to the center of the Manhattan, the island of Manhattan, but if, in the future that does happen, we just want to provide that flexibility to raise those outside. If, for some reason, there's a one thousand year flood that we're not projecting with current flood risk, we just want to make sure that we still allow owners to elevate if they have that perceived risk. Thank you. Rachel any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, I'll jump right in to follow up on Rachel's question: have you given any thoughts to actually excluding areas that are not within the one percent or 0.2% flooding zones, from this specific provision from the power systems or for the entire text amendment? So the only two provisions that would apply outside that are actually related to physical changes. Are these power systems and also these ADA accessible ramps, and these are both things that we think that would be appropriate, regardless of where they're located with respect to the flood zone, so we haven't considered taking either of these provisions out and just applying them to the one in 0.2%. Okay and my other question, is you know, as you know, we are very concerned about some mechanical voids loopholes that the Department of city planning has actually worked on, eliminating, and you know trying to fix the tech so that this little ploy by developers to use excessive mechanical space to increase the height of their buildings without using any far is eliminated. Initially, I was concerned that this particular proposal could actually introduce another loophole. That developers could exploit this way. Is there in with your knowledge, intimate knowledge of the text? Is this concern ill-founded on our end, I think it's always great to have those concerns and look at any text and try to identify different areas where you would have unintended consequences. I. Don't think that this is one here. The void's text is still in effect. None of these provisions, the ones that modify bulk, don't apply in community district five and so there's no kind of unset height restriction that would be put in place via these. This text amendment so I. Don't think that is a concern here and currently does this text amendment restrict the use of sellers as mechanical space. The text does not so there's a distinction between zoning and the building code may restrict uses in sellers. You can't have residential uses and sellers if they're on the first floor in the flood plain, they have to be dry flood proofed. Those are different regulations that apply to just the floodplain area. So there's no regulations that apply just outside of that area and again those are really governed by the building code, not by zoning. Okay, that's super helpful. Okay. Thank you. So much any more questions from our members of the committee. Okay, seeing none I will open up the floor to members of the public. Do we have any questions from members of the public? If you do have a question or wish to make a comment, you can use the raise hand, function and Luke our community associate would give you permission to speak you're joining from a phone. You can press star nine to indicate that you would like to speak. Thank you, Luke any questions or comments from members of the public. Okay, so seeing none, we will move back to a business session. Members of the committee discuss the matter. I will jump right in by saying that we are very grateful to DCP to come and present if this text mostly does not apply to CB5, and it seems that there will be no unintended consequences. Therefore, we do not have to take a position. We can also decide to acknowledge that we receive a presentation, but given that you know it is not an issue that is really parochial to us, we can choose to actually remain silent. We can also choose to take a position. So I would like to hear comments from our members of the committee on how you feel is best to proceed. I will start by asking. Is there any objection to the text? You can use your raise hand function any objection to this text and with its applicability to CB5, okay, no hands up. Is there any desire by anyone to specifically comment on these portions of the text that apply to us? Okay, so it looks like the committee would be comfortable with acknowledging that we have received a presentation, but choosing oh Nancy has her hand up Nancy go ahead and then see you look it's a little tricky I know it's a little tricky, I'm on my iPad mic, so I have one concern, and that is that these electric power sources are generally fueled by diesel and I would not want to see any of these diesel generators in residential courtyards. In our neighbor in our district, because I think it's a quality and air quality issue, so that's my big concern, yeah good point: they have to be turned on and tested and they make a huge amount. Oh and the other thing is, they have to turn on and be tested and they make a huge amount of noise and they have to be tested. How often they are every month they have to be tested. So you have that noise and that air pollution every time you test it. They have to be tested all the time. My partner just reminded me about that, so they are noisy, they are very noisy and any of our residents and air quality, noise pollution and air pollution, but they would have they have to be tested on a regular basis. Yeah, okay, I think that it's a very good and very valid point. Any other comments concerns from members of the committee. Okay, so seeing none I think that Nancy Spawn is really a very valid and very important one. So I think we should comment if only to state this concern Nancy. Would you be comfortable with a resolution stating a concern on this specific point? Absolutely, yes, okay, should it be a conditional approval? You know, along the lines of you, know, making sure that they are not permitted in rare yards in our district. It's really, yes, I think that's really important, because this is a way for architects and developers to use space that wouldn't otherwise not be allowed, and we are not in a flood plain yeah. So why should we have this imposed on us? Yeah Rachel? You have your hand up, go ahead. Rachel I, I'm just not sure I fully understand Nancy's point on how this language would change that air quality issue. So if that, once you know, we can anticipate that it's going to pass once the text passes if it passes, as is a generator that is, you know, functioning with diesel would be allowed to be installed in a rear yard. So you know when you build a you know. Let's say you build a residential building in Midtown. There is a really hard requirement, meaning that you need to set back the rear of the building and you need to leave. You know, like typically it's 30 feet between your building and the lot line. Now with this regulation, you would be allowed to install your generator on in this rare yard. So, all of a sudden and right now, you can't do that. You have to install your generator most developers install it on the roof. All of a sudden, you would be able to reclaim this roof area and stock, your generator at the rear of the building, and it would become as of right and it would become permissible. And the thing, though, is that, because we're such a dense built environment, then you would have noise and fumes from this generator. That would basically pollute this rare yard and the rare yard's purpose is just to you know, provide you, know air and lights, so that could defeat the purpose of the rare yard. So is everybody, okay with a motion that could be an approval, providing that generators would not be permitted in rare yards and flagging that to DCP telling them that you know for us it would be a noise and air quality issue. Yes, okay, any of that. Oh, not an objection, obviously not my place to do that, but I just wanted to note that the department of buildings actually has oversight of the generators. This is just allowing them as the permitted obstructions, and so the types of concerns that you're outlining would kind of be something for both city planning and for DOB to address because of the ones that regulate the size and type for the building and again, I just want to reiterate the efficiency of placing the mechanicals in the within the building, especially when you have larger buildings like you do in community district, five, placing those outside I, I'm not sure that would be done purposefully to reclaim any type of space because it actually would be a less efficient building. We have been burned too many times with you know. Unemployment consequences that were full would never happen and end up happening, so we have to be. You know as thorough as we can all right. Let's stay in business session when only members of the committee can discuss the matter, so it would be a motion to approve the proposed tax, provided that generators would not be permitted as per DCP. While we understand there's also building code, but as per DCP, they will not be permitted in rare yards in community board five. We can, you know, make it. You know phrase it that's what that way on our end, hoping that it can be incorporated into the text in a way that is, you know, DCP or friendly, you know maybe identifying specific districts or zoning areas. Is everybody good with that? Any objection to that? Okay, second yeah, I'm sorry, okay! So we're we will take this to a vote. That will be the first vote of the evening. Bear with me all right, so I need a second on the motion. I'm sorry do we have a second? Yes, okay! Thank you all right so motion to for conditional approval, Dave Achilles! Yes, Nick! Yes, Julie, yes, Aaron yeah! Thank you Nancy, yes, Mike! Yes, Tristan, yes, Matt, yes, Ej, yes, John, yes, Rachel yeah and Ryan. No Ryan is not with us. Okay, all right and me Leila, I'm a yes okay, so the motion passes unanimously. Thank you very much to DCP for their presentation all right. Moving on. We will now go to our next application, which is 109 East 42nd street. This is the Grand Hyatt Commodore Hotel, and it is the review of the scope of work for the Grand Hyatt redevelopment located in the greater east Midtown special district. So I think we have a full team of applicants with us tonight for this very important project. I will before we go into the presentation. I just want to frame what we're looking at. This is the scope of work. We will be discussing the scope and only the scope of the environmental impact statement that will be prepared for the review of this particular development. Okay, so I will explain more thoroughly what that means, but I want everybody to keep that in mind. You know from the get-go as we listen to the proposal. There will be an opportunity to fully comment on the project itself, its merits, whether we like it, we don't like it, is very important, but tonight really what we need to focus on is whether the impacts of this development are properly assessed all right. So with that being said, I will turn on the fourth to the applicants for this project. Thank you, Leila. Thank you for having us. My name is Michael Remin, I'm the development project executive from Rxr Realty, and we're excited to be here tonight to discuss Project Commodore, I'm also joined by my friend and partner John Mcmillan from Tia Cornerstone, who you're who you'll hear from shortly. We also have other members from our project team who can help answer questions that includes David Karnovsky from Free Frank, Luke Bridal from Som and Nancy Doon from Vhb and I just want to echo. Thank you Layla for pointing it out. This is an advanced briefing on the project which is being held prior to the public scoping hearing, which is scheduled for December 21st, and this is for the purpose of commenting on the draft scope of work, so we'll be back to discuss the building itself early next year and, of course, the project as well. Thank you so, on side, two we've got quite a bit of content to cover today, so I'll keep these introduction slides short, but just in looking at the table of contents, we'll start with a brief introduction of the project team and then we'll review the site history and the existing conditions. We'll then turn our attention to the proposed project by reviewing our goals and guiding principles, and then John will take you through a bit of the proposed project, mostly focusing on improvements to the public realm and then, since tonight's presentation is really looking forward to that scoping hearing later this month, we'll touch a bit on the proposed land use actions and look forward to the next steps and finally, of course, we'll leave time for questions and answers. So Rxr is a New York city-based vertically integrated real estate firm and we've got a long history in New, York City and a commitment to the city's future. Our operational ethos is doing good and doing well means doing better, and that really leads us to develop strong partnerships and support the communities where we work. We bring deep experience, developing projects in partnership with public entities, and this includes pier 57, which is a mixed-use development in Hudson River park, and that's got extensive public open space and the Willoughby. The lights just went off in my room and the Willoughby, which is a residential development on Long Island, University's campus. That includes upgrade upgrades to collegiate sports facilities. We also have a significant presence in community board 5, with many of the properties pictured below falling into your district John. Do you want to take a second to introduce Tf yourself into your cornerstone yeah? So I'm John Mcmillan with Tf Cornerstone, and we are a large but private, family-owned company we've been around for 50 years. We have a very long-term multi-generational investment horizon. We call that patient capital, our bread and butter seems to be very large-scale public private sector partnerships. We did a lot of work at battery park, city Queens West, which you can see here on the lower right hand corner. We did all of that we're now building about 850, affordable units at hunters, point south we're doing two buildings at Atlantic yards in downtown Brooklyn and even Carnegie hall, which is our trophy office building, is on a lease with New York City. We don't have a large presence in community board. Five I would say the nearest thing to you. Guys was a rezoning that we did with board four way west on 57th street over at the highway, and that was probably the first rezoning that came through in the De Blasio administration. Next, so you're probably familiar with this site. But just as a reminder, the site is the at the current Grand Hyatt and it's bounded by Lexington Avenue to the East 42nd street, to the South, the Park Avenue viaduct to the west. And, of course, our neighbor to the north is grand central market, and the interesting thing apart about this site is the 456 subway line that actually runs diagonally below it and I can't stress. This is of such tremendous importance that it's been a major factor in almost all of the decision making on this project, from the improvements of the transit system, to the location of the public, open space and, of course, obviously, the architecture, the engineering and the construction of the building itself. So on the next side, we'll take a closer look at the existing conditions and we notice that the public realm and the pedestrian experience in the vicinity of this project really leave plenty of room for improvement. And lessons learned so we're happy to report that we plan on demolishing Donald, Trump's, first foray into Manhattan real estate and building a new tower from scratch. So here are some of the characteristics that we'll try to improve. Everyone knows how crowded the sidewalks are and how busy the subway entrances can become, and on 42nd street that cantilevered restaurant really has kind of an imposing presence that blocks views of grand central terminal beyond and the engine the entrance is from Lexington to the subway and grand central terminal. Those are sometimes hard to locate for visitors, and then they spill directly out onto the sidewalk. So we see all these as an opportunity to write these wrongs. Yeah. One thing I would point out which you can see in these pictures. That's characteristic of that site and the relationship to the terminal is that it's continuous on the ground level. So we are a continuation of the terminal across the ground level, but on the second level, we s it pulls away and we have the space between the terminal and our building of the viaduct and that very much influences how we treat the ground level and how we treat the second level and how we deal with public circulation and open space which you'll see later so. On the you'll see. The redevelopment of this project really reflects the heart and soul of the ideals that are expressed during the rezoning process, and we really want to give the community board a lot of credit. You guys spent an enormous amount of effort getting greater east Midtown right and we've taken these ideas to heart, with a really particular focus on integrating development, with our transit improvements and public open space. And you have the foresight to realize that the importance of new high quality office space in Midtown, which is even more important in the age of Covid-19, because we all know the fact is that most companies move their offices from time to time and when they move they'll, look for the best available option and we want that option to be in east Midtown. Another guiding principle for us has been to improve the streetscape and the transit experience, and this is really the focus of what John will speak about. But I thought that this is an interesting graphic that expresses how we've embraced that connectivity with the terminal and the surrounding neighborhood. So you'll see this intense connectivity on four different levels above grade in the new public open spaces at grade with new sight lines and improved sidewalks one level below grade with better access to the subway and even further underground. With a new connection between commuter rail lines and so on, so the project itself is about 2.2 million zoning square feet, of which about 1.9 will be devoted to office space. With most of the balance being devoted to a new 500 room hotel. There will be about 12,000 square feet of retail on the project, and that includes the MTA controlled retail within grand central terminal itself and they'll also be significant public realm improvements, including subway and mass transit improvements, publicly accessible, open space and really to an extent that far exceeds the 10,000 square feet. That's required by zoning so on the in seeking land use approvals for this project. We're really drawing on that framework that was established during the greater East Midtown rezoning process. So just briefly, we're going to actually use the transit improvement and public Concourse special permits that you're already familiar with, but we're going to alter how we access them in lot. 30, which is the current Grand Hyatt and grand central terminal, will act as a single qualifying site, as well as we're going to be making modifications to the floor area, height and setback, street wall continuity and other district plan elements, as well as the publicly accessible open space regulations and, of course, we'll seek a special permit for the hotel use too. We're also making zoning text amendments to those existing special permits that I discussed in the first bullet we're reducing the number of required bicycle parking spaces from 286 to about 100 spaces, which we think makes sense, given that the building's sitting on top of one of the biggest transportation hubs in the country and lastly, this will be city-owned property, so another land use action will deal with the amendment of that lease and extending the grounds. Okay. So we're now going to walk you through some of our major proposed changes to the site. We have been working with the MTA for more than a year, so all of this has been agreed to with the MTA. This is a ground plan of our site, combined with grand central is to the left of the yellow section and then we're on the right, and our section is outlined in red here. So you can see how kind of intricately connected our site is with grand central on the ground level and how many of the public spaces of grand central kind of flow past right through our site, like the Lexington passage and then the three major subway entrances to the 42nd street station kind of cut into our site, the one at 42nd street, the one off the Lexington passage and then the one over on Lexington Avenue. So these are the major areas that we're going to be making improvements to which we're about to present to you. So the shows our proposed changes to the ground floor and you can see that we one of the major moves that we're making here is. We are introducing a new transit hall that runs all along the western edge of our site so that it anchors the eastern edge of the grand central terminal complex. So it's designed very much to read as part of the grand central public realm you'll never realize it's part of our building. It's you know it's going to read as part of the grand central complex and combined with that is just below that, where it says expanded, subway entrance, that's a completely reconfigured entrance to the 42nd Street subway we've created a kind of an at-grade foyer for the subway below where we've brought all the turnstiles that are now underneath in the mezzanine level, we've brought them up to the grade level. We've created a new entrance from 42nd street into this subway station so that you don't have to go through the 42nd street passage and then we've added new stairs and elevators and I'll go through this in more detail. A little later, then, we've greatly improved the Lexington passage by nearly doubling its height. Otherwise it will be located more or less where it is today and we've relocated. The Lexington the entrance on Lexington Avenue we've had to relocate it because we're setting our building back five feet, and so we couldn't leave the existing subway entrance where it is so. We took advantage of that opportunity and relocated it in a way that aligns with the station below, as Michael mentioned. The subway station is a 45 degree angle with this building. So now the subway station will bring you down into the station directly on access with the station below okay next. So this is a view of the 42nd street passage looking south towards 42nd street, and you can see at the end that there are three entrances there. Today there are only two and the one on the left is occupied by an ADA elevator that takes you down to the subway. We will be relocating that elevator and restoring this entrance to its original function and then off to the left. You can begin to see the new spaces that we're creating. You can see the subway turn styles there, that's the new subway for your entrance and then more towards this side, you're beginning to lead into the new transit hall that we're creating now we're kind of in this new transit hall. Looking at the new entrance to the subway station, so again you can see all the turn styles are up here. At grade you can see, through those turnstiles and we've now created kind of this new aperture into this subway entrance that so that you can enter directly from 42nd street. But this is also bringing you know, natural daylight, into this entrance and to the staircases going down below. And then you can see in this transit hall. It begins to have openings, that align with spaces in grand central terminal, and then you can see that light is coming in from above. If we go to the you can see that we've been able to create skylights into this transit hall that create strategically positioned views of the eastern Facade of grand central terminal, and then again the openings into this transit hall are aligned with things like the ramp. That takes you. Take you down to the oyster bar to the Vanderbilt Hall, which you can see through here. Okay and then this is the plan of the existing conditions of the mezzanine below, which is, you know, utterly inscrutable to anyone, but the most avid transit aficionado, and that is because of all this green stuff, which is the supporting structure of the Hyatt above and the reason it's all. There is because the Hyatt was built on the grid of the street system above, whereas this subway station was built at a 45 degree angle to that, so you need all these green girders that are transferring the structure of the Hyatt from one grid to the other grid, so because we're removing the Hyatt above we have the opportunity of removing all of this structure in here, which is kind of impeding legibility, visual access and circulation through the station. So in the this is the proposed changes to the mezzanine below you can see all the green stuff disappears and suddenly you can see from one end of the station to the other. Suddenly, the circulation is much clearer and more legible, more evenly distributed. So now, I want to just kind of quickly walk you through all the subway entrance changes. So if you start over at the left hand side at the corner of the Red box, that is the existing escalator coming down from above. That won't really change that stays more or less where it is today, then, to the right of that is a slightly repositioned, but much enlarged staircase coming down. You know close to where it is today and then to the right of that big oddly shaped square thing, that's one of the two mega columns that are coming down and bringing the structure of the tower through the station down to bedrock. There are only two places along the south side of this building on 42nd street, where we can bring structure through the terminal without affecting the subway station. The other one is over at the corner on Lexington Avenue. So then, just to the right of that mega column is a new staircase that we are introducing and the new ADA elevator down to the mezzanine, and you can notice that this new staircase is at a completely different angle from the old staircase. And the reason for this is it brings you down in a much more kind of logical orientation to the mezzanine below. So you know you enter the mezzanine at a perpendicular angle to it and you're much more in the middle of the mezzanine and that allows pedestrian traffic to be more evenly distributed throughout the station and kind of among all of the existing staircases. You can see how the old staircase kind of takes you to one end of the station and orients you away from all of these staircases and the throughput of this station. The number of trains that can pass through the station is a critical issue for the MTA, and that can be greatly improved by more evenly distributing people to the staircases there are you couldn't really have more staircases going down to the tracks? It's just that people aren't using them evenly, and so the point of this new staircase is to get people more evenly distributed among all the staircases and then at the all, the way at the far right end, you can see the new staircase coming down from Lexington avenue in an orientation that is, you know completely legible to the orientation of the mezzanine and also in a way that brings light coming in from Lexington Avenue, okay, I think that's everything on this side, then the Lexington passage. This is a cross-section of the Lexington passage looking to the south and the red line cutting through there is the existing ceiling height, so we are going to be able to almost double the height in the Lexington passage for much of its length and create a much grander, more visible, light filled entrance on Lexington Avenue and then in the middle here, where you see the 456 circles, that's the existing entrance down to the subway, which will remain unchanged and then just to the right of that is a new bank of escalators that will take people up from the Lexington passage to our office building. So this is one of those office buildings where the office lobby has to be on the second floor because of all this transit stuff going on the first floor, we are not able to bring the elevator hits below grade, and so the entire lobby is up on the second level, and you know we are expecting that approximately half of the building's tenants will use this elevator bank here and the other half will use the front door which will be on 42nd street, and then you can also you're just starting to get peaks of the public realm that we're going to be proposing above here. I will talk a little bit more about that later, but it does kind of circle. The building in 360 degrees, on a couple of levels. Okay, now we're out on Lexington Avenue, and you can see starting all the way to the right is the stone entrance to the existing grand central market and then just to the left of that is the new entrance to the Lexington, passageway and kind of nestled in there is a new elevator. That's going to take you up to a new public realm that we're creating and then just to the left of that is a new staircase that will take you up to that public realm and then just to the left of that is the new entrance to the subway station that we're creating I think the will give you a better view of that. So you can see how this is kind of orienting you so that when you get go down to the subway station you're, you know in line with the station itself. You can also see in this image one of the mega columns coming down behind the staircase. That's taking people up to the public room and if we could just go back Luke to the previous image. I just want to point out once more. So what you're, seeing above all of this on the second level, is one of the terraces that we're creating. This is the 10,000 square feet of required open space, but we've greatly expanded on that as you'll see in upcoming images, okay, Luke and John. We should just also mention the sidewalk widening here on unlucky, yeah, and so the sidewalk on Lexington has been expanded by I think five feet, and then you can also see there's a bleeding area waiting area for the ADA elevator take and it's a protected waiting area for the ADA elevator taking you downstairs, okay and then, by the way to the left of that was the entrance to the hotel. The Grand Hyatt is going to be rebuilt and we will be putting that at the very top of the building and it will be the highest hotel in the western hemisphere. Okay, so this is kind of an expanded view of all of this and kind of our last major transit improvement. We've wandered way off the site and has found a way to make a connection to the East side, access all the way over at one vanderbilt and also to the Metro North commuter lines coming in. So what we have been able to do is find a way to bring those commuters underneath the terminal and through to the 456 mezzanine level, so that those commuters don't have to kind of go up through the terminal and then back down through the individual, subway entrances. And then the way we've been able to do that is we've taken advantage of one a kind of an old turnaround track for Metro North. That's the curved thing and then kind of some underutilized space running under the terminal under the grand central terminal itself, and so both of those come through connect and then come through to the mezzanine level of the 456 train. So this takes approximately. You know: 4,000 commuters out of just per hour peak rush hour, just out of the 42nd Street subway entrance, because they're not having to go up through the terminal and then down through that station they're able to make a direct link underneath and then you can kind of see over on the right. How the other subway entrance from Lexington is also coming in and that has opened up all kinds of new staircases over there which are currently, you know completely hidden and very much inaccessible. And again, you can see in this image the two places along 42nd street. Those two gray shapes those are the structural landings for the site, and so you can see you know how little area we have to bring the structure down for the project. Okay now. So this is the second level of the project, and you can now see that we have found a way to create a an outdoor public realm here, and this is something so it's surrounding the site on all sides. So we found a way to literally set the building back, not on the first level, where we need all of the space to create all of the connections we just talked about, so we've set it back on the second level in a way that creates all of this open space, and this was an idea that came to us very early on in the project when we met with Gail Brewer and she happened to have given this a lot of thought and she had this suggestion and we took it and ran with it and ultimately decided that it was a wonderful idea because it's a way of creating a public realm, that's somewhat removed from the congestion of 42nd street and Lexington Avenue, and but yet it's very much connected to the urban experience. It allows you to look down on the busyness of the street around you and by the way, this site is completely surrounded by landmarks on all sides. So it's really kind of a spectacular urban setting, and we see this very much as a platform from which you can just view the spectacular city around you, and you know. We think that it will be a variety of experiences. We call the terrace closest to grand central terminal, the grand central terrace and really what that's about is just being able to view grand central terminal from the first time. From this perspective, you know you don't really get to see the eastern facade of Grand Central and you know, except when you're whizzing, by in a car on the viaduct, so that's kind of what this particular terrace is about. You can also see the skylights that are going down to the new transit hall, which is directly underneath the space and then over on the Lexington Avenue side. That's a slightly larger terrace that we hope to be able to program a little more intensively, maybe with some restaurants, some casual Dining, Fnb, art water features that thing and then on. The north side is another terrace that we call the Graybar terrace. You know that we're hoping to kind of program with some individual, smaller buildings, I think if we go to the you, can get a slightly better perspective on that. For example, we are hoping to do some kind of a restaurant up there at the upper left hand corner that glass building that well, I'm sorry on the right side, Lou that, hopefully, will be some kind of a restaurant. You know so that's where people can come up from Lexington Avenue kind of a two-story thing with you know public seating both on the lower level and on the upper level, and then you know some kind of a retail pavilion over on the other end as well, to make sure that we are able to. You know activate all of these spaces as much as possible. We very much want these spaces to be used by both the office. Tenants, it's going to be a sizable office population here, as well as the public, but the main way that you get to these spaces are through these huge grand staircases that come down to 42nd street right at the middle of the site. Right at the front door to our site, so these staircases, these civic staircases, you know very much- are going to be defining. You know the front door of this building. You know they couldn't be kind of more prominently placed. So we really do feel that you know the public they're going to be very welcoming to the public. We are trying to design them so that they are. You know they are spatial experiences in and of themselves. We are working with field operations as the landscape architect for this project. They did the high line. So you know we think they're going to be able to bring a lot of value to these elevated spaces, and then we, you can kind of see. We've got little elevators strategically located in lots of places to make sure that all of these spaces are very much accessible for everybody and I. Think next Michael is back to you Michael. Yes, can you guys hear me yeah, so I get the fun job of explaining the EIS framework, which always it's not always super intuitive. So really, what we're comparing here is what's called the no action condition, which is a building that we could construct without any of these discretionary actions that we're here to discuss today against the with action condition, which is the building that we could construct with all of these land use actions that we described earlier. So importantly, the no action condition it isn't the existing building, it's the building that could be built without any discretionary actions and another item to note is that the figures you see here on the right side of the page, those aren't building designs or proposals, we'll be back with those soon they're, just a zoning envelope within which our building will ultimately need to fit. So. Lastly, on the for next steps, a public scoping hearing will be held on December 21st at 2 pm. The documents for that hearing are all available for download at that web link. There and I know it's long, so you can just google NYC DCP project, Commodore and it'll pop right up. You can watch or participate in the meeting using the second web link, which you can also find at the first one and, of course, we'll return shortly to present the building design and we'll do that in connection with an application that we'll be making to the landmarks Preservation Commission, seeking a report on the harmonious relationship between our building and the in grand central terminal. So with that I think. That concludes our presentation. We're happy to take any questions. Thank you very much very dense proposal that you're bringing to us. Let's go to questions from members of the Committee David Keyless go ahead. Yes, I believe it's page 23 where you have the red dotted outline showing the space. I'm sorry 22 page 22, the red dots here on your area. That shows where it's just surrounding the blue area. This shows the area that the terrace will be I, assume the dotted red line that is out almost to the street level. That is the actual area where the building will eventually rise to because it looks like the building is bowl shaped and expanding out into the air space from. If you look at the drawing on page 20 on page 18 and page 19, those paintings there, it looks like the building is expanding out over into the air space. Is that is that's what's happening there that's correct, as I mentioned, the building sets back at these lower levels and expands out as it rises, and that's how we've been able to create these open spaces. Okay, thank you, yeah and really kind of pulling the building in at those edges. Sorry, at the lower levels, we're able to expand those sight lines of grand central terminal and the Chrysler building, and all these other great landmarks, as well just to clarify that this piece of the red line that you're referring to is not part of the building. That's the extent of the plaza spaces above the building line would be back along this edge. Okay, thank you. Nick next question. Thank you. Laila at the very beginning of the presentation, Michael I think I heard you say something about reducing the number of required bicycle spaces. Did I hear that correctly? Can you explain that? Yes, so you did hear that correctly. This building is quite large and the way that the zoning works is it requires a specific number of bike parking spots per gross square foot of the building and when you get to a building of this size, when you run the map, it turns out that you need a little bit over 200 parking spots for bikes, which you know it takes up a tremendous amount of space. But what we found is that no one really uses it, so we actually have a bunch of other buildings of similar size across New, York City, and we found that those all had bike rooms of about 100 spaces and they were well used, but not really at capacity, and so we thought that reducing the bike parking space at this project to about a hundred also made sense, considering both that experience and the fact that we're you know very well serviced by public transportation here at this site. Thank you. Ej yeah, thanks Laila Michael John. Whoever might be most appropriate for answering this question. You covered a lot of new transit space, transportation improvements and pedestrian spaces and connections, and particularly as it relates to this second story, pedestrian area, I'm wondering if this EIS scope will include in it any potential improvements, pedestrian spaces on the viaduct and or any connections between any new connections between the viaduct and any other pedestrian spaces. With your second story, terrorist gear, I'm gonna say not as of yet. This is something that we're still exploring, but we're not quite there yet, okay, that potential exists. Clearly, we've created public access to that level, that's kind of as far as we've gotten. Thank you just a quick follow-up on that is that going to be part of the evaluation of the environmental impact statement. Well, Nancy. If you're on you would know better, but I, think not that yeah I mean right now the draft scope of work that's been posted on the website does not include that. That's correct! Okay! Thank you! Nancy Goschall! You have a question. Go ahead. I don't know if this is the time to ask, but where are you planning on putting your mechanical space? Is it too soon to ask it's over the lobby? How high is that space from floor to floor? Do you know yet probably at least 20 feet? Luke? Do you have any idea? The mechanical space is yes 20 feet, but the lobby will be much taller than that. If that's, that was your question. So it's 20 feet. I have another question on the eight. The mechanical flaws will be 20 feet. You have mechanical floors further up in the building as well. Yes, what Florida floor heights are those, so the building is still very much in development at this point, so final location of those and dimensioning of those is still under development. Okay, then, the next question I have is the ADA elevator that you're adding? Who will maintain that ADA elevator? Do you know for those that are taking people down to the subway? They will be maintained by the MTA for those that are taking people up to the public realm. On the second level, we will okay. The reason I ask is I know this is a question. Is it would it be possible to add a second ADA elevator because they always are going into disrepair, and if there was two of them one we would be more assured that one would always be in use. Is that possible we do have to you do yeah, but, okay. The way to address this at this level would be to actually ask that accessibility be fully studied, okay right, taking into account the fact that very often elevators and escalators break down, and that we have to factor this into the number of such equipment to be allocated to provide constant, ADA accessibility to all the areas. Well said. Thank you. Okay, other questions, members of the committee, any more questions I have a few of my own I'll start with the first one. The one comment that I did not fully understand that you mentioned that there's going to be an action to LPC as to the harmoniousness to grand central terminal. Can you elaborate on that because this is not part of the east Midtown tech? So are you using a part of the zoning text that is beyond east Midtown, all right, I'll start? Well, the building is actually plugging into grand central terminal on that ground level, where we're doing the transit hall. So that's one area of interest, in particular on the part of the state, historic preservation, people SHPO and then outside our building, actually touches at the ground level that I mentioned, and so that's an interest of both SHPO and landmarks and then because we're on the same block as a landmark I think the LPC needs to issue a harmonious relationship certificate for the overall project. Is that right, Michael John? If I could answer that a little bit more, it's David Karnovsky from free Frank, the East Midtown text, actually does provide in the provision that relates to the transfer of Florida from landmarks that if the distribution of Florida is to a site that is adjacent to contiguous to grand central, a harmonious relationship report is required from LPC and while we'll be making the distribution for Florida in a slightly different way, we are maintaining that requirement to go to LPC and obtain that determination got it. Okay. Thank you. So, just to you know, go one step further and to fully understand you're, not using a 74,711 article. Are you no? The way that the floor will be distributed is across the zoning lot boundaries, because I think Michael mentioned this- that the qualifying site here consists both of the grand central lot and the Commodore Hyatt Lot together they form the qualifying site. So the floor will distribute over the zoning lot lines and in connection with that, there will be this harmonious relationship report, okay, so that was going to be. My second question is that to say that you're doing a lot merger and therefore it does not qualify or read as a transfer of right. It is for purposes of East Midtown zoning. It's the functional equivalent of a zoning merger. They won't actually be merged, but they'll be treated for purposes of east Midtown requirements as a single qualifying site. So my next question to that point or you does that mean that you're exempt from contributing to the is Midtown fund? No, we are no in connection with that distribution of Florida from grand central of the unused floor area. There will be the very same payment that would have been required if we had used the existing mechanism, so there will be no change. No payment will be made okay. So what is the benefit to proceeding the way you're proceeding? The benefit of is essentially that when you look at this as a single qualifying site, you have the ability to generate through the special permits for transit improvements and for public realm improvements, significantly greater amounts of floor area and therefore significantly greater improvements. I'm not sure I follow that, but if you sure, if you look at lot 30 alone in the Commodore side alone and apply the bonus rates to that site alone, the amount of bonus floor and therefore the size of the improvements is significantly smaller than if you generate it from a larger lot, a larger qualifying site. That's the essence of it. Now you understand. Okay, I will re-explain that for members of the committee who may not have grasped the full impact of what was just said. Okay, moving on, can you actually just clarify again the amount of sidewalk widening that you're proposing you said five feet: does that apply only to Lexington Avenue, or does that also apply to 40 seconds straight the five feet? Is it right, Luke five feet on Lexington yeah five feet in Lexington and you'll be set back also on and then on 42nd street, where we are setting back, but the setback is occupied largely by these civic staircases that take you up to the public space on the second level, okay and then my final question is there used to be a street actually between the terminal and the hotel that has been d mapped? Is that does that become part of your development, so Leila I think you're referring to deputy place, which runs north south from 45th street south towards the project site right now? Didn't it wrap around? Wasn't it a like L, inverted L, passageway or you know street that was d-mapped. It runs north-south essentially, and it's not part of the development site, oh yeah, so it does run north south. Yes, but it is not. Its lot area is not. It is not part of the development side, it is part of the qualifying site- okay, but you're, not developing it. No, it is not being developed. It is being used as it is used today for deliveries and other. You know: support services, okay, but you're, just in incorporating it into the qualifying site. Correct. Okay, thank you, hi can I just make. One can I just make one point. The loading and servicing for this building, which we didn't mention will continue to take place off that Depu Alley, which is what the Commodore hotel, which is what the Grand Hyatt hotel uses today. So that will remain unchanged and you will never see the servicing for this building, because it's tucked away in that Back Alley. Okay, thank you. Okay, I think that wraps up most of the questions, I had I see that Mike really has a question might go ahead. Hi I saw there was a lot about the 456 mezzanine. Is there any plans for the 7 train and connections to the 7 train Michael? Wasn't that going to be kind of a second shortcut phase that the MTA was interested in pursuing yeah? That's true! So, as part of this short loop that we discussed earlier, we worked with the MTA to develop a phase two of this and that phase two would kind of take this arrow. That points at the 456 mezzanine and it would create a new hallway that would connect down towards and into the seven line station, which is much further below ground. And so this improvement here will be done as part of the improvement shown on the screen will be done as part of our project and our transit improvements and it's being constructed in a way that will allow for that future phase, two to be constructed by the MTA or by you know a different developer, also seeking transit improvement rights in East, Midtown. Okay, thank you, and will this well that second phase then meet all the qualifications for the Hudson yards mitigation that was cited during the environmental impact of Hudson yards, that there should be more access from grand central terminal to the seven train. I can't answer that yeah I'll, admit I, don't know, okay, but once again, Mike I think it's very important that we asked that to be studied in the environmental life statement and that it becomes part of the proposal so very important to make sure it makes its way into our recommendations and that becomes part of the scope. But I would like to point out in this image that the increased traffic flow coming from these commuter lines into the 456 station, which is represented by this red arrow. That is that increased demand is being accommodated by the removal of all the turnstiles which are now exactly in that location. So we've taken all those turnstiles upstairs and all of this area in the mezzanine below is now available for circulation to handle this increased demand coming from the commuter connections. Okay, thank you as we are on this slide. I'm not sure if you're done with your questions, Mike but I have a follow-up to this particular slide. Can you just clarify for us, so these improvements will be done at your expense or will that be shared costs with MTA? These are being done at our expense, and I should also point out that the new subway entrance over on Lexington Avenue is not something that we are getting any bonus for, because the MTA had recently reconstructed that staircase over there. We had to relocate that as I mentioned, because of the setback that we're creating on Lexington Avenue, so we won't be getting any bonus for that improvement, but we'll be paying for it, obviously that one's on our dime. Okay, thank you. The my last question is: do you have any opportunity, and are you required to do any work on the train shed I, think you're south of it, so I'm not totally sure where it starts, but is that does that have any connection to with the train shed? No we're clear of the train shed. Okay, sorry, any more questions from members of the committee, any more questions: no okay! Let's open up the floor to members of the public members of the public. Do you have any questions or comments to this proposal and for the applicant once again, I will reiterate that we're really discussing the scope of this proposal and what should be studied and assessed in the environmental impact statement that will be prepared for the review of this proposal, any questions or comments from members of the public. If you're joining us from a phone, you can press star nine to indicate you'd like to speak. Thank you Luke. Any questions comments. Okay, so seeing none, we will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to speak, which means that attendees members of the public are no longer allowed to speak, but that also applies to the applicant I. Just want to make that clear, given that the previous applicant got a little confused if we have clarifying questions, I will allow it because those are you know. This is a very important presentation and if we need to clarify any specific point, I will allow it, but otherwise we are in business session. Members of the committee are going to make comments and we're going to make a motion. So, let's start who would like to make the first comment, members of the committee on this important proposal. You can use the race hand function. We do need comments. If you don't make comments, I will call on you. I see a hand up. Yeah Dave go ahead, Dave well, just so for everybody's information, the Metlife Building, which is a great example of the brutal architecture of the airline industry. Taking over grand central, that's 800 feet tall roughly 800 feet tall, the Chrysler building, which is directly across the street from this pot, is one thousand feet tall. It's one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and one of New York's finest landmarks. This building, as proposed for the additions to it, is going to be 1600 twice as tall as the Metlife building. I just want everybody to keep that in mind as they're thinking over this proposal and the way that the cantilevering over the existing airspace is just for me. Another example of the brutal brutality of some architecture that just grabs and takes as much space as humanly possible. The mezzanine looks beautiful. Why can't the building just be 800 feet tall? That's my two cents! Thank you, Dave. So I think that you know, let's keep in mind, that we're really commenting on the scope. So I think that, as this comment relates to the scope, we should make sure that the visual corridors, you know the Vista corridors. The views onto the other landmarks, especially the Chrysler building, are assessed in this environmental impact statement and also I. Think the access to air and light needs to be properly assessed and it needs to meet the you know the minimum requirement of the code. There should be no exemption and no variance given and I think that they, you have a point. This cantilevering, you know like tapering out shape, may have a negative impact here. Mike really might go ahead. I just wanted to comment if the seven train improvements are in phase two, that we would ask that the phase two be incorporated into this environmental impact statement. Instead of waiting for another process, yeah very good point, yeah ej, you know I think I might make a similar comment about pedestrian connections to things that are currently under consideration. Like improvements to the viaduct. You know we know that they're being considered, you know it might make sense if they were included within the scope of the of this EIS, instead of being punted to a later phase, certainly when they're being considered. But you know, that's just one suggestion or caveat yeah in general: I think the all-encompassing scope to all of the new transit access and transit improvements is appropriate. You said air and light and view corridors I think definitely need to be in scope as well yeah, so I just want to make sure that members of the committee understand what it means that they're going to seek an approval for the definition of the qualifying site as being one qualifying site with the terminal and the Hyatt. So if you remember your arithmetics classes, the far is a ratio. Okay, so it's a proportion of you know a fixed number. So the way that the text works is that you know if you do a transit upgrade you get a you know. Three far, you know an additional 3, far so floor area ratio is basically the square footage of the base of your lot multiplied by a multiplier. So if the base of your lot is, you know the narrow size of the footprint of your tower, then you know your base number is fairly small. What the applicant is proposing is that, although they're not doing a lot merger but because they are adjacent to the terminal and because they own the terminal or they own the air rights, they or maybe they don't and you actually, the ownership is kind of irrelevant here, but they're proposing that the qualifying site becomes the entire footprint, including the terminal itself, and therefore your base numeral. Is that much greater? So when you multiply that amount of square feet by three, you can see that you gain a tremendous amount of added density and you know certainly much more than if the qualifying site was strictly the site where the hotel is going to be constructed. So I would be really inclined to actually have a study of the action, as it would pertain only to the side of the tower and I think that should be evaluated in as an alternate development in the EIS, because I believe that the east Midtown rezoning did identify the site as being a potential development side. So it was not a development site for sure and they had anticipated that it would reach a 23 far. I believe that this particular proposal would reach a 30 far and depending on how you calculated, it could actually be even more so I think that we should ask that a alternate development be studied with only the footprint of the tower as being the base for the calculation. Okay, any other comments on the scope that you feel should be included anything about the use. So currently it is a hotel. The hotel is going to remain in a different form and there's going to be an influx of office space. Any concern do we have any concerns about displacement of you know particular businesses displacement of a particular type of employees, anything that we want to flag for that. My I'll start with Mike go ahead, yeah, yes, I! Thank you for bringing this up. The current Grand Hyatt hotel has about 60,000 square feet of event. Space ballrooms, meeting rooms, and things like that and food and beverage employees are take up, are very labor intensive for a hotel, so I just I, don't think. I saw any plans for any similar, and now it's not going to be the same amount, but any similar amount of media, meaning meeting event space or any kind of food and beverage inside the hotel. That's a similar proportion to the existing Grand Hyatt, as you know, becoming part of the scope and really flagging that. As a you know, social economic impact, a very good point: I saw another hand up I. Think that Dave Achilles, you had another comment. Well, yes, one more comment. The plan as it stands is a great plan. The subway definitely needs work around there. It just seems to me the trade-off for the work for one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan for providing what the city needs anyhow and what any decent developer would do. In the course of events, it seems to me like a huge trade-off from what is it from 11 1100 feet to 1600 feet for just doing what any good developer would do with the subway system in this particular case. Thank you yeah. Thank you. Other areas of concern in the environmental impact statement are landmarks and other historic resources. The social economic impact which we touched upon, transit access to air and light parks. So, let's touch briefly upon this notion that the open space would not be at great but would be elevated and would be encroached upon by restaurants and other. You know commercial structures. Do we want to flag that in the environmental impact statement? The requirement is that the you know in exchange for this development, the developer has to provide 10,000 square feet of publicly accessible space. So currently the space is not at great. Is it something that we want to flag as being of concern and should be evaluated in the I EIS say yes, okay and any other is, do we have consensus on that I see some head shaking Nancy go ahead, oh you're, in mute, yeah accessibility to that second level is really important, so we need to make sure that it's accessible for everyone, including elderly, who don't normally climb how many steps that's a very long staircase, and so there needs to be elevators available to the disabled and elderly so that they can enjoy that park. Space yeah, okay, so I think we can put that in the accessibility. Buckets Ej, no I, just second, that I think it should definitely I think the accessibility should definitely be studied. The number of points of access you know should be measured and their you know capacity per hour to make sure that it doesn't become like a you know, unreachable sky deck, but that you know the intended number of pedestrians can actually access it easily and, as was mentioned excessively yeah Nancy. You have your hand up again. Okay, I just wanted to say that I have a concern about that second level. Outdoor space. Will it be? Will there be some security there, because if it's down on street level, you have a street level passersby and pedestrians who keep these spaces fairly active? It seems to be more remote, and that has a concern. So there's gonna have to be some security, 24 7 security, to make sure that it is well that it's safe, I, guess yeah. You know I think that that's the other, the issue that I have with the space I think that you know. Theoretically, it's a great idea in practice. You know I always get nervous when I hear the word. Oh, you know it has to be activated because activation in our realm means you know giving it away to for commercial use which defeats the purpose of having an open space publicly accessible, open space and if we're creating an open space that is not publicly accessible or that is not publicly desired because it is deemed unsafe. Without you know, giving it away turning it away to a private operator, then I think we have failed. So you know I think maybe in the parks section of the EIS, we should flag that you know the space has to remain public open, safe, inviting to all without you know having to be in the know, I mean how would people even know that there's a park on the second level of this building? It's you know, I think once again, it's a great idea, but we need to make sure that the execution of the idea you know, reaches its goal. It would be terrible. You know to end up with a failed area that is unsafe and uninviting. You know, and who knows you know what other aspects need to be studied. You know, is there going to be a wind corridor that will make it totally unusable, because you know it will be so windy and cold, so we I think we need to make sure that the scope addresses those concerns Julie, since we're on the topic of accessibility for the public space, I'm wondering if it's appropriate, to ask for public bathrooms for this project. It's a lot of far and Midtown's getting denser and we don't have enough public bathrooms. I don't know if this would be an appropriate ask yeah, absolutely the one Vanderbilt Tower has a public bathroom. As you know, our borough, President Gail Brewer, was absolutely adamant and she actually raised hell and she made it happen and I actually had the privilege of visiting the bathroom. It's amazing and I think it's a real. You know it is a true public humanity. You know, I know that people can be a little. You know no shalom, but oh, you know, and there are other well actually in Midtown. It is really critical. So I think that we should add that, as you know, becoming part of the scope for the park area Aaron, you have your hand up go ahead, so it just it definitely. Second, the issues on the public space I, think that is a concern you know. My other comment is that you know that the density that this building is going to do on one of the busiest intersections in the world I think is understated and I. You know I, look, there's the transit improvement is great, but the reality is that not everyone, who's going to be working in this building is going to be coming from grand central. So we we've got to look at the pedestrian impact on those intersections the buses, the you know, the people there's going to be people who drive into the city who work in that building. So the impact on the density in this now mixed-use, commercial plus hotel is astronomical and I think that you know again in one of the busiest corners in the world. You know that needs to be really studied because I do think. That's a concern. That's not just alleviated by. You know updating the subway platform. You know, especially in a prolonged potential. You know future pandemic people are not going to be using mass transit. You know for periods of time. You know, I think that should be a concern here. You know that the viability of that project I think comes into question, but you know that's not our issue. Yeah no I think it's very important and I think that this project needs to be assessed in conjunction with other developments that either are about to come online or are in the pipelines, and that includes you know, obviously, vendor build what one vendor build, which is on the other side of the terminal, but also the MTA building that is slated for redevelopment and other projects in east Midtown that are coming online, including the Jpmorgan Chase redevelopment of additional sidewalk is even going to make a dent, given the amount of density that this building is going to bring so I think it's very important to properly study it and certainly to flag it so that it's fully within the scope very good point. Other comments on this project. Anybody else would like to make any comments, any areas of concern that we have not yet talked about Nancy. Okay, this is really to whomever is going to be. Writing our comments on the EIS, we'll we're gonna be doing. Our board is gonna, be doing some response right to the scope at some point, so I think we have one that we did for one Vanderbilt and people could look at that and build on that. That's a really great document, I, don't know when we're going to be doing that, but that's a good document to start with it. We, it did produce a lot of things that we wanted, and so I think that whoever is writing these. Our own response can certainly build on that, and that may not be yet, but I just want to make sure that everyone knows we have that available. Yes, that's absolutely very good point. All right, I think that we've touched on most of the areas that we are concerned with. I would think that we really need to emphasize the evaluation of impact on air and light the sky exposure plane, you know, is a great concern. We need to make sure that there's enough light coming onto Lexington, Avenue and 42nd street, because with all this density coming online, is going to become very dark at the street level and yeah any thoughts on. So, as you know in a an environmental impact statement, it is typical to request a alternate scenario, so not only the no action and with action, but we can also ask for an alternate action. Is there any alternate action that you think should be evaluated and any specific you know aspects that we feel should be part of this development? Any you know public amenity, cultural, educational, space that you should be dedicated in you know within the building, any other public you know amenity or benefit. We believe should be assessed any thoughts Nancy well. This may not be the right location, but the school construction authority and the board of Ed is always looking for educational spaces anywhere. They can find them they're always needing to find places to add seats. So I don't know if this is the right location, but it could be work. People could come to work and drop their children off of school and then pick them up at the end of the day. Yeah very good one I mean we could. We can certainly add it. The study may yield the conclusion that you know it's not the right location but I think it's a good idea to flag that Dave. Well, once again we're talking about building one of the tallest buildings, certainly in Manhattan, if not the world, for what it is and to just plop it right there between Madison Square I, mean between grand central station and the Chrysler building. You have to think about the density of this building. How huge it is. Perhaps they could give us some of the amenities and make a smaller building like I, say: what's wrong with a building, that's 800 feet tall, less density, it's going to overwhelm the neighborhood amazingly! Thank you, okay! Thank you. Any other thoughts on a community space or you know public benefit space. You know healthcare, educational, Cultural, okay, so I see no comment on that. So educational space I agree. It's a good idea, so it look. Yep Nancy go ahead. Well, we could always ask for non-profit performance spaces. I mean the performing arts. Industry has been really hit bad by Covid-19 and in order to bring some of these back, they may have to have inexpensive spaces that where they can restart their activities, because we are the center of entertainment and I would that might be something that could be considered for non-profit theater arts organizations yeah. Okay, we can, you know phrase it in. You know like mix it with education and performing arts and ask for that to be assessed. Okay, so I think we have a good list of the areas that we want to comment on. So you know, I, don't think that we're really in a position to you know, issue an approval or a denial. You know we really need to comment on substance on the scope, so I think it will be a resolution with no resolve. It will be just you know, a list of the areas of concern that we want studied as part of the environmental impact statement and I think this is what we did for one vendor built. It was not really, you know whether we were in favor or against the scope. It was just you know. The additional areas that we want to be part of the scope is everybody. Okay. So, as a result, I don't think we're gonna be taking a vote because we're not really taking a position. We're just basically agreeing that those are the areas we want included in the scope is everybody is, in agreement, I see some thumbs up. Anyone opposed to this way of proceeding, okay, seeing none. We will adjourn this matter and move to the next application and thank you so much to the applicants for a great presentation, all right, so we're moving on to 118 West 28th street. This is a an application for a BSA variants to permit the development of non-conforming troll story: mixed-use, commercial and residential building in an m16 district. So I think we have the applicants for this proposal and you have before go ahead hi good evening. My name is Eric Palatnik, I'm an attorney and I'm representing the Fox family and I hope. You could all hear me: okay, I'm just making sure you're not getting any feedback. It's nice to see everybody. This application we're here for variance application request, which we came before you about a year ago, almost exactly last November, the property is at 118, West, 28th Street, and if it's okay with you I'd like to share the screen with you, would that be acceptable? Yes, go ahead! Absolutely! Okay! Let's see, if I could do this correctly, I see Boston. It did not come up on my screen. The way it should have. Can you take over the control yeah? Thank you great. So Austin is taking notes first tonight and he created the presentation. That's here tonight, so thank you Austin. So we're asking you keep it right here for a second Austin you can see. The site here is in yellow it's outlined in yellow it's next to a series of taller buildings, including a hotel. That's right next door, as well as multiple residential uses on the block, we're in an m16 zoning district, we're entitled to build a 10 far from manufacturing or office use. Unfortunately, the site. The presentation you just heard was so on point. This site is not the presentation. You just saw it's not a great site for an office use and it's improved upon with a two-story building that was built at the turn of the last century. It's really outlived its useful life, so the owner's desires of rebuilding the site and creating a new building there. It was originally allowed to be a hotel. It was an m16, but then the hotel special permit came into effect a few years ago, which of course, doesn't allow hotels without a special permit. Also, in addition to that, we've experienced Covid-19, which has had its own special effect on hotels and office spaces and this site, which I'll go through a little bit more. If you also go to the next page, we'll go through with you, why it's not so suited for office use and why we're asking you permission or for variants to allow it to be developed as a residential building. This page explains to you some of the pedigree information about the site. The left side tells you what we're asking for, which is what I just explained, which is the top left we're asking for a BSA variants to allow a 12-story residential building in an m16 zoning district. It would be 124 feet tall if you were to approve it would contain 19,000 square feet of floor area of that 19,000 square feet. 1470 would be ground floor, retail, it's a very small lot and the rest of the building would be residential, including the upper floors. If you can go to the next page, please Austin that shows you the site right there. It's situated between sixth and seventh avenues squarely within an m16 district, but just off the edge of sixth, which you know has the c64x overlay which allows for residential or the please. This slide is just originally the same slide that we showed you at the start. At the outset. This gives you some kind of a sensation or feeling for what's going on around us. You can see the 18 story, building next door to us seven story: buildings across the street. You see the flower and plant, whereas obviously we're in the flower district with a hotel across the street. Go to the please, because this is just repeats. What you've already seen here. You can start to see how the what the block looks like up close. You can see to the left and the right. The flower shops downstairs with residential, that's upstairs with a hotel. That's immediately to the left, there's our site, you can see it right there if you can go to the please just gives you more of a perspective for what's going on the block. There were a lot of hotels from the best we can tell is one of the hotels has shut down, but we don't know about the others at this point to the please some more pictures of. What's on the block, the view on the top left shows you the hotel, that's the left of us with our site to the right. You can see how we're grossly underbuilt the way we are right now. Please- and this just gives you a feel for the scope and size of the structures that are all around us. We're certainly not what you just saw: we're not going to be the biggest building in the area if we were to be approved, please this gives you a radius diagram which I'm going to start going through with you just to show you the residential uses that are around us, as well as the other uses that are around us. Go to the please. This gives you a good perspective for the size of our lot. There are a few other lots around us that are of our size, most of them improved upon with taller four-story buildings up not as small as ours, which is just a once a two-story building. Please here you can start to get a feeling for what's going on around us, the color coding is, it shows you, the orange and yellow, starts to show you where there's residential and what we're trying to explain to you or to demonstrate to this slide is our block. This block up, you could see. There is a substantial amount of residential on the block. This slide just starts. To give you a perspective for what the rear yards and the roof heights are of. The buildings that are around us, primarily it just starts to show. If you look at what's in green, you can see that everything around us is 156 feet. 101 feet, 264 feet, it goes down to 50 feet and a couple or 30, but most everything really averages around the 120 foot mark please and go to the please. This is just more of the same up. This gives you a good perspective again for what building heights are around us. Just to give you an idea or, of course, on the left side of that slide there and lot 51 we're 34 feet tall, it's being circled, but you can see that what we're asking for is a 12 story. Building would really fit snugly right within the block and it would fill in a missing tooth on the streetscape next, please. This just gives you more of the same. You think you all have the idea you can skip through to the next. This gives you again I'm trying to show you here. Thank you, Austin, for making it bigger. We tried to break down the lot. The block view trying to show you what the uses are on each site. The darker orange is residential and you can see very prominently. Those uses around there. You also have on the corners. The lighter pink is also residential, so you can see it all around up and down. The block is certainly not dominated by any one particular use, but rather it's quite a bit of different uses with I would think a little too many hotels, please. This is just giving you more of the perspective of the same we're trying to show you here again, the residential that is around us. The sites that are numbered are sites that are similar in size to our property. This is all part of a uniqueness study. This is a variance. We must demonstrate that we're unique and what all these numbers are starting to demonstrate to you is that we've done a study within a thousand feet and we've identified some 288 sites that are somewhat similar in size to us, but when you narrow it down to the ones that are not developed upon and are substantially undeveloped, you really only come down to three sites and that's a site at 110, west 28th, 137, West, 28th and our site. That's shown here on the map. You could see on this. You can see site number, six and site number. Eight are really the only sites in the area that could possibly see piggybacking off of us to ask you to do what we're asking you to do most, every other site that we've represented is developed upon rather substantially, please I'll just go back. Actually. Excuse me please to make this a little more clear for you too, as you call to your attention the right side of this chart where you can see where the x's are, where it's either too small to be developed. It's under that lot might be small, but it's under common ownership with a lot next door, or the lot has frontage on a wide street which gives it more development ability. Please we created for you an as of right plan, because the essence of why we're coming to you right now is to tell you that the site right now is a money. Loser, it's obvious. It's a small site. It's not making a go of itself and to build as of right is a money loser, and we knew that before Covid-19 just slammed it home. What the only thing we're allowed to build on that site without any special approval, is an office building, and this is the office building that you're looking at the office building is tiny. It's nothing like was just explained to you about Midtown, about what you've created with the rezoning with Midtown East the type of office buildings you want to see created. This is crammed I'm about to show you the floor. Plates are tiny, there's a lot of waste on each floor by the time you're done with the circulation and corridors and things of that ilk. You're really left with virtually 30 loss factor of the entire building the building. When it's built, we've done a zoning. We've done an analysis of financial analysis. If you were to build this you'd lose 14 million dollars, so nobody would build it and that's before Covid-19, that's, even if you could entice people to cram into a small little office which, given what we've all just experienced, I, don't know if you're gonna see that as much anymore in the future. But that's for other people to tell us the please again. These pictures are just gonna start they're, just going to start to show you what it looks like okay, so here's a good example of the floor plans and how they start to lay out what you can see here. The areas in gray the shaded area are the areas that are common in most every building. It's normal you're. Looking at it, you probably don't even think twice about it, but it's not an income producing area and it's not usable functional floor plate. It's usable, you need it, but it's! You know nobody moves into a new office and says that has the nicest elevator I've ever seen or the best staircase I've ever seen. Rather, you know you're looking for space and it really doesn't arrive here and that's what we're trying to show you here with these plans. If you go to the it just repeats itself, the whole way up what you're looking at is on the lower floors. You have a loss factor of about 800 square feet on the lower floors out of about 1500 square feet on the upper floors, you're losing about 600 square feet on each floor if you're losing a substantial amount of space due to these core functions. That's why we're here! This is the essence of it. There's nothing. We have two choices. We could leave what we have forever or we can build an office building where we'll lose 14 million, which I don't think anybody would please and so we're going to take. You now keep going to the proposed. If you can now we're the proposed looks virtually identical to what you're allowed to build as of right. We're not trying to ask you for more than is allowed we're trying to mimic. What's allowed we're sensitive to you, we know your board is sophisticated and knowledgeable in zoning and has a very clear image of what you want to see created in your neighborhood. We're not trying to take advantage of that we're trying to create something tastefully designed. You can see the design here, the architects on the line they could talk to you about their design and Mr Fox is the building owner and he's on the line and they're interested in doing something. That's sharp, of course, they'll be bound by whatever approval if it should be granted to design it. The way that it's shown on the plan, because it is a BSA approval. So should you like the idea you can of course guide what would be constructed there if it were to be approved the rest of the slides going to take you through the building, it's very similar to what you just saw with the offices. There's not much to this building. It's tiny! The floor plates are my new. It's 23 foot, 20 foot wide and 100 feet. Deep, so there's not too much to it. The first floor, which you're seeing there in the middle of the page right here, is retail, it's hoped and intended. As we discussed last time, we were with you to bring the flower shop. That's there now back into the space when we rebuild it, that's our biggest hope. Derek who's on the phone has a great relationship with them and we'd love to maintain them. The upper floors, the second floor and all the upper floors are going to be residential. The second floor: let's go back one more go back, one more second, I went there, you go the top image here, shows you the second floor, which has two apartments: that's the only floor that has two apartments and really I. The reason it was done is because the second floor benefits from having the terrace or the roof of the first floor. So the unit that's on the back side of the building, could actually get some nice outdoor space. So that's why that was broken up. But if you go to the next floor, go on up, please Boston! You can see, as you start, to move up the building. Where are we on here I think we still might be on the office building. If I'm not mistaken, are we on the residential? No there. It is the bottom you can see. The bottom is broken up a little bit different. The bottom shows you how it breaks up a little bit differently. That's a full floor apartment that you're, seeing there. It creates a beautiful apartment that gives room for a family to move into it up and live in the apartments you're, not getting young transient people necessarily that are renting and in and out very quick, but rather we're trying to create something. That's going to be attractive for a family, that's going to settle in and that's why you're seeing walk-in closets you're, seeing bedrooms that could accommodate maybe two kids in a bedroom you're, seeing a formal, dining room, you're, seeing a kitchen you're, seeing a real home, not a micro apartment, so that is in essence. Our proposal to you. I tried to demonstrate to you the variance components, how we feel we're unique, how we feel we're fitting within the character of the neighborhood and how we know that we're losing money on most everything except for what we're proposing. So we thank you very much and we'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you very much. Let's jump right in members of the committee. Do we have any questions? John go ahead. Excuse me, Austin. You can stop sharing the screen for a second, so everybody can see everybody. Actually, if it's okay, can we leave the presentation on because most likely we're going to refer to it whatever you want. Thank you. You'll have the pleasure of enjoying our faces a little later, I had a lot before I've been 20. So far, hi John go ahead thanks, so I believe your economic impact analysis was done prior to Covid-19, but have you considered that you know obviously given the situation that we are in, that it also may not be favorable to construct a luxury or even market rate condo building either? At this point? No, we no none of the market data supports that residential is over in Manhattan by any stretch of the imagination. Although there is this and we've spoken to our consultants about this, although there's definitely a drop in the medium sales prices and the rental prices, there is still a steady stream of demand and there's a firm belief that, once a vaccine comes into play that it will come right to the same level, but in contrast, the office market has seen a cataclysmic plunge. That's incredibly well documented easy to see and everybody in the business world, including myself, who, up until Covid-19, I, still pay rent on an office I have no intention of bringing my entire office back into my office ever I. Don't think my office wants to go back in and I think everybody that I speak to that works in Midtown Manhattan feels that they'll be on a much different scale of office. Interaction for the next few years, at least that in comparison to people that I know and people we've spoken to and the brokers and everybody they don't see that with people's residences, they still see an interest in the city. So we there is a market there right now it is a feasible market for residential. There is nothing there right now for office, obviously, and whatever there was for hotels, is surely gone as well, so that that's how we feel about residential okay. Thank you. Any other questions from members of the committee Mike. Okay, thank you, hi Mike. What about the first floor that you think will make it conducive for the floors to come back? Is there anything special that you're doing to ensure that there will be a florist flower business that will come back to the sunflower market money we like art, we like okay, we like the tenant. That's there now, the tenant. That's there now Derek Fox is on the line. He's had a beautiful relationship with him. They want to see them flourish. They have no desire. The retail is not what's supporting the building at this location. Nobody nobody's coming to this block for anything other than flowers right now, and we don't think in the future that it is going to be a strong retail desire for anything other than something flower related. So we want to keep the history of it. We feel it's useful. We feel that it lends some stability to the building it feels attractive for the residential tenants above people would much. Rather, we think if you saw the pictures, it looked beautiful out front, even it's one of the few businesses that could stack all their stuff in front of a bit in front of their business and it looks gorgeous and that's how we feel about it and that's why we like to encourage it. Okay, thank you, and you could stipulate to that. If you want to in your conditions, we we're very happy to be committed to that. Okay, other questions. John, you have a follow-up question yeah, so your proposed plan, I, think, is 9.8 far and your as of right plan was 8.8 fbr, both of which are under the 10, far maximum that you have the in your proposed design. That design does not include setbacks, while the other bright one does. How much of the difference in far is due to the lack of the setbacks that are, at the whole that whole difference. You just said: yeah the m16 has a setback requirement. So that's what they're, adhering to with the m16, the variance doesn't have the same setback because the variance of breaking the rules, so we designed it without the setbacks, because it does have a substantial impact on an apartment layout if we set it back and it does match what's next to us on the block, it would be. You know if you want to go back and look at the pictures you can see. You know it doesn't we're not screwing up the streetscape Austin. If you can go to maybe one that gets a good shot of the hole up a little higher I. Don't know if there's anything against the height it's hard to get the height yeah they're, all just so of the tough how tall? What is the setback? Our building is proposed to be 124 feet tall. The building to the left of us is 17 stories. I, don't know exactly how tall, but it's got to be about 170 feet. Obviously it's 17 stories so and where do you go? What is the setback? What is the setback for the rare yard? Well, the setback is a 20-foot rear yard, but I think the question that was just being asked is: what's the setback for the as of right, commercial Austin? If you can go to the plan for the as of right, commercial I think he was asking me what the setback is in the front. Keep going there, you go so go back actually that image had it right there. If you could expand this or maybe get something a clearer image of this, but this gives you the setback that they're complying with, which is over the sixth floor. So that shows you there I, don't know if you could probably about 60 feet is where they hit the setback level there, and then they come back 20 feet. That's in the bottom. This is the design for the conforming news. That's the conforming use. Our proposal ignores that setback. We disregard that. We go straight up in the front and what is the rationale for a setback for a commercial delay? The zoning requires it. That's it it's the M16 requires it, and why are you exempt if you have a non-conforming use, we're not exempt the variance just doesn't abide by any rule at all, so we've designed it to be fully combined, except for the setback to get a better floor plate at that level for the residential. So not only you want a your variance for the use, but you also want a variance for the setback the set. Well, it's not really very once you vary the use. You vary all the rules, you're not bound by any but yeah, not necessarily I mean you have to be specific on what exactly you want to be relieved of? Well, yes, but the depart. You're right, I understand your question. Okay, so please go ahead and tell us specifically what in what ways this building is not going to be conforming as it pertains to the use to the bulk to the height to the rear yard and the setback requirements. Okay. So if we were applying the m16 regulations to this, it would not be complying with the front setback. Only the rear, it's providing a 20-foot rear yard, which is more than you're required to a commercial building, go right to the rear, with no rear yard and we're allowed to go up to a height in the district of I, think 100 and there's no limit on the maximum height. It's the sky exposure plane. So the 12 stories, I think is where it maxes out with the sky exposure, which is what you're, seeing here in the imagery that's being provided at the front. But there is no maximum height yeah, but there's this that exposure guys closure that captured it at 12 stories. So that's what you're, seeing here in the front when they're, showing you those angled lines that run off the front of the building in this image, they're drawing the sky exposure lines so that so, basically this is the conforming massing. Yes, okay, regardless of the use correct and then what you're composing is a variance that would provide relief on the use and the sky exposure plane correct, although just for your own edification, the department of buildings only gives us an objection for use. That's what I was trying to say before, because once that once I ask technically once I ask to vary the use, there are no bulk regulations that apply. So that's why so we're now the conversation you and I just had was analogizing the proposal as if the m16 bulk regulations would apply to a residential use, but they don't so just to clarify. I'm sure you appreciate that we care very much about the amount of light that gets onto ourselves. Yes, I! Do that's why I'm just letting you know! Technically you write it up the right way. We need to move on. I'm sorry, Aaron! You have a question go ahead, so just the comparison of what you're saying you know for that difference. You know you mentioned. You know the 14 million loss. You know based on your estimates, in a pre Covid-19. So did what are those numbers? Look like for residential value right projected by your real estate. You know consultants, I'm just curious about that percentage of difference right if you did without that bulk I just be curious. What those numbers are because again you're talking about this. If we lost this, if we complied with the setback, you're asking yeah. What's that percentage of fluorescence I've asked about it and it's not substantial enough that and I was going to say this. If it was something that was important to you, we could amend the plans to provide that setback at that portion and comply. That's not enough to kill the residential feasibility of it! Okay, but you don't have that I! Don't have that number with me, but I spoke about it beforehand, because I understand what you're asking where we're coming out in the front and I it's in the financial analysis. We can get it from the application. Yeah no and I can give it back to you too I. Just don't have it now. Okay, thank you any other questions from our members of the committee. Then we need to open up to members of the public and John yeah, just a quick one. So you mentioned a loss factor for the commercial structure, but I don't think I saw one for the residential version. Do you have a sector for that? No that's why the units upstairs are all single floor. Plate units they're one they're floor throughs, so you don't have a loss factor because you step right off the elevator right into your apartment, so you're using every square inch of the place. You don't have a lobby, you don't have circulation, you don't have anything. I mean I've only been into a couple of friends apartments in my life that have the elevators. It's really nice that come in, but you know they use every square inch of the place. So you don't get that same issue that you have in an office building events, what prevents a design that would function exactly the same, but for a commercial space where the elevator would get directly into the office space difference that comes up is that the function? It's the functionality of the office space. It's the ADA requirements in an office space, it's the turning radiuses that are needed. It's the handicapped bathrooms that are needed. It's the secondary means of this two secondary means of Egresses needed in an office building, so there's different method, there's different things that come into play in an office. Building that eat up more floor area up in the common areas that are not easy as easily utilized as they are in a residential scenario. So we I can give you the exact loss factor in the residential. There, surely is a loss factor, but it drops dramatically and also in a residential, remember in an office environment you're, paying per square foot based upon the space. That's your space! So if you have lost space, that's not money that they're actually getting returns on that space that they built. If you'd like I I'd, be happy to break it down for you a little bit and send it back to your board and give you the loss back to speak to our financial consultant. Okay, I think it's in the financial analysis that you said it is all right! Nancy! You have a question. Go ahead: yeah I just want to confirm that the building the lot is 25 feet wide. The lot itself is less I. Think it's 20 feet wide. I'm going to confirm it, so the building is 25 feet wide. How many I want to know the width? The lot is 20 feet wide by 20 feet wide by 98 feet. Okay, that I, thank you. You're welcome. Does this liver rule apply to this loss? This rule does not I, don't believe it does apply to this lot. Why not I'll find out? I've asked the architect and we've gone through it. I haven't spoken with them really about it. Eric this is Ian Rasmussen. The sliver law only applies in residential districts. That's a residential district bulk regulation. So even though it might sound a little counter-intuitive that rule is actually not applicable in an m16 zoning district, but I see where she's going. If it did apply, what would it do to this I believe the height of the building would be limited to the half of the street or 75 feet or 75, or you know, whichever is greater than the width of the street or 16. all right. Moving on any more questions from members of the committee Dave yeah, I'm sorry, the building immediately to the west has windows which are going to be totally blanked out by the construction of your building yeah. Those are like line windows. So in essence, it's the nature of the beast outline windows are, you know, bound to be blocked if the adjacent parcel gets developed? Okay, great. Thank you any more questions from members of the committee. Okay, so seeing none I want to open up the fourth two members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments for this application for members of the public questions or comments? Okay, let's start with oh Paul Barth, okay, Paul, you can unmute. Okay, can you please introduce yourself, including any affiliation that you have with this particular project or whether you're a resident? What is your connection with it? With this application, I live at 130, West, 28th street. It's a residential building and I have a couple issues. One is there's an alleyway next to the red brick building, so those windows would not be blocked up, but I was interested in hearing about fire. Egress there's got to be two means of fire egress in a residential building and they haven't shown. It is the architect we could have the architect answered anybody on from the architect's office, Oneplus One hi. How are you sorry? So there is the two means that you guys as you look at that, actually go back to the proposed plan. Yes go back next, if you look at it right now, there's actually the staircase is on both sides of the elevator. So there is a two mains right there. That's one staircase where's, the other, that's a two set of staircase. If you look at the top plan, number three proposed second floor plan. You see on the left and the right side, the elevator there's two set. So if you have one apartment on the floor, it's going to have two staircases in it. Yes, because we require too many egress and those, but just to be clear, those two staircases leave and where are they exit down on? If you come down the first floor, you will see one person front entrance actually another one further in the hallway. Is there a back entrance to the building? Unfortunately, there's no back entrance, because actually we don't have actually we don't have any eagles from the back. Okay. Thank you Paul. Does that address your question? Yes, but it doesn't sound right to me. Thank you for this. A 25 foot there's also a five foot alleyway. They split the lot and sold off 20 feet and five feet are still with the Red school building next door. Can you put a cursor on the plan so that we know what you're referring to a cursor? No I can't because I might not I, don't think I don't have it Austin? You can they're showing an alley on the top on the right side of the building on the West side. Yes, when that school, that was a school when they sold off the 25 foot wide lot next door, they replotted it to 20 feet and they put five on their school, so they left all the school windows. Oh so the school windows won't be blocked, you're, saying that is correct. It's why it's a 20-foot lot! Yes, gotcha! Okay, I, didn't know that. Excuse me, there's no mean of egress through this alleyway you can unmute yourself good night. Are you able to hear me? Yes, I'm the bookkeeper for one, the commercial businessman, I love the idea that you need commercial as well as office, space and residential, which is always good. But my thing is that, if you're doing that, you you're going to actually now take away a lot of this from the commercial I love that you want to bring back lieutenants of the year because they've been here over 20 years, but when you decide to build on everything different proof. What is young you're working with me to substitute all those monsters not being able now to make their funding because they're going to lose business workers that I'm implied by the laws of that as well as other things? What are you proposing to them now to compensate for that lost period of time until it's built Andy and you negotiate to bring them back with lesser space? What do you have in place? Thank you for this question. I, don't know who wants to take it on the epic inside I'd, be happy to answer we're working towards a sympathetic arrangement with the owners that Mr Fock is going to be talking them about to let them stay in place at a rent that will enable them to be comfortable with that. As far as any extra space goes up, there is a seller in the building where they'll have storage that'll be available. There's some commercial storage, as well as some residential storage it'll, be split, so they'll have space and will be very accommodating to them as far as the terms of their lease arrangements. Thank you and where are they supposed to go while you demolish the building and redevelop it were this proposal to be approved. We were intending before to work with them to try to find a temporary location before Covid-19 and now that the vacancy rates in Midtown have jumped so high, we think we'll be able to find them a suitable location, very close by for that time period. Okay, thank you any more questions from members of the public, okay, so seeing none we're gonna move back to our business session during business session, as I said previously, only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter. Just you know a few pointers for members of the committee, so this is a BSA variance in order for a BSA variance to be granted, the applicant needs to satisfy five findings. The first one is that this site is unique and is causing the hardship. The second one is that the hardship is not self-caused, meaning that you know the owner of the site did not cause this difficult situation that prevents a fair return on their investment with conforming use, and you know among like among those five three that are really crucial, is also that it is the minimum variance necessary for providing relief. So those are the parameters and all those five findings need to be met in order for the variance to be granted. So I would like to hear your comments before I share mine I see some hands up. John yeah John go ahead so right off the bat I think that, obviously the you know most, the obvious thing you know in terms of uniqueness is that this is a very small lot, which is you know, kind of understood and puts them in a unique situation. But one thing that I've had trouble with when I was reviewing this application. Is you know the minimum variance point that Layla just mentioned? So you know I did I was actually very. You know pleased to hear that the applicant was considering to amend the plans such that the setback would be reapplied in the proposed plan. In order to you know, have the you know the bulkiness of the residential spa, the residential plan, as is to be you, know, removed a little bit so I think that's something that we should. You know definitely consider you know to ask them yeah. Thank you for that. Other comments from members of the Committee Nancy Well 20 feet wide is very narrow. Most brownstones are 18 to 25 feet wide, so this is narrower than a number of brownstones. I think that this is the best use for this building and I think they have a unique situation and I think we should support this BSA application. I think that there's nothing else that would really fit here. It's just the width of the building is too narrow, so I think we should support this okay, so I'm gonna jump in and share a diverging view. I agree that the site is very narrow. If this were to be in a residential or a commercial district, the sliver rule would apply, and the essence you know behind the sliver rule is that a very narrow lot should not be developed higher than either the width of this the street or 60 feet, whichever one is greater, so I think in that case it's the width of the screen, the street, which is 75 feet, so I think that the applicant is asking a lot. A use change you know, bringing residential development in a manufacturing district is something that really we don't condone. This has always been an issue, especially in this particular part of our m16 district. Then the fact that, on top of a use change they are asking for a relief on the setback is also something that you know is very problematic. As a result of that, the amount of light that will come to the sidewalk will be that much diminished as opposed to a building that would be, you know conforming use, because then it would also have to conform to the bulk requirements of this district, and you know I agree that the site is very narrow but as narrow as it is for a commercial development. I think that it is very narrow for residential development and although the numbers are made to appear that you know they support the case for hardship. We have to keep in mind that in the conforming use the development is smaller, because there is a major setback which is not respected in the residential bulk massing. So I don't think we're comparing. You know, apples to apples and oranges to oranges. If the massing was, you know conforming. If the bulk was conforming to the zoning requirement, the residential analysis would be different and it would be much closer to the result that we have with the commercial development and then finally, you know overall, we've been dealing with these applications that come to us over and they're located in this area. You know 27 28 29, and it's always the same story that we hear you know our lot is you know too complicated, difficult, narrow, wide too big too long to something and we want to become residential. Basically, what we hear is there is an impetus for residential use in an area that is zone manufacturing. If that is the case, then the route is a rezoning, and this is something that we may entertain. You know we may find out that you know. Manufacturing use is no longer the best use for this district and that it should become a commercial district that would allow residential as a right, but then the whole evaluation of this use change would be taken into account. This account amounts to zoning and support this proposal. I really feel that you know if we approve this I, don't know how we say. No to you know the next BSA application that comes to us, especially given that the hotel use is no longer and as of right use, and although it's permitted, you know it's now by special permit. So you know as much as I do appreciate that you know the condition is, you know, certainly difficult because of the narrowness. I really feel that this is not the minimum variance and I do think that a commercial development would be financially sustainable. So I need more comments. Any more comments from members of the committee, I'm gonna start calling on people, otherwise Aaron I'll call on you know: I see both sides of this one I, I'm a little torn but I. You know I think it is. You know problematic, because there are a lot of sites like this in that neighborhood. So if we're gonna, you know if we're gonna, let this variance approval happen. You know, there's lots of other subject sites that could you know apply for that same issue. So it's like at what point you know: is this the exception that it's just it's a larger? You know zoning challenge for the area, so I definitely struggle with that, because look at the markets are could change every five years and that what's to say that you know, if we're taking this lot out of, you know out of the hands of commercial as a possibility. You know five years down the road. You know that could be viable again so that you know to allow that and that make that permanent change to residential. You know and yeah I think it's just it's a tricky precedent to set, so I'm a little on the fence, but I'm probably leaning against not supporting it. Okay, thank you. Dave, you have your hand up, go ahead, Dave yeah, it's a shame, believe it or not. I used to work for a florist about 20 years ago, and all the buildings on 28th street were four stories tall and it was a beautiful part of New York and all those new buildings. The pictures that we saw today on the street have gone up in the last five or six years in that neighborhood and we've seen the neighborhood change drastically and I feel sorry for the developer and the person who owns the lot. But that's not our problem. That's not what we're discussing here. I believe Layla has the right approach and perhaps the only thing I would consider if he were to turn the units into artist housing, then I might give it a consideration, but otherwise I'm going to have to go with Layla on this one all right. Thank you. Dave Nick, Laila I have to compliment your foresight because when we were discussing the zoning change and the special permit requirement for hotel use, you said this was going to happen, and now here we are so we were anticipating this problem and I think we need to protect the commercial use that you saw was going to be coming under attack. Yeah I mean when we evaluated the zoning tax amendment, for you know hotel special permit and manufacturing districts. We saw that happen, and you know I'm not necessarily saying that you know I would be enamored with a hotel development on this particular site, but I think that you know we are being a little more forced into you know agreeing that residential is the only way to go. You know once again. This is a thought that I can certainly entertain. You know. Is it time for this area of our district to be rezoned, there's a great case for it, but I really feel that you know the BSA approach is not the right approach. We need to be able to mitigate the impact of this use change. You know the influx of children that go to school, the use of parts facilities and also I, really have a great issue with the lack of bulk compliance with this particular design. Nancy, okay, I completely disagree with what you're saying this building is too narrow to even to be a hotel. This is a very limited use, and this is the only use that I think as an architect. You could really safely say you could do a layout for I'm appalled that no one sees that a 20-foot wide building can be used for anything else. I just don't understand, so I'm really shocked at the committee's approach to this request. Okay, thank you. Nancy Tristan I'll, just say that I agree with Nancy on this one. I'm not really seeing a lot of other uses for this building. I mean she's kind of spoken at length about it. So that's where I stand. Okay, thank you, Tristan all right, so it looks like there's. You know, split views on this one, so I need to hear more comments. I need to get a better feel John. Would it be appropriate, or would people be able to agree on this if we did something on the line along the lines of a deny unless resolution that called for the addition, the re-edition of the setback to you know make the bulk be more in line with the as of right development, but then satisfying. You know the ability to build residential on a very narrow plot. Is that something that people would want to entertain? Just throwing that out there as a possibility, unfortunately, I would not be able to support a use change through a BSA action. You know, I feel that you know in a way, I agree with Nancy I think that you know that the lot is narrow for commercial building, but also for residential building and I. Think that you know in the end, you spend much more time at home than you do at the office and I think that the flexibility for class b and class c office space is much greater. You know, I'm not sure that the layout that we saw as being proposed is necessarily the most efficient layout for commercial use. So I feel that you know the hardship would be. You know shifted to the occupants of those residential units, so I wouldn't be able to support a use change. Once again, you know I am totally willing to entertain. You know like a more systematic use, change in this district, that I think that the route is Arizona. Mike really I would be willing to support the use change if they would have the commercial use still on the first two floors as it is now. It's a two-floor building commercial. The first two floors will continue to be commercial and then have the residential above that and if they didn't like John suggested with the normal manufacturing setback. I would be perfectly okay with that, but I would be willing to support a use change for this area, because we've seen what hotels have done to that street and to the flower market yeah Nancy again, is it possible for us to see an elevation to see what the height is of the buildings on either side of this building? I, don't recall what that looked like. Is there a way to see the heights of the buildings on either side? I, don't think, there's I, don't know if there's an elevation, but I can go back to the diagram that showed like all of the buildings in the area and like the building. Because of the building buildings on either side are a certain height. It would be better to match those than to have a very short building, because you it's nice to have this a street wall, that's the same contiguous through the whole length of the street. So this is this site right here and then these are the two buildings and so what and how high? And can you show us how high your building would be yeah you have a drawing of that. Do you have a drawing? You can show us that yeah we're in business session, so I'm sorry, I didn't see. That would help to for me to understand. Sorry, yeah, but I hear your point. You know there's a case to be made for a contiguous street wall rather than having a recessed building. When the adjacent buildings have a straight wall. The Nancy, the adjacent building you know, is a hotel. That is the whole. You know front wall is actually recessed 25 feet. So in any case, because of you know the damage that these hotels have done to this block, the streetscape is already you know very seriously damaged, so the adjacent the exit the proposed building would be. You know sticking out when the hotel would be recessed. Okay, I guess, in terms of being a business owner, I feel that this property owner is being penalized because the department of city planning has not done a change in zoning in this area and we're hanging our hat on the fact that there needs to be a change in zoning, so this property owner is being compromised and is not able to get the value out of his land. I think that's very important thing for us to think about. Well, we are the community board. So what we look is you know for the interest of the community. You know I. Think rezoning gives us the opportunity to properly assess impact on schools parks. You know, I, think that the applicant may be interested in you know, teaming up with other property owners and introduce a rezoning. I think that this is something that definitely we would entertain. You know provided that it's done the right way. Other comments. It really looks like we are totally split on this one other comments. Otherwise, we're gonna have to just wrap it up and take a vote and see where it all falls any more hands being raised on this one. Okay, so seeing none, we need a motion to deny. Okay and I will second that, okay. So it's a motion to deny the application. Just to you know underscore the reasons the uniqueness is not enough to make the case, and this would not be the minimum variance necessary to relieve hardship. We should also take the opportunity to comment that a rezoning, a more systemic use change should be entertained by the Department of City planning to provide the unnecessary relief in a way that would not amount to spot zoning which this Vsa action would amount to all right. Are there any questions or comments to the motion before we take this to a vote all right, so the second vote of the evening? Sorry Dave! Yes, Nick! Yes, Julie, yes, Aaron, yes, Nancy, no Mike, no Tristan, no Ej, yes, John, yes, Rachel! No Ryan is still not with us and Laila. I'm a yes one, two three, four, five, six, seven one, two, three: four: okay! So the motion passes seven to four all right. Thank you very much to the applicant for their presentation to members of the public for their good comments and to members of the committee for a good discussion. Moving on to 25 east 21st street. This is the Gramercy condominium. This is an application for an authorization pursuant to section 15-20 b of the zoning resolution to waive the four area: preservation requirements of section 25-21 for permitted commercial and manufacturing uses to allow the conversion of an existing 11 story, building to group use two which is residential use, so brace yourselves, because it's almost like what we just did, except that it's totally different and we have the advocate here. I'm sorry we have the applicant and you have the floor and go ahead. You can give us your presentation. Okay, I'm Jordan Mohs, I'm an attorney Brian case and I represent the condominium board there at 25 East 21st street, which is a 11-story condominium building. Well, let me just first explain: I! Guess the action that's being sought. This is a request. So it's exactly. As you explained, it's just like the last one except completely different, so it's an existing building, so there's as a baseline concept. There's a there's, no new construction, that's compromised what this is a city planning action, that is, an authorization, not a Euler affection authorizations are non-Mueller under section. 1520 b is in boy of the zoning resolution, which empowers the commission to waive the preservation requirements of 1521. It's the building is located in M15 M zone. The M zone is what allows what is an otherwise manufacturing district that doesn't permit residential use to for buildings and for buildings to be converted to residential use, subject to satisfying certain preservation requirements which are set forth in 1521. 1520b is. This is a escape patch from the preservation requirement. If you will for buildings that are located for buildings to satisfy four specific criteria, the four criteria are, you need to be a landmark building or you need to be in a historic district, and this property is in the ladies mile, this Oregon district, the alterations that are proposed to the building needs to be approved by LPC. The applicant has been through the Opc process and has those approvals in hand. There are several different LPC approvals, a certificate of no effect and a and there's a cpa, LPC report or memorandum of use MOU. The third finding is that the applicant agreed to a continuing maintenance program so in some respects, I. Think of this section 1520b, which is a not often heard section by anyone. The last time this particular section was used in this area was in I think it was 2016 floors. Two through five of seven East 19th street was were converted to residential use. It's very much a kind though to 74,711 and in fact, and I'll get there in one. Second, in fact, so you have to go through an LPC process and the fact that you need to agree to a continuing maintenance program for the landmark structure and then the fourth finding is that the conversion comply with the density requirements at 474,711, section, subsection A3, which is which allows for a much greater density, that's being contemplated anyway, I think of it as a mini 74,711 because of the landmark status. There's a what the zoning resolution is saying: look will allow you to convert that which you wouldn't otherwise be able to convert because you're, this landmark building and you're gonna you're, going to jump through the traditional 74,711 preservation hoops here. The building a little bit about the building is and boy it's late. I know so I'll try to make it as quick as possible the build. The lot is a 44 by 98 lot. Let me see if I can relinquish my share my screens so okay, so do you see my screen? You seem screaming now right. Yes, we do right. So the property is on at 25, east 21St street, between Broadway and Park Avenue South on the north side of the street. It is 44 by the Apd. It's about 4,300 square feet, the building. That's it some site was built in 1904. It's an 11 story. Building I'll show you a picture of that in a second, and it has about 40,000 square feet in the building it, and it was converted- and this is maybe one of the most significant aspects to this application- is that this building is not. This building is a condominium. It's a commercial condominium and each floor is a separate unit, so there are basically 11 units in this building. The 10th and 11th can basically comprise one unit as the 11th floor is a smaller penthouse floor. The floors are about number 4300 square feet, a little less, maybe 40 about 4300 square feet like the like a lot there there's a seven foot rear yard in the back of this building, so they're more like 4,200 square feet for the floor, the preservation requirement of 1521. That would otherwise be uphill here. If the building were not in the historic district in 1520 were not available to, it would require preservation for lots under 5,000 square feet would require 33 of the building to be preserved per commercial there's, a special section under 15212 that allows for a reduction in the amount of preservation which gets which, if you're eligible for that, can reduce the preservation requirement in this particular case, it would reduce it to about 21 and the application before you is requesting permission or permission under the authorization application to convert the whole building to residential use. The building is completely occupied and used for commercial use right now by the owner occupied continuing units owners. Historically, this actually was a application in front of the state Planning Commission I, don't believe it ever got to the community board. In 2007, the 747-111 application was filed to convert this building and then the aftermath of midst of the 2000 2007-2008 financial crisis. The application was basically abandoned. So that's let me try and run through another slide here. This is actually from one of the not really slide and rolling pdf. You can see here the historic district and 25 east 21st is in this northeast corner of storm district, and this is the building's facade here on. The left of this is from the landmark set of plans. There's also a different set plans for city planning. Three of the primary landmark treatments that are to be addressed is a complete, replacing of the storefront condition or with something different. I'll show you that in a minute, as well as replacement of louvers and vents on the building and window replacement master plans as well so see again, I, I'm just gonna quickly return to this. Now, let's see what else I've got here, so this is a building from a street view of the building. Looking up, this is looking down the block. Looking westward. This again is the building here on the right. You can see, there's a mishmash of buildings ranging from easily from 20 stories down to three or four stories and I think there's even a couple of sites that have no buildings. This is the area land use map. The site is in here, so we've got yellow orange and this yellow and this dark orange are all residential and or mixed-use buildings. There are two residential buildings next door to the site. There's residential across the street. There's obviously I mean it's very much a mixed use area. There's a plan showing the elevation of the building. These are yeah, I'm not going to get into the details of the landmark materials. Unless someone really wants me to at this point. This is a diagram that I prepared for city planning. At some point, it's a schematic diagram that illustrates what's going on the block, if you will so this is basically the tax mask, so here's street here's broadway on the left and Park Avenue South on the right and near each of the lots as you head down the street. This is all m15 and then the red line is hard to see the on the right of the red-line, which obviously allows residential use and makes use on Park Avenue south. But here is all m15 m and there are three lines here: one is on the in the top on this side of the street and on the bottom numbers, not so important, but it tells you how many stories each of the buildings are and how many residential units are on each of the blocks of the two sides. There are approximately 80 in the only in the m15 and approximately 80 residential units on the north side of the street and approximately 58 residential units in the south side. So then I will just want to quickly mention that I think what's unique here, one thing and there's not because this is not a BSA case. Of course there's not a hardship finding or a uniqueness finding, but there is something that is unique about this building that I think is relevant and because it is a commercial condominium, it's not a it's, not in the more fluid which is, you know, I, remember thinking about that term or writing that term before Covid-19 and it's not as applicable now because of the obviously the challenging commercial market that we have. But it's not in the commercial rental market, it's a commercial condominium which means- and these are which means there's a significant commercial of capital outlay. That's required to acquire one of these units and lenders. I think don't view these as favor as a whole building or as favorably as a residential unit. There is not as in as free-flowing a market as commercial rental, space or residential condominiums they're, much less common and because they require significant capital outlining initially it's not something. A lot of businesses are interested in tying up their money in they'd, rather pay their rent as money comes in not figuring out how to lay out hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in order to acquire one of these units, I think I will I think I'll, let it rest there I yeah, I'm sure. Okay, thank you. Some questions before we jump into question. I just want to mention that this application actually did come to us in 2007. It came to the Landmarks Committee of E5. It was reviewed for the maintenance plan and, as the applicant explained, in order for this particular article of the zoning resolution to be used, LPC needs to issue a report supporting a maintenance plan in perpetuity. So if you guys are familiar with the local law 11, it is basically a similar process, but on steroids, just you know, imagine that you know you with local 11. You need to keep your building in good structural condition. With this particular report, you need to keep your building in good, historical, contextual, restorative condition, so we did weigh in on that and CB5 approved the landmarks portion of this application. So I just want to reiterate that it is exactly like the previous one, except that it is totally different. We are, it is not a BSA variance. The applicant is not making the case, although the applicant mentioned some, you know hardship notions attached to this use change, but this is not the article that is being used and the hardship is not actually in question. What is in question and I'm going to read to you what the requirements are. So it is a non-discretionary action certification by the Department of City planning, and the requirements are that such building is either a landmark or lies within a historic district designated by the Landmark Exposition Commission. So this is the third thing right here yeah, so I'm just gonna go through it. If you don't mind any alterations to the subject, building required in connection with such conversion to residential use have received a certificate of appropriateness from LPC. That condition is also met. The program has been established for continuing maintenance that will result in the preservation of the subject building, as evidenced by a report from the Landmark Preservation commission. This has been issued and such building or portion thereof, being converted to residential use shall comply with the density requirements set forth in paragraph a three of section: 74,711, the landmark preservation in all districts. So these are the requirements to give this authorization. The part that is important to also understand is that there is a preservation requirement and when I use preservation, it is in a land use context, meaning that a commercial use should be preserved, and you know technically, the building should have some commercial use and should not be 100 residential, and in that instance, the applicant wants a 100 residential use to become permitted. So with all those clarifications, let's open up two questions from members of the committee. Any questions all right, no yeah Mike- might go ahead. So explain to me one more time why 15,212, with the one floor, commercial being required, is not being used with this application. Sure so 15. So like it's on the screen, I don't know, can you see the screen right now this text? This is a text from you mentioned 15. You mentioned this section, which is right nearby. It's 15212 the reduced floor area, preservation, I, think you were referring to this concept right here, where it says less than five thousand square feet one floor plus in buildings of more than six stories. Twenty-Five percent of the floor area is that right that we're looking at yes, so that would be that is applicable, but there is this other section and that's why I'm here in that section 1520, allow I understand that part. I'm asking what is the financial I know? It's not a variance. So I know it's not the minimum requirement, but I'm I. Guess I'm trying to ask it in that. In those terms, what can be done at the minimum and if 15,212 could be a minimum and if it can't be, why not sure so? I'd rather not talk about 15212, but let me talk about a minimum and I guess, as I remember, I think the building is prepared to recognize that the first floor may be better suited from an economic perspective from a planning perspective, maybe to remain commercial, so I think that's a that's like a peace offering if you will that I, I'm able to I think put on the table. The first floor is a full floor. It's about 4,300 square feet and comprises about 10 of the building's floor area right because I think it's even a little more 10. 10.5 percent of the building's floor area, building about 40,000 square feet and the first floor is about 4300. So I guess in my answer. I'd like to make I'd like to set that as a baseline preservation. Offering so does that mean you're amending your application. I will if we are prepared to amend the application, if that's how, if yeah we're prepared to do that, so would that mean you're in complying with 15,212 and not 15, 20 b, no we'll still be short of 15 2, 1 2, because fifteen two one two says that you have to preserve the first floor and then for buildings over six stories. You have to preserve 25 percent of the floor area in excess of the sixth floor and when I do the math that comes out to the preservation of about probably the first floor, plus another floor and a half and that's yeah. So it comes out it's probably about 20 percent of the building and over 8,000 square feet. So just preserving the first floor doesn't bring me into compliance with 52 and 2. god, if I, if it did I, would make that pitch, because I'm sure that pitch would be easier. It also I can I also need to say it's not as simple as that, because it also requires that the other uses the commercial uses have to be special uses that satisfy I. Don't remember the section, it tells you right there. It's only for where floor area will be occupied by use listed in 15660 business, which I, don't believe, includes general office. I, think it's geared more for larger service and or like industrial or manufacturing uses. So, but if yeah I think that I think that's an answer, but just to clarify you would be willing to agree to keep the building as a mixed-use building and to not seek a 100 residential use. Change right. Okay. First floor preserve the first floor, so if I were to follow through on that, I would amend the plans to show a commercial first floor. I would modify the restrictive declaration that I've worked through with city planning to make clear that the first floor would remain commercial and isn't subject to the conversion provisions here that I'm seeking okay. Thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, so seeing none I will open up refer to members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments to this application? Yeah Jonathan Dominguez? Yes, hello, everyone! My name is Dominguez, I'm a tenant at 31, East 21St street, so I'm actually just two addresses down from the proposed building. I just want to express my support for the conversion to residential use, affordable housing, as I think, most of you know, is one of the most acute crises facing the city. I believe anything we can do to increase the housing supply should be supported, even if in this case it's probably just a few market rate units yeah, so I hope the community votes today to recommend approval of the application. Thank you any other comments or questions from members of the public on this application. Yeah Melissa, Davis, hi, I'm also a resident on the street and I. Just want to clarify: will it be full floor? What's the plan for the residences? Is it full floor condos on each floor, so 10 residences, sorry, yes, that is the nobody has designed or built or designed out that those spaces yet. But that is the intention, the primarily the light and air really as opposed to the building that you saw before this building has limited light and air from the rear. The windows are permitted, but the primary legal nightmare will come from the front of this building at the street, and it's really they knock yours up into smaller units. That is the plan. The program would be for each commercial unit to just become a residential year. Thank you, I'm also in support of it. Thank you any other questions from members of the public questions or comments. Okay, so seeing none, let's move to a business session, all right, so it's one of those intricacies of the land use framework of the city. So in that particular instance, the applicant is seeking a use change, but through an article of the zoning resolution and not through a variance from the board of standards and appeals, so it meets a number of criteria and we understand that the applicant is willing to amend their application to actually preserve some commercial use at the ground floor. So, let's do comments. How do you feel about this application? Mike? Okay as yeah? Okay? So as long as they put it in writing into the application that the first floor will remain commercial, I'm willing to support this application? Okay, thank you, Tristan hi! So, along that same note, you know, if they're willing to put that in writing on the first floor as well as if they meet the other standards per the code, then I'm so also supportive of this application. Okay, thank you Tristan other comments. We need more comments. Ej I'll, agree, I, think that's an appropriate concession and I see no other real reason to oppose this application with that stipulation. Okay, so it looks like we're on the path to a support. I will share quickly. My views I'm very torn on this one I see the benefit through the preservation plan and, as you know, I'm a big fan of historic preservation. So the fact that the building is going to be preserved and kept in its historical condition is a big plus. It's a big part of this quick pro quo. So that's why I feel that you know that there's a benefit. The use change, though, bothers me and I wish that there would be more preservation of commercial space. I think that a true mixed use would be great, but I see that the applicant is already making a gesture with keeping the ground floor as commercial, so I'm torn. That's all I can say for the moment Nancy. Well, I'm not torn I'm completely opposed and I will not vote for this. Okay. Thank you. Nancy other comments, any more comments. We need more comments. Aaron calling on you again, I think I support the application with the adjustments that we talked about, so I would be in favor of it. Okay, so it looks like there's a willing. Nick can I ask a question to inform my comment. Go ahead. So if I understand this correctly in order for them to do this, conversion of use as of right, they would have to preserve one and a half floors of commercial space or two floors of commercial space. Is that correct? I would have to re-crunch the numbers, but it looks like with one and a half. They would be compliant with one possible article that they could use once again. None of it is as of right. They still need an authorization, meaning that the chair of the Department of city planning needs to make the determination that they meet all these criteria, but it is not discretionary, meaning that you know if the maintenance plan is in place. If the amount of square footage is preserved, then it's an approval, so basically we're really just giving them a concession of, say: half a floor, correct. Okay, then I'm in favor, okay, all right. So it looks like we have a consensus, mostly or the majority beers for an approval. So, let's try to get a motion wants to make a motion to approve okay and I would add, with the specification that the application is amended as per the agreement and commitment given by the applicant at tonight's meeting and is done in writing to the department of City planning, with the appropriate, restricted declaration recorded on with the deed on you know, against the property. Is that clear for everybody? Okay, so we need a second thanks, all right. So here we are Dave. Yes, Nick, yes, Julie, yes, Aaron, yes, Nancy no Mike, yes, Tristan! Yes, Ej, yes, John, yes, Rachel, yes and Laila I am going to be a yes all right, so the motion passes ten to one okay, thank you very much to the applicant. We will be in touch with you, because we need all these great commitments that you just made to us in writing and making sure that the Department of city planning is aware of the amendment to the application. All the Aids will be submitted, they'll be submitted to city planning and then and you'll get copies of all those materials, fantastic, revised applications. Thank you. So much moving on the last item on the agenda. We're almost there guys. Thank you so much to all committee members and other attendees for your patience through this very lengthy agenda. So we're not gonna. Look at governors island once again, you're going to wonder. Why are we looking at governor's island? That is definitely not in CB5. We have actually been contacted by CB1, along with all the other community boards in Manhattan, and probably they have also reached out to other community boards in the other boroughs, because governors island is part of CB1, but they really believe that it is a very important resource that is really a city-wide resource and they are seeking. Cb1 is seeking comment for from other community boards on the proposed redevelopment of the island. So when we get a request from you know a sister board, we feel that it's important to honor it and the implications are. There are two traps for us to look at. Is you know the first one is the use that residents and other stakeholders of Cd5 would have of governor's island and also the implications and the precedent that such development could set for other public open space. So Aaron was very kind to actually work on that Aaron I, don't know if you have a screen that you can share, so maybe we can show a couple of visuals and if you can, you know speak a little bit about the proposal and it's its implications. Sure let me hopefully technology works here. Fantastic and I just want to also see if we have someone from CB1 in attendance. I know that they had expressed that they could maybe join us tonight, but it was not a guarantee on their end and I just want to make sure that we recognize them if they're with us tonight, but Lou correct me if I'm wrong but I, don't think we have anyone from CB1 with us tonight if you're from CB1, and if you want to raise your hand, you can do that by pressing the button, I'm not sure who the person that CB1 is but I. Don't they might not be in attendance, yeah, okay, all right Aaron, it's all on you! Okay, so you know. Obviously this is there's a lot of complex stuff here and I think we're only gonna. You know focus on some aspects of it. You know it's a very dense presentation, the vision for this right, so the trust for governors Island put together this presentation, it's a very like perspective, vision for what could happen and they've and I went to their website today and they're, actually they're, currently engaging rfps to get developers to pitch ideas. So again, this is a vision of what could happen, but clearly there's some. You know focus on some things here and one of the main- and this first slide shares some. You know potential ideas of what this could look like, but the main strategy on there or in their mind is that they want to make governors island. You know commercially viable to pay for the park itself, which I think is. You know that's an interesting concept right, so they're, basically saying hey, we need to upzone. We need to develop this. To a point of you know. Incredibly, change and density, which would require zoning changes, would require a lot of development to get to a point where it can pay for itself, which I think that principle is a little challenging. So I'm going to go quickly, jump around a little bit to show you some of their vision here. Page 16 is a comparison that justifies the zoning change and they're like comparing governors island to other development projects around the city, which you know one could argue. This is a fair assessment or not, but it's justifying the change in the far going from a residential r3 to C4 C41 and substantially changing the that the zoning allowance here on slide 39. So this shows you and there's another diagram which shows you the development footprint so for anyone who's familiar with governors, island they're, the north zone, which has the historic forts. Sorry, my notes, which has the you know, as of 2001, is actually a national monument which is about 20 acres in the north zone. The South zone, which has been abandoned since the coast guard left in the late 90s, is largely undeveloped. But has a lot of you know is mostly open space and those two zones, and this shows that the shadow impact on what those two new developments would be in a March September zone. So you can get idea of the footprint. There's a quick map, history of the original island before the landfill. What looked like and when in revolutionary times this was the landfill, which was all from New York, City, subway digging, which was World War One, and this is what it looked like with coast guard footprints through the 1960s through 1990s, the current development zones that have been identified on the south side of the island on the West and east banks. And then there's you know it's a little unclear on what the current state of some of the structures are on the south side now I believe most of it is it's uninhabited, but there are some structures that are lingering from that are unoccupied at the moment, which I'm not sure when this picture was taken from, but going to some of the zoning details here so that the main change that would need to happen to make this possible would be go going from an R32 and creating an expanded zone, but by doing that making the south side of the island a c41 which would allow this development and density change. So Layla I, don't know if you want to speak more to this map or this part of it, but yeah sure. So something that is interesting to understand is that currently the zone is R32, which, basically is you know it is zoned for residential. But what's interesting is that the deed has a restriction where per the deed, residential permanent residential is not permitted. So, although it is zone residential because residential is not permitted under the deed, it basically means that you can not develop. So this is why they're seeking this zoning change so that they can develop for any commercial use, but also any institutional use, or you know, like entertainment, you know they could build something like Coney Island, but they could also build non-permanent residential developments such as dorms or hotels or convention centers. That kind of use, what's interesting with the deed, is that this restriction, which was thought to be in perpetuity, is actually going to expire in 2016, which is you know it's in 40 years. You know in terms of land use. 40 years is actually kind of you know, short-ish term midterm. So there is, you know, great angst from CB1, and they have shared that with us that you know this use. Change would actually could have really some grave implications, not only now with what would be developed, but also in the other. You know broader future. The commercial zoning would also allow for a higher density and a different type of massing. That would give you know, developers more much more flexibility than they would have. It was if the zoning stayed the way it is so yeah so Leila to clarify that, because I think that's an important thing, because that the deed transfer in 2003 right, the stipulation was that the remaining 150 acres that was not made a national monument right, which is Fort Jay and Castle Williams. The stipulation is that 40 acres has to maintain park land and then 50 acres has to be used for educational, civic or cultural purposes, and then you know there's an additional 60 acres remaining. That would be allowed to be in play, but you're saying that is what would go away in the future. Or is that a that idea that there has to be a percentage of parkland and open space remaining, so I think the parkland requirement would stay. It is just that currently, any built development would have to conform with specific uses as per the deed, but so and there would be no residential development, but this provision will expire in 2060, which means that you know we could end up with a type of development that would be phased. You know it's not going to be developed all at once, and you know there could be a phase three in 40 years. That would include residential development, but you know I, don't know necessarily that we need to get really totally hung up on that. It's you know, I, think this issue is more of a parochial issue for CB1 I. Think that the implications here you know as far as we are concerned are really you know. Governor's island is a wonderful opportunity for open space and for recreational uses that are direly lacking, and you know the question is: would we if governor's island were to be redeveloped as a you know, park and recreational area? Would we patronize it? Yes, you know the same way we patronize Rendels Island and Roosevelt Island. You know we rely on these spaces that have you know expensive, you know space, you know, area, recreational space to you know fulfill our need, for you know air and open space and physical activity, and you know entertainment for children and sports. So these areas are very critical and there's a great lack of such amenities. I mean certainly we're not going to build a ball field in the middle of CB5 anytime. Soon we could build a ball field on governor's island and we, as you know, other residents of Manhattan would use it and residents of other boroughs. You know Brooklyn Queens and Saturn Island. So you know I think that it's relevant for us to comment on what do you? What use would best serve us I. Think that's! You know, that's the kind of comment that CB1 is seeking from other community boards and the other question is you know, as Aaron was pointing out. You know the fact that the park- or you know this space- you know because it's not only parkland has to pay for itself. Is you know something that we are kind of familiar with in our district? As you know, a number of our parks actually don't receive public funding or very minimal public funding, and this is just pushed to the next level and it's a little troubling because you know if we hit the doomsday in CB5, is that to say that we're going to build the condos in central park because the park needs to pay for itself. So it's a little bit of a slippery slope that I think also CB1 is you know, seeking comment from other community boards, so you know those are like the two angles that I think would be interesting to explore and I see that Mike has his hand up Mike go ahead. My only concern is that I understand and agree with everything you just said later, but it's an island with no bridge no subway station. It would need ferry service. So as long as that ferry service is subsidized enough that people can get access to it, whether it's free ferry service or the ferry is as much as a subway ride or I. Would that would be my only concern, I think it's a little bit too much development but I. Think a little bit enough to make sure that there's a access for anyone in the city to get to it quickly and often on a regular. You know not once an hour ferry service, something that's you know every 15 minutes at minimum, something like that. So people can have access to it. Yeah- and this is also a big concern of CB1 and I- think that other community boards in Brooklyn or community groups have also advocated for exactly that. You know more accessibility, Nick. Are we in questions or comments? We are in both we don't. We have an applicant here so to respond to Mike's comment. I went to an event on governor's island, it's called the jazz age Lawn party. If anybody is familiar with it, it's an outdoor festival, it was really spectacular, they had very reliable ferry service was frequent and I found the location very accessible, and after that event it occurred to me that location would be perfect for events like the big Apple Barbecue Street fares parades it could be a parade ground. Would this proposal facilitate or make this location a more desirable venue for things like that? No, it would preclude that it would basically be in lieu of all these programmatic. You know events that would be, you know, generating income. It also appears that there has been a you know, a constant request by CB1 for alternate scenarios from the trust and that so far there has been no alternate scenario proposed by the trust, they're really gung-Ho on you know it's. We need development, we need to build and that's the only way that you know this big island can pay for itself and I think just to jump in Leila. It's hard. I can't see you because I'm sharing the screen but I think the other challenge here is that the need to not right now, it's very seasonal right, so Nick the events you're talking about you know their season is September. You know may through September. The idea with this plan is to make this a year-round destination and I think that's. That brings some challenges because you know the added ferry service. You know 365 days a year. What happens during hurricane season? When you know half of this island is a flood zone. I think there's a lot of environmental impact of having increased ferry service to support year-round events. I think that's a whole nother. You know issue that this spirals into, because the implications of that water, taxi private boats, adding three more docks: you're, creating activity to support the commerce on the island. So there is an adverse effect of that year-round. You know impact in the harbor. You know we've done such a great job of restoring the harbor. What kind of impact is this volume and density on the development in that area going to be on the Brooklyn, waterfront and obviously there's successful versions of that? But I think we have to take into account all this added ferry service in order to accommodate you know permanent events. The other thing they mentioned. You know CB1 I, think was worried about that. There's an idea that an educational institution would use this space, but clearly that that's very speculative, like there's no requirement that they have to have a school there's no plan to definitely implement new schools, etc. That there's an idea that an educational institution would want areas year-round, but there's no concrete. You know requirement to do that, so it's you know, there's a lot of questions in regards to that I. Think of that volume yeah. So if I hear the comments expressed so far, there's concern about accessibility. Both in terms of you know it would be limited accessibility, but then, if the accessibility becomes suitable, then the impact that this accessibility would cause is something that needs to be evaluated and possibly mitigated the concern about the precedent that would set- and you know this notion of anchoring the idea that a park has to pay for itself. It can have a you know, deleterious effect on other open space in the city, and then you know the need. You know the sheer plain and simple need for open space to remain open and publicly accessible. So those are the things that the three angles that I hear is as being you know, comments that we have on that or are there any other thoughts on this proposal? Anybody else? No okay. So let me open up two members of the public. Are there any questions or comments from members of the public on this proposal? Okay, so seeing none, let's move back to business session. So, as I said you know, CB1 wants to hear our thoughts and comments. I've just spelled them out it. Would the other committee be okay with basically issuing a I think it a letter to Cd1 telling them that we have reviewed this proposal and those are the three areas that we wish to focus our attention and that we have concerns with and I think that you know that they they're they've been working on this, for you know, probably the past, you know six or seven months and you're very familiar with you know the nuts and bolts of all of you know the technical aspects of you know all this zoning, it's a big thing, but I, don't know that we really have to. You know, get really at the granular level. I think those three areas really are our main concern. Everybody is in agreement, okay, so I think just for the sake of it. We will take it to a vote, so we will send comments to CB1 on the governor's island redevelopment of focusing our attention to ferry service and its accessibility and its impact open the need for open space for the entire city, including residents and stakeholders of Cd5, and the risk of the rational use for the redevelopment, as it would potentially impact other open space in the city, and so this could be yeah just to be clear on your second point, like we're saying that the we're saying that the presentation as proposed for this development would negatively impact the open space that we're advocating for. Is that that's what we're saying yes yeah, so that would be the motion to send this letter. So I need a second. Thank you all right, final vote. Dave did we lose Dave Nick? Yes, Julie? Yes, Aaron!
