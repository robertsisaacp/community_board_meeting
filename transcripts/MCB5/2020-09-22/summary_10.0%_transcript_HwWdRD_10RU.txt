So first we're going to hear about a number of bills that were introduced by the City Council's General Welfare, Committee.
Testimony Abigail Bessler from Council member powers is going to speak to us regarding some of those bills that we then have burton phillips the Albany chief of staff for Senator Holliman who's, going to speak about two bills: 8865, which speaks to the limits of personal liability of Covid-19, impacted business owners and then the clear path forward.
We're, not sure how the courts are going to open or how they're going to hear the cases that have been held in obeyance, but we're pretty sure a lot of people are going to be affected, so the bills from the City Council's, General Welfare Committee go some way to address those issues.
Last week the General Welfare Committee heard a number of bills related to source of income discrimination and in general, trying to reduce discrimination and give people a chance to find housing in the city.
If you have like a housing voucher currently in the city, so the state actually pretty recently passed an expansion of protection.
It also has an exception for ones that are owner occupied, that are three units, and we are potentially looking at making some amendments to it, based on testimony at the hearing to bring it closer in line with what the state law ended.
We may make some amendments, but we think it's a really important bill and definitely has support from the advocacy community in terms of putting these protections in place in New, York, City, Law and then the other bill.
That would a big issue for people with vouchers is that the vouchers do not cover the actual cost of renting an apartment in New, York, City, and I know that I've worked with many people in the shelter system who have a voucher but are unable to get out of shelter despite trying very hard to find housing.
It stated, so the big hurdle is usually just getting a vote at the committee level, which means you know getting the support of the speaker, and hopefully they can all move as kind of a package.
Some of the bills like 146, which was the one I talked about, of making the vouchers comparable to actual cost of rent we'd, probably have to do a fair amount of negotiating just in terms of the budget, impact, and so I.
I think it's just a matter of negotiating the actual, the you know, cost and My question is whether this housing excuse me the protection, extends to people and all offenses, or does it exclude, say sex offenders?
What are the sort of services, the domestic violence services that would be provided like Do. You know how that's going to be delivered in the shelters or what that means?
We wanted to get them to you, just because the moratorium on rent evictions is coming up, Think about more questions, we're going to ask Abigail to come back and put her on the hot seat again and also ask somebody.
We tried to get someone from council member Rosenthal's office who can speak to the other bills so that you can really formulate your questions and really think about.
Think on the hearing is that the committee is in favor of moving forward in support of the bills.
One limits, the personal liability of Covid-19 impacted businesses and the other is called a clear path: forward, an act which suspends some rent payments for some residential, some small business, commercial, tenants, And I, think some mortgage payments in response to Covid-19, so burton.
The eviction moratorium for commercial entities has ended, and it's kind of premised on a balanced approach of shared sacrifice between small businesses, Not, for, profits, landlords and the government.
So under the proposal that we developed, small businesses and nonprofits that have lost income due to Covid-19 would be responsible for a modest but reasonable percentage of their commercial rent based on the reduced income that they're actually generating.
That comes to the state through which landlords would apply to be reimbursed for that sort of middle portion of rent that they do not receive because we have reduced the rent obligation for the tenants.
We would like this idea this model to be the framework of eventual state legislation to try to address the commercial rent crisis that we think is coming.
This point in time we saw some very dire predictions from the partnership for New York City last month, suggesting that up to 70,000 small businesses would end up closing without some form of assistance.
So I mean safely, I, think we can say we're talking thousands of businesses and to what extent the funding need would be there or You know what the fiscal impact of that would be.
So this would be, but under unrestricted funding that we received from the federal government as part of like a recovery package and at this point in time, And. Act, though we did have enough in the way of unrestricted funding that earlier this summer, we were able to pass a 100 million dollar rental assistance program which could we could have used a lot more of that money.
We'd love to have their support for a proposal like this, and this sort of shared sacrifice model, but we're early in the coalition building around it and to your second question: There are a lot of unknowns here, one of the biggest unknowns that we have not even talked about yet is when the state legislature will next be convening.
I think the expectation is something is going to need to happen on state funding before January, so we are anticipating.
We may have to take up some revenue raising proposals and a lot of what we've been watching Is, what's going to happen with additional federal assistance, This is not a bill that I think we snap our fingers and it's in law.
You know what the situation is with the state's finances, with additional federal funding that comes in and where we are with the pandemic and with government ordered restrictions and closures.
I. Think we see this more as a framework for something that could be tailored to fit the circumstances in a way that alleviates the rent burden on commercial tenants make sure that landlords are still getting some measure of rent, because we do recognize that they have expenses to pay, not the least of which is revenue.
I. Suppose that could be an issue if there are still non- payment eviction protections in place that a tenant could continue to not pay rent not be evicted, they would be on the hook for quite a bit of money once those eviction once the eviction moratorium, ended, but I, think a lot of businesses would probably like to avoid that type of legal and financial burden at the end of the moratorium.
Excuse me, in a lot of parts of the state where you do not see the high commercial rent that you do in New, York City, that 20 is more than fair, but I.
Think you raise a really great point that you know some of the existing commercial leases may be for highly inflated rates, and we do not necessarily want the state to subsidize that through this through this program.
Further questions from the public, seeing none, I'm, going to move to comments from the committee I'd like to hear on the committee's thoughts on this bill.
I think that in a time like this, with everything going on that there needs to be a dual responsibility to you know not have all of our businesses go out of business.
Do not think we would want this bill to pass and be signed into law without knowing the money piece of it and having it nailed.
I know I've used that terminology a couple times but create the framework, but also demonstrate and kind of lay a marker down for how we would like to use a portion of any forthcoming federal, funds.
We think it's important to make it clear that we want to prioritize assisting small businesses and making sure that they do not.
Think the tenants side would most probably very much welcome it and say resident who you know frequent restaurants, small businesses in the city.
I want the small business to continue to thrive after the state of emergency, but the landlord pieces, the other half of the piece that I I find it hard to wholeheartedly support the current bill.
Having, more input from you, know, property owners from the landlords, and also about the the rationale for the 25 people or less for a small business, because I do believe that, particularly here in New York, small businesses actually are larger than that, and so that's just something to think about.
A lot of small businesses have had to sacrifice 80 to 100 of their revenue for months at this point, and I think they might even be in tougher situations, so I would definitely be open to an expansion of the bill to include 25 to 50 employees, but I also think that maybe that could be a separate initiative or maybe there could be a an order of operations like the first 500 million in funding is reserved for small businesses, and then you know anything over them.
You know, I, know we're supportive of you know, efforts to ensure state federal, local wherever it comes from funding that goes directly to the businesses, and you know to employees in particular.
Anyway, and My final thing on this part of our goal with this bill is to try to help reduce litigation by tipping the playing field slightly towards the tenants, because we're making it a little bit easier for them to prove their case to get out of their commercial lease And we're hoping that helps, encourage the parties to come together and actually negotiate settlements out of court that are reasonable and keep the businesses afloat for the duration of the pandemic.
In a way we would be preempting that by seeing the you know, foreseeing the the problem and trying to address it ahead of time, although usually what the legislature is clarifying, are the words of bills passed by the legislature and not judicially created standards for interpreting contracts.
Is, that fair to say, I'd, say yes, most of the time, I'd be happy to look into whether I can pull some examples of other recent legislation that we've passed, that more go to clearing up or codifying case law that comes out of judicial interpretation, renee, you're, muted, other questions, July.
Let me just ask you, know: straightforward: The purpose of this bill, then, is to allow businesses who have signed the lease has terms remaining to be able to say my business is not going to go.
Would the landlord be going after the business owner for if there is no business, so that probably becomes a question of bankruptcy law which is separate, apart?
It actually probably saves the state money by trying to reduce the amount of litigation, that's going through the courts, and I apologize.
There are few things that are more established than that, and so you know there may be instances relating to government contracts where the legislature puts its thumb on the scales or has something to say about it, but in terms of private party contracts like that is not the role of the legislature, which is just, I, think, My instinct is that this is not going to be a possible path to success for commercial tenants and courts will almost uniformly sought uniformly side with landlords on this issue, and even if they do not, I mean there is a very well established means by which we settled divergent opinions and that's through the intermediate appellate courts And, if necessary, the court of appeal in New York.
And I feel it myself to saying to voting yes in this committee on anything that dings landlords at the expense of tenants, But I, just like I, want to make sure that we do it with like a level of sort of like 30,000 foot sophistication about what it means for the legislature to do things that are very much in the domain of courts and contract interpretation Is, just like that's like law, 101.
I tend to think if the state of New York passed this law and allowed people to for purpose of renegotiating their contract obligations to get a better deal or to keep their business going, especially when their business would have kept going.
I would likely support bills that consider some sort of either rent, freeze or rent vacation for commercial tenants, and that definitely interferes with you know contractual arrangements, and so let the legislature pass it and let courts consider whether it's okay, what I'm less okay with, is the legislature weighing in on something that is very much the domain of the courts.
We do not know when the legislature's coming back to me and if this is something they would consider, I think a lot of it also depends on what's going to be happening federally.
Oh, I, probably should not step on what the representative of the speaker's office is going to talk about relative to what we've done in terms of the third party fees for like grubhub and seamless, and all that you know just extending that and so making sure that the businesses are able to do that.
And that's something that we could get and dig into a little bit more when there's more details and other bills that are supporting the small business Any more questions from any of the committee or comments, seeing none, I'm, going to turn to the public And we'll be in contact.
