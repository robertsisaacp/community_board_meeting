There's going to be then an overview of small business initiatives that are being proposed by local electives ben jacobs of council member power's office is going to speak and laurie h from speaker.
The committee is going to ask questions of the presenter and when all of those questions have been answered, members of the public will be permitted to ask questions So. If you'd like to speak, use the raised hand function once all of the questions have been addressed, the committee will then go into business.
What happens after that is anybody's guest, we're not sure how the courts are going to open or how they're going to hear the cases that have been held in obeyance, but we're pretty sure a lot of people are going to be affected, so the bills from the city council's general welfare committee go some way to address those issues.
Last week the general welfare committee heard a number of bills related to source of income discrimination and in general, trying to reduce discrimination and give people a chance to find housing in the city.
If you have like a housing voucher currently in the city, so the state actually pretty recently passed an expansion of protection, so this is kind of just making sure that we have city level protections so that we can have that kind of city level enforcement and make sure that our laws are closer in line with the state.
It also has an exception for ones that are owner occupied, that are three units, and we are potentially looking at making some amendments to it, based on testimony at the hearing to bring it closer in line with what the state law ended.
So, we may make some amendments, but we think it's a really important bill and definitely has support from the advocacy community in terms of putting these protections in place in new york city law There was a bill to require that DHS provide services to domestic violence, survivors in all shelters.
It would prohibit housing discrimination in new york city based on a criminal record, so kind of like ban the box, landlords and real estate brokers would be prohibited from inquiring about criminal record information during the process, and it would also be unlawful to advertise or circulate any information that expresses any limitation in housing.
It's, actually like a very well well-functioning part of city government that has been able to help a lot of people who were discriminated against and solve individual cases, but Right now somewhat because you know they reshuffled around their staff during Covid-19 to handle different cases and then also someone left their job.
It stated, so the big hurdle is usually just getting a vote at the committee level, which means you know getting the support of the speaker, and hopefully they can all move as kind of a package.
Some of the bills like 146, which was the one I talked about, of making the vouchers comparable to actual cost of rent we'd, probably have to do a fair amount of negotiating just in terms of the budget, impact, and so I.
Think on the hearing is that the committee is in favor of moving forward in support of the bills.
They are state bills, one limits, the personal liability of Covid-19 impacted businesses and the other is called a clear path: forward, an act which suspends some rent payments for some residential, some small business, commercial, tenants, And I, think some mortgage payments in response to Covid-19, so burton.
It's a bill that brad carries with assembly member harvey epstein, and it's really getting at a solution to the issue of small businesses and non-for-profits that are having difficulty making their rent, I'm.
Once the eviction moratorium for commercial entities has ended, and it's kind of premised on a balanced approach of shared sacrifice between small businesses, not-for-profits landlords and the government.
So under the proposal that we developed, small businesses and nonprofits that have lost income due to Covid-19 would be responsible for a modest but reasonable percentage of their commercial rent.
So now, you've got that 47 in the middle and that would be covered by a commercial rent relief fund that this bill would establish you're, marking up to 500 million dollars in federal assistance that comes to the state through which landlords would apply to be reimbursed for that sort of middle portion of rent that they don't receive because we have reduced the rent obligation for the tenants.
We would like this idea this model to be the framework of eventual state legislation to try to address the commercial rent crisis that we think is coming.
This point in time we saw some very dire predictions from the partnership for new york city last month, suggesting that up to 70 000 small businesses would end up closing without some form of assistance.
So I mean safely, I, think we can say we're talking thousands of businesses and to what extent the funding need would be there or You know what the fiscal impact of that would be.
This would be, but under unrestricted funding that we received from the federal government as part of like a recovery package, and at this point in time, Act, though we did have enough in the way of unrestricted funding that earlier this summer, we were able to pass a 100 million dollar rental assistance program which could we could have used a lot more of that money.
Are you going to prepare, given that we don't know how much longer the state of emergency will be Thank you for your questions to answer the first part I, to my knowledge,, we've not spoken with any sort of umbrella organization representing commercial landlords at all, but I can tell you: We've spoken with a number of landlords in our district.
We'd love to have their support for a proposal like this, and this sort of shared sacrifice model, but we're early in the coalition building around it and to your second question: There are a lot of unknowns here, one of the biggest unknowns that we haven't even talked about.
You know what the situation is with the state's finances, with additional federal funding that comes in and where we are with the pandemic and with government ordered restrictions and closures.
I think we see this more as a framework for something that could be tailored to fit the circumstances in a way that alleviates the rent burden on commercial tenants make sure that landlords are still getting some measure of rent, because we do recognize that they have expenses to pay, not the least of which is revenue.
They would be on the hook for quite a bit of money once those eviction once the eviction moratorium, ended, but I, think a lot of businesses would probably like to avoid that type of legal and financial burden at the end of the moratorium.
Think you raise a really great point that you know some of the existing commercial leases may be for highly inflated rates, and we don't necessarily want the state to subsidize that through this through this program.
Further questions from the public, seeing none, I'm going to move to comments from the committee I'd like to hear on the committee's thoughts on this bill.
I think that in a time like this, with everything going on that there needs to be a dual responsibility to you know not have all of our businesses go out of business.
If I jump in just a little bit, I, don't think we would want this bill to pass and be signed into law without knowing the money piece of it and having it nailed.
We think it's important to make it clear that we want to prioritize assisting small businesses and making sure that they don't you know, go under during this pandemic that that's very helpful.
If we are, you know lucky enough to get federal funding, I can't think of a better use for federal funds If they come the state's way so really support your efforts.
Think the tenants side would most probably very much welcome it and say resident who you know frequent restaurants, small businesses in the city.
I want the small business to continue to thrive after the state of emergency, but the landlord pieces, the other half of the piece that I I find it hard to wholeheartedly support.
Having, more input from you, know, property owners from the landlords, and also about the the rationale for the 25 people or less for a small business, because I do believe that, particularly here in new york, small businesses actually are larger than that, and so that's just something to think about.
A lot of small businesses have had to sacrifice 80 to 100 of their revenue for months at this point, and I think they might even be in tougher situations, so I would definitely be open to an expansion of the bill to include 25 to 50 employees, but I also think that maybe that could be a separate initiative or maybe there could be a an order of operations like the first 500 million in funding is reserved for small businesses, and then you know anything over them.
Know, because currently the assistance is going towards the landlord, how about providing assistance direct directly to the small businesses?
Anyway, and My final thing on this part of our goal with this bill is to try to help reduce litigation by tipping the playing field slightly towards the tenants, because we're making it a little bit easier for them to prove their case to get out of their commercial lease And we're hoping that helps, encourage the parties to come together and actually negotiate settlements out of court that are reasonable and keep the businesses afloat for the duration of the pandemic.
In a way, we would be preempting that by seeing the you know, foreseeing the the problem and trying to address it ahead of time, although usually what the legislature is clarifying, are the words of bills passed by the legislature and not judicially created standards for interpreting contracts.
Most of the time I'd be happy to look into whether I can pull some examples of other recent legislation that we've passed, that more go to clearing up or codifying case law that comes out of judicial interpretation, renee, you're, muted, other questions, July.
There are few things that are more established than that, and so you know there may be instances relating to government contracts where the legislature puts its thumb on the scales or has something to say about it, but in terms of private party contracts like that is not the role of the legislature, which is just, I think, My instinct, is that this is not going to be a possible path to success for commercial tenants and courts Will almost uniformly sought uniformly side with landlords on this issue, and even if they don't, I mean there is a very well established means by which we settled divergent opinions and that's through the intermediate appellate courts And, if necessary, the court of appeal in new york.
I tend to think if the state of new york passed this law and allowed people to for purpose of renegotiating their contract obligations to get a better deal or to keep their business going, especially when their business would have kept going.
I would likely support bills that consider some sort of either rent, freeze or rent vacation for commercial tenants, and that definitely interferes with you know contractual arrangements, and so let the legislature pass it and let courts consider whether it's okay, what I'm less okay with, is the legislature weighing in on something that is very much the domain of the courts.
So ben's going to take us through what's happening now with respect to some of these initiatives, and we also have then laurie following ben from council from the speaker's office who's going to talk about some bills that have already been passed and what's happening to support small businesses.
And I have listened intently enough to the discourse that you all just engaged in over the other small business lease What the small business recovery lease program would have to be passed by to say both house of the state legislature signed by the governor and then the city council would have to introduce a bill and create a local law to actually enforce.
I think this makes the most sense, because you know landlords have got responsibilities and property taxes within the borrowers of new york city is one of the top expenses that they have to meet in order to keep the buildings and tenants in tenancy and operating love.
The, city and state have no money and the federal government doesn't have any money either they can just make it up, though we can't do that, so that was there another thing that we were going to do relative to, This falls in line with the discussion that we've been having the a suspension of the commercial rent tax, which you guys are probably all familiar, with, or I can go into if you're , not that's the resolution in favor of that.
Oh, I, probably shouldn't step on what the representative of the speaker's office is going to talk about relative to what we've done in terms of the third party fees for like grubhub and seamless, and all that you know just extending that and so making sure that the businesses are able to do that.
Ask you ben if you could send the outdoor dining bill once I think you said it's has that been introduced yet And, that's something that we could get and dig into a little bit more when there's more details and other bills that are supporting the small business.
