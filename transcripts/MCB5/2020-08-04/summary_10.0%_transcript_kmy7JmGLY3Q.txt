Members of the public will be able to ask questions of the presenter and then, once all those questions have been addressed, the committee will go into business session and that's when only members of the bex committee discuss the issue amongst themselves and determine what action to take we're somewhat different by we I mean bex than other committees within community board five and that we don't have applications so that our determinations are not as straightforward We can decide to draft a resolution.
Schools are top of mind for everyone, because there's just the number of people and families and children With remote learning and how many flaws, whether it's the technological process on the learning side, with meals, with kind of everything in between, and we kind of took all that feedback and all we heard from across the city and boils into a number of different recommendations for how we think it's a pass for schools to reopen safely and also prioritize quality instruction going into the fall.
We've been talking to the administration about not just in this set of recommendations, but in subsequent communications that we've had with the mayor's office as well, and then one thing that has actually gotten a lot of attention is on the need to identify more outdoor spaces for learning activities and again We know that virus transmission has been lessened significantly with being outdoors, and so we've included that, as a recommendation, we've been really discouraged that the mayor has seemed to be very dismissive in a way of the possibility.
In a blended learning model needing to provide support to students in both a remote learning environment, as well as in the classrooms it and potentially having groups of students in different parts of the building At the same time, it definitely feels like the city is at a critical point, where we need more staff in schools and it seems like a potentially a great opportunity to establish a hiring pipeline and let this be a potential job, professional development and professional training program.
So I dropped the link in the chat to both our report ellis colors, op-ed, calling for use for more outdoor space and a little bit touched on, but I think one of the things that we're really thinking about as an office is president before I work for the comptroller I was a teacher for three years in high school in the city and jobs already up, and especially with all these other things going on it really, The one thing that we're really hoping for is more creativity in that how we test students to ensure schools are safe, how we staff up schools, how we conduct remote learning We need to kind of borrow from what we've seen work and not work around the city and around the world, but also really be able to get creative in terms of.
and I have not really seen much about that in terms of best practices, so wondering if that's something your office has thought about at all or if you've heard of kind of any work, that's being done around the city on that I know that the way the department of education so far has been monitoring like just basic student attendance is really not what you or I might think of in terms of what attendance is it's tracking student engagement, which could be anything from you know?
We think it's probably something that should have had them long ago, but especially now, more than ever, when there's been so much different types of trauma, so many students have gone through it's even more important for them to know There's someone in the school building I'll try to find the data and send it over your way cause Do I have more questions any more questions from the committee.
I completely agree that like when we talk about the need for more staffing, you know sort of one of our sub recommendations with something that could definitely be built out into something more prominent is leveraging many community-based organizations that work with youth throughout the city and who have you know, or they thought they would have summer programming through You, know some of the summer programs I think that's an absolutely such a vital resource in terms of the community-based organizations and the youth development groups that work across schools and this and across the city, and that the city should really leverage that valuable resource I totally agree, I'm looking for any hands any further questions for elizabeth and luke from the committee Hearing more and more obviously, education and reopening schools is something that's evolving.
Patricia I hope that you will talk to us a little bit about what school of the future is thinking about in terms of reopening and very specifically about your request regarding open streets , you thank you renee and thank you for that title, but I'm, a parent sitting on the slt at school of the future That's going to be attending, hopefully in the fall, and there was a lot of parents working with the principal stacey goldstein to troubleshoot, like potential issues that may arise with the reopening in the fall and what we've come up with that were in attendance.
We'll triage the kids there, like you, know right before the doors open to kind of line them up, I guess monday through friday, because with the different cohorts that they're going to potentially have in the fall, we're going to need that time every day to do this work and usually when you apply through the DOT for a play street, you need the support of the community board That's.
Why I'm here this evening to ask for your help with that, as well as the NYPD and the department of transportation, because we have to apply for it You know put in the application to help with that We also besides, that we've also put in through the department of transportation app for more bike racks, because then a lot of the teachers and I'm sure the students are going to be biking Currently, there are any bike racks in front of the school, and so we're going to need that on Lexington avenue, as well as on 22nd, and the other thing is to address what luke was saying earlier, that they are trying to think creatively of having the kids outside outdoors more we're, hoping that we could walk the kids to like madison square park or union square, so they can be outside Those are those are our requests and hopes for the fall Do. Any members of the committee have any questions for patricia use the raise hand function.
Any other comments from the committee, seeing none I'm going to ask, do I, have a motion for supporting the application of school of the future for the play spaces.
My question is coming from concern about businesses like when the state of emergency ends well after the state of emergency ends to give businesses some breathing room to try to catch up and invest in the changes they need to make to get back to normal, For sure I think, and this also got the support of the hospitality alliance, which I didn't mention in the Manhattan chamber of commerce Then you could always do an amendment later to extend the bill, which is a lot of the Covid-19 related bills that we've passed as a council are limited to the state of emergency or to like a certain date in the fall and then potentially will be extended.
So, if I'm, a small new york city hedge fund, for the base rent of under a million dollars, I get a there's different ways to make sure that we're targeting the right people I , think it's just that you know businesses and other boroughs, no matter what kind of business you are aren't paying.
I think we actually got that figure a few years ago when we looked into that, but it would be a that would be a pretty huge hole in the city's budget, which is why we are not proposing that for all businesses in Manhattan If. Would you be willing to share that with the community later on Thank, you and second question, and maybe the council members in the city have already been discussing it.
I. Think that a way of endorsing the bill and encouraging the council to look at opportunities to focus the need on businesses that need it, the most would be a good position to go Any other comments from the committee What I'm hearing is that we're in favor of the bill generally, but we would like to see language that indicates there's some parsing between who is impacted by Covid-19 and ensuring that they are the ones that receive this release.
So I think that's what I'm hearing from the committee do I hear support for a resolution in favor of that response that we're in favor of the bill generally, with the caveat that we would like it focused on those businesses that truly require it as a result of Covid-19 and that it belongs to the council member and to the council to figure out how to parse that specifically robert Are, we talking about needs, testing or you know, means testing or We want to make sure that it does go to people in need, but we're not suggesting you know how that should be done.
You know an income threshold I, don't think that we're specifically advocating one way or the other of doing the parsing we're suggesting that if the bill has been introduced to provide relief to businesses that have suffered because of kovid that are paying this commercial rent tax, then it should be focused to those players and not necessarily, as zach pointed out to maybe a hedge fund that doesn't necessarily need or require the relief, because Covid-19 has not impacted their business Given.
So, do I hear a motion in favor of a resolution to support the bill with language that says we do believe there should be some way or some parsing of businesses that require the relief as a result of Covid-19 I motioned to support a bill with that open-ended caveat Yes, let's second, okay, then we will move to a vote in july!
I want to thank joseph particularly and then rob july for their work and pete on the resolution and I'd like to open it up to questions.
I looked through my notes to very specifically reflect what I heard from our committee members, because I didn't want to include something that hadn't been there at the outset of our conversation, but certainly we can discuss it now and add it to the resolution.
Chuck's comment was about removing certain phrasing and all I wanted to say was that I think the phrase desk duty is important to include in the resolution just as a sort of plain language explanation of what the current protocol is and what this is in contrast to, and so I had a sort of convoluted way of making that point, Yes, so you're, saying police officers who need to be reprimanded for I think the term was criminal, specifically this language would be requesting that the mayor and city council take that action So. This would be a request that we're making to city council and the mayor rather than making to NYPD directly right Is that within their legal jurisdiction?
All agencies, because I think the provision of other services that provide the city's health safety and well-being and I suggest that my friendly amendment would be that essentially after new york city budgets and strike out the police department and other services, So I actually agree with what you're saying I want to hear some other committee members and then I have a second point: Okay one second: can you hold it for one?
