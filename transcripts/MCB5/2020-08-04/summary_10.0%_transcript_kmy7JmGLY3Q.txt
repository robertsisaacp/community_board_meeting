With remote learning and how many flaws, whether it's the technological process on the learning side, with meals, with kind of everything in between- We kind of, took all that feedback and all we heard from across the city and boils into a number of different recommendations for how we think it's a pass for schools to reopen safely and also prioritize quality instruction going into the fall.
On that note, elizabeth, I, don't know if you want to go through some of our plans, some recommendations and some of our work on reopening more broadly or yeah, And I can just preface it by saying again reiterating the fact that this is not a representation of necessarily the department of education's plans.
I, think wanting to provide some of their concerns and asking our office to make recommendations to the department of education ahead of their releasing any plans.
We've been talking to the administration about not just in this set of recommendations, but in subsequent communications that we've had with the mayor's office as well, and then one thing that has actually gotten a lot of attention is on the need to identify more outdoor spaces for learning activities and again.
A lot of support from You know we'd love to see the city be more creative in ways that it could expand the use of outdoor spaces for learning activities, and you know again, I'm not going to go through every single recommendation.
We wanted to encourage the safe reopening of school buildings in terms of ensuring strong instruction, there's sort of a separate set of recommendations, and they really largely focus on the need for additional staffing and child care.
So I dropped the link in the chat to both our report ellis colors, op-ed, calling for use for more outdoor space and a little bit touched on, but I think one of the things that we're really thinking about as an office is president before I work for the comptroller, I was a teacher for three years in high school in the city and jobs already up, and especially with all these other things going on it.
Progress and measure progress at various schools will need to be adapted, and I have not really seen much about that in terms of best practices so wondering if that's something your office has thought about at all or if you've heard of kind of any work, that's being done around the city on That I know that the way the department of education so far has been monitoring like just basic student attendance is really not what you or I might think of in terms of what attendance is It's tracking student engagement, which could be anything from you know.
Something that we called for in our school report is to make sure that every school is a social worker ready and On staff this year we think it's probably something that should have had them long ago, but especially now, more than ever, when there's been so much different types of trauma, so many students have gone through it 's even more important for them to know.
You, know some of the summer programs I think that's an absolutely such a vital resource in terms of the community-based organizations and the youth development groups that work across schools and this and across the city, and that the city should really leverage that valuable resource.
I, hope that you will talk to us a little bit about what school of the future is thinking about in terms of reopening and very specifically about your request regarding open streets.
Currently there are any bike racks in front of the school And, so we're going to need that on Lexington avenue, as well as on 22nd- The other thing is to address what luke was saying, earlier, that they are trying to think creatively of having the kids outside outdoors more we're, hoping that we could walk the kids to like madison square park or union square, so they can be outside.
Please use your raised hand function, seeing none we're going to move into business session and discuss moving forward on this support of the application of school of the future.
Any thoughts from the committee are people generally in support of opening up play spaces for schools like school of the future, taking parking spaces to allow the kids to assemble both before and after school for check-in and dismissal, rachel, If we were to go out there and say we can't do this for kids safety, then it's pretty problematic to think about prioritization.
Any other comments from the committee, seeing none I'm going to ask, do I have a motion for supporting the application of school of the future for the play.
I can answer any other questions, but that's kind of the update and would obviously be happy to if we could get a you know, supportive statement or resolution from cb5 about the bill.
Well after the state of emergency ends to give businesses some breathing room to try to catch up and invest in the changes they need to make to get back to normal, For sure I think, and this also got the support of the hospitality alliance, which I didn't mention in the Manhattan chamber of commerce.
So, if I'm, a small new york city hedge fund, for the base rent of under a million dollars, I, get a, there's different ways to make sure that we're targeting the right, people.
Space such as you know up and down midtown and fifth and sixth avenue, You know some sort of tax break for a small restaurant bodega, all the mom-and-pop businesses, but you know, I think, there's a if you look at like I'm guessing.
I think we actually got that figure a few years ago when we looked into that, but it would be a that would be a pretty huge hole in the city's budget, which is why we are not proposing that for all businesses in Manhattan.
Would you be willing to share that with the community later on Thank, you and second question, and maybe the council members in the city have already been discussing it.
My only comment would be that by leaving the bill as it is, or as it's proposed, it would benefit people who don't necessarily need it And that's why, if it's not based on, if there's no exemption for income or whatever, I, just don't think it's a I know that the previous iteration of the bill did have an income component to it, so it was like five to ten million dollars or something to do with that.
What I'm hearing is a general support of the bill with two different two different philosophies about how to implement one thinking that it's good the way it stands another one zach and joe and July thinking that there should be some parsing of the type of small businesses that get the relief I'd like to hear so from a few other members of the committee and get a sense of what they're thinking about this hi renee.
Any other comments from the committee What I'm hearing is that we're in favor of the bill generally, but we would like to see language that indicates there's some parsing between who is impacted by Covid-19 and ensuring that they are the ones that receive this release.
I hear support for a resolution in favor of that response that we're in favor of the bill, generally, with the caveat that we would like it focused on those businesses that truly require it as a result of Covid-19 and that it belongs to the council member and to the council to figure out how to parse that specifically robert Are, we talking about needs, testing or you know, means testing or We, want to make sure that it does go to people in need, but we're not suggesting you know how that should be done.
Necessarily, I think that's what I was hearing from the committee that there's some you know.
Don't think that we're specifically advocating one way or the other of doing the parsing, we're suggesting that if the bill has been introduced to provide relief to businesses that have suffered because of kovid that are paying this commercial rent tax, then it should be focused to those players and not necessarily, as zach pointed out to maybe a hedge fund that doesn't necessarily need or require the relief, because Covid-19 has not impacted their business.
So, do I hear a motion in favor of a resolution to support the bill with language that says we do believe there should be some way or some parsing of businesses that require the relief as a result of Covid-19 I motioned to support a bill with that open-ended caveat.
If that's something that the committee would like to discuss and add to the resolution.
The community that our committee would like to add to the conversation and that to the resolution.
I looked through my notes to very specifically reflect what I heard from our committee members, because I didn't want to include something that hadn't been there at the outset of our conversation, but certainly we can discuss it now and add it to the resolution.
I, don't know that it adds anything to our purpose in the resolution and it I think having that language in there is important just for understanding it in the terms that we normally hear use to describe police protocol when it comes to discipline, but I think that removing the this sort of editorializing, which I agree with by the way but the editorializing about the status quo.
As I, understood it, chuck's comment was about removing certain phrasing, and all I wanted to say was that I think the phrase desk duty is important to include in the resolution just as a sort of plain language explanation of what the current protocol is and what this is in contrast, to, Yes, so you're, saying police officers who need to be reprimanded, for, I think the term was criminal.
Cb5 believes that it stands out future new york city budgets and is the intent here to narrow, where these core principles apply, because I don't know if I feel like we're saying new york, city, the police department and certain other services or other services.
And I suggest that my friendly amendment would be that essentially after new york city budgets and strike out the police department and other services, because in the provision of other services, actually joe, I, think that's a very good point.
So I actually agree with what you're saying I want to hear some other committee members And, then I have a second point.
So mine is just more of a comment, and you know the most important thing to me during this conversation has always been the reinvestment in community and youth, services, and I Just wanted to remark that I thought that was very eloquently and articulate articulately included in this iteration of the resolution.
