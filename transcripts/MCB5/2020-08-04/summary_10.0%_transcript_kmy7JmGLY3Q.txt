The first is a present presentation from Lucas Wolfe and Elizabeth Berg from Scott Stringer's office, they're, going to be talking about this comptroller stringer's, strong school plan and we'll use this to educate the committee on the comptroller's approach to safely reopening schools.
He spoke to us about this bill right before Covid-19 And. That's about the commercial tax that affects businesses below 96th street You'll, probably recall that we were about to support that bill with a resolution it was drafted Then Covid-19 came along, And, so we were waiting to see what would develop with regard to that bill.
The committee will go into business session and that's when only members of the Bex Committee discuss the issue amongst themselves and determine what action to take we're somewhat different by we, I mean bex than other committees within community board five, and that we do not have applications so that our determinations are not as straightforward.
With remote learning and how many flaws, whether it's the technological process on the learning side, with meals, with kind of everything in between- We kind of, took all that feedback and all we heard from acrosss the city and boils into a number of different recommendations for how we think it's a pass for schools to reopen safely and also prioritize quality instruction going into the fall.
Let Elizabeth jump into more on that in a second, but I also kind of want to preface that these are our office recommendations that we've sourced from talk to a number of different stakeholders, families, students, teachers, kind of acrosss, the educational spectrum, they're.
I. Think wanting to provide some of their concerns and asking our office to make recommendations to the Department of education ahead of their releasing any plans, and so when we, you know, released our set of recommendations.
We've been talking to the administration about not just in this set of recommendations, but in subsequent communications that we've had with the mayor's office as well, and then one thing that has actually gotten a lot of attention is on the need to identify more outdoor spaces for learning activities and again.
A lot of support from You know we'd love to see the city be more creative in ways that it could expand the use of outdoor spaces for learning activities, and you know again, I'm not going to go through every single recommendation.
We wanted to encourage the safe reopening of school buildings in terms of ensuring strong instruction, there's sort of a separate set of recommendations, and they really largely focus on the need for additional staffing and child care.
I think, in terms of thinking of teachers in a blended learning model needing to provide support to students in both a remote learning environment, as well as in the classrooms it and potentially having groups of students in different parts of the building.
On, But I think one of the things that we're really thinking about as an office is president before I work for the comptroller, I was a teacher for three years in high school in the city and jobs already up, and especially with all these other things going on it.
It seems to me like a lot of the ways we track progress and measure progress at various schools will need to be adapted, and I have not really seen much about that in terms of best practices so wondering if that's something your office has thought about at all or if you've heard of kind of any work, that's being done around the city on That I know that the way the Department of Education so far has been monitoring like just basic student attendance, is really not what you or I might think of in terms of what attendance is It's tracking student engagement, which could be anything from you know.
You, know some of the summer programs I think that's an absolutely such a vital resource in terms of the community- based organizations and the youth development groups that work acrosss schools and this and acrosss the city, and that the city should really leverage that valuable resource.
I, hope that you will talk to us a little bit about what school of the future is thinking about in terms of reopening and very specifically about your request regarding open streets.
Please use your raised hand function, seeing none we're going to move into business session and discuss moving forward on this support of the application of school of the future.
Any thoughts from the committee are people generally in support of opening up play spaces for schools like school of the future, taking parking spaces to allow the kids to assemble both before and after school for check- in and Dismissal Rachel, And, so I think.
Any other comments from the committee, seeing none I'm going to ask: do I have a motion for supporting the application of school of the future for the play.
In July, yes So. We have passed this motion to pass to support this initiative on behalf of school of the future and then pass it to transportation, for presentation to Cbe to the full board that this is a little bit unusual, just because we're crossing over both committees.
This bill would actually temporarily suspend and repeal the commercial rent tax in full for businesses, with an annual base rent of less than one million dollars for just the Covid-19 state of emergency.
I can answer any other questions, but that's kind of the update and would obviously be happy to if we could get a you know, supportive statement or resolution from CB5 about the bill.
Well after the state of emergency ends to give businesses some breathing room to try to catch up and invest in the changes they need to make to get back to normal, For sure I think, and this also got the support of the hospitality alliance, which I did not mention in the Manhattan chamber of Commerce.
But I do think that the idea is that we need to come out with something to kind of resolve this unfair, and the reason I originally asked is because there are a lot of financial institutions that do not necessarily rent a lot of space, but they run very expensive.
I just think it's bifurcating, which businesses benefit and which ones may, I mean, I know that there are in total, there are almost 9,000 tax, crt taxpayers, There are a lot of businesses that are over a million in rent.
I think we actually got that figure a few years ago when we looked into that, but it would be a that would be a pretty huge hole in the city's budget, which is why we are not proposing that for all businesses in Manhattan.
Would you be willing to share that with the community later on Thank, you and second question, and maybe the council members in the city have already been discussing it.
I thought we were talking about businesses under 10 million dollars like last time in income, but or was it fun I think there was an income.
And I'd have to also see what the like, what number of businesses we'd be talking about for who would be under this kind of like Venn, Diagram and income higher than that and rent lower than 1 million , I think it was 10 million, but it was actually.
What I'm hearing is a general support of the bill with two different two different philosophies about how to implement one thinking that it's good the way it stands another one zach and Joe and July thinking that there should be some parsing of the type of small businesses that get the relief I'd like to hear.
Any other comments from the committee What I'm hearing is that we're in favor of the bill generally, but we would like to see language that indicates there's some parsing between who is impacted by Covid-19 and ensuring that they are the ones that receive this release.
I hear support for a resolution in favor of that response that we're in favor of the bill, generally, with the caveat that we would like it focused on those businesses that truly require it as a result of Covid-19 and that it belongs to the council member and to the council to figure out how to parse that specifically Robert, I missed you, go ahead, Are, we talking about needs, testing or you know, means testing, or are we just kind of saying?
Necessarily, I think that's what I was hearing from the committee that there's some you know.
So, do I hear a motion in favor of a resolution to support the bill with language that says we do believe there should be some way or some parsing of businesses that require the relief as a result of Covid-19 I motioned, to support a bill with that.
The resolution itself demands honest communication from our electeds regarding budget decisions, a request for a targeted plan to reduce the NYPD overtime, spending, a request for the mayor and the city Council, to provide a plan for the transition of school safety agents and school crossing dogs to the DOE, as well as a report on the shift of homeless services from NYPD to DHS, to figure out how that's being done.
Is that something that you're proposing and would like to discuss now, if it's appropriate for me to propose that I certainly think that it is in keeping with the broader spirit of the resolution and is specifically, I think, an actionable and important concrete step when it comes to how the NYPD spends its money.
If, that's something that the committee would like to discuss and add to the resolution.
The community that our committee would like to add to the conversation and that to the resolution.
I looked through my notes to very specifically reflect what I heard from our committee members, because I did not want to include something that had not been there at the outset of our conversation, but certainly we can discuss it now and add it to the resolution.
To, then I think you know that would be great, but I would be supportive of adding points that address both of those issues, the cost that kind of equipment and, secondly, the measures they take with them.
As, I, understood it, chuck's comment was about removing certain phrasing, and all I wanted to say was that I think the phrase desk duty is important to include in the resolution just as a sort of plain language explanation of what the current protocol is and what this is in contrast, to, Yes, so you're, saying police officers who need to be reprimanded, for, I think the term was criminal.
I. Think that the City council has the authority to to either enable or require the department to come up with a program like that.
I, think you know just like the NYPD is It's a department that works at the pleasure of the mayor?
So I actually agree with what you're saying I want to hear some other committee members And then I have a second point.
Just going to say, I thought it was already like a legal requirement in the city for them to have a balanced, budget.
So mine is just more of a comment, and you know the most important thing to me during this conversation has always been the reinvestment in community and youth, services, and I Just wanted to remark that I thought that was very eloquently and articulate articulately included in this iteration of the resolution.
