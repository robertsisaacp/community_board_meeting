What can change look like for young people who are directly affected by policies implemented now and in the future and who better to ask than our very own New York City teens today for power to the youth, we've brought together three young leaders who will be in direct connection with our lead public officials, and you could go ahead and pour that over.
We have deputy borough president Matthew Washington of the Manhattan borough, president Gale, a brewer first deputy public advocate Nicki Smith of the office of public advocate Jumaane Williams, and then we have also New York City Council member Carl, inna Rivera of district 2 and with all of those introductions with that I cede the floor to our young people, and if you could go ahead and show on your camera Paula, would you like to take the mic?
We have a chance to Center the voices of young people who are really the leaders of today by tomorrow, with during all of us ourselves, a big favor and in fact, that Ashley is a great segue into your question, which is why am I in this stuff as I get into policy and politics and organizing for me, One was I was a witness to the Rodney King uprising in Los Angeles and my family was actually directly impacted by the uprising at that time.
Who look like me then fast forward in terms of how I, really, if I'd, that I would be doing this work as a career was in 2000 as a result of the presidential election again bush-gore Remember again talking about black people and systemic inequities.
Think, like you, all, are doing here, speak to the elected officials and actually getting involved in city government there.
And then you know, put forward a bill to ban the chokehold nationally to make sure that I'm funding programs and services that not only I needed as a young person, but that I know that are important to just basic survival.
But, when you look at what we're funding, how we're making things happen, how we're providing services to people I mean my office has hundreds and hundreds of cases.
But as long as you have the people behind, you can really do anything awesome and Those of us who are working government and all so much thanks to Sidney and Richie in New, York, Public Library, and also to Lucan Community Board, five.
How I love that you're promoting reading on your shirt, which is awesome because we definitely need to read It's so important and critical, And You know when I think about how I got into public service.
When I think about the need for food for people in an economically disadvantaged areas, we have to make sure that we're providing food, and so our office in Manhattan borough, president's office.
What they need is critical and then, when we think about the protection that you talks, about, pinnacle is making sure communities are healthy and alive and thriving, and you know if we are building more cohesion amongst ourselves between us and our neighbors.
I. Think is really fantastic in the sense that you are yourselves organizing and pushing change, and we try to as an office make sure that we are having similar types of events, but ensuring that we're listening as people who are in government, because there is no real division between you.
This form I think it is great to help those in power really hear from understand the things that you are pushing for some grateful for this space, pink I'll, just say: I'm, the you know in the City Council on the chair of the Committee on hospitals and a lot of my work has focused on addressing systemic barriers to healthcare, and that includes mental health as well, and Co would really Illustrated the inequity in our health care.
I. Don't really have a lot of questions in regards to policy, but a lot about education, And I just feel like k12 is not getting the proper education, especially black and brown teams, and we really ask ourselves why teens of color drop out of school, But when we see what we're learning at school and has nothing to do with our history, it has nothing to do with where we come.
Do you think we should make in the education system to make sure that all groups are represented and all groups are all forms and traces of history are talked about and understood not just by black and brown kids, but also privileged white kids as well Answers about that niya you and hawa just recently, graduated as well in white and persevering, and congratulations and persevering in our remote learning, environments.
Well, can somebody tell me how trigonometry is helping me get a job that I can help take care of my family with And, so I think we need to infuse more career, pathway, ideology into schools and help young people.
The fact that we have to continuously repeat over and over our life matters, because other people look at us and feel automatic threat or feel like we just automatically don't matter in society that you know Just, because the way that my skin color looks and not what's in my brain and my potential and how I want to strive to be important, strive to move Society.
Within the councilmember mentioned the Copa 19, just disparity and I, think you know we move policy by building quote critical mass or just you know a moment where folks are basically fed up and moving our government officials to finally change things.
With issues that we're seeing you know on our block and in our neighborhoods So, you can even apply to become a member, and actually you can just obtain these meetings and they talk about issues of housing and policing and education and they also push themselves as board members, elected officials and others with solutions that you pitch And, then you know more longer-term, consider running for office.
Interns in my office, young people and I post questions to them constantly just to get different perspectives of people that you know are in high school that are going to college in college.
I recently asked my interns, you know what does it mean to you when we talk about defunding the NYPD abolishing the NYPD just to hear directly from the people that are out there from the people that are really have been served with a lot of the mistakes that we have made as a society and that they're going to have to live with and try to grapple with police brutality with climate change, with everything else, So is just trying to bring as many of y'all around the table and the way you can do.
As a matter of you, know, like housing policy alone, it's making sure that we can afford homes that are kind of more spread out in different areas that we have opportunities to live in areas that are not dance terminal to our health.
I know when I'm on the trip I get the best education, because I'm able to look at different things That's exactly that's exactly right in terms of hearing from students themselves, so I had a bill that passed in the council to create these diversity working groups, but what's different about this, then in previous kinds of cohorts or task, forces.
I mean what you all want to do is kind of like an everyday no-brainer and in some school districts, because they have the resources they can go on trips, all the time, because they're PTAs It's a lot of money for a family.
We just need to make sure, as Nick mentioned, that there's equity and how these resources are being distributed to our school systems and we're not listening to the young people.
I mean you know the school leadership teams, the community education, councils.
Looking at some of these formulas that deal in finances that are just not coming down to the black and brown low-income immigrant communities that we need them to also want to encourage on education.
You know certainly challenge the council number two to continue to fight for young people to continue to for underrepresented, communities, Thank.
