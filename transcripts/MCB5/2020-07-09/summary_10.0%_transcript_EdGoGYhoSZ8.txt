What can change look like for young people who are directly affected by policies implemented now and in the future and who better to ask than our very own New York City teens today for power to the youth, we've brought together three young leaders who will be in direct connection with our lead public officials, and you could go ahead and pour that over.
We have deputy borough president Matthew Washington of the Manhattan borough, president Gale, a brewer first deputy public advocate Nicki Smith of the office of public advocate Jumaane Williams, and then we have also New York City Council member Carl, inna Rivera of district 2 and with all of those introductions with that I cede the floor to our young people and if you could go ahead and show on your camera Paula, would you like to take the mic?
We have a chance to Center the voices of young people who are really the leaders of today by tomorrow, with during all of us ourselves, a big favor and in fact, that Ashley is a great segue into your question, which is why am I in this stuff as I get into policy and politics and organizing for me , One was I, was a witness to the Rodney King uprising in Los Angeles and my family was actually directly impacted by the uprising at that time.
One is the problem and two are the solutions and I'm privileged to be in space now, as deputy public advocate working with public advocate's Ronnie Williams in pushing the mayor or certain reforms, and also working with council members, including councilmember Rivera, who is on and adopting the reforms that young people in others are pushing hard on My family I will tell You is not was not the most political It was always like a big deal to vote.
I never thought that I would be an elected official, but I tell you that now that I am I've used all the years of organizing and providing services and being on the community board, which all of you all can do And then you know, put forward a bill to ban the chokehold nationally to make sure that I'm funding programs and services that not only I needed as a young person, but that I know that are important to just basic survival.
I'm ready to have this new crop of women in LGBTQ and tgn Sometimes you know I remember as a young person saying politics and the government, they don't do anything When you look at what we're funding, how we're making things happen, how we're providing services to people I mean my office has hundreds and hundreds of cases.
But as long as you have the people behind, you can really do anything, awesome and Those of us who are working government and all so much thanks to Sidney and Richie in New, York, Public Library, and also to Lucan Community Board five, how I love that you're promoting reading on your shirt, which is awesome because we definitely need to read it's so important and critical, and you know when I think about how I got into public service it's through personal experiences.
You know the people in my neighborhood and I got a job, there's a real problem here, and so it started and kicked off my effort to join my community board and be in public service to say, I'm going to use whatever power.
I think is really fantastic in the sense that you are yourselves organizing and pushing change, and we try to as an office make sure that we are having similar types of events, but ensuring that we're listening as people who are in government, because there is no real division between you know, quote young people and Carlina Matthew to myself.
Black and Latino communities have always had they have just a history of a lack of investment in these communities for things as basic as health care and so I'm, advocating for greater transparency in the city's test and trace program right now to make sure that it's actually helping the black and brown communities that are suffering the most right now because of kovat 19 If you don't know what testing traces-- Okay, it's just as people get tested for Covid-19 19 if they do test positive, making sure that they can trace the people that they've come into contact with to make sure that they get the services that they understand what it means to quarantine.
I. Don't really have a lot of questions in regards to policy, but a lot about education and I just feel like k12 is not getting the proper education, especially black and brown teams, and we really ask ourselves why teens of color drop out of school, but when we see what we're learning at school and has nothing to do with our history, it has nothing to do with where we come from What reforms.
I Remember, a bunch of us, put forward a bunch of bills and some of them move some of them didn't, but I think you know, because of the organizing that so many of you and of course allies in the council throughout government are engaging in , keep pushing your government folks elected officials, but you yourself should consider getting involved civically We have boards called community boards So almost one community boards, and that's a sort of a way that many of us can start really engaging in a quote, unquote or formal capacity with issues that we're seeing you know on our block and in our neighborhoods, so you can even apply to become a member, and actually you can just obtain these meetings and they talk about issues of housing and policing and education and they also push themselves as board members, elected officials and others with solutions that you pitch and then you know more longer-term, consider running for office yourself, Just.
I would just say: absolutely join your community board interns in my office, young people and I post questions to them constantly just to get different perspectives of people that you know are in high school that are going to college in college.
Do want to mention that our public officials do have some time constraints and it not being an editable in it kind of having the blame being put on low, not even low income people, but black and brown communities Do you think we one go about environmental racism and add light to that?
Think the council's been the most actually progressive on this topic of environmental racism by one looking in house But when it comes to you know, people of color in these areas it is making clear to our electives that you know we live in certain communities, sometimes not by choice, sometimes by design As a matter of you know, like housing policy alone, it's making sure that we can afford homes that are kind of more spread out in different areas that we have opportunities to live in areas that are not dance terminal to our health Quite.
I know when I'm on the trip I get the best education, because I'm able to look at different things That's exactly that's exactly right in terms of hearing from students themselves, so I had a bill that passed in the council to create these diversity working groups, but what's different about this, then in previous kinds of cohorts or task forces Is that we're actually including students, parents and school leadership, because I think that's?
You know I, remember in school, We, just didn't really have the money for that There is so much here in New, York City that we can that we can bring to young people.
The way that dollars flow to our hospital systems, - is very inequitable, so I think it's really listening to you all and then making sure we're looking at some of these formulas that deal in finances that are just not coming down to the black and brown low-income immigrant communities that we need them to also want to encourage on education.
