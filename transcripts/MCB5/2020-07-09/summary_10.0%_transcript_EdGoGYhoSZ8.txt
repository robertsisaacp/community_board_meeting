What can change look like for young people who are directly affected by policies implemented now and in the future and who better to ask than our very own New York City teens today for power to the youth, we've brought together three young leaders who will be in direct connection with our lead public officials, and you could go ahead and pour that over.
We have deputy borough president Matthew Washington of the Manhattan borough, president Gale, a Brewer first deputy public advocate Nicki Smith of the Office of Public advocate Jumaane Williams, and then we have also New York City Council member Carl, inna Rivera of district 2 and with all of those introductions with that I cede the floor to our young people, and if you could go ahead and show on your camera Paula, would you like to take the mic?
We have a chance to Center the voices of young people who are really the leaders of today by tomorrow, with during all of us ourselves, a big favor and in fact, that Ashley is a great segue into your question, which is why am I in this stuff as I get into policy and politics and organizing for me,, maybe a little bit younger I'm, originally from California Los, Angeles and I.
Think, like you, all, are doing here, speak to the elected officials and actually getting involved in city government there.
Then you know, put forward a bill to ban the chokehold nationally to make sure that I'm funding programs and services that not only I needed as a young person, but that I know that are important to just basic survival.
When you look at what we're funding, how we're making things happen, how we're providing services to people I mean my office has hundreds and hundreds of cases you're going to see that you really can affect change and being an elected official being in government.
But as long as you have the people behind, you can really do anything awesome and Those of us who are working government and all so much thanks to Sidney and Richie in New, York, Public Library, and also to Lucan Community Board, five.
How I love that you're promoting reading on your shirt, which is awesome because we definitely need to read It's so important and critical, And You know when I think about how I got into public service.
When I think about the need for food for people in an economically disadvantaged areas, we have to make sure that we're providing food, and so our office in Manhattan borough, president's office.
What they need is critical and then, when we think about the protection that you talks, about, Pinnacle is making sure communities are healthy and alive and thriving, and you know if we are building more cohesion amongst ourselves between us and our neighbors.
I think this is a issue for young people and not so young people in terms of many prongs, The Office of Public advocate, is working on some legislation right now on the mental health issue, to support families and including young people, I think, as many of us know, right now.
I. Think is really fantastic in the sense that you are yourselves organizing and pushing change, and we try to as an office make sure that we are having similar types of events but ensuring that we're listening as people who are in government, because there is no real division between you.
Black and Latino communities have always had they have just a history of a lack of investment in these communities for things as basic as health care, And. So I'm, advocating for greater transparency in the city's test and trace program right now to make sure that it's actually helping the black and brown communities that are suffering the most right now because of Covid-19, If you do not know what testing traces.
I, do not really have a lot of questions in regards to policy, but a lot about education, And I just feel like k12 is not getting the proper education, especially black and brown teams, and we really ask ourselves why teens of color drop out of school, But when we see what we're learning at school and has nothing to do with our history, it has nothing to do with where we come.
Do you think we should make in the education system to make sure that all groups are represented and all groups are all forms and traces of history are talked about and understood not just by black and brown kids, but also privileged white kids as well Answers about that niya you and Hawa, just recently, graduated as well in white and persevering, and congratulations and persevering in our remote learning, environments.
Are you ever supposed to be able to digest it to absorb it and to actually understand that there's so much trauma in our communities that go so far deep so far back decades and centuries and for the City Council to have to fight to You know include LGBTQ, inclusive, curriculum, Hyper locally is maybe teach a little bit of history.
It goes right to your block into your neighborhood into your city in this country in the world, and then you get this kind of international understanding that can change your perspective on policy and try to bring in new fresh ideas, while also grappling with what is just you, know, racism, systemic racism, entrenched and really just affecting everything that I think is basic, which I always say is food, housing, education and health.
Can somebody tell me how Trigonometry is helping me get a job that I can help take care of my family with And, so I think we need to infuse more career, pathway, ideology into schools and help young people.
Taught cooking in school, Right home economics, what it used to be called, Now you look at that, the food network- You know the young person who grew up in NYCHA.
The fact that we have to continuously repeat over and over our life matters, because other people look at us and feel automatic threat or feel like we just automatically do not matter in society that you know just because the way that my skin color looks and not what's in my brain and my potential and how I want to strive to be important, strive to move Society.
With issues that we're seeing you know on our block and in our neighborhoods So you can even apply to become a member, and actually you can just obtain these meetings and they talk about issues of housing and policing and education and they also push themselves as board members, elected officials and others with solutions that you pitch And, then you know more longer- term consider running for office.
Interns in my office, young people and I post questions to them constantly just to get different perspectives of people that you know are in high school that are going to college in college.
I recently asked my interns, you know what does it mean to you when we talk about defunding the NYPD abolishing the NYPD just to hear directly from the people that are out there from the people that are really have been served with a lot of the mistakes that we have made as a society and that they're going to have to live with and try to grapple with police brutality with climate change, with everything else, So is just trying to bring as many of y' all around the table and the way you can do.
As a matter of you know, like housing policy alone, it's making sure that we can afford homes that are kind of more spread out in different areas that we have opportunities to live in areas that are not dance terminal to our health.
We just need to make sure, as Nick mentioned, that there's equity and how these resources are being distributed to our school systems and we're not listening to the young people.
I mean you know the school leadership teams, the community education, councils.
The way that dollars flow to our hospital systems- is very inequitable, so I think it's really listening to you all and then making sure we're looking at some of these formulas that deal in finances that are just not coming down to the black and brown Income, immigrant communities, that we need them to also want to encourage on education.
We have to change the way those dollars come into our systems, and we also have to look at kind of the local health clinics that serve people very culturally, humble care, our federally qualified health systems, which is, are those local clinics that probably a lot of our families go to and how are incorporating health into the education system.
You know any black people trying to go into the medical field, support them, which you can to get them in there, because I personally has health issues and I do have a fear that going to a doc, That's an issue.
But when I'm speaking about history, you know there's a lot of missing history with Native Americans and black people and Hispanic people We always have to educate each other on different things.
Okay, I think that's a great point to end last thoughts from our young people.
