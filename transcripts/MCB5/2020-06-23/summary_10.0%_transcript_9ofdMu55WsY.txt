I'm just going to give you a brief overview of how the committee works, we are going to discuss our issue, which is budget and alternative policing, Public Safety tonight the citizen budget Commission CBC, who is a nonpartisan I, always say that we're wrong nonpartisan nonprofit civic organization, whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City is here.
We have already sent our electeds a letter which supports cuts to the NYPD and support for things like the Summer Youth Employment Program, and so we are now as a committee looking to the next budget cycle, which begins on July 1st, the transportation and environment committee of CB 5, provided us with a set of principles that they have informally adopted regarding the enforcement of transportation violations, and that's really going to be helpful for our conversation this evening, and we should look at that We start this conversation is what are the tasks that are currently handled by the NYPD that could be better handled by other agencies or other organizations even think about whether armed police are necessary for all functions, and we also need to think about enforcement, and how do we ensure enforcement is done in a non biased way, but also even thinking things like?
I, don't have much to say, but I do want to say thanks everyone for focusing on this conversation, something I'm very interested in, and I'm really excited to have two people from CBC here, : I have to be transparent four years ago, I was an intern at CBC, so I got to know them well, and you know think that they're, a great organization and There is that you know they're a good place to go for the facts, about the budget to understand how the city budget works- The last part of the discussion, if possible, to answer questions that come up about different budget lines.
One important fact to note is that this doesn't fully account for the entire expenses of the city pays on the NYPD and related costs, because it doesn't include what are known as central expenses, so in 2020 the NYPD's operating budget which funds it's like day-to-day operations, the costs of staff, the cost of programming or anything else that the agency might do is about five point: six billion Then there are another 5.3 billion dollars in central expenses which are managed centrally by the city, but then can be allocated back to the agency, for which you know those costs are responsible for, and this is things like pensions fringe benefits, which includes things like health insurance and other welfare contributions to employees as well as there is spending for any capital projects that NYPD might have This makes the NYPD the third largest budget out of all of the city agencies The five point: six billion dollar operating budget is the third largest behind the Department of Education and the Department of Social Services If, you add in those central expenses, it's still the third largest, but it's 11.1% of the city budget instead of five point.
Next comes administration and communications, so this is all of the admin side for the agency, as well as their 911 response team, and the third is the chief of Department This is the department, that's responsible, with coordinating between all of the different bureaus at the NYPD, but also the reason why their budget is so large is because that's where pretty much all of the agencies- overtime, as well as their other sorts of supplemental pay sit They have their transit and transportation police there's school safety agents as well as spending on counterterrorism.
So you can see, on the right hand, side where their funding breaks to the funding breakdown about 92% is city funded, and then you have a six percent That's federally funded, and this is mostly for counterterrorism as well as there's some security grants like reimbursement for the police officers at the UN If you look at how many people did NYPD employees, it's a bit, it's about 54,000 in 2020, about 36,000 of those or uniformed employees, and seventeen thousand of those are civilian employees, and the civilian employees include things like the school safety agents, as well as traffic enforcement agents that eat see in the street.
One of the reasons why police officers and uniformed employees at the NYPD are you know, have such high average pay is because of the overtime and the NYPD has a particularly high overtime budget, the uniformed overtime budget of about five hundred million dollars, That includes agencies like the fire department or the department Corrections or the Department of Sanitation, which also have uniformed employees The notable expansion was in 2015 when the City Council on the mayor agreed to hire a thousand three hundred police officers, and most of these were targeted at the community policing initiative, as well as some of them for the counterterrorism response and over the course of the entire period.
Revenues have come in much more much lower than expected, given the economic crisis and the pandemic, and so we at CBC did a report looking at sort of what we would recommend as the way for the city to close the budget gap, and we have a framework that was developed by Charles pressure, a research staff, negative impacts on New Yorkers, especially on disadvantaged communities, that you want to preserve the city's competitiveness and its attractiveness as a place to live as a place to locate your business and that you don't want to burden future generations so that we really we've been very staunch in a position that any long-term borrowing could really be.
I can definitely understand the concern, because you're right that, if you are, if you are doing any kind of reduction, if you went to the point where you were actually trying to produce your current employment level, you would be required under union to really start with the most recent hires So. In that case, you're, most likely relying you know in terms of the uniformed police force, they tend to have a slightly lower turnover rate and most in the city as a whole, especially in police, There's.
I believe that what the governor was referring to was not just state funding related the police, but all state funding, so I think the threat was an education aid, other aid as a way but general It's, not a large area of spending for the state Most of the state aid to localities is right and thank you, Tristan Could, you maybe speak a little bit about the methodology used to calculate the pensions and how you know uses the later years and options career or like the peak years and how overtime plays a role in establishing what the pension is and then, if you could also loop in, if you have any data, how over time, usage changes from like a more junior officer to a more senior officer?
There is a fair amount of churn and that's usually what the city has been relying on in terms of increasing or decreasing or by slowing hiring, even, for example, the reductions that are proposed Department of Corrections, as they start closing facilities on Rikers those have all been through attrition and so you're managing it by letting more people leave I mean you know, around 500 million dollars for uniform to overtime at the police department is sort of You looked at the change from the budget last year, and there was a decent change.
A second bucket with school safety You know potentially moving safety officers from NYPD to Department of Education, and then there was homeless outreach, which you know it's kind of related, obviously to the mental health bucket, but I think it's more talking about You know: funding, outreach teams and Department of homeless services, programs and funding housing.
You know they're not trained to be mental health professionals or to deal with the homeless or all sorts of other issues that they are forced to kind of handle on a day-to-day basis, and so I think all the areas that Joseph mentioned are some perfectly appropriate for increased funding You know, if that you know whatever, as a replacement for whatever is cut from the NYPD budget.
I want to have the conversation about that and see what you think about that You, your hand is up again, I want to say, I, agree in principle with what Joseph and the sack we're talking about in the three areas, its fullness mental illness and exclusivity, to have to NYPD the police officers, nothing loth, but have other more appropriate or relevant We trained service providers to be logged now, I'm, not sure CI, Principal role, provided that the overall had come for.
It is so important , I think more so important, whether it has to do with people violating social distancing rules, the state law of a mask in public when you're, not it was maintained, so she did social distancing or when it relates to business, closed temporarily and opportunities present themselves for people who want to you know, take what don't belong to them, and just public safety as a female signifying resident Police officers in the street Better training personnel, but I cannot support any meaningful cut.
So I think our principles need to be defined first and that's what this conversation is about and that sort of drives is that well and overall, philosophically I would agree that certain things should be taken away from the police department, because they're, probably not well equipped and they're inclined to use force and handcuffs versus There are other enforcement things that should not be in the police department's ballot works such as social distancing, a lot of quality of life stuff and I would say that we are not talking about lack of enforcement.
You know that, put together mental health workers and police I think there's a group called the core response teams and there have been a number of efforts to try to soften the approach of the NYPD to emotionally disturbed people and folks of that of that ilk and I Wonder.
Mental health clinics Had. Some contact with these corresponds teams, but they still show up in NYPD, Blue right and so even emotionally disturbed people respond to the uniform more than they respond to the role you know In other words, everybody shows up and they all look like police, but some of them may have different training and I guess for me, I'm curious to see how the PD has worked to provide a more you know, synthetic kind of service that might respond in more ways than just brute force to control the situation.
We've talked about kind of functions that might be better served in different agencies, but I mean there are also some things that the City Council and advocates are recommended in terms of changes within NYPD that have budget implications, but that also have like Public Safety implications that, like I, don't know if that's appropriate for our principals They still get their pension they're costing the agency a lot of money.
I would support a statement of principles that allows changes like that to be made where we can actually take quick action to fire officers who hurt people, and you know, and then also there is concerns about overtime, that I think Zach and a few others raise that I'm not saying we're not looking at the budget, but that is not the focus given that it's tied up, but we're now moving into the next year.
I think that services like mental health response, school safety and homeless, outreach and support that you know Mary Joseph Sam, that entire team here is been speaking adamantly about tonight like it makes sense to divest those activities from then, like you Can, we propose you asking for you know proposed having greater transparency in the new and in the NYPD budget?
So I want to make sure I have everyone's position and that I'm, reflecting what the committee has said So what I have is that we do not believe that police should be in the business of mental health response, school safety, homeless, outreach or transit We're thinking that transparency is needed in terms of police overtime, their accountability in terms of body cams and the ease of firing Those bad apples should be looked at any frontline law enforcement should have a body cam and should follow the legislation for uploading it within a 30-day period.
Is that I'm sort of reiterating the position of the committee when I said that Sam I mean I think it was just a little over a week ago that the governor challenged every community in New, York State to reimagine, policing and Public Safety?
Further right here, This is a big ball of wax people and they're all interconnected, so it can seem overwhelming because we're talking about so many things but I think right now, if we frame our position, get our principles down and have a resolution that we can use as a touchstone as we move forward in doing all the budget requests and all of the agency requests and looking at all the different issues that come throughout the year, it'll be helpful for us overall I think you know I'm in support of them.
