Just going to give you a brief overview of how the committee works, we are going to discuss our issue, which is budget and alternative policing, Public Safety tonight the citizen budget Commission CBC, who is a nonpartisan I, always say that we're wrong nonpartisan nonprofit civic organization, whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City is here.
The committee is going to be permitted to ask questions followed by the public and then we're going to move into our conversation mode, now, While, a resolution regarding our committees, you of alternating policing and potential areas where the city might explore new paradigms is the eventual goal.
It's gonna be finalized at the end of the month, and although there have been statements from the City Council and the mayor regarding what this budget is going to look like, we really don't know.
We have already sent our electeds a letter which supports cuts to the NYPD and support for things like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, and so we are now as a committee looking to the next budget cycle, which begins on July 1st, the transportation and environment committee of CB 5, provided us with a set of principles that they have informally adopted regarding the enforcement of transportation violations, and that's really going to be helpful for our conversation, this evening, and we should look at that.
We start, this conversation is what are the tasks that are currently handled by the NYPD that could be better handled by other agencies or other organizations even think about whether armed police are necessary for all functions, and we also need to think about enforcement, and how do we ensure enforcement is done in a non biased, way, but also even thinking things like?
One important fact to note is that this doesn't fully account for the entire expenses of the city pays on the NYPD and related costs, because it doesn't include what are known as central expenses, so in 2020 the NYPD's operating budget, which funds it's like day-to-day operations, the costs of staff, the cost of programming or anything else that the agency might do is about five point: six billion.
Then there are another 5.3 billion dollars in central expenses which are managed centrally by the city, but then can be allocated back to the agency, for which you know those costs are responsible for, and this is things like pensions, fringe benefits, which includes things like health, insurance and other welfare contributions to employees as well as there is spending for any capital projects that NYPD might have.
This is the department, that's responsible, with coordinating between all of the different bureaus at the NYPD, but also the reason why their budget is so large is because that's where pretty much all of the agencies- overtime, as well as their other sorts of supplemental pay sit They have their transit and transportation police , There's school safety agents, as well as spending on counterterrorism.
If you look at how many people did NYPD employees, it's a bit, it's about 54,000 in 2020, about 36,000 of those or uniformed employees, and seventeen thousand of those are civilian employees, and the civilian employees include things like the school safety agents, as well as traffic enforcement agents that eat see in the street.
Anyone has questions and then also I'll turn to on to see if she has anything else to add, but some of the budget Basics online way, PD, thanks, Adrienne I I think he did an excellent job sort of discussing the general contours of the budget and how it fits into the city's overall spending.
Revenues have come in much more much lower than expected, given the economic crisis and the pandemic, and so we at CBC did a report looking at sort of what we would recommend as the way for the city to close the budget gap, and we have a framework that was developed by Charles pressure, a research, staff.
It definitely does vary by Department by agency, quite substantially, with some agencies like the NYPD being mostly city funded, whereas others like dia, we relying more on state funding and then social services also, unlike us, the federal and state money That some other agencies may be seem smaller, because they're funded for from federal, phosphate, funding, So, overall about 68% of the city's budget, comes from tax revenues it another five percent comes from the fees and fines.
: Do you know how the number of uniformed and civilian officers, as well as the New York City police budget, compared to that of other comparable cities, whether it be San, Francisco, LA, Chicago, on a per capita basis?
A new police officer starts at forty two thousand five hundred and that stays at fifty one thousand unfilled air and about five just before five and a half years and after that is when it jumps to over eighty five thousand And I guess the continuation of that question is if the city becomes bankrupt, what happens to the pension, contributions?
You, know, I know you're not really focused on the conversation about cutting the NYPD budget or looking at alternative sources, kind of alternative plans for Public Safety and trying to balance those priorities.
Some advocates, including you know, the City Council Speaker I'm, called for 1 billion dollars per year in reductions to the budget.
Look smaller The city started to implement caps on overtime at some of the uniformed agencies, which is really the majority like three quarters of the city's overtime, the four agencies that Adrian mentioned and the NYPD As if growth has been a little bit, slower, I think and there's been definitely a little bit more control in the last year.
You would call it like city funded payouts from civil suits against police officers in the New York Police Department I was surprised that the money that the city pays out doesn't come from the NYPD budget, but I'm curious to hear whether that's just standard.
Just, one question: I'm, not sure the extent to which you would know this, but so the City Council is obviously thrown out a 1 billion dollar annual cut from NYPD budget.
At NYPD is going to have this budget, and so the city can make some they can move up to like 5% within an agency across these different groupings, to make movement any greater than that they need to go back to the council.- So the Charter and the budget process have some limitations on how much you could so like a school safety.
What we'll do now is turn to the committee for our two-hour conversation about the NYPD, using what we've learned tonight to think about the resolution that we want to put together for our next meeting about the principles for CB 5.
Guess they want to start up the discussion by asking what would be the purpose of us getting a resolution together, because the city budget is going to be finalized by July 1?
We're talking about is a statement of principles and a resolution moving forward CBI's position on perhaps alternative policing and you're correct that the city budget is going to be decided in the next week.
It was about alternative public safety strategies and One of them was mental health response, which is currently you know a major responsibility of the police department which I have to say they don't even really like the president of the PBA, has actually said like they don't feel like they can help New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises because of underfunding from other mental health, related programs and housing programs.
You know potentially moving safety officers from NYPD to Department of Education, and then there was homeless outreach, which you know it's kind of related, obviously to the mental health bucket, but I think it's more talking.
You know they're, not trained to be mental health professionals or to deal with the homeless or all sorts of other issues that they are forced to kind of handle on a day-to-day basis, and so I think.
You know, are we just saying we support cutting the NYPD budget, and these are ways that we could do it and sort of leaving it at that Are we saying you would like budgets be cut, and this is how we want that money that could have gone to them?
If there's any information available on how effective that effort has been and whether some things that combine police enforcement with social services or mental health services are actually achieving any success currently in the current climate, because I guess, from my point of view, is the interface between NYPD and emotionally disturbed people or people that are in crisis.
In other words, everybody shows up and they all look like police, but some of them may have different training, And I guess for me, I'm curious to see how the PD has worked to provide a more you, know, synthetic kind of service that might respond in more ways than just brute force to control the situation.
What we need to do is sort of think about where we stand and what potential solutions and what we believe is best for our community and If we, if you look at the tne proposal and their set of principles, if we could craft something similar to sort of guide our conversations and guide our budget considerations going forward, that would be most helpful.
Before this pandemic hit, Andrew Cuomo, announced that he was hiring 500 additional MTA officers to go on the trains essentially to roust, homeless people, so I just feel that law enforcement has overreached on this That I think that, whether it's MTA Police or NYPD.
We've talked about kind of functions that might be better served in different agencies, but I mean there are also some things that the City Council and advocates are recommended in terms of changes within NYPD that have budget implications, but that also have like Public Safety implications.
Let's I, don't know, I would support a statement of principles that allows changes like that to be made where we can actually take quick action to fire officers who hurt people, and you know, and then also there is concerns about overtime, that I think Zach and a few others raise that , I'm not saying we're not looking at the budget, but that is not the focus given that it's tied up, but we're now moving into the next year.
I think that services like mental health, response, school safety and homeless, outreach and support that you know Mary Joseph Sam that entire team here is been speaking adamantly about tonight like it makes sense to divest those activities from then, like you.
If we're going to be looking at a deficit, which means a budget reduction, perhaps one of the things that we might want to look at is trying to at least protect or continue to study these programs that sort of soft soften the impact of having the police show up for a mental health event or for an emotionally disturbed person, perhaps without uniforms or in other ways.
What I'm hearing from the committee is that we believe that and the NYPD should divest not be in the business of school, safety, transit, enforcement, homeless, outreach and potentially security for public officials.
That program wasn't working well hitting records published of cops who have records hiding guy in okay, Lucas hi, so I think that one thing that might be able to guide us and in this conversation, perhaps is just looking more at things like we have talked about in terms of details in their budget like in terms of overtime, Other city agencies do right.
Mary I do want to point out, because I have experience working with low-income housing, complexes, some of the community policing officers I think when they were added to the PD force.
Is that I'm sort of reiterating the position of the committee when I said that Sam I mean I think it was just a little over a week ago that the governor challenged every community in New, York State to reimagine, policing and Public, Safety So you know when you, when you think about enforcement, I, guess from my point of view.
If we frame our position, get our principles down and have a resolution that we can use as a touchstone as we move forward in doing all the budget requests and all of the agency requests and looking at all the different issues that come throughout the year, it'll be helpful for us overall I think you know I'm in support of them.
