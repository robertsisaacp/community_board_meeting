Just going to give you a brief overview of how the committee works, we are going to discuss our issue, which is budget and alternative policing, Public Safety tonight, The citizen Budget, Commission CBC, who is a nonpartisan I, always say that we're wrong Nonpartisan nonprofit civic organization, whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City is here.
The committee is going to be permitted to ask questions followed by the public and then we're going to move into our conversation mode, now, While, a resolution regarding our committees, you of alternating policing and potential areas where the city might explore new paradigms is the eventual goal.
It's going to be finalized at the end of the month, and although there have been statements from the City Council and the mayor regarding what this budget is going to look like, we really do not know.
We have already sent our electeds a letter which supports cuts to the NYPD and support for things like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, and so we are now as a committee looking to the next budget cycle, which begins on July 1st, the transportation and environment committee of CB 5, provided us with a set of principles that they have informally adopted regarding the enforcement of transportation violations, and that's really going to be helpful for our conversation, this evening, and we should look at that.
We start, this conversation is what are the tasks that are currently handled by the NYPD that could be better handled by other agencies or other organizations even think about whether armed police are necessary for all functions, and we also need to think about enforcement, and how do we ensure enforcement is done in a non biased, way, but also even thinking things like?
So in 2020 the NYPD's operating budget, which funds it's like, day- to, Day, operations, the costs of staff, the cost of programming or anything else that the agency might do is about five point: six billion.
For, which you know those costs are responsible for, and this is things like pensions, fringe benefits, which includes things like health, insurance and other welfare contributions to employees as well as there is spending for any capital projects that NYPD might have.
One important thing to note is that the Department of Social Services budget does include a required six billion dollar Medicaid contribution and beat on the part of the city.
If you look at how many people did NYPD employees, it's a bit, it's about 54,000 in 2020, about 36,000 of those or uniformed employees, and seventeen thousand of those are civilian employees, and the civilian employees include things like the school safety agents, as well as traffic enforcement agents that eat see in the street.
One, of the reasons why police officers and uniformed employees at the NYPD are you know, have such high average pay is because of the overtime and the NYPD has a particularly high overtime budget.
Revenues have come in much more much lower than expected, given the economic crisis and the pandemic, and so we at CBC did a report looking at sort of what we would recommend as the way for the city to close the budget gap, and we have a framework that was developed by Charles pressure, a research, staff.
If you look at agencies that have substantial federal funding, it will be agencies like administration for Children Services, the Department of Social Services, the housing preservation and development agency, and other agencies like sanitation, fire police, tend to be primarily funded by City dollars.
: Do you know how the number of uniformed and civilian officers, as well as the New York City police budget, compared to that of other comparable cities, whether it be San, Francisco, LA, Chicago, on a per capita basis?
You, know, I know you're not really focused on the conversation about cutting the NYPD budget or looking at alternative sources, kind of alternative plans for Public Safety and trying to balance those priorities.
The city does not really have program, but it's in the way that one might think about where it's easy to go and say you know, I, want know how much you spend on neighborhood, policing or The city is also they provide a lot of information about the upcoming, but the data on actual spending is a lot less granular, and so that's the other reason that can be somewhat difficult.
It's they're cutting heedcount in many agencies or stuff, it's usually through attrition or moving people around, and So you know, I, think that's just part of the general way that the city has worked has been through, and the separation rate is something like 7 percent.
You would call it like city funded payouts from civil suits against police officers in the New York Police Department I was surprised that the money that the city pays out does not come from the NYPD budget, but I'm curious to hear whether that's just standard.
Just one question: I'm, not sure the extent to which you would know this, but so the City Council is obviously thrown out a 1 billion dollar annual cut from NYPD budget.
That is the level at which the council appropriate, and so they can say you know this unit of appropriation, which might be something like administration or executive administration at NYPD is going to have this budget, and so the city can make some they can move up to like 5% within an agency acrosss these different groupings to make movement any greater than that they need to go back to the council.
Is that something that we agree, with, that there are agencies that might be better served outside to be put outside of the NYPD July Oh yeah, sorry, okay, Thank, You, Renee, I, just I guess they want to start up the discussion by asking what would be the purpose of us getting a resolution together, because the city budget is going to be finalized by July 1?
We're talking about is a statement of principles and a resolution moving forward, CBI's position on perhaps alternative policing and you're correct that the city budget is going to be decided in the next week.
You know my thoughts about the discussion about kind of like what we might want to fund instead of certain components of NYPD, because I know that's kind of where we're going in one way.
It was about alternative public safety strategies and One of them was mental health response, which is currently you know a major responsibility of the police department which I have to say they do not even really like the president of the PBA Has actually said like they do not feel like they can help New Yorkers experiencing mental health crises because of underfunding from other mental health, related programs and housing programs.
Talking about you, know potentially moving safety officers from NYPD to Department of Education, and then there was homeless outreach, which you know it's kind of related, obviously to the mental health bucket, but I think it's more talking.
You know they're, not trained to be mental health professionals or to deal with the homeless or all sorts of other issues that they are forced to kind of handle on a day, to- The areas that Joseph mentioned are some perfectly appropriate for increased funding.
You know budget conversation We can talk about what we think just philosophically, as T&E has done about where we think these things should be, and it could be almost divorced from the budget Then we can bring the budget back in as we look at it going forward through the year.
You know, are we just saying we support cutting the NYPD budget, and these are ways that we could do it and sort of leaving it at that Are we saying you would like budgets be cut, and this is how we want that money that could have gone to them?
Okay, July, you, your hand, is up again , I want to say, I, agree in principle with what Joseph and the sack we're talking about in the three areas, its fullness mental illness and exclusivity, to have to NYPD the police officers, nothing loth, but have other more appropriate or relevant.
One type of job, meaning I, do not believe any given police officer is assigned to conduct outreach to illuminate old people or to the homeless population, or to do the specific control, so I think figuring.
You, know that put together mental health workers and police I think there's a group called the core response teams and there have been a number of efforts to try to soften the approach of the NYPD to emotionally disturbed people and folks of that of that ilk and I.
If there's any information available on how effective that effort has been and whether some things that combine police enforcement with social services or mental health services are actually achieving any success currently in the current climate, because I guess, from my point of view, is the interface between NYPD and emotionally disturbed people or people that are in crisis.
Where we stand, but also raise some of the questions that need to be answered before we can come to a definitive position, and that's certainly one of the questions- Mental health clinics Had. Some contact with these corresponds teams, but they still show up in NYPD, Blue, right and so even emotionally disturbed people respond to the uniform more than they respond to the role you know.
Everybody shows up and they all look like police, but some of them may have different training, And I guess for me, I'm curious to see how the PD has worked to provide a more you, know, synthetic kind of service that might respond in more ways than just brute force to control the situation.
What, we need to do, is sort of think about where we stand and what potential solutions and what we believe is best for our community and If we, if you look at the Tne proposal and their set of principles, if we could craft something similar to sort of guide our conversations and guide our budget considerations going forward, that would be most helpful.
People of color in the department We've talked about kind of functions that might be better served in different agencies, But I mean there are also some things that the City Council and advocates are recommended in terms of changes within NYPD that have budget implications, but that also have like Public Safety implications.
He was on the NYPD pay line for five years, so I think if we're looking for ways to save money and avoid officers losing their jobs, they're doing a really good job.
I would support a statement of principles that allows changes like that to be made where we can actually take quick action to fire officers who hurt people, and you know, and then also there is concerns about overtime, that I think Zach and a few others raise that Not looking at the budget.
If you know, because of all of the effects, those coronavirus and everything going on, it's like If we just can't really see that in the budget line, as it's in I, think, We may not be able to see that, but that's something another question that our public safety silo should investigate before our next before there is any resolution, is adopted.
I think that services like mental health, response, School safety and homeless, outreach and support that you know Mary Joseph Sam that entire team here is been speaking.
If we're going to be looking at a deficit, which means a budget reduction, perhaps one of the things that we might want to look at is trying to at least protect or continue to study these programs that sort of soft soften the impact of having the police show up for a mental health event or for an emotionally disturbed person, perhaps without uniforms or in other ways.
What I'm hearing from the committee is that we believe that and the NYPD should divest not be in the business of school, safety, transit, enforcement, homeless, outreach and potentially security for public officials.
Do, not think you necessarily need a one- for- one transfer of current school safety officers from NYPD to you know similar officers that are just they just report to The do- e I.
Mary I do want to point out, because I have experience working with low- income, housing complexes, some of the community policing officers I think when they were added to the PD force.
Cam does not prevents people from you know, even wanting to have a conversation with the police officers.
Is that I'm sort of reiterating the position of the committee when I said that Sam I mean I think it was just a little over a week ago that the governor challenged every community in New, York State to reimagine, policing and Public, Safety So you know when you, when you think about enforcement, I, guess from my point of view.
If we frame our position, get our principles down and have a resolution that we can use as a touchstone as we move forward in doing all the budget requests and all of the agency requests and looking at all the different issues that come throughout the year, it'll be helpful for us overall I think you know, I'm in support of them.
