, I'm, the chair of Manhattan, Community, board, fives We, have three items on our agenda: Tonight: two presentations by the New York City Department of Transportation, and then one discussion amongst the committee members without any further ado.
That point I will open it up to members of the committee to ask questions and then, following that to members of the public, to ask questions or to make any comments that they'd like to make from there We'll move into a business session where the committee and only the committee members will have an internal discussion around the topic and though I do not currently anticipate this for any of the items on the agenda tonight to potentially take a vote or any board action and then from there.
We're, all looking forward to continuing to work with you and the board members on our Midtown projects: I'm joined here by my colleagues, Brian Peret and David Andrew from the dot's bike share program as well as colleen chatterboon from the Manhattan office, who many of you also have the pleasure of working with Kimberly, Rancourt and Casey.
3 expansion in Manhattan started this spring when we expanded into new neighborhoods uptown, but we're also focusing on adding new stations and more dock capacity into the existing service area, including here in Community board 5, to help support the demands of a larger system.
Let me know if you can't thank you again, thanks for your time, I'm Brian Peret and with the DOT bike share program and again here to discuss You, like infill in CB5.
It's, going to support increased demand from phase 3 expansion meet unmet demand in the existing service area and Installations will be rolling, so they may cover multiple community boards at a time, and really this is going to be an iterative planning process, we're going to try to be nimble and address changes in the system as demand.
This is going to be focused on demand, we're looking to try to where it makes sense, Max out space, that we have existing and also add new stations where we feel like it makes sense, got it.
We will be notifying both adjacent property owners and through the borough, commissioner's office, notifying community boards great and then just a quick follow-up to that Is. You know things may change, of course, but do you have an expected rhythm of how often you think we might hear about new additions?
I actually have sort of a follow-up question to that which might be more backward looking than forward looking, but I am curious whether or not you can speak to have any current stations or how many current stations, if any, have been relocated as a result of say the need for a restaurant or a business to sort of reclaim that sidewalk space during Covid-19 once open streets started for the purposes of say that business having to needing the space to stay in business were any, were any existing stations, relocated or moved to this point, we've only relocated and really not even relocated.
You know this infield process has really taken a need to kind of re, examine everything whole cloth when we started this process, we really, especially for each community board, we're taking a real blanket look at everything again and looking for space where, where it's available, so I would say, for these sites.
If you're in attendance-That was a great presentation and I'm especially interested to note that the news station, which was discussed to go behind fit, which would block the loading dock, we're now going to be forced to use for three years while we hooray finally build our new academic building May I report back to my people that it is not in the current plan, hi Lisa good evening.
You know transportation committee last week, but there are a few kind of like updates that I wanted to share with you.
I just want to know just the Department of Transportation have any plans or any method for enforcing existing bike laws.
Thanks for your question, you know we work hand in hand with the local precincts and the NYPD to enforce our traffic laws, but in terms of our CitiBike and bike share expansion into Midtown, I'm, hoping that Brian can elaborate more on our education and outreach campaigns that we're looking to do with the increase in ridership, as the CitiBike system.
We have learned over time that, while D.O.T certainly can can fund and take it on themselves to do education initiatives as much as much as the committee has is on record saying many times that enforcement of bikes needs to be totally rethought and revamped that the city currently does not fund or give the authority to DOT to do that.
It's, not so much a question of engaging with DOT to change that priority, but Probably, with the way that the city allocates that reso those resources and jurisdiction-And I know there is a history behind the fact that some of that enforcement authority might have lived with D.O.T in the past, but for something like 20:25 years.
As Brian had mentioned earlier, we are working on a lot of education campaigns and initiatives with our partner Lyft to ensure that all writers, whether they're new or you know veteran cyclists, continue to follow the posted, and you know, traffic bike rules for New York City.
Agencies seem to feel both empowered and willing to change the way that they are currently enforcing kind of how some of the street use like like the bicycle lanes and the conduct of bikes in general are being are being done.
You know in the terms of a bike lane going in and, for example, an infill.
So you know, I think, that concept of reallocating parking and traffic enforcement dollars could be part of the proposal that bex brings Become before the full board and thus something that we could potentially vote on, but again very interested to hear if there are kind of other ideas.
My only concern with the budget process and the allocation of dollars from NYPD to DOT is that when it comes to on the street, enforcement, I would think that the DOT would have the same problems that the NYPD has there's a bicyclist going 15 miles an hour down the sidewalk, the wrong way.
Other members of the committee who have any comments on this issue-again, I, we You, know kind of influx proposal, as was presented by DOT tonight, but again just want to open it up to discussion and ideas.
That would still need to at that point, like ticketing of those city, and you know, CitiBikes, causing infractions.
Between, as we have discussed in past committee, meetings about people who are using bikes for a living and trying to deliver food-Whoever has that enforcement capability, which again, I believed to be NYPD at the current time.
I. Definitely think that it's important You know bikes should follow the laws, but it's also important to note that the traffic laws as written right now were designed solely for the purpose of expediting car.
That Sam was talking about in terms of creating new enforcement mechanisms legislatively which may not exist right now, but I think I think we do need to start to get creative, because DOT and NYPD, for various reasons, are not currently empowered or funded to do the type of enforcement that we're that we're asking for and at that.
This is our sort of latest response to Covid-19 in your district, and the idea is to create a temporary sidewalk extension on Lexington avenue around grand Central, which is an area that we were looking at for improvements even before the pandemic, and we do plan to pursue a full street improvement project here in 2021.
We were hoping to come to the board this summer for the full proposal, but due to Covid-19 and shifting of priorities for response, we delayed it for one more year, but we're looking to kind of get some of some of the advantages of the project as part of the repaving and for the winter season.
The DOT will have to come back to us with the full plan, probably for our position on what a permanent reconfiguration and permanent treatment of the street would eventually look like.
But I also wanted to say that once the even this temporary plan becomes clearer to us, we will be happy to work with DOT about what we can be doing, perhaps to create a nicer experience for people using the space, as I'm sure you all know, at 43Rd, Street and 44th street, on the West side.
We'll move on to the the third item in the agenda, which is in reference to reviewing a budget proposal to create a director of the public realm position within the New York City Administration That's, analogous to similar discussions of a potential budget priority that have been had by multiple other committees in CB5 , already, I, believe, parks and land use have already discussed this proposal, and now we as Tne can discuss it here as well.
So I think we're still a long way from having a commitment to having a comprehensive street use plan, and it would seem that the DOT, as the agency, that's responsible for the curb to curb public space in our city, ought to be the leader in that I'll.
