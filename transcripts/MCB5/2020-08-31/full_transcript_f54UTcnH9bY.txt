Neither of these is a voting action item tonight, so normally I would say that none of our positions are official until they are heard at full board a week from Thursday, that's not quite as relevant tonight, but anyone who's interested can check out the meeting details on Cb5.Org for our full board meeting a week from Thursday night. So first we are going to hear at this point. It's actually a little bit more of a recap, because the circumstances on the ground rapidly shifted much to the public benefit, we're thrilled to say, but we still wanted to hear a kind of recap of the of the issue and the circumstances surrounding it and maybe ask questions about moving forward Kim. I'm not sure if you wanted to say anything to kick this off since you've been such a great advocate. For this sure, thanks so much Clayton, I just want to say huge win for our kids on Friday mayor De Blasio announced a reversal on the city park. Athletic field permit freeze so that youth programming can return to play this fall. This was made possible by a coalition of more than 100 New York City Youth sports organizations that joined together to really advocate and make this happen. And so we have a couple of those amazing representatives with us at the meeting tonight. This was spearheaded by Andrew from south Bronx united the executive director over there, and he was able to help generate over 8,000 signatures on a petition for this and then joined tonight. We have Meredith berkowitz, who is the West Side Soccer League, commissioner, as well as Tom Frambach from downtown United's Soccer Club, and he is the general manager there and would just love to hear as Clayton as you mentioned, their experiences and how else we can continue to champion and support this and once again to congratulate them on what is a huge victory for our kids, just knowing that in the midst of a global pandemic- and you know an economic depression and the rise in city gun violence, it's just so important to support the health and well- being of our next generation. So they, these organizations rely on fields and facilities to operate their programming, and this will make that possible. This fall, so I'm very excited that this can happen and that we have special guests tonight. Thank you so much, and also I just wanted to ask I'm not sure if Matt or anyone from the Parks Department is here, they're originally going to be part of the conversation, but since things shifted, I'm not sure if they are here or not, if you are, can you holler I'm looking through the list? I do not believe so. I just wanted to know if we had that voice in the room, but does not look like it all right. So I think Kevin is yes so hi. This is Kevin Mccarthy, I'm the executive director of downtown United, Tom Frambach, our general manager, who did a tremendous amount of work with Andrew and with Meredith in reaching out to organizations around the city and rallying their constituents to to move forward on this. So I just want to one I'm not sure if Meredith is on, but to recognize the work that she did, which was immediate upon hearing that news is, as we were, all sort of staggered. Meredith is one of the first person who I heard from who said: look let's get together. Andrew so also was incredibly significant with that and I'll be very brief. My hope is that this is a harbinger for all of our fellow organizations to seek these types of solutions with these types of numbers for sorry for for our kids in New, York City, who need especially now safe places to play and we'll continue, even as we move forward from this, so really pleased to see the coalition of the group and, of course, the short- term outcome, but I believe there are some mid and long- term things that we can do now as well and hope we can capture that energy moving forward. Thank you and what are the? What are? What do we need to know about the shifting data as to how the parks Department is going to continue to evaluate permits moving forward so from what we know is that they will. I think a lot of you know that for adult organizations or adult sports leagues they still have not been granted permits, but for the youth sport organizations, they are it's going to happen. I think the third week of September is when they'll start to open those permits. They're. I spoke with people from the psal, the Public School Athletic League today, and they are asking about different permits, so the situation literally changes every day, but the most significant thing is that, from the perspective of this coalition is that now there is. There are baselines for creating safe environments for everybody who participates on the permitted fields instead of having a sort of wild west scenario, so that is the short term and but again it shifts every day there. Now the adult leagues are concerned the psal now that they know that these fields are open and they use them have been interacting. So I literally was on the phone with a number of athletic directors today from different schools and obviously in the last week or so different organizations. So I wish I could give you a more definitive answer, but it shifts and changes every day yeah and what is it that we might be able to do to help further our advocacy and help support these organizations, who you know, in addition to just having this hardship of this immediate issue or obviously having a larger hardship as many entities are in the city? Well, that's a great question. I think that there's some evidence to the involvement of and downtown with a lot of our organizations in what's happened with gansevoort over the last year or so in, seeing that pier 40 has been resurfaced and their drainage systems have been updated, and so I think, using the collective voice of these grassroots youth sports organizations can swing a pretty powerful sword, and so I think, if all of the all the folks on this call who have significant influence in their spheres and when we stay connected with that. I think that this is a good example of what we can do as we move ahead. That's great! We, you know, I do know when we heard from south Bronx united when the lanker project in kind of the upper part of central park. You know we do not often hear a lot of central park things necessarily, but because we are one of the bordering districts on central park. We did hear that and one of the major issues that we were concerned about was access for the youth and for these programs, and that was the last time that we kind of heard from them, and I think that we all on this committee and on this board, certainly would be interested in doing whatever we can to strengthen those relationships and further our advocacy. Kim Mccall has been really great this summer, in kind of being open and available and creative to Troubleshooting ways that we can be involved in a proactive way and not a reactive way to how the Covid-19 crisis is impacting, in particular out of these kids. And so I want to thank her again for her leadership on these issues and just reiterate that we are here to help and to support, and we do not always know the best way, the specific way that we might be able to do that, especially with these shifting circumstances. So please remember that we're here, as developments continue to unfurl, and we continue to respond to them. That's great, thank you and Kim did you have any other questions for them or anything else you wanted to cover now. Thank you, Kevin, so much for all the work that you're doing for our kids and thanks for the update as well on the status for adult permitting, which you know is also extremely important too for for new Yorkers. But wishing you the best of luck and just really grateful for the services you provide for our kids. Well, I appreciate that very much, and my final note will be is that our organization and almost all of the organizations that rallied in this coalition give a tremendous amount of opportunity. They are organizations that do not have financial barriers. They offer scholarships. They are regardless of zip code, and so it's very important- and I know that the city was concerned about having open space for kids to come and play and during the pandemic- and I respect that, but I will say that these organizations offer opportunity for many kids who need to get out and get out into safe environments where the safety protocols have been established with the right institutions. So so thank you all and Kim. Thank you especially, and we want to continue to open access for all kids acrosss the city as we move forward. So thank you. Thank you, Kevin and before we move on from this item, I did want to see if committee members had any questions or comments for Kevin or on the issue, and if so, please raise your hand using the raise hand, feature craig thanks, Clayton, and I think this is great. I think this is. This is wonderful. So my comment is not going to dilute anything about the youth lakes because clearly doing this for youth leagues was the priority most important out of anybody, but we do have representatives from Speaker Johnson's office and the borough president's office on the line tonight, and I would just encourage them to look into the adult leagues as well and expand to that, because I've gotten a lot of feedback from the adult leagues who have been trying and working trying to get permits for months and been getting the run around and now other people. The youths are, youth are getting it and they're we can. We can socially distance. We know how to do that. We can behave ourselves. I do not think anybody is as begrudged at the youth that the kids have gotten at first, because that is clearly the most important area, but I do encourage the elected officials to push for the adult leagues as well, because there are a number of them and getting out and getting fresh air is, I think, helpful, I think, everybody's getting a little cabin fever, so I would encourage that as well. But again, I think this is great, that you know Kim's work and Kevin's work. I think that's absolutely wonderful for the kids and for the city itself. Thank you, craig any other input or questions from members of the committee before we open more to members of the public. Yes, we're hearing from Meredith Berkowitz that the West Side Soccer League, also 100, agrees that the organized sports for adults in an organized way in a safe way is important. Thank you Meredith, and I think we also have okay. If you have a question or comment, Zelda G, you are muted hi. Can you hear me? Yes, hi everyone? Thank you so much it's really. It really is extraordinary to be with a group of people who are aligned in the commitment that you are aligned with and thank you so my name is Zelda Gay, I'm the president of Chemical karate. We run a karate school on Fifth avenue between on 18th street between fifth and sixth avenue, and we are not a large organization we and we do make a profound difference for our community of adults and children, and we have moved into the parks as much as possible and we're wondering you know. I appreciate that obviously there's power in numbers and that and that these larger leagues have been able to get permits and I'm wondering like what the process will be for we're. Not a sport. Technically karate is somewhere in the physical fitness art world and we're not a gym and we've been closed because you know we believe in doing our part. Despite that, you know there are many schools in the city that have not closed as per kind of extra. You know trying to deal with that loophole, and so I guess my question is what do ours? What do our smaller entities do in regards to obtaining permits? And or you know, we've tried open streets we've like there's everywhere we go, we seem to hit some kind of a wall, and so I guess my question really just is like. If you were me, and you were really standing for the value of martial arts and of your community being outdoors as much as possible, what Avenue would you take and any idea, because we can't apply for a permit currently because we're not one of the Youth League sports, so any advice would be really thoroughly appreciated. Well, thank you so much zelda for the question and the input. This is one of the reasons why, when the circumstances had not yet changed, we wanted to be able to have the parks Department here to answer questions. I'm sure they would be happy to work with you to answer those questions but Aya Luke, who is works in the board office who's on the call tonight Luke. I would want to make sure you have Zelda's information from her registration and tomorrow. If you can email her and cc me and Kim, I would love to just make sure we can connect her with somebody. There who can actually help address that with more specificity. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Thank you. Luke there is and Meredith also put in the chat there. You could also apply for a special event permit. If the sports permits on a ladder, though I think that also is not currently allowed yeah I mean it would be. One of the things is that we're looking to have an ongoing opportunity, especially for our or you know, as we move indoors we're still in that kind of we're, not sure area how that's going to work, and so we are looking to provide a little consistency for not only our community, but anyone who might be interested in training in martial arts newly, and so yes, but thank you that's certainly the avenue we'll take. Thank you so much permit. That's what she said. That's what she suggested, although I think that's also disallowed at the moment. Okay, thank you so much, but we will follow up with you zelda thanks, so much any further comments or questions from members of the committee. If not, we will move on with our agenda all right, seeing none Kevin. I want to thank you again so much for coming tonight and for your help and advocacy and we look forward to staying in touch. Thank you. Thank you all right. Second, on the agenda. Yes Clayton! So sorry, I just was wondering if we could maybe give Meredith the opportunity to say a couple of words. She was highly instrumental in making the in the reversal of permitting as well and of course, is chiming in with all these great tips, and so we're really right now. I actually did not put two and two together that Meredith was this Meredith apologize for that meredith. If you'd like to say a few words we'd be very happy to hear, I'm not seeing her on the call right now, maybe I missed my chance and she she's from phone. She can press star nine to raise her hand yeah. Her name is no longer here. Well, my apologies for that no worries. I will drop her a line and let her know how grateful we are. Okay. Thank you. So much Meredith Berkowitz Zelda asked all right. Moving on to our second agenda item. We were all quite thrilled and somewhat surprised to see the municipal art Society's press release a couple of weeks ago about the proposed creation of a position of the director of public realm. This is something that has occurred in other cities and Mike Quebec. I have to give you props. You were the first person from whom I learned about this. I love my committee members, always forwarding me juicy late- breaking news about public spaces, but in short order many people on our board were chatting about this, so we were excited to invite them to come and speak about the proposal and to hear about it and to give whatever input or questions we might have as this as this. Hopefully, this process continues to develop. So I want to welcome from municipal arts society we have Stephen Albanese, Tara, Kelly and Spencer Williams and from new yorkers for parks. We have Lucy Robson, so I'm so thrilled to have you all here and I will leave it to you to determine who speaks first right. I think I am kicking us off. I'm Lucy Robson from New Yorkers for parks been working closely with the team at municipal art society on this project, so Stephen is going to be working on sharing our slide deck. We have. We brought a visual aid to talk you through the history of our project. Very briefly, we'll take you through sort of the nuts and bolts of what we call for in the research brief. The policy brief and talk you through some of what is available for you to do right now and where we think this work may go, but we're very interested in your questions. So thank you Clayton for having us. We are really excited to talk about this. We think this is a practical solution, not the only solution but a practical solution among many for two many issues that we all know affect the public realm in New, York, City, so Stephen. If you want to use, can you see my screen? I can see it. I hope everyone else can yes, great. Okay, I will advance the slides great, so our joint project is called fight for light and we've been working together for almost two years. At this point on trying to understand in technical terms why sunlight is so important to our lives as new Yorkers to city life in general and how to quantify and qualify what we have, what we need and what are our opportunities to protect that, and so we we've really cast a wide net in looking at health research and looking at architectural specifications and looking at engineering work and trying to distill what we have together. So we've collaborated on this, and we are now at the point where we are coming we're testing what those solutions might be so steven. Thank you. The recent policy brief education mentioned. It elaborates on some of the ideas that we proposed in a report that we did last year and does call for creating a new city role, which is the director of the public realm, and so we in you know in brief. As it's a brief we've presented, you know what we think this person should be able to do where we think it makes the most sense for it to function in terms of city agencies and various powers and what resources that person needs. In order to be successful- and so I want to take a moment to get us all on the same page and what we're talking about when we say public realm, I know that you guys deal with this every month in your meetings, but it's useful to have the same terminology when this project, when fight for fight for light talks about the public realm, we're talking about the 40 of New York City's land, which is streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts parks. You know it goes all the way to community gardens and privately owned public spaces, and I think that my colleagues later on are going to talk through, like the governance side of that and the fact that when it comes together, it's really just a big mess. There's no one person other than the mayor who gets a say in what happens with the public realm right now, and so that's one of the things that we've diagnosed as an issue that could use a solution and then what we know really crucially right now is just how critical the public realm our open spaces are to our life. I think that new Yorkers generally have had a healthy appreciation from everything from the smallest piece of sunny sidewalk on a cold winter's day to you know the expanse of the great lawn, but the pandemic has certainly thrown into high relief the fact that these are pieces of critical infrastructure. You know when we're talking about reinstating a permitting process for youth sports and adult sports, we're talking about pieces that are just integral to the way that we live life both for our health and also for the exercising of our first amendment rights, we've seen in New, York City, not just parks, but our streets, our sidewalks, our plazas, get used for assembly and speech, and that's something that we believe is also critically important to the way that we function. So here I'm going to take a step back, I'm going to pass off to my colleague, spencer, who will take us through the next section, hello, everybody good evening, thanks again for having us, you know it's clear that New York City sort of needs, this role in the city we currently, if you go to the we have a lot of specific specification in the public realm we'd lack a sort of central organizing function. This is only a sampling of some of the many organizations that have some role of responsibility within the public realm. So we give oversight of these essential pieces to a vast array of agencies, which can sometimes mean collaboration. Consistency and ease can also become really difficult. We see that from everywhere from trees to permitting that you have to involve and interact with several different agencies to sort of have one consistent use in the public realm that you may not know readily, and so you start down a permitting process and then all of a sudden you're talking to three or four different agencies. It should be a lot more simple than that to be able to think holistically. Certainly now we see that as the demand for public space increases, all these different people from businesses to schools are looking to permit into the public realm to continue to sort of have some similance of everyday life, and so I think this role speaks to that need consistently, and so that's evident in our public spaces in a very general way, it's much more complex than this diagram even shows. But as an example, you know our playgrounds can be governed by parks or the Department of Education, or in some cases NYCHA. Our plazas can be parks or department of transportation. Our privately owned public spaces that are at the basis of many of the buildings, can either be operated by the private sector by the Department of City Planning Department of buildings. These kind of overlapping regulatory and operation responsibilities can make it really complicated to have a cohesive sense of the public realm. It can be a really big obstacle to being creative around how to sort of support uses acrosss these different spaces, because what we want to do is actually have a seamless public realm that can be coordinated and facilitated to create these really unique experiences that both allow for movement of people and goods, but also serve this real place, function that supports New, York, City's, neighborhoods businesses and to really be a thriving place. So, in addition to all of those things, we have the sort of inequitable distribution of open space to begin with. Not everyone is sort of starting at the same place in New, York City and there's not the same protections acrosss different places within the public realm. This leads to sort of in this current space when we look at open streets and some of the other programs that have been considered, those state programs have been really helpful, but they have not actually been able to overcome the inequities that are existing pre- existing in the park system and so neighborhoods that had poor access previously continue to have poor access in the macro. We also do not have any real coordinated goal setting for sunlight access and so because no one's really thinking about access to sunlight in the public realm. Those departments, Department of Transportation, is really thinking about how people are moving throughout that space parks is thinking about. Recreation, DCP and department of buildings are really thinking about the private realm, and so really thinking about how all those things can come together to create a really rich public environment with access to sunlight. That means, then, that people can play party operate their businesses throughout the year comfortably, especially when we think about into the winter months, access to sunlight for the ability of outdoor dining and some of these other outdoor uses that extra 10 to 15 degrees that it feels like when you feel the sun in your face, is really going to extend the life and the usefulness of those public spaces. At the same time, sunlight really is not captured in New York City's planning processes, and so we do not see it sort of thought of consistently from beginning to end and as a result, those sort of impacts are not captured and are not mitigated in our environmental review processes, and so at Mas. We've seen this in a number of projects, acrosss the city and which sometimes there's found to be a sunlight impact, but it's discounted because it's not the growing season or it's during the winter months, and so we think that those are really viable times to for people to gather as well, and we need to be more nuanced about really capturing the value of sunlight as we're considering projects and sort of. Lastly, the gap that this one of the gaps of this field could fill is that you know many of these agencies are underfunded. There are disorganized operations and oftentimes. There may be multiple projects that are happening within the public realm sort of over the course of the year couple of years. I certainly have friends that operate businesses in Brooklyn that have you know, can attest to having a road crew on in front of their business for four years, doing multiple different things, so they tore up the road once to put in new sewer. They had to come back and do the sidewalk, and so it had that been coordinated. Sometimes those impacts can be minimized, but also the sort of cost structure of those things can be much more advantageous to do more with less and to coordinate acrosss different staff and different departments. And so you know, we've taken a look at a couple of the other cities around the world, some of our pure cities, to really get a sense of how this position and role could function in New, York City, with a special focus on the sort of sunlight aspect of it. And so it's important to note in the that New York City is doing some really great things. Our active design guidelines, citywide initiatives like one New York, have really moved some small pieces. There's been some really amazing, but limited department level. Efforts like department of parks, has really tried to address park gap access, we've seen recent legislation around sort of access to sunlight for buildings and the commitment to solar and green roofs to really change and shift sort of the thermal environment of our urban spaces, and we've seen you know, coalitions like play fair, which is led by new Yorkers for parks, lead budgetary efforts to really make sure that our parks are well funded so that they can be maintained, well, loved and well used. But we still need to do more and so looking to other cities. As an example, the city of Boston has a public realm director that works primarily on people- oriented projects, they're looking at sort of streets and sidewalks, and that experience that's a really great focus to think about activating that area of the public realm. But the lesson I think that we learn from Boston is that there's so much more that role or that position could do. Mexico city established a public space authority that sort of had a broader view that was looking about the sort of holistic quality of urban life and wanting to really encourage sort of pro social spaces, and so that sort of that expansion beyond the street and sidewalk to think about more interactions between buildings and spaces was a really important step. However, they did not embed this sort of role or this office into their charter or into city government, and so in 2019, when there was a sort of governmental overhaul. This agency, this authority was disbanded, and so that's a sort of cautionary tale that what we need to do in New York needs to be really rooted and have some teeth to make sure that it sort of can last administration to administration in the city of Seattle. Their outside citywide initiative is being undertaken by the office of planning and community development, which is a mayoral office that was established, and I believe in 2015, in the city of Seattle, through a mayor executive order. That office takes staff from different departments around the city to do sort of coordinated planning and outreach and engagement on big city level. Things like their city's comprehensive plan, as well as doing a lot of the outreach and engagement for other departments like their departments of transportation, environmental services, those types of projects, so this project is, I think, a really great output of that in terms of what that kind of city- wide thinking can produce. This effort out outside citywide is really looking at equitable access to outdoor space and so they're. Looking cross- agency city- wide to have a coordinated sort of plan to map, identify and then sort of strategically invest in reducing those inequities that they see in terms of park, access both for parks and plazas, but also for some of the uses that are in those spaces and so thinking about not just is there a park, but is there a playground? Is there a hard court? How can everyone in the city of Seattle sort of have access to these things, citing that sort of outside city life is really critical to a growing densifying city? And then? Lastly, you know last week, a couple weeks ago, we had a conversation with Christopher Hawthorne who's, the chief design officer for the city of Los Angeles. It's an also recently created position to sort of uplift, the design quality of the built environment and thinking a lot about shade and cultural heritage and how sort of the city spaces can really ground and root the sort of city's culture fortunate to learn that this type of position can really have a critical role in being a public advocate for the public realm and so really learning from Los Angeles. Is that the ability for that position to convene conversations to have ideas and initiatives that are sort of directive, while still maintaining the sort of interagency conversations below? That is a really critical sort of dual role, and so what we need is to see someone who has that ability to both put out a bold idea and agenda, but also support and enhance the sort of specialization and expertise of all those myriad of interagency sort of expertise and collaboration. So now I'm going to hand it off to my colleague Stephen thanks Spencer. Can you all hear me okay, so I'm going to briefly go over potential responsibilities for the director, the keys to the director's success and our recommendation for the positions placement within city government. So one of the immediate tasks for the director would be to inventory the various entities whose work directly affects the public realm. This would allow the director to identify areas that are disputed or poorly managed and to help designate responsibility. When authority is unclear, we foresee the director leading and implementing public realm design management, envisioning efforts, acrosss departments, and to facilitate this. The director could convene a public realm cabinet comprising members of different agencies. We also believe that the position should have a direct role in the city budget process, including the potential to coordinate groups like the east, Midtown, public realm improvement fund and the establishment of similar funds in other districts. So, in terms of research, the director's work has to be guided by a comprehensive understanding of public realm needs, including sunlight access and Mas, is currently undertaking two mapping assessments to to help inform this. The first is a baseline assessment of sunlight availability so that we can better understand where sunlight is abundant and where it may be at risk, and the second is a social vulnerability assessment to identify vulnerable populations, for whom protecting sunlight in open space is most critical to social and health outcomes. So the director could regularly update these assessments as public maps in order to guide policy decisions, and certainly obviously, this understanding of needs also can't be done without significant engagement and partnership with community boards, elected officials, city agencies and other stakeholders. So the the director could create a public realm plan for the city to ensure that there's one long- term vision among agencies and that investments are distributed fairly and efficiently, and they could also certainly create a sunlight strategic plan as a component of the public realm plan. So we've also raised the possibility of creating a sunlight rating system for buildings that takes into consideration a building's impact on public spaces. This could certainly be integrated into existing systems like Leed or well, or you know, could take the form of something like a local law. So the director could also work with the mayor's office of environmental coordination to update evaluation criteria in the seeker, Technical Manual for shadows and open space, which is something that we've been calling for a long time and it's another sort of effort that we're undertaking and we'll have more information on that in the coming months. But in general we really think that many of our ideas can be piloted on a smaller scale. You know, for example, things like special districts or incentives and things like net new shadow laws and, lastly, the director. In light of this new reality and what we've learned. We really think that the director should work acrosss agencies to formulate plans that address a range of public space access scenarios in the event of crises like Covid-19.. You know, I think what we've learned is that the director should really be able to mobilize to repurpose streets for passive recreation, for example, without significant bureaucracy or creating a burden on other emergency priorities, and we've also outlined some monitoring and review functions like advising and making recommendations on the open space components and shadow impacts of major projects like neighborhood rezonings, and I think a key part of this is is working to ensure accountability for the public realm commitments that are that are made, but sometimes not upheld. And finally, the director could work with community boards, SBS bids pops and other entities to expand permitting to help enliven the public realm, and we took a cue from London in outlining the potential for the establishment of a commission focused on diversity in the public realm. In this case, London was striving to ensure that their monuments reflected a variety of perspectives and and backgrounds of the of the residents. So now, I'll briefly, take you through the keys to the director's success in our in our view and the position's potential location within city government. So we see the director's role is providing guidance, vision and directive in not imposing strict control, and you know this will certainly require collaborative relations. Acrosss all facets of government, including the mayor, the City Council Cpc Borough presidents, community boards, like yours and Spencer, has mentioned the commissioners of different agencies. It's critical that the director engage deeply the community on their public realm challenges and visions, so that investment meets local needs. You know we're talking broadly about the public realm, but we know that it the makeup of the public realm and what is desired. Acrosss New, York, City's neighborhoods varies significantly now. We also recognize that buy- in from the various professional organizations is critical, as is providing the director with sufficient and highly skilled support staff. And, finally, the director really has to be equipped with the the financial resources to be able to carry out these functions that we've outlined, and you know I think we all feel that they should be able to work with communities to prioritize how funds are spent as part of the participatory budgeting process. So our research explored several locations within the city- wide organizational chart where the position could be housed, including the possibility of creating a new department of the public realm, an affair, an affiliated board or commission, or a new deputy public advocate. But given the responsibilities and requirements for the position, we really came to the conclusion that the director is most likely to be most effective within the mayor's office and the position could take one of several forms. In the brief you know, we've identified the potential for a deputy mayor, you know, London has more of a chief or a czar, it could also reside within you know an existing mayoral office like policy and planning, or even a new mayor's office of the public realm and the you know. The director's success is obviously determined by their ability to work effectively acrosss departments, and that was really why we felt like the mayor's office was critical, and you know, a big challenge is ensuring that the continuity of a mayoral position and its priorities can continues acrosss administrations. You know, as Spencer cited the example earlier from Mexico City, where that agency was just simply disbanded so now I'll hand it back over to Lucy to to wrap things up thanks steven yeah, we want to let you know what you as community board members as individuals, as representatives of various organizations, can do to help us make this happen. This is this is long term, so Stephen. Thank you. There are three things that you can do to support. The fight for lights. Call to action on the director of the public. Realm first is going to Mas.Org Ffl there. You can send a message to your council member to let them know that this is something that you think they should spend some time. Thinking about, you can read and share our policy brief, which is also you can find from the same link, and you can sign up to receive information about how we're going to keep this going in the future. We know that next year is a really big year for New York City in terms of elections, candidates running for office. We would like this to be something that comes up during that process, that you know, candidates for major citywide office have an opinion on talk with us about make a commitment to so we I believe we have some time for questions. I do want to check in Clayton to see how much time we can take up, but thanks all again for listening to this overview. We appreciate it. Thank you so much all of you, it's comprehensive and it's thoughtful, and it's exciting. I explained to these guys on the phone last week that we on the community Board and on this committee in particular, are so incredibly well versed in the frustration of the Alphabet soup, of the many acronyms of the many agencies, and actually it was after our last orientation just recently that Miriam berman who's here with us tonight he's our public member on the committee emailed and said you know, feedback about the orientation could, is it possible just put together a cheat sheet of the acronyms? You know we we're used to it and we hear a lot about it, but it's it can be a little over confusing. I thought that is such a great idea. I took it to our executive committee and all the other committee chairs to drop into a google a shared Google doc. What I thought was you guys just off the top of your head, like what are the acronyms that you traffic in most often with your well, the document became so the albatross of this acronym document would be hilarious if it were not so totally maddening and it reveals how much we it. You know, there's no accident that it can be so confusing, because there are dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of entities each with different slices and each with different mandates. So I speak for the committee, although I would love to hear everyone's questions and comments and input just that the conversation is refreshing. I mean I really hope this ends up happening in the best possible way that it can personally, but I also just think that for New, York City's sake and for the public benefit, it is way overdue and should have been a part of the organizing principle of the city. From the beginning, the net shadows, the net shadow thing is, I hope we can also have this conversation at our land. Use Committee, the chair, Leia Lagacico, has been passionate about the shadow impact on our city and we're seeing that come up again now, with the governor's proposals for 33, far towers at Penn station. You know these issues are only becoming exponentially larger and more impactful for us all. So I would love to just open the floor to my committee members and see what questions you might have for these guys. What input you know, I'd love to help us move the ball along and bring things up that from our experience. That might be helpful for them to consider as they move things forward. So anybody who has any anything to add or contribute feel free to raise your hand using the raised hand feature, and while we wait to see we do have representatives from state Senator, Brad, Hoyleman's office, Gail, Brewer's, Manhattanvir, President's office and Speaker Corey Johnson, so we're thrilled to have them here as well and hope that you agree that that this position is a brilliant idea. We also have members of the public in attendance who, I'm sure might want to weigh in as well so you'll have your chance. Anyone from the committee yeah Todd hi, so I support your efforts and the sunlight is obviously one example of something that needs city-, wide planning and somebody to crack heads and make sure all these agencies or the mayor really and the governor, even so that they think in terms of the city overall, but I'm just thinking of practical issues that have come up in our own experience as a community board. I know that we, when we were putting together information for the Broadway task force for psql the actual use of the public spaces. You know what is the foot traffic on the sidewalks? What is the foot traffic on the side streets? What is the foot traffic on the public plazas and the pops? I mean, if you think about it, you know what that information resides among all these different agencies, and it would seem to me that you know there were. There were many issues like that would benefit from a public realm, commissioner or deputy mayor. That would ride hurt over these things, so I'm sure we can think of other examples, but I mean, if I had, if we had to find out well who keeps track of the foot traffic on the sidewalks and the public plazas and inside the subway stops and the bus stations. I mean it's in all these different organizations and nobody's thinking about the city as a unified hole and that's all part of what I think you're saying the public realm so do not stop at the sunlight. There's all these other areas, thanks todd, actually just a quick, follow- up kind of question for you guys to that end with all the competing authorities that govern a lot of these spaces, a mayoral office position. I understand the logic, and I also hear you that it undoubtedly sounds like the most doable thing. I do have questions and concerns about the power of that office. The transparency of that office, the who holds that office accountable our most robust experience with a mayoral office when it comes to public space, is CECM and SAPO. The street activity permit office, which is most people, think of it. As a city agency, but it is not, and as it is a mayoral office, we have come up against a lot of problems and challenges with that. So I guess one question I have for you just generally is: how does a mayoral office have the authority to do more than just coordinate but actually affect meaningful change over all these different jurisdictions and on the other side of the coin? What if we had a director of public realm, who was nefarious and wanted to destroy the public realm? What is the accountability and what is what procedures might be part of this proposal about how the public sees what's going on with this office? I I'll take first in terms of one of the roles that I think this position could do in terms of you know what impact can they have on the public in a positive light? I do think that, having a voice for the public realm on the mayor's side when it comes to the budget and determining resourcing the alphabet soup of agencies, that's something which I think is sorely needed. You know, as I think you guys especially have a you- have a keen understanding of the fact that, when you step from the street bed to the curb you're, changing jurisdictions of who looks after that space, but most new yorkers when they walk around just you know who would know who would know unless you participate in these types of discussions and so to have someone in the mayor's office who can get into that person's year, because the butt I mean the budget for the Parks Department in particular, is very complicated. And I do a lot of my work on that. But that's something that I think particularly we're lacking the perspective on the public realm when it comes to resourcing the pieces that need to work well with each other. I unfortunately do not have a great answer to what do we do if we have a rogue director of the public realm? Who wants to do it, but I would say that it's 40 of the land it's going to take them a while to really do something terrible to it. I mean also I did not. I do not really think that would ever happen, but just as far as you know, unlike city agencies, mayoral offices just have a lot of discretion and not necessarily any transparency. So one thing I think that we would just want to be interested in is baking in somehow to the creation of this office. A mandate SAPO says they can not have a mandate like the charter prohibits them. I do not know, but they can't do it. I think that any public position or any public entity or department or anything any type of city entity that serves the public, has to be able to claim the authority to act in the interests of the public. I mean my god, it seems very obvious, but I would just hope that the language around the creation of this position would something about this would be baked into it. I just want to add, I think one of the sort of strategic aspects of this that's important for us is that is to make this part of a campaign conversation so that some of that accountability comes into play with who we elect for office and who we're thinking about re- electing in the future. So there is a there is a bit of a duty on our part to as citizens and as advocates and stakeholders to demand that kind of transparency and accountability in what we're asking to be enacted, and then to continue to follow up on that. So I think you know there is no. We looked at a lot of different ways to enact this position and I think there is no real, truly perfect solution. This is sort of as best as we got so far, but we're glad to be talking to you about ways that we can make it better, and so, if you know you continue to have thoughts on this on this call in this meeting or want to follow up with us afterwards with with further refinement of ideas, we're glad to hear it. Thank you. So much Tara Dave has a question Dave before you ask it. I also just want to address Sam dropped, a question into the chat asking if this warrants a resolution of support, I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts, my gut feeling, based on our prior procedures with things like this- is that, since this is kind of in the early stages and is also a little bit of a well movement, might be a strong term, but a campaign, a resolution of support might seem a little early, but I certainly think that weighing in a supportive way would be important and critical. So if that's in the form of a letter, I would be totally open as to who that letter goes to. But I think a letter or a position statement might be a little bit more relevant than a resolution of support at this at this point. But I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts and dave. Yes, certainly the land, Use Committee is going to be very interested in this. I want to lend my support to this off the bat I think for the last 30 or 40 years. The real estate industry, especially here in Manhattan, has controlled our whole life. They've denigrated the quality of life and affected every part of the city for museums, galleries, colleges, universities, schools, concert, halls parks and landmarks have all been negatively affected by the control of the real estate industry over this city and to see an agency like this. That would be able to give a little push back on the out of control real estate development. That's going on, I'm all for it and anything I can do to help I'm going to be there. So thank you and actually to Dave's point. Another question that did come up was well with the private realm, so to speak. Pops is the main thing that comes to mind, but there's other ways that this would intersect with private interests, and I'm just curious to hear a little bit more about how you would propose that. I would imagine there could be some real kind of conflicts there and how would you propose that the creation of the position does not in itself become kind of a anti- private rallying cry for those who might take that argument? I'll? Just say using your example of pops, that is private space, but it is regulated by city planning and enforced by the Department of buildings, and I think that shows an example of where the sort of siloed departmental missions do not line up and where we would hope that somebody who coordinates between these would understand how better to help DOB to enforce what Dcp's rules are, whether that's through training or just prioritizing it within that agency. So that's just an example where we see that the coordination is something that's really important and is lacking at this point. Thank you. Any other questions comments input from members of the committee. I also want to ask if there are members of the public or representatives of the electeds, who would like to ask any questions or weigh in if you're joining from a phone, you can press star 9.. Thank you, luke, director of the zoom realm. It does not look like we have any raised hands at the moment. We certainly look forward to learning more about this process as it continues and, frankly, I'm excited about all the possible dorky minutiae conversations that could be had about how you solve what happens when a kiosk is on the plaza versus in a shared street or event permitting fees for a park versus a plaza. I mean all the things that we have been banging our heads against brick walls for years and making some progress too. I think that now is the time, and one thing that can be said about this crazy year is that it has allowed many of us to think much more creatively and structurally about systems and about solutions and about having the courage and the will and the patience to enact changes to them and to make progress, and I think that we're all really dedicated to that. So, if no one has any further input, you know I'll ask you guys. If you have anything else, you want to say to wrap up. I just want to thank you again for your time and also encourage you to think about places where you can lift up this conversation as well. So in your sort of annual program priorities for the budget and sort of thinking about calling out specifically the public realm is one avenue for you, as a group of individuals to raise the profile of this in your community district needs assessment process as well. That's a really great way to sort of call out the public realm as a sort of umbrella and then go into all the different aspects of the public realm instead of just thinking about parks. Thinking about including sunlight on your district needs assessment, saying our district needs. Sun, and here are the places where we get it here are the places where we think it's at risk. That is a really concrete way for you all in the sort of established place that you have as community board, to really uplift this using your own voice, without necessarily calling on electives or other folks to sort of put it into the conversation. So I would encourage you very strongly to if you're interested to take each one of those opportunities to really own and champion this at the community board level as well. Thank you, that's very helpful and I think for our committee's point. I think right now just a simple vote of acclimation, which you guys can just like, raise your hands and your zoom screens to to have a position of support and principle of the creation of this position. If there are any naysayers, please be known, and if you have any questions accordingly, please ask them and vicki you have your hand raised. I do I wanted to ask, and you all know how I am a firm believer of strength in numbers. So have you met with any other community boards yet and if you have not, I suggest this should be. This should go to every community board and I would like to see it ultimately go to borough board for an overall combined effort on all of the community boards, as we usually do on an issue such as this is fabulous. Have you been to other boards? Yet we have not yet this this just came out and we were very excited to be able to speak to you guys so quickly about this. We are, you know we would love to engage with the other community boards and take this even to the to the borough board. So yes, absolutely. I do want to also add that we're going to have as we meet you know in the coming months with other stakeholders we're going to have more information about the needs of sunlight in the city, about where vulnerable populations are. We're. Also we're continuing to refine some of these ideas and going into more specific recommendations about the types of planning and policy tools that you know that can be used to lead to a more livable public realm, with a particular focus on sunlight, which we know is you know such a critical issue in your in your board, but yeah we would love to continue to engage. Thank you so much. I think vicky we'll be having conversations, I think with the other committee chairs too about where else we might have this conversation, because I mean it really applies to every single committee. It's. It was most relevant to hear you guys here, but when you think about it, there's nothing that we touch and talk about that would not be affected by this position, which tells you something about the importance of the position. So with that we have corralled support for this committee, but I am, I will be having conversations with our chair about what else we might do to strengthen that further. Well, I'll, just sorry to interrupt you, I just wanted to add. We very much appreciate the suggestion to be in touch with all of our community boards, but I do want to emphasize for you all. We are a small but mighty team. This is this is fight for light right here. So this is the director of the public realm team here. So we can really use your help in spreading the word and in connecting with the other boards and with the borough president's office in each of the boroughs, so any connections any way that you can sort of help us pave the way towards getting this done. We really appreciate. Well, I will bring it up at the Nexboro board meeting, which will be the 17th of September. What should I tell chairs of the boards? How should they connect with you? Is there someone in particular or just connect, without Mas or with the other organization? Okay, with you Spencer, will you put your email in the chat? Thank you, okay, great there. It is wonderful, all right well, barring any further questions or comments from committee members or members of the public. I think that we can wrap this up and thank you so much for your insights and your presence tonight and your advocacy for this, and we can't wait to see how it evolves and to help it evolve. Thank you. Thank you so much and thank you that is it for our agenda tonight. Unless any committee members have any new world business you'd like to address, I promise you Miriam's, acronym document will be coming. I just wanted to try to do a little bit of triage on it, so that it does not just shut you down the second that you open it. I might divvy it up into committees, so that you'll see the agencies that we actually work with the most et cetera and that'll. Be it thanks. Everyone thanks for a great meeting, and we will see you at full board next week. Okay, thank you. Everybody good night.
