Do we need to know about the shifting data as to how the parks department is going to continue to evaluate permits moving forward so from what we know I, think the third week of september is when they'll start to open those permits.
We did hear that and one of the major issues that we were concerned about was access for the youth and for these programs, and that was the last time that we kind of heard from them, and I think that we all on this committee and on this board, certainly would be interested in doing whatever we can to strengthen those relationships and further.
My committee members, always forwarding me juicy late-breaking news about public spaces, but in short order many people on our board were chatting about this, so we were excited to invite them to come and speak about the proposal and to hear about it and to give whatever input or questions we might have.
We think this is a practical solution, not the only solution, but a practical solution among many for two many issues that we all know affect the public realm in new york, city.
This point on trying to understand in technical terms why sunlight is so important to our lives as new yorkers to city life in general and how to quantify and qualify what we have, what we need and what are our opportunities to protect that, So we we've really cast a wide net in looking at health research and looking at architectural specifications and looking at engineering work and trying to distill what we have together.
It, elaborates on some of the ideas that we proposed in a report that we did last year and does call for creating a new city role, which is the director of the public realm.
You know what we think this person should be able to do where we think it makes the most sense for it to function in terms of city agencies and various powers and what resources that person needs in order to be successful, and so I want to take a moment to get us all on the same page and what we're talking about when we say public realm.
But it's useful to have the same terminology when this project, when fight for fight for light talks about the public realm, we're talking about the 40 of new york city's land, which is streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts, parks.
There's, no one person other than the mayor who gets a say in what happens with the public realm right now, and so that's one of the things that we've diagnosed as an issue that could use a solution and then next slide.
We know really crucially right now, is just how critical the public realm our open spaces are to our life.
Rights, we've seen in new york, city, not just parks, but our streets, our sidewalks, our plazas, get used for assembly and speech, and that's something that we believe is also critically important to the way that we function.
All, these different people from businesses to schools are looking to permit into the public realm to continue to sort of have some similance of everyday life, and so I think this role speaks to that need consistently.
Next slide, and So that's evident in our public spaces in a very general way, You know our playgrounds can be governed by parks or the department of education or in some cases, NYCHA.
It can be a really big obstacle to being creative around how to sort of support uses across these different spaces, because what we want to do is actually have a seamless public realm that can be coordinated and facilitated to create these really unique experiences that both allow for movement of people and goods, but also serve this real place, function that supports new york, city's neighborhoods businesses and to really be a thriving place.
Recreation, dcp and department of buildings are really thinking about the private realm, and so really thinking about how all those things can come together to create a really rich public environment, with access to sunlight.
That means, then, that people can play party operate their businesses throughout the year comfortably, especially when we think about into the winter months , access to sunlight for the ability of outdoor dining and some of these other outdoor uses that extra 10 to 15 degrees that it feels like when you feel the sun in your face, is really going to extend the life and the usefulness of those public spaces.
The city of boston next slide has a public realm director that works primarily on people-oriented, projects , they're, looking at sort of streets and sidewalks, and that experience that's a really great focus to think about activating that area of the public.
Mexico city established a public space authority that sort of had a broader view that was looking about the sort of holistic quality of urban life and wanting to really encourage sort of pro social spaces, and so that sort of that expansion beyond the street and sidewalk to think about more interactions between buildings and spaces was a really important step.
We also believe that the position should have a direct role in the city budget process, including the potential to coordinate groups like the east, midtown, public realm improvement fund and the establishment of similar funds in other districts.
The director's work has to be guided by a comprehensive understanding of public realm needs, including sunlight access and mas, is currently undertaking.
We really think that the director should work across agencies to formulate plans that address a range of public space access scenarios in the event of crises like Covid-19, 19.
We would like this to be something that comes up during that process, that you know, candidates for major citywide office have an opinion on talk with us about make a commitment to I explained to these guys on the phone last week that we on the community board and on this committee in particular, are so incredibly well versed in the frustration of the alphabet, soup, of the many acronyms of the many agencies, and actually it was after our last orientation Just recently that miriam berman who's here with us tonight, He's our public member on the committee emailed and said you know, feedback about the orientation.
Who, I'm sure might want to weigh in as well Anyone from the committee So I support your efforts and the sunlight is obviously one example of something that needs city-wide planning and somebody to crack heads and make sure all these agencies or the mayor really and the governor, even so that they think in terms of the city overall, but I'm.
That's something that I think particularly we're lacking the perspective on the public realm when it comes to resourcing the pieces that need to work well with each other.
I, don't really think that would ever happen, but just as far as you know, unlike city, agencies, mayoral offices, just have a lot of discretion and not necessarily any transparency.
