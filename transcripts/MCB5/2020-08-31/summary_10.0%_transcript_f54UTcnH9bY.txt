Neither of these is a voting action item tonight, so normally I would say that none of our positions are official until they are heard at full board a week from thursday, that's not quite as relevant tonight, but anyone who's interested can check out the meeting details on cb5org for our full board meeting a week from thursday night It's, actually a little bit more of a recap, because the circumstances on the ground rapidly shifted much to the public benefit, we're thrilled to say, but we still wanted to hear a kind of recap of the of the issue and the circumstances surrounding it and maybe ask questions about moving forward kim On friday, mayor de Blasio announced a reversal on the city park.
I spoke with people from the psal, the public school athletic league today, and they are asking about different permits, so the situation literally changes every day, but the most significant thing is that, from the perspective of this coalition is that now there is Now. The adult leagues are concerned the psal now that they know that these fields are open and they use them have been interacting, and what is it that we might be able to do to help further our advocacy and help support these organizations?
My committee members always forwarding me juicy late-breaking news about public spaces, but in short order many people on our board were chatting about this, so we were excited to invite them to come and speak about the proposal and to hear about it and to give whatever input or questions we might have as this as this So I want to welcome from municipal arts, society and I will leave it to you to determine who speaks first right been working closely with the team at municipal art society on this project.
The public realm in new york city, Okay I, will advance the slides great, so our joint project is called fight for light and we've been working together for almost two years At. This point on trying to understand in technical terms why sunlight is so important to our lives as new yorkers to city life in general and how to quantify and qualify what we have, what we need and what are our opportunities to protect that, and so we we've really cast a wide net in looking at health research and looking at architectural specifications and looking at engineering work and trying to distill what we have together.
You know what we think this person should be able to do where we think it makes the most sense for it to function in terms of city agencies and various powers and what resources that person needs in order to be successful, and so I want to take a moment to get us all on the same page and what we're talking about when we say public realm But it's useful to have the same terminology when this project.
When fight for fight for light talks about the public realm, we're talking about the 40 of new york city's land, which is streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts parks, You know it goes all the way to community gardens and privately owned public spaces There's, no one person other than the mayor who gets a say in what happens with the public realm right now, and so that's one of the things that we've diagnosed as an issue that could use a solution and then next slide.
The fact that these are pieces of critical infrastructure You know when we're talking about reinstating a permitting process for youth sports and adult sports, we're talking about pieces that are just integral to the way that we live life both for our health and also for the exercising of our first amendment rights, we've seen in new york city, not just parks, but our streets, our sidewalks, our plazas, get used for assembly and speech, and that's something that we believe is also critically important to the way that we function.
Now we see that as the demand for public space increases All, these different people from businesses to schools are looking to permit into the public realm to continue to sort of have some similance of everyday life, and so I think this role speaks to that need consistently next slide, and so that's evident in our public spaces in a very general way.
It can be a really big obstacle to being creative around how to sort of support uses across these different spaces, because what we want to do is actually have a seamless public realm that can be coordinated and facilitated to create these really unique experiences that both allow for movement of people and goods, but also serve this real place, function that supports new york, city's neighborhoods businesses and to really be a thriving place next slide, So. In addition to all of those things, we have the sort of inequitable distribution of open space to begin with Not, everyone is sort of starting at the same place in new york city and there's not the same protections across different places within the public.
Efforts, like department of parks, has really tried to address park gap access, we've seen recent legislation around sort of access to sunlight for buildings and the commitment to solar and green roofs to really change and shift sort of the thermal environment of our urban spaces, and we've seen you know, coalitions like play fair, which is led by new yorkers for parks, lead budgetary efforts to really make sure that our parks are well funded so that they can be maintained, well, loved and well used We still need to do more and so looking to other cities as an example, the city of boston next slide has a public realm director that works primarily on people-oriented projects, they're looking at sort of streets and sidewalks, and that experience that's a really great focus to think about activating that area of the public.
We also believe that the position should have a direct role in the city budget process, including the potential to coordinate groups like the east, midtown, public realm improvement fund and the establishment of similar funds in other districts The director's work has to be guided by a comprehensive understanding of public realm needs, including sunlight access and mas, is currently undertaking.
Think a key part of this is is working to ensure accountability for the public realm commitments that are that are made, but sometimes not upheld Finally, the director could work with community boards, sbs bids, pops and other entities to expand permitting to help enliven the public realm, and we took a cue from london in outlining the potential for the establishment of a commission focused on diversity in the public realm So now, I'll briefly, take you through the keys to the director's success in our in our view and the position's potential location within city government We see the director's role is providing guidance, vision and directive in not imposing strict control, and you know this will certainly require collaborative relations across all facets of government, including the mayor, The city council, cpc, borough presidents, community boards, like yours and spencer, has mentioned the commissioners of different agencies, It's critical, that the director engage deeply the community on their public realm challenges and visions, so that investment meets local needs.
We also have members of the public in attendance who I'm sure might want to weigh in as well Anyone from the committee , so I support your efforts and the sunlight is obviously one example of something that needs city-wide planning and somebody to crack heads and make sure all these agencies or the mayor really and the governor, even so that they think in terms of the city overall, but I'm, just thinking of practical issues that have come up in our own experience as a community board.
That's something that I think particularly we're lacking the perspective on the public realm when it comes to resourcing the pieces that need to work well with each other I, unfortunately, don't have a great answer to what do we do if we have a rogue director of the public, Don't really think that would ever happen, but just as far as you know, unlike city agencies, mayoral offices just have a lot of discretion and not necessarily any transparency.
