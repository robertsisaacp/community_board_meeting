My hope is that this is a harbinger for all of our fellow organizations to seek these types of solutions with these types of numbers for sorry for for our kids in New, York City, who need especially now safe places to play and we'll continue, even as we move forward from this.
We did hear that and one of the major issues that we were concerned about was access for the youth and for these programs, and that was the last time that we kind of heard from them, and I think that we all on this committee and on this board, certainly would be interested in doing whatever we can to strengthen those relationships and further our advocacy.
We think this is a practical solution, not the only solution, but a practical solution among many for two many issues that we all know affect the public realm in New, York, City, so Stephen.
This point on trying to understand in technical terms why sunlight is so important to our lives as new Yorkers to city life in general and how to quantify and qualify what we have, what we need and what are our opportunities to protect that, So we we've really cast a wide net in looking at health research and looking at architectural specifications and looking at engineering work and trying to distill what we have together.
It, elaborates on some of the ideas that we proposed in a report that we did last year and does call for creating a new city role, which is the director of the public realm.
But it's useful to have the same terminology when this project, when fight for fight for light talks about the public realm, we're talking about the 40 of New York City's land, which is streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts, parks.
And, then what we know really crucially right now is just how critical the public realm our open spaces are to our life.
Rights, we've seen in New, York City, not just parks, but our streets, our sidewalks, our plazas, get used for assembly and speech, and that's something that we believe is also critically important to the way that we function.
You know it's clear that New York City sort of needs, this role in the city If you go to the we- have a lot of specific specification in the public realm.
Now we see that as the demand for public space increases, all these different people from businesses to schools are looking to permit into the public realm to continue to sort of have some similance of everyday life, and so I think this role speaks to that need consistently, and so that's evident in our public spaces in a very general way, it's much more complex than this diagram, even shows.
It can be a really big obstacle to being creative around how to sort of support uses acrosss these different spaces, because what we want to do is actually have a seamless public realm that can be coordinated and facilitated to create these really unique experiences that both allow for movement of people and goods, but also serve this real place, function that supports New, York, City's, neighborhoods businesses and to really be a thriving place.
Recreation, DCP and department of buildings are really thinking about the private realm, and so really thinking about how all those things can come together to create a really rich public environment, with access to sunlight.
The city of Boston has a public realm director that works primarily on people- oriented, projects, they're, looking at sort of streets and sidewalks, and that experience that's a really great focus to think about activating that area of the public.
Mexico city established a public space authority that sort of had a broader view that was looking about the sort of holistic quality of urban life and wanting to really encourage sort of pro social spaces, and so that sort of that expansion beyond the street and sidewalk to think about more interactions between buildings and spaces was a really important step.
Agency city- wide to have a coordinated sort of plan to map, identify and then sort of strategically invest in reducing those inequities that they see in terms of park, access, both for parks and plazas, but also for some of the uses that are in those spaces and so thinking about Not. Just is there a park, but is there a playground?
It's, an also recently created position to sort of uplift, the design quality of the built environment and thinking a lot about shade and cultural heritage and how sort of the city spaces can really ground and root the sort of city's culture fortunate to learn that this type of position can really have a critical role in being a public advocate for the public realm and so really learning from Los. That is a really critical sort of dual role, and so what we need is to see someone who has that ability to both put out a bold idea and agenda, but also support and enhance the sort of specialization and expertise of all those myriad of interagency sort of expertise and collaboration.
We also believe that the position should have a direct role in the city budget process, including the potential to coordinate groups like the east, Midtown, public realm improvement fund and the establishment of similar funds in other districts.
The director's work has to be guided by a comprehensive understanding of public realm needs, including sunlight access and Mas, is currently undertaking.
We really think that the director should work acrosss agencies to formulate plans that address a range of public space access scenarios in the event of crises like Covid-19.
We see the director's role is providing guidance, vision and directive in not imposing strict, control, and Acrosss all facets of government, including the mayor, the City Council Cpc Borough presidents, community boards, like yours and Spencer, has mentioned the commissioners of different agencies.
Success is obviously determined by their ability to work effectively acrosss departments, and that was really why we felt like the mayor's office was critical, and you know.
We would like this to be something that comes up during that process, that you know, candidates for major citywide office have an opinion on talk with us about make a commitment to I explained to these guys on the phone last week that we on the community Board and on this committee in particular, are so incredibly well versed in the frustration of the Alphabet soup, of the many acronyms of the many agencies, and actually it was after our last orientation Just recently that Miriam berman who's here with us tonight, He's our public member on the committee emailed and said you know, feedback about the orientation.
We also have members of the public in attendance, who, I'm sure might want to weigh in as well Anyone from the committee , so I support your efforts and the sunlight is obviously one example of something that needs city, wide planning and somebody to crack heads and make sure all these agencies or the mayor really and the governor, even so that they think in terms of the city overall, but I'm.
That's something that I think particularly we're lacking the perspective on the public realm when it comes to resourcing the pieces that need to work well with each other.
I do not really think that would ever happen, but just as far as you know, unlike city, agencies, mayoral offices, just have a lot of discretion and not necessarily any transparency.
