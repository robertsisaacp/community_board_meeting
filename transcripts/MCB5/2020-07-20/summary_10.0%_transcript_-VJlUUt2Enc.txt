It looks like in the chat I'm, seeing that one of the attendees is a member of the public that is blind using a talking computer, so I assume if they want to ask a question during that portion of the meeting.
They can help you if you're a committee, member and My name is Leila Lopes echo and The chair of the land use Housing and zoning committee of Manhattan Community Board, fine I am joined by EJ Calif, our skin, who is the chair of the transportation and Environment Committee of cd5, a few words about what is in front of us tonight and how the meeting is going to run.
Thank you so much to all the members panelists and attendees who are joining us tonight, we're going to be discussing the draft scope of work related to the ohio, station, complex project that was published by the governor of the state of New York on July 1st of 2020.
And there's going to be a hearing on the scoping of this proposal on July 20th, so community board 5 needs to establish and develop a position.
We will slice off via the conversation in questions and comments, but mostly you know we're gonna make comments, because you know we don't have a an applicant in the road to actually answer any other specific questions, and Said, I think that it's fair, given you know the transit centric nature of this proposal to pass it on to EJ who is going to lead the conversation on transportation and transit, EJ.
It's basically, you know that this board, that is appointed by the governor, that will have final say on approving the proposal by the governor there's going to be a number of hearings, but obviously the city, elected officials and agencies will not have the role that they would have in Euler.
If you want to maybe start the conversation on the impacts to transit and infrastructure on this particular project, and then we can open up to members as a committee for questions and comments absolutely and before I guess the before I get started into some of the details.
3 train services serve the station in independent concourses, New, Jersey, Transit and Amtrak, and the Long Island Railroad Penn Station used to be a very big grand train station on par with Grand Central before Madison Square Garden was built on top of the site, literally on top of the tracks, as it is today in 1960 and then in the mid sixties.
The positioning of Madison Square Garden, where it is right now directly over the tracks that serve Amtrak and Long Island Railroad, New, Jersey Transit impacts the capabilities of what can be done to continue to increase and improve the capacity.
It Sene clear is that those being in scope would probably very much be required from a practical standpoint for any new tracks to be installed on that site to block there would need to be runway on either side for the simple practical usage of those tracks as new transit capacity for the station.
The context of what the scope makes possible for the garden is going to be very important in terms of considering the capacity and future improvement that is open to not just the aesthetics of being inside Penn Station, but also actually continuing to increase the capacity of Penn Station, which of course, I, said 650,000 commuters.
, Six, seven and site a could be redeveloped as a not just redeveloped here, as is being proposed for new towers or new office space, or whatever is kind of vaguely alluded to in this document so far, but also for a potential new location for the garden that is leaving as many of those options open as possible is one reason why it's somewhat not suspicious, but detrimental for that whole block.
You know with a ceiling higher than 80 going forward, but to actually improve its transit capacity and in future development, creating capacity to move the garden somewhere down the road.
But that, in a nutshell, are kind of all the interconnected implications of why this why some of these project areas seem to be defined the way they are on this map and why I think there's a very strong argument that extending the project area to contain the rest of that block that contains site six is probably something we want to push for very strongly, because it was part of the conversation already and because it's not doing Those are really very critical.
, So I think this is so significant, so important that we gave it its own bucket, but you know it You know that the perimeter of the district that is being proposed for the year the land, whose action it is actually not part of the action, the same way as EJ, explained the transit below grade transportation.
You know that the proposal sponsored by the ESD is a proposal that calls for the relocation of the garden that it is found that it is thought that he not just an alternative, because typically, alternatives are studied their environmental impact study, but that doesn't mean that we're gonna go with the alternative more likely than not, especially in this political context.
That is something that we should raise, because I think that, just having you know an underground long hallway that doesn't provide the opportunity to transfer between those two stations without having to swipe in a second time is just something that I think we should raise, because it's not clear the document and then additionally, in terms of station entrances, I'm sure that a DA accessibility will inevitably be a large part of this scoping.
Ok, I, definitely something that we can add in the scope of the proposal, any other comments or questions we're going to try to really stick to transit and transportation.
If you look closely at you know the way the proposal is structured, the wall really of this redevelopment is to actually provide I.
All we know is that there is a big land use proposal and observing where the governor purchases lands in these areas through eminent domain or negotiation, and then observes these areas, meaning that he basically creates additional allowed density, and he sells this density and through the proceed of this sale, this will finance and fund the below grade.
There is a case to be made given who the stakeholders are, and in this process that you know maybe alternate sources of funding, should actually be considered and that could dramatically change the scope of this proposal.
So I would like to have us consider you know, adding the funding as in part of the scope, and that the scope should basically be revised, because more federal money should be poured into improving Penn Station, rather than you know, creating density that would basically be negatively impacting community about five.
We'll have an opportunity to do that, but what I would like to include is to say you actually have a challenge and the burden is upon you to prove that you need to do this project that it is necessary We believe that you can get money elsewhere and that we community board five should not be hit with the full burden of generating the revenue so that you can do these upgrades that you know I, think everybody agrees that you know.
We need to explain why we believe that funding is part of the scope, and you know it was part of the school because the because it's a public project the entity needs to demonstrate the need.
I mean the main reason is the money, but they also bring in a lot of other what they think would be viable reason for the redevelopment Absolutely The, reality, though, is that you know the governor is not in the business of redeveloping blocks of New York City.
You know direct residential displacement, which actually will happen and is going to be studied and more likely than not will not rise to the level of significance and I will explain that in a moment.
You know some local stores and office space is going to disappear, but You know, influx of commercial real estate in close proximity to others Unless someone has further questions about the funding, I think we can move on to the next bucket, which is going to mediate urban design, historic resources and socio-economic impact.
We will open up the floor to two members of the year of the public and those I see that Dave Achilles has his hand up Dave go ahead, But. Whenever we've seen these huge developments, we've been concerned about hospitals and places for the homeless and around transportation hubs like Madison I like the garden and the Long Island Railroad and Penn Station , there's always a homeless situation and I, don't know if this is a proper place to insert something about our concern.
You currently, you know visual resources, so I think you know we should look into those, but I would love to hear other people's thoughts on the urban design and the impact that that's gonna have Yeah for the incredible amount of GSF on this project.
One thing that I would want to ask is:: how can we try to nail down with more specificity which of our open public spaces, some of which are new york city?
I think we need to say that if indeed, there's gonna be shadows on open space, it has to be mitigated in a significant way, which is basically be massing, the building so that it doesn't cause so much shadows.
Development, such as you know, closing a street beautifying or creating a better sidewalk It is the state taking away property, knocking down buildings, generating and absorbing selling these air rights, and with the money.
I. Think we can ask in the scope that you know the open space study.
Dave Achilles you ever sort of follow up on what EJ had to say in terms of the socio-economic impact of Madison Square Garden, that for the last 50 years, has been home to all of New York City's sports teams, as well as its chief entertainment arena that whether there's going to be an alternative in the proposal or whatever happens to the garden.
You know we is the is the governor and I heard you say that that's not currently in the scope, we're just commenting on the space on the size of it and how it's going to impact.
You know it's basically, a series of huge office, buildings, hotels and commercial space surrounding Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.
Maybe it's maybe we as a community board to make sure that is not over what We totally agree with you and we agree with those kinds, but there would be an opportunity to actually comment on the substance of the proposal itself in the process and the different phases and in the review of a big line, land transaction like this one.
You know what is the environmental impact of this big land-use action and will have an opportunity to comment and hopefully to shape what that will look.
Okay, I see none, so one more area that, on this bucket, that I think is important to discuss, is actually the impact to our historic resources.
We had a interesting conversation this morning with the New York landmarks Conservancy, and they actually have commissioned a survey of all the historic resources that they are currently you know pulling and working on , there's no landmark elates and therefore the impact that basically, they really need to look at.
I know I'm talking a lot, and this might actually come up in the public comment section, but would we be proposing that they look at a situation in which the transit expansion happens on the other side of the Hudson in New, Jersey?
There's talk about the actual project, itself, having an alternative where development happens in New Jersey, instead of happening in midtown, Manhattan I know that that's a separate conversation, but would it be too specific about to ask that they consider a situation in which the fundamental assumptions of this project was before us right now, which are that and station would continue to be the hub of regional commerce of regional transit rather, where that assumption sort of goes away because the development is in fact having is happening in New Jersey.
If the community in New Jersey were in the room and saying you know what we would really like to have this development, and you should actually advocate for that.
When we, when we argue for making sure that moving the garden is in scope and widening the tracks and widening the platforms that I think is within the realm of what we should be arguing for right now, We absolutely could you know or should call for a call for a new park or call for new public space.
When we talk about some capacity for community space, you know How about a you know: museum area dedicated to the history of the original Penn Station.
You know having a meeting place for community board five to have some sort of auditorium space or some area that can be used for that I.
Know, conducive space in the overall design, You know, dreaming, big and asking for both a park, which a thing is that there's a very strong case to be made, as well as the community space You know it's sort of like open recreational area and a enclosed.
Think that asking for a extended boundaries on those aspects makes sense, because you know the pedestrian mass starts way before We have a few people calling in So. If you'd like to speak, you can raise your gun.
And I think the open space analysis definitely needs to take into consideration new dwelling units, both the actual number, that's in the chart on page 15, 630 So, that's interesting, because if indeed they are considering a alternate proposal with residential development, then they do need to study.
