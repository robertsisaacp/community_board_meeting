6 pm we're gonna, give our committee members a little more time to join in Leila I assume you were told that I'll be standing in for Luke, helping manage the what I've been are for this and EJ It looks like in the chat I'm, seeing that one of the attendees is a member of the public that is blind using a talking computer, so I assume if they want to ask a question during that portion of the meeting.
Thank you so much to all the members panelists and attendees who are joining us tonight, we're going to be discussing the draft scope of work related to the ohio station, complex project that was published by the governor of the state of New York on July, 1st of 2020 You know the governor is proposing a big line.
We are reviewing the draft scope of work for the redevelopment of the plantation area that was introduced by the governor There will be a hearing held by the Empire State Development Corporation, which is the entity you know from the state of New York that has jurisdiction over this development and there's going to be a hearing on the scoping of this proposal on July 20th, so community board 5 needs to establish and develop a position on.
They will be in the form of a resolution because we need them to be actionable so that we can present them to this hearing on the yoga xx, and so we will take a vote you to actually stay until the end of this meeting, so that we can take a vote and this will become our official or official position on the scope of work As the members of the community, you have received an email earlier this morning that spells out you know, sort of buckets.
The process is very similar to the Windrun other committee meetings and as well as the full board meeting I'm, not sure I have the same of you as so, as you have on your computers and wait to be recognized before you speak, we will slice off via the conversation in questions and comments, but mostly you know we're gonna make comments, because you know we don't have a an applicant in the road to actually answer any other specific questions, and so, with all of that said, I think that it's fair, given you know the transit centric nature of this proposal to pass it on to EJ who is going to lead the conversation on transportation and transit.
You know rise from you know obviously transit and transportation, but you know also, as I have spelled, that in the email this morning you know socio-economic conditions, population, displacement, business, displacement, urban design, historic resources , Thank you so each if you, if you want to maybe start the conversation on the impacts to transit and infrastructure on this particular project, and then we can open up to members as a committee for questions and comments absolutely and before I guess the before I get started into some of the details.
Similarly Long, Island, Railroad trains come in from Long, Island, load or unload, and then leave back in the same direction through running would enable much higher capacity and much better efficiency by say, allowing those train systems to work together, That's a dramatic simplification, but that's the kind of improvement that, by being able to actually reconfigure the tracks, would dramatically improve the transit capacity of the station So. The context of what the scope makes possible for the garden is going to be very important in terms of considering the capacity and future improvement that is open to not just the aesthetics of being inside Penn Station, but also actually continuing to increase the capacity of Penn Station, which of course, I said 650,000 commuters a day It's already supporting three times the capacity that it was even built for in the 60s With that in mind, I draw your attention to what the map calls site We want to make sure that the scope that we end up with as part of this scoping document and then the environmental impact study leaves as many options open as possible.
, Six, seven and site a could be redeveloped as a not just redeveloped here, as is being proposed for new towers or new office space, or whatever is kind of vaguely alluded to in this document so far, but also for a potential new location for the garden that is leaving as many of those options open as possible is one reason why it's somewhat not suspicious, but detrimental for that whole block That's considered site six on this map to not to be included, and it was in fact outlined fully by the governor's last presentation in January It would seem that there's a very strong argument for saying that a bare minimum, it's kind of stupid to only include half of a block in your environmental assessment, since the other half of the block is going to be inextricably connected to whatever the effects of redevelopment are going to be that full block was included The last time the governor talked about this in January It's already part of that conversation and that a lot of the proposed improvements that Penn Station would truly benefit from not just aesthetically and having a train station.
You know with a ceiling higher than 80 going forward, but to actually improve its transit capacity and, in future development, creating capacity to move the garden somewhere down the road The political will and the financing appears for it would be a very important part of the scoping document.
We have not seen yet, but certainly I totally agree that the implications on the subway should be part of the scope and if we, if we suspect that this is that this map and these sites as identified, are not inclusive of that then Mike The master plan does not at this point, seem to be creating any new subway lines or subway capacity or and to affect local subway transit in any sort of specific way.
We have to be so careful to make sure things are included, because if it's not, we are screwed after the fact My number one red flag is about Madison Square Garden, as you both have alluded to community board I think it was February of 20:13 past the unanimous resolution to recommend not granting a permit in perpetuity for the garden to operate in response to that city council agreed with us and they got a 10-year permit You help me understand just because the block is in scope?
, So I think this is so significant, so important that we gave it its own bucket, but you know it Currently, although it falls within the parameter, you know that the perimeter of the district that is being proposed for the year the land, whose action it is actually not part of the action, the same way as EJ, explained the transit below grade transportation.
The ideal scenario is that in the end, we work closely with you know the different stakeholders, so that the proposal you know gains cv5 support, that's readable, and this is something hopefully that you know we can start to shape now It says in the document that additional public transportation improvements under consideration include creating a below grade, east-west corridor between the 3rd Street 34th Street, Penn Station in one to three lines and the 34th Street Herald Square subway stations, and it doesn't make any suggestion that this would include the creation of a free transfer opportunity between those two stations and That is something that we should raise because I think that, just having you know an underground long hallway that doesn't provide the opportunity to transfer between those two stations without having to swipe in a second time is just something that I think we should raise, because it's not clear the document and then additionally, in terms of station entrances, I'm sure that a DA accessibility will inevitably be a large part of this scoping document.
I, just think that this project should also do more than what could be What I would describe is like the minimum requirements in terms of improving station access, because it seems like there's only going to be perhaps one additional ad entrance created, Ok I, definitely something that we can add in the scope of the proposal, any other comments or questions we're going to try to really stick to transit and transportation.
All we know is that there is a big land use proposal and observing where the governor purchases lands in these areas through eminent domain or negotiation, and then observes these areas, meaning that he basically creates additional allowed density, and he sells this density and through the proceed of this sale, this will finance and fund the below grade improvements, We, sell this density and that you know creates funding So. There is a case to be made given who the stakeholders are, and in this process that you know maybe alternate sources of funding should actually be considered and that could dramatically change the scope of this proposal.
We'll have an opportunity to do that, but what I would like to include is to say you actually have a challenge and the burden is upon you to prove that you need to do this project that it is necessary and we believe that you can get money elsewhere and that we community board five should not be hit with the full burden of generating the revenue so that you can do these upgrades that you know I think everybody agrees that you know Nobody.
Around Penn Station I mean the main reason is the money, but they also bring in a lot of other what they think would be viable reason for the redevelopment Reality, though, is that you know the governor is not in the business of redeveloping blocks of New York City There has to be a broader purpose for the governor to you know, use eminent domain, I mean if the If, the state is the owner and for right of you know particular sites.
You know some local stores and office space is going to disappear, but you know influx of commercial real estate in close proximity to others Unless someone has further questions about the funding, I think we can move on to the next bucket, which is going to mediate urban design, historic resources and socio-economic impact.
If you look at the numbers, the incremental difference between the no action and the action would actually bring the number of additional residential units to basically zero, so they're planning to develop zero residential units- my understanding is that the zoning, the underlying zoning of the area, would be commercial and therefore, in a commercial district, a residential development is as of right, so it could be a possibility that one of those sites would become resident and as such, it could be market rate or affordable, and, as such, the impact of these residential developments are entirely excluded from this environmental study, meaning that you know if a building were to be residential, You know, let's say a large residential building gets built.
You know possibly creating overcrowding, the access to park and open space This is something that we may want to ask them that they consider adding You, know the possibility of a scenario where some of these Lots would become residential, but as of now it is not part of the proposal and then I just want to tack on into the transit transportation piece One of the comments is like: if they're making this commercial, you know you saw the success of Columbus Circle subway station, where they have an underground all those shops This could be an opportunity if they're expanding that corridor, an area to really offer to both minorities and WBS people for those opportunities right to open up businesses, there's so many homeless, as it is even outside now, 13 14 17, a in that open space , there's so many homeless people there As, you know people that are going to be weather business, suspend both homeless, that's going to displace It is a concern as well It's, not part of your scope, but definitely the impact on displacement to the homeless population should be studied.
The scope document suggests that there's going to be a review of visual resources, but I think it's really important that we spell it out and that going further You know it's only just make sure you don't block the views of the Empire State Building It's, really you know comprehensive design on , how you fit that's that type of density into the area My recommendation in db2 had specific language to you know the view corridors onto the Empire, State Building, but actually mats did some research for us on other significant landmarks that are considered If. You currently, you know visual resources, so I think you know we should look into those, but I would love to hear other people's thoughts on the urban design and the impact that that's gonna have yeah for the incredible amount of GSF on this project.
The public space seems like next to nothing the public amenities, a it's just amazing If there was something that these buildings can do, instead of sheer office space to become offering more to the public other than the obvious transportation of but other than that, because it seemed to be much in the way of public amenities as it stands now, I mean they were proposing one tiny, little Plaza green area between two very large buildings and the existing 33rd Street closure They count that as a open space, but it already exists, I have a question about the park land that would be in essence, a shadow by these developments Were they to determined that a shadow would fall on the district, which is obvious?
Dave Achilles you ever sort of follow up on what EJ had to say in terms of the socio-economic impact of Madison Square Garden, that for the last 50 years, has been home to all of New York City's sports teams, as well as its chief entertainment arena, that whether there's going to be an alternative in the proposal or whatever happens to the garden I, think it's fair, although you know I, think no one is really recommending that the garden be you know, abandoned and eliminated altogether.
We want to make sure that the scope is wide enough to keep all options on the table, most specifically creating possibilities for moving Madison Square Garden The way that community board five fact in 2013 and that liyan MSG's current permit exten year permit expires in 2023 will theoretically be back in discussion.
And you know it's basically, a series of huge office buildings, hotels and commercial space surrounding Penn Station and Madison Square Garden It's, like if there's a new paradigm in place where the number of people are going to be working in commercial office.
Buildings is going to let's say dramatically shift because people are not going to Is that something that we should comment on very strongly because I think you know what's driving This is the idea that we must do these transit improvements and that we have to build these huge commercial office buildings to fund it but like if the demand for commercial office, space and cities are all over The all over the country in the world goes down by 1/3, then we're barking up the wrong tree Maybe it's maybe we as a community board to make sure that is not over.
You know the thing that if we phrase it this way, it's a very valid point, because we want to evaluate if there is no longer a market for commercial, real estate and hotel real estate, because they're also proposing a large hotel which could you know suddenly see a you know, a big recession I mean right now we sort of like took it for granted that you know this added density will be used on the site, but You know if all of a sudden the use becomes residential, You know the impact on schools, the impact on hospitals- and you know, health care services at open space.
We had a interesting conversation this morning with the New York landmarks Conservancy, and they actually have commissioned a survey of all the historic resources that they are currently you know pulling and working on, there's no landmark elates and therefore the impact that basically, they really need to look at It is very important that we pay close attention and they frame the other criteria and the threshold in a way that doesn't let this all This talk of historic buildings go to the dumpster with without any or any concern Are there any comments or questions or thoughts on the topic of historic resources in the area?
I know I'm talking a lot, and this might actually come up in the public comment section, but would we be proposing that they look at a situation in which the transit expansion happens on the other side of the Hudson in New, Jersey?
We may want to add some language It seems incredibly likely that it contains a connection to the Gateway tunnels, which everyone you know knows are critical and need to be built and will eventually increase capacity across the Hudson You know political backing by the governor He seems we've gone in right now, with the idea of an air train transfer way out in Queens to get you to LaGuardia the same way you transfer to an air train to get to JFK for what it's worth Can we make sure that this that this development area is scoped such that, as many of those things remain possibilities down the road as possible, certainly moving the garden and enabling at least as many of the tracks as possible to be reconfigured and widened, and eventually tied into other transit tunnels like gateway or a connector, or a single seat out to Long Island?
