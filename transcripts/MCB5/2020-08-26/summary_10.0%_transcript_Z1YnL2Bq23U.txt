First is a presentation by new york university on its plan to temporarily house students in the w hotel at 201 park, avenue.
We didn't close and, as I said, I just want to provide a brief overview of the strategies that the university is implementing to safely bring back our students, faculty and staff to the community.
Nyu has developed strategies to address the most pressing concerns which include Covid-19, 19, testing, contact, tracing quarantine and isolation, face coverings, physical distancing, reducing density and nyu facilities, symptoms, screening, enhanced cleaning, education, awareness, and, lastly, compliance.
We currently have a group of about 2 600 students who are quarantining in our residence halls and that quarantine will end at the beginning of next week, so that they're able to attend the first day of classes on the second, in terms of covering face coverings and masks like most facilities, individuals will be required to wear a mask when inside nyu building masks will be made available to all students, but they've also been instructed and recommended to bring their own face coverings.
The university is also emphasizing the importance of following these safety guidelines when outside of our facilities in order to protect the community at large, I think physical distancing is pretty clear.
For the community apply to all residence facilities, whether they're on or off campus, so that includes the hotel students will be held to the code of conduct that outlines behavior, both within and outside of university.
Another important thing to note is that the hotel will not be used as a quarantine facility, as valentine mentioned, nyu, has reserved five percent of existing housing stock for those needing to quarantine or isolate, but it will.
We recognize that and we're committed to new york city's revitalization, bringing back students as well as university faculty and staff that support the academic services will help spur economic community activities in the community surrounding nyu facilities in the hotel.
Students contribute to the local economy during this during the school year, but also the majority of nyu graduates remain in new york state following graduation, so for us, creating and sort of retaining that talent pool here in new york will assist with it, which is assisted by the temporary arrangement with the hotel is going to help contribute long term to the city's overall economic recovery.
We recognize that you know a lot of students are going to feel safer being at home Our main concern is for those who are in person making sure that we are following everything and creating a safe environment not only for our students and our staff and faculty, but also for the community at large, and you said that 50 of this undergrad student body will be on campus or like here.
Thank you very much for attending valentin and chris, and I would ask that you contact luke at our board office so that we can disseminate the answers to all the questions about the congregating on the sidewalk and what the public safety will look like and all the other questions that we had.
You asked me to look at the budget for the community boards themselves and we did an analysis, and I really want to.
Thank you for asking me to look at the new york city budget, because this really was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about.
Read a lot of documents, I'm gonna focus on the budget process, Think of most of this as reference material hold on a second, If, you need to look up something, it's something you could just refer to, but I'm, going to cover some of the new york city, budget, basics, the basic terms I'm, going to try to put it in perspective, the new york city budget and talk about relative roles, Then I'm going to talk about the timeline, the takeaways from the budget.
You know and add to the conversation, and then there were some really unique observations that I want to make that I learned about and A lot of great data sets analysis tools Yeah as quickly as you can go through the material while making that digestible for people An understanding that we're gonna ask you to share all your slides with us after the fact and make it and be available for the questions and to do this, because this is a really good way for people to think about when they're, putting in their budget requests capital and expense and how to think about the budget.
Then I wanted to compare the new york city budget.
New york city is larger than Florida and in every other state, its total budget expenditures compared to to all 50 states, not ideal.
You know periods, but you get a sense that how significant new york city's budget is.
That's, correct, there's also something called a financial plan which I think is Now. What the budget's going to look like It is done four times a year and to go back to the expense budget that the budget is actually modified throughout the year.
You should know that the both the city controllers office and the new york state controller's office.
There may be some information in there about savings that they found that that may be of interest for you as you're doing your silos, and I could- There are the mayor, the city, council and the community boards- Let's talk about the timeline, I think there's three major buckets to put the timeline: In, there's a needs assessment or the budget preparation period which we're in now I mean that's from may to november.
You know on the on this budget and Which, then is going to get sent to either the the full committee.
Very next thing is in by January 16th of every year the mayor drafts a financial plan and the preliminary budget once he drafts the So In february you're going to see you know the agencies start to respond to our request and by the 15th.
We get a response from all of our requests with you, know, with our recommendations, whether they've incorporated into the budget or whether they've and a lot of the responses are needing.
Now, that's due by november 1st Is for the 2022 budget , There's a lot of things on there that the community board is responsible for, so I took some of the larger agencies.
It's about 28 billion dollars a year in expenditures and then pension contributions and debt service are not an agency per se, but it's you know, budgeted separately And, then the department of social services and the police department and yada and all the other agencies after these top agencies, anything over a billion dollars, totaled, just over three billion dollars.
You know it's not a rainy day fund or which I think is prohibited, but it's a So. What this financial plan did was took the billion dollars in fiscal in next fiscal year and reduced it by 900 million dollars so that they could basically balance the next fiscal year.
Think in the new york city budget on the expense side, one is the number of employees 52 or more of total expenditures.
Really, you get the budgeted head count the amount that's to be spent on and on salaries, and you really dive into a lot of details on expense categories and really how that agency is going to spend money.
Basically, the new york city employees, retirement plan, which pretty much covers all of the employees.
You've done a lot of work on this You know you must be an accounting groupie, So I hate, So, I, absolutely second that, because the budget sometimes for us, is hard to digest right.
The charter does say that new york city has to balance their budget, but I submit.
If you're borrowing the money, we have to pay it back at some point, so it's going to affect our budget debt service, but yet that liability is showing that we're balanced.
I, don't know if new york, some agencies might be counting borrowed money as income, and then I told you that the budget is on a modified account basis.
Beyond my experience in the government, accounting world, where the new york city budget can be played with an accounting trips can happen, we do get audited, we got a clean opinion.
There's data on the new york city, open data, portal, lots of information, truth in accounting.
And then all the actual budgets are on are on you know: new york, city.gov, and these are the actual pension plans.
You want to read the pension plan summaries, where I pulled all you know, Later I want to ask if the committee has questions I, see.
, I'm, going to ask you to share your presentation so that I can send it out to all of the all of the committee members If you need help getting anything any of the data.
The thought was to send a letter to the department of sanitation and our electeds to ask them to really fix this or look at some ways to address the issues that are showing up because of the trash and the rats.
If I could ask the committee members to service to sort of what's a sort of way, sort of weigh in on anybody have any thoughts about a letter regarding sanitation.
I, don't know that it would be in the in this letter, specifically because I think we want to look at that.
