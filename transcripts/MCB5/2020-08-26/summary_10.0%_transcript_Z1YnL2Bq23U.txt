First is a presentation by New York University on its plan to temporarily house students in the W hotel at 201 park, Avenue.
I'm going to do something a little different tonight for members of the public and ask that they put any and all of their questions into the chat function and we'll answer them in the order that they're received in the chat, function.
And I'm, the assistant director of community relations, And I'm, going to speak first, just kind of briefly about the university's reopening plans, I think, firstly, the term reopening or is a little bit misleading, because the university never officially closed.
We did not close and, as I said, I just want to provide a brief overview of the strategies that the university is implementing to safely bring back our students, faculty and staff to the community.
If need be, I'm returning to the layers of safety that I mentioned before Nyu has developed strategies to address the most pressing concerns which include Covid-19, testing, contact, tracing quarantine and isolation, face coverings, physical distancing, reducing density and Nyu facilities, symptoms, screening, enhanced cleaning, education, awareness, and, lastly, compliance.
We currently have a group of about 2,600 students who are quarantining in our residence halls and that quarantine will end at the beginning of next week, so that they're able to attend the first day of classes on the second, in terms of covering face coverings and masks like most facilities, individuals will be required to wear a mask when inside Nyu building masks will be made available to all students, but they've also been instructed and recommended to bring their own face coverings.
The university is also emphasizing the importance of following these safety guidelines when outside of our facilities in order to protect the community at large, I think physical distancing is pretty clear.
Proximity to Nyu facilities and public transit options was an important one, compliance with all fire and safety, requirements, quality and reliability of I.T services, since students are likely to be attending some of their classes, virtual, virtually or remotely residential life features like common areas or room sizes or kitchenettes, and that kind of thing and performance with DOB requirements on zoning and usage was an important one to us as well importantly.
There will need to complete the community standards, fall, 2020 module, there's an attestation, as I think Valentine mentioned, that's required for all members of the community, Nyu's health and safety protocols for the community apply to all residence facilities, whether they're on or off campus, so that includes the hotel students will be held to the code of conduct that outlines behavior, both within and outside of university.
We recognize that and we're committed to New York City's revitalization, bringing back students as well as university faculty and staff that support the academic services will help spur economic community activities in the community surrounding Nyu facilities in the hotel.
Students contribute to the local economy during this during the school year, but also the majority of Nyu graduates remain in New York state following graduation, so for us creating and sort of retaining that talent pool here in New, York will assist with it, which is assisted by the temporary arrangement with the hotel is going to help contribute long term to the city's overall economic recovery.
So much Christopher, I'm going to ask that members of the committee raise their hand for their questions for either Christopher Valentin.
Thank you very much for attending Valentin and Chris, and I would ask that you contact Luke at our board office so that we can disseminate the answers to all the questions about the congregating on the sidewalk and what the public safety will look like and all the other questions that we had absolutely.
You asked me to look at the budget for the community boards themselves and we did an analysis, and I really want to.
Thank you for asking me to look at the New York City budget, because this really was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about.
Read a lot of documents, I'm going to focus on the budget process, But I'm, going to think of most of this as reference material hold on a second, If, you need to look up something, it's something you could just refer to, but I'm, going to cover some of the New York City Budget, basics, Then I'm going to talk about the timeline, the takeaways from the budget.
You know and add to the conversation, and then there were some really unique observations that I want to make that I learned about and A lot of great data sets analysis tools Yeah as quickly as you can go through the material while making that digestible for people An understanding that we're going to ask you to share all your slides with us after the fact and make it and be available for the questions and to do this, because this is a really good way for people to think about when they're putting in their budget requests capital and expense and how to think about the budget.
Then I wanted to compare the New York City budget.
You know periods, but you get a sense that how significant New York City's budget is.
I did look at a comprehensive annual financial report that showed that the estimates in our in our various budget versions are pretty close to the actuals.
There's, also capital budget and a capital item, is anything over 35,000 that is going to have a useful life of five years: or, more so, for purchasing large equipment or land.
You look at the capital, budget, I think it's around 800 pages It literally lists every single by agency,, every single capital item.
It's done every other year on the odd years, and also all of these budgets are listed on the mayor's website and or the Office of Management and budget owing OMB, I'm not going to get into the accountability too much If you have any questions on some of these slides, just let me know, but New York state is still very involved with the New York's New York City's budget.
When, we had financial difficulties, the New York State Financial, Control Board through the control, the New York State Comptroller's office, offers a lot of analysis, feedback and oversight on the New, York City Budget.
You should know that the both the city controllers office and the New York State Controller's office.
You know on the on this budget and Which, then is going to get sent to either the the full committee.
Very next thing is in by January 16th of every year the mayor drafts a financial plan and the preliminary budget once he drafts The Then, the basically the city, council and everyone starts reviewing and have hearings and offer comments.
We get a response from all of our requests with you, know, with our recommendations, whether they've incorporated into the budget or whether they've and a lot of the responses are needing.
Now, that's due by November 1st, is for the 2022 budget There's a lot of things on there that the community board is responsible for So I took some of the larger agencies.
Well, the Department of education is over 20, it's about 28 billion dollars a year in expenditures and then pension contributions and debt service are not an agency per se, but it's you know, budgeted separately And, then the Department of Social services and the police department and Yada and all the other agencies after these top agencies, anything over a billion dollars, totaled, just over three billion dollars.
What I did learn from going through this process, that there are two drivers, I think in the New York City Budget on the expense side.
You get the budgeted head count the amount that's to be spent on and on salaries, and you really dive into a lot of details on expense categories and really how that agency is going to spend money.
So those plans are 75 funded, so the pension unfunded liability , that's on our the the city's financial statement is 43 billion dollars, which is good, but not so bad.
, there's an article that comes out about a New, York, City teacher, making over four hundred thousand dollars in their pensions or three hundred thousand or two hundred thousand or one hundred thousand.
I do recall the number there are over 3,000 teachers making over a hundred thousand dollars in retirement benefits in New. You've done a lot of work on this You know you must be an accounting groupie, So I hate you ai, not understand great.
The charter does say that New York City has to balance their budget, but I submit.
This is how we, these are the following ways: that a city can spend more than show a balanced budget, but yet be actually in a deficit.
If you're borrowing the money, we have to pay it back at some point, so it's going to affect our budget debt service, but yet that liability is showing that we're balanced.
I do not know if New York some agencies might be counting borrowed money as income, And, then I told you that the budget is on a modified account basis.
Beyond my experience in the government, accounting world, where the New York City budget can be played with an accounting trips can happen, we do get audited, we got a clean opinion.
There's data on the New York City, Open, Data portal, lots of information, truth in accounting.
You know: New York City.
Thank you, I'm, going to ask you to share your presentation so that I can send it out to all of the all of the committee members If you need help getting anything any of the data.
The thought was to send a letter to the department of sanitation and our electeds to ask them to really fix this or look at some ways to address the issues that are showing up because of the trash and the rats.
If I could ask the committee members to service to sort of what's a sort of way, sort of weigh in on anybody have any thoughts about a letter regarding sanitation.
I do not know that it would be in the in this letter, specifically because I think we want to look at that.
Since you know, the rates in New, York, City have decreased with Coronavirus Department of Health and mental hygiene have increased in are getting back to normal the volume of outreach that they have for rodent control.
