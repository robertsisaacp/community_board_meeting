These include the CDC, the new york state governor's office and the commission on independent colleges and universities, among others, like all other higher education institutions in new york, state nyu is required to submit a plan to the governor's office for review In order to return a plan includes parameters for reopening monitoring, containment and shutdown, if need be, I'm returning to the layers of safety that I mentioned before Nyu has developed strategies to address the most pressing concerns which include Covid-19, 19, testing, contact, tracing quarantine and isolation, face coverings, physical distancing, reducing density and nyu facilities, symptoms, screening, enhanced cleaning education awareness and, lastly, compliance You know a little bit more about what we're doing in order to achieve a positive result in each of those areas in terms of Covid-19 testing.
We had a first group of students who arrived last week and we have another group arriving on the 31st and september 1st, so that will also pertain to these new students coming and then those residing outside of university housing are also required to present a negative test before entering any university facility, and we do have students living on campus, but the majority of our students do live off campus We are, you, know, aware of the policies and procedures that we're putting in place and making sure they apply to all, not only those in our residence halls and then throughout the fall semester, the team will conduct ongoing testing.
The university is currently setting aside five percent of its housing stock in residence So. We currently have a group of about 2 600 students who are quarantining in our residence halls and that quarantine will end at the beginning of next week so that they're able to attend the first day of classes on the second, in terms of covering face coverings and masks like most facilities, individuals will be required to wear a mask when inside nyu building masks will be made available to all students, but they've also been instructed and recommended to bring their own face coverings.
But a lot of what we're doing is not only geared towards those who are utilizing university facilities, but also those who are out in the community A public safety campaign called keep each other safe, and this talks about strategies that can be used in the community to make sure that we're all following the safety guidelines have been put in place and that we're all doing what we can to keep each other safe and then Lastly in terms of compliance all nyu students, both those who are residing in our residence halls and those who are residing within the community will be required to read and acknowledge a student code requirement and agree to behavioral standards set forth in the university-wide student conduct policy.
Compliance with all fire and safety requirements, quality and reliability of It services, since students are likely to be attending some of their classes, virtual, virtually or remotely residential life features like common areas or room sizes or kitchenettes, and that kind of thing and performance with DOB requirements on zoning and usage was an important one to us as well importantly, the university has laid out the health and safety protocols for our nyu community members temporarily living in this space, and there will be a constant communication with the with the hotel.
So we worked with the mayor's office to finalize the terms and parameters of this The. Lease will run through december 20th with an option only if needed, to renew first spring semester, but not extending beyond This should provide another layer of density densification for us an opportunity to maintain socially distant behavior hotel operators will be making staffing decisions as appropriate to meet the following: services: 24 7 desk coverage, security, daily cleaning and all the common areas, weekly house, cleaning of all the guest rooms and maintenance and, of course, repair staff.
All students there will need to complete the community standards, fall, 2020 module, there's an attestation, as I think valentine mentioned, that's required for all members of the community, nyu's health and safety protocols for the community apply to all residence facilities, whether they're on or off campus, so that includes the hotel students will be held to the code of conduct that outlines behavior both within and outside of university facilities.
You know we're an anchor institution in new york city We, recognize that and we're committed to new york city's revitalization, bringing back students as well as university faculty and staff that support the academic services will help spur economic community activities in the community surrounding nyu facilities in the hotel.
Nyu students contribute to the local economy during this during the school year, but also the majority of nyu graduates remain in new york state following graduation, so for us, creating and sort of retaining that talent pool here in new york will assist with it, which is assisted by the temporary arrangement with the hotel is going to help contribute long term to the city's overall economic recovery in the months and years ahead.
You asked me to look at the budget for the community boards themselves and we did an analysis and I really want to thank you for asking me to look at the new york city budget, because this really was an opportunity for me to learn a lot about it.
A lot of great data sets analysis tools and yeah as quickly as you can go through the material while making that digestible for people an understanding that we're gonna ask you to share all your slides with us after the fact and make it and be available for the questions and to do this, because this is a really good way for people to think about when they're, putting in their budget requests capital and expense and how to think about the budget.
Now we're asked to comment on the expense budget and as well as the capital budget and the expense budget covers all the day-to-day operations of running the city All the payroll supplies you know, rent all of those administrative expenses like I mentioned before debt service, as well as pension and french benefits those costs and it's calculated outside the agencies and those are funded by those revenue sources.
, there's, also something called a financial plan which I think is Now. This is not binding on the city, it doesn't say that you're gonna they have to spend this, but it's their estimate of the next few years, next, five years, current years and and four other years, what the budget's going to look like It is done four times a year and to go back to the expense budget that the budget is actually modified throughout the year If there's any particular expense, you know something that changes they do.
It's done every other year on the odd years, and also all of these budgets are listed on the mayor's website and or the office of management and budget owing omb If you have any questions on some of these slides, just let me know, but new york state is still very involved with the new york's new york city's budget back from the 70s when we had financial difficulties.
If you have, if one of your silos in one of your silos, if there's a department, you have an interest in, you should know that the both the city controllers office and the new york state controller's office There may be some information in there about savings that they found that that may be of interest for you as you're doing your silos and I could, and there are the mayor, the city council and the community boards- Let's talk about the timeline, I think there's three major buckets to put the timeline in there's a needs assessment or the budget preparation period which we're in now I mean that's from may to november, and then, from november to march, it's the drafting of the budget, the preliminary version of the budget and then in april to july It's actual adoption of the budget I think what I viewed was the most important dates and I've also listed as a reference , there's pretty much some timeline or some deadline or some goal to be met.
But I think the most important date- we have to submit our final budget request with our priorities submitted through the office of management and budget That means that this committee has to discuss, have hearings meet with constituents, gather information and make recommendations Then the then we're all gonna have to vote on You know on the on this budget and which then is going to get sent to either the the full committee The timing of the next of the october meeting, if we're finished by the october meeting or the executive committee will have to vote it out, but we need to submit it by november.
The very next thing is in by January 16th of every year the mayor drafts a financial plan and the preliminary budget once he drafts the So in february you're going to see you know the agencies start to respond to our request and by the 15th If you do, we actually get a letter, or this is a letter.
I should incorporate that into the to these slides and then, by june 5th, the the budget gets adopted by the city council and the very next day it gets certified by the mayor, the controller and the city clerk and then june july, 1st the fiscal year begins So back in june, we just adopted the fiscal year ending 2021 budget, so this process, our process, is for the 2022 budget There's a lot of things on there that the community board is responsible for so I took some of the larger agencies : Let's look at agencies that are over one billion dollars in expenditures and let's see how many there are in the relative importance.
I'm going to minimize this power point Well, I, What I didn't mention was that the the controller's office is, you know he has He. Does his own audit audits of various departments he's also responsible for hiring the outside auditors, which is grant thornton and grant thornton So by october of this year they will have finished the audit of the june 2020 financial statements This is the financial statements for the city of new york and I.
The police department was it did that actually happen, and you know they wrote a report basically said What I did learn from going through this process, that there are two drivers, I think in the new york city budget on the expense side, one is the number of employees 52 or more of total expenditures relates to personnel.
Let's talk about new york's employees in new york city, this is taking 1980 to 2019 You know some people thought that there was a lot of growth in in employees under the current administration, The independent budget office.
Health and mental hygiene saw a 52 percent increase fire civilian sort, almost a 30 increase and then housing preservation and development saw a 10, almost 11 decrease in employees from 2008 to 2009, and then I highlighted some of the other agencies, so All agencies, some went up significantly The next biggest driver, in my opinion, was the pension plans, not maybe on an annual budget perspective, but certainly on a total aggregate impact.
This is how we, these are the following ways that a city can spend more than show a balanced budget, but yet be actually in a deficit If you're borrowing the money, we have to pay it back at some point, so it's going to affect our budget debt service, but yet that liability is showing that we're balanced the capital We may have balanced the capital budget, but guess what we owe a lot of money on there playing with revenue assumptions.
There's data on the new york city, open data portal, lots of information, truth in accounting, those chapters that will really relate to the community board and the budget process.
There's fewer weekday and holiday basket collections and the trash is just leading to a lot more mice, Rats cockroaches, all those fun friends we're starting to eat outside, as you all know, in Manhattan, and that also tends to create trash So. The thought was to send a letter to the department of sanitation and our electeds to ask them to really fix this or look at some ways to address the issues that are showing up because of the trash and the rats I'm saying a letter simply because we don't have our next meeting until until september, and I wanted to get your sense of what you think about a letter on this topic.
