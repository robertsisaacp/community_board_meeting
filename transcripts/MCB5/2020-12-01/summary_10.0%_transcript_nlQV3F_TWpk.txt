Okay, I think we can get started, we're doing pretty well, hello, everyone, I'm, Clayton, Smith, chair of the parks and public spaces, Committee for Community Board five.
We are going to begin with a little bit of a rehash of an issue that we heard a couple of months ago, namely the proposed position of the director of the public realm, put forth by municipal arts, society and New Yorkers for parks, so Tara Kelly is with us from Mas hi, Tara, hello.
We heard this, as you might recall, as a committee specific to issues that pertain to our committee's jurisdiction, and there are many of them with this proposed position, and we agreed unanimously to put that into a written statement that would we weren't exactly sure what the strategy was going to be but be submitted to the city in some fashion, to indicate our support for the proposed position in the two or three weeks immediately following that, as you know, the Bex Committee on Community Board, five took up the same issue in regards to the formal budget request for the year.
Coming from the budget request process formally and now that has been done, We thought that it was a good idea to re-hear this idea at committee again, for two reasons: number one is to hear from municipal art society about any updates we should know about whatever progress has been made or anything that has been further evolved in the proposed position since the time that we saw them last and secondly, just as a strategy for Community board five, Since there is such widespread support for this proposed position, even as many details continue to be talked about, is that we, as a committee, can take the content of that written statement and actually, Assuming that we have things we might want to add or talk about, tonight, put that into the form of an actual resolution, which is just stronger and then can be sent to full board and then a full board.
The other issues can add something they'd like there if they see if they deem fit, and then we'll actually have a statement of support as a resolution from the full board, which is the strongest way moving forward.
I just wanted to see if there are any questions from members of the committee about this anything procedurally or any questions or comments that you have at this time and Luke did drop the link to the registration for the full board meeting into the chat by the way and seeing none I will ask Tara to give us kind of a recap of how things have progressed over the last three months.
We had a series of four conversations over the course of October and November about management and oversight of the public realm as it pertains to design how it works in relationship to providing open and green space.
The public realm is adapting to support businesses through street tale and open dining and one more oh, active, transit, and so all things that I think that CB5 is well acquainted with and how we see that we really need this coordinating position to balance.
This, as you know, is also part of our larger fight for light campaign, and so we're working on some land use recommendations around that in the form of a development framework and.
But, as you all know, There are really important elements of this position that are integral to all aspects of planning in New, York, City and in the public realm.
And, so I think that, in terms of accountability and empowerment, This call coming from the people of New York City, asking for this position to be created to then create some accountability to the public.
I think is really important, but you know we've had suggestions from other colleagues, particularly in the four series conversation on open space that we had was moderated by Susan Chin, and she strongly advocates for a deputy mayor position to really oversee all of those disparate agencies.
And I think that you know, as you as members of the community board, who interface and interact with all these agencies, have better suggestions and recommendations for how this would be implemented and be most effective.
But as Tara said, It also depends on who the mayor is so looking at that, and also looking at what a more institutional, broader fix would be is something that, of course, would interest us so just to reiterate that this statement of support is loose in terms of the details as the position is now and that we would very much look forward and hope that we have the ability, once the budget is approved, to create this position, that we have the ability to then weigh in a more fine, detailed level of how this would actually work, coordinating between different agencies and all those operational details, Any other questions or comments from members of the committee and while we're waiting I will also open it up to members of the public.
What we do see is that there currently is that there is not a lot of coordination between these agencies and pops being the case in point where it's city planning, who understands best what the particular rules are for each one, And. I, think that we're seeing a little bit more intention and they've improved a little bit in terms of their communication between the agencies.
But we really would like the public, doesn't understand the difference between the agency jurisdiction between that pops next to a plaza next to a park.
There is no rationale, that is the department of City planning, who is responsible for enforcing a sidewalk cafe and a pops when everyone is familiar with DCA doing the same on a sidewalk, and you know, after being on the community board for x number of years, I.
My understanding of the application is that this is an event that the Salvation Army is proposing to host in Madison Square Park and there are a few.
I think it's maybe just best to let the salvation Army present the application themselves or with the conservancy.
So today we're presenting a sculpture of the iconic Salvation Army red Kettle that will be placed in the park for five days in December.
Where is the positioning of the truck and where will the people be moving to and fro from in terms of the actual installation itself or just if they're support, vehicles, I, guess both I guess where, on the street, where the you know.
Aren't, going to be jumping in to rescue everybody in the way that they were, You know last April, and may I'm hoping that at some point we can actually do earned income again and have marketing events and bring that money.
There are any members of the public who have any questions to this application, Please use the raise hand, feature and let us know, and seeing none you're free to continue to raise your hand in the next minutes here, But back to the committee.
I understand that as members of this committee, we're supposed to limit our opinions on whether or not to vote yes, no based solely on whether it meets the physical criteria, that's being presented, I just have to say that the reason that Gail asked me to join this community board is to lend my expertise for 30 years.
I'm going to abstain from voting just out of respect for the extraordinary work that's being done by the Madison Square Park Conservancy.
I think we're doing great work for New, York City, and you know, we've partnered with the coalition a different, the don't walk by coalitions for many years and I respect your opinion.
But the vote on this application is has to be seen in context of our history, of taking public positions on all applications, and this is where I really get a little stymied, because when we have had even charitable organizations in the past file for permits to use park space, we have not asked about hiring practices.
It's also giving valuable dollars to the Madison Square Park Conservancy we as Todd and will have said we go through a lot of applications in this committee.
I just wanted to see if any members of the public had any I think one person contacted the board office in advance of the meeting, so I just wanted to see.
With allocation development of community gardens in New, York City public school children would have the potential to become involved in the formation of school.
In order to make food insecurity a thing of the past I urge this committee on parks and public spaces to support the legislative bill.
