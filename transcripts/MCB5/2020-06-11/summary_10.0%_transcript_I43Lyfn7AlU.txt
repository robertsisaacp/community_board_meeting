, I, remember saying it's the first time Talked about it afterwards in the history of community board So welcome to our third virtual board meeting I thought: I'd open tonight's meeting by reading cb5's statement of solidarity to protest.
We are here to represent all residents, workers and stakeholders in our district and to advocate for what is in the best interest of the public, we will continue to fight for more equitable housing and land use, policies, social services commensurate with need and advocating.
We will continue to maintain an open forum to hear the concerns of the public and engage with the administration city agencies and other entities to exact the strongest possible solutions for social justice.
So I'd like to say that there is an awful lot of work that has to be done and our bex committee will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing, models, access to housing, new approaches to criminal justice and the provision of education, educational equity to all students.
Both I like counterfeiters and talk about his, but I think we both have been calling for the council to do more than what the mayor has recommended by a large margin when it comes to the budget.
Mayor's proposed budget basically makes essentially zero cuts in this fiscal year, but puts all the burden of cuts onto programs like summer youth, employment.
All of us feel not just to look at the number and the numbers, but to look at the role of policing in new york city when it comes to transportation, homeless, services and mental health services and police, and as the schools to have a better idea of what we want policing to look like in the future.
It's going to be fairly discretionary on the small businesses, but it is a good moment to start thinking about how you want to see that happen in your own area.
The, most immediate thing we can do is to create some locations in each community where you can still drop it off, even if it's not in your building and our legislation, I did with councilman radio so requires there to be three in each community board district that could be surface drop-off sites Questions, of course, is we are joined by my colleague mark levine, who has been if you're, not following on social media.
Shortly, I think our budget, our budget committee, chair, renee kinsella, is joining like a coalition of other boards on helping small business.
Racing can interrupt that chain and what it means, and what it's meant now for 10 days is that if you get a positive test, result, you're going to get a call, those calls are going out and we need people to answer that call and complete an interview with the contact tracer to talk about who you may have been in contact with close contact for at least 10 minutes or more right.
You work with, but as we open and things like restaurants, come back, they'll probably be more avenues for exposure I think very few new yorkers even understand that this is happening and would be wary about talking to someone with such private information.
That's a lot that I've shared with you, but I want your help as community board members, as community leaders, as ambassadors from public health to communicate no less than you've communicated on the importance of the census.
Obviously, you know people need to go out and protest, but I've been really concerned about it becoming a public health crisis and causing you know quite an immediate spike, especially because it's you know the disproportionate deaths by Covid-19 and the black and brown communities.
But I was told by many organizations that actually the bigger issue is the fact that people on the ground in those protests were saying that the NYPD we're not wearing masks, and I was wondering if that was something that the council, you know, u.s health chair could address, but also in addition on that.
A two-part question is anyone thinking about PPE that could be donated for the people that are out there, but also to enforce I'm sure the cops with all the money that they have PPE I've seen that some do and some aren't wearing them, but how you know an enforcement issue needs to happen because this first and foremost, they're You, know we don't want people to die a Covid-19 And, the more I talk to community organizations.
Are we setting if public sector workers aren't doing that, And we're not gonna stop until police officers are doing the right thing to protect their communities.
We believe that we do need to start breaking down a lot of the structural racism that has been in new york city and the police department and one of the ways we really need to do that through the budget.
One of the steps that we think we should be taking now is restarting our city's capital program as a way to invest in schools, affordable, housing, theaters outdoor spaces, to make sure that our city is ready to recover and reopen, and it's also one of the best job multipliers to get our city going and on the cobra front.
We have jeremy unger caught from carlina's office, Now. We put out a letter or open statement from carlina and a couple of local black women leaders from lower Manhattan, addressing both, I think, The nypd's over enforcement and escalation in protests, but also the fact that the city did not do enough to put our small businesses in a better place to be kept safe and protected, particularly as they were being you know, addressed, you know, being hit by.
Take away as many kind of roles that the police do not necessarily need to be involved in whether that's schools or traffic enforcement and always open to you know other suggestions.
You know, I think, there's been a lot of really great things coming from the community on ways to address police issues, and you know happy to hear from anyone else.
As senator hoyman, said, brad blizz too, was very happy and very satisfied to be an elected representative up in albany having passed, help to pass so many of this comprehensive legislation to confront the policing and public safety issues in our city to follow up on that just know that next week we are going to be hosting two virtual town halls on topics that were brought up this evening on next wednesday.
June 17th liz will be in conversation with insha rahman, who is the director of strategies and new initiatives at the vera institute of justice to discuss this issue of policing and public safety going forward.
We have betsy schmidt from congresswoman carol, maloney's office, hey We, just wanted to put out you know things as well, just about with all people across the country protesting marching to condemn police violence, demand justice and declare unequivocally that black lives, matter.
She's supporting rep presley's house resolution, 988 condemning all acts of police, brutality, rep, Justin amash's in qualified immunity, act, which would end the practice of qualified immunity which protects officers from civil suits, h.r 4359, the peace act, which would require law enforcement to use de-escalation techniques and use force only as a last resort, as well as rep jeffrey's, HR 4408, eric garner, excessive use of force prevention act which would ban the use of choke holds by law.
Let me see what's available for individuals to donate okay, thank you, and this is jeremy When there's like so many different types of places, you can donate But, like I think when in doubt the best place to donate right now is like the mayor's fund to advance new york city, because that is going to a bunch of different things and because that is a quasi-government, nonprofit organization that can sometimes more easily donate to small businesses, which are for profit ventures than the city can, through other funding.
Members of the public are invited to speak on issues that they think would be of importance to the board.
Sorry, the state liquor thought it was on the phone And you might want to have them come and discuss what would be relevant for your topic, because the short version is that if a restaurant is simply going to a little bit in the outdoor cafe or even perpendicular out into a parking space, there is not a lot of forms to fill.
That's something that I just called the mayor's office to say: We need the suspension to open container ordinance so that people can walk to an adjoining area and sit and enjoy dinner.
And they've been working with D.O.T and the law department, so the community board does play a role, though, because sla says, oh new york, is very complicated.
I think we've been working a lot on that issue of more street space for the restaurants.
Would be another project that people want to work on that we're now working with the executive superintendent in Manhattan, because I know jcc to their credit, has 200 volunteer tutors and they are all signed off on by the department of education , they're, all fingerprinted, et cetera, so they're going to help starting working with students, because if you didn't get through during the year, I, don't know if you're going to get through during the summer.
We've got a resolution tonight that comes to the opposite: conclusion, because we've been getting a lot of complaints about people loitering in front of restaurants that are serving liquor, not respecting social distancing and we've been having a lot of trouble with with things that would be resolved by the open container, law.
I, don't know like if you're a restaurant and you're gonna have seating in a plaza, And you're not adjacent to the restaurant I So you should go ahead with your resolution, but just think about this other.
I've been shut down during this whole Covid-19 time, but I've stayed in new york, And I've seen how disproportionately affected the low under-resourced communities have been in our city and those majority black and brown, populations, and I just think.
Now it's such an important time to really look at the budget and look at the six billion dollars that NYPD has and really think about how pulling finding some excess in there and pulling it out and being able to put it into resources that the communities really need right now in order to rebuild whether it's mental health or youth, employment or housing, or food banks or anything.
This time, only board members will participate by hearing reports and opining on agenda items that are presented by committee chairs by way of questions.
That's me, and my report to the board this evening is to bring something to the board's attention, which is the community board committee's letters to the mayor regarding shaping the city's response to Covid-19 19.
We want parity in any budget cuts, but believe that housing, the summer youth employment program in our schools, areas, where we've always called for more funding, must not be duly impacted by the deficit.
The general thinking at this point is that outdoor seating is much safer than indoor seating with recirculated air and close quarters and difficulty social distancing, because this is a proposal that has very few examples or precedents in new york city, and we don't receive proposals like this very frequently.
That would charge the city most likely, the department of transportation to select streets to close and the DCA to issue these permits to create this new permitting scheme very quickly, because the proposal- you know, as you heard, a lot about tonight, was moving very quickly and because new york city ha itself has already moved into phase one and because, while restaurants and bars are slated to be in phase three and the state is already allowing outdoor dining in other regions, seemingly already in phase two.
We ask that the city work closely with the local bids to establish security for any closed area, to clearly define whether or not the business is responsible for enforcing the social distancing and the safety of customers that define who is responsible for setting up erecting barriers and ensuring the safety of everybody on the on the closed block or lane that they relax signage regulations, so that the restaurants can advertise themselves and their outdoor areas and coordinate with food trucks.
The joint committee meeting about outdoor dining tne, also met to have a wide-ranging discussion about all the other effects that the kova crisis is having on the transportation and environment of our district and to express the sense of the committee around our concerns and suggestions regarding the city's response.
Notably many of the enacted and proposed changes already dovetail with some pre-existing priorities and long-term plans that the that community board five has weighed in on like reducing traffic through congestion, pricing, other street use reconfiguration, and So you know we wanted to emphasize that the plans should not just be looked at in the context of the crisis, but also our long-term priorities, as well.
We also wanted to emphasize the second half of our committee's name, the environment, and to ensure that the city is looking at and providing data on noise and pollution and other environmental effects that are affected by any of the types of proposals or changes that we that we just mentioned.
As, you all know, bryant park, central park, madison square park, union square park and harold and greeley squares are very beloved public spaces to say the least, and now in this time are critical because they offer new yorkers a safe opportunity, given the following of probably proper health protocols to get outside and move around and get fresh air, which is good for physical and mental health.
We have questions about how the city will work with them in managing the crisis and their contractual obligations, for example, phase two, which will allow for the extended outdoor, dining proposal.
I. Think on the last letter, presenting right now If you want to read those yourself or spread them around or Whatever Covid-19, that's it!
As we better understand the needs that the city is going to have to evolve to to address these, these health issues.
You know the mayor and the city council to create a system, a mechanism that is going to give us an opportunity to be consulted, weigh in so have a reactive response, but also have a proactive approach to the urban and land use issues and broader issues.
If that's okay, given that I want to do the third, if that's okay with you, let's give it a try So we also had an application, and this application is for the renewal of a chair certification for an open-air cafe in a public plaza, so to give a little bit of background.
The developer got a much taller building than they would have so the way the committee has approached these resolutions and these applications is to basically say we will support the cafe.
Resolutions, and I want to thank wally kim luke and at the board office as well.
The police would have to enforce the open container law and the orders about social distancing, but this take goes a step further and asks the sla to, or as the legislation to give the sla the authority to enforce that and perhaps suspend a licensee's license or their privilege to to deliver or sell alcohol to go.
My I was concerned about this whole issue of what can we do if all of these people that are out on the street or loosening the rules for good reason, and we all agreed that it was critical for all these restaurants and small business to get out there?
Alcohol, and I know that I think that kendall offered to speak to it, but our understanding was that there's already the ability for liquor stores to do delivery, and so the question was in the time in this moment in Covid-19, when restaurants have are having such trouble with their potential trouble with their business models, certainly actual trouble right now that it wasn't actually clear why they shouldn't be allowed to deliver.
That's that was, I guess, my logic in why we were supporting it, and then we just wanted to make sure that the loopholes that a lot of people have experienced around getting deliveries and not having to show I I, want to add to what matt just mentioned the logic behind our committee meeting.
Since time is of the essence, and this week and next week the budget will be finalized by the mayor and the city council, and since it did not go through the beck's committee, the whole board must now act as a committee, which means that we are now.
When, the mayor issued his executive budget and that's what comes out in April it immediately and specifically called for cuts to some programming like the summer youth, employment, program, This, evening, community board, immediate board.
We do not want the city funding to be cut for children or programs and agencies that strengthen underfunded and underserved communities that need our support right now, more than ever, but perhaps more importantly.
We as a board start looking at the budget and our request in June as we prepare our community needs.
Other thing I would say is that I know that some people have voiced their interest in police.
I think this is actually a question versus a comment, but the that lines 574 and 575, that they talk specifically about a reinvestment, reduction, mitpd budget and reinvestment in communities, particularly when it comes to critical social services.
I think if this were the final word that we were having on police brutality, I would definitely have a lot more comments and questions, but I understand that this is just the beginning of a very long process or less fleshing out our position.
I think it would be remiss of us to pass a resolution on the nypd's budget without mentioning police brutality specifically.
