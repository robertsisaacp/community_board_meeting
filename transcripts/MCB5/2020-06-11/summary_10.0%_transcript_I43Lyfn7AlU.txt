We will continue to maintain an open forum to hear the concerns of the public and engage with the administration city agencies and other entities to exact the strongest possible solutions for social justice for our district To that end, we will be working to identify effective ways to engage more deeply with the public on these issues in the coming weeks.
So I'd like to say that there is an awful lot of work that has to be done and our bex committee will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing models, access to housing, new approaches to criminal justice and the provision of education, educational equity to all students.
It is through the engagement and feedback from the community that cb5 can best represent the needs of everyone in our district and ensure that we provide a voice for all Please note that tonight's agenda concentrates on the many timely issues that we have been hearing over the past month, including our budget.
A budget resolution in your packet I think time have to think about our priorities as new yorkers and individual beings, and also as organizations think about how we're advancing goals to make sure to advance the goals that we're all out there marching about, and for me that goes I'll talk about policing in a second, but that goes into you: educational integration that goes into housing, integration, It calls on us, and particularly institutions on community boards that have , know continuous in our pursuit of policies that will help ensure that our city is not segregated that our city, our city, is inclusive of all voices and that we are not forgetting that after the protests are over.
The mayor's proposed budget basically makes essentially zero cuts in this fiscal year, but puts all the burden of cuts onto programs like summer, youth, employment, Even before this moment hit, we had started to call for them to make deep and more meaningful cuts and now I think all of us feel not just to look at the number and the numbers, but to look at the role of policing in new york city when it comes to transportation, homeless, services and mental health services and police, and as the schools to have a better idea of what we want policing to look like in the future.
But it is a good moment to start thinking about how you want to see that happen in your own area or, if you have recommendations around that, but we've been leading the charge and the council on trying to get some version of that to help our restaurants and if you have questions or businesses that want to know more about the grants I've announced today.
You are guys, I think, are taking up a resolution, I believe tonight, or at least discussing related to my bill on composting in new york city, which is one of the programs that was cut as part of the mayor's budget cuts and still an uncertain future here in new york city Most immediate thing we can do is to create some locations in each community where you can still drop it off, even if it's not in your building and our legislation, I did with councilman radio so requires there to be three in each community board district that could be surface drop-off sites One of the best voices around Covid-19 and understanding He gives you very straightforward information about what's happening in Covid-19, what's happening with this public health moment, so he has been a good voice.
Racing can interrupt that chain and what it means, and what it's meant now for 10 days is that if you get a positive test, result you're going to get a call, those calls are going out and we need people to answer that call and complete an interview with the contact tracer to talk about who you may have been in contact with close contact for at least 10 minutes or more right, Now. It's mostly people, you live with, or people you work with, but as we open and things like restaurants, come back, they'll probably be more avenues for exposure right now , I think very few new yorkers even understand that this is happening and would be wary about talking to someone with such private information Likewise with quarantining and isolating You get sick.
You know people need to go out and protest, but I've been really concerned about it becoming a public health crisis and causing you know quite an immediate spike, especially because it's you know the disproportionate deaths by Covid-19 and the black and brown communities so about a week ago, and you know, bought 7 500 masks and was talking a bunch of community organizations and NYCHA houses and I think the com, someone from the comptroller's office that I know helped me get these out.
But I was told by many organizations that actually, the bigger issue is the fact that people on the ground in those protests were saying that the NYPD we're not wearing masks and I was wondering if that was something that the council, you know us health chair could address, but also in addition on that, if there has been anything any calls to action, I mean we saw the whole world rallied for PPE for nurses, but I'm not seeing that same sort of call to action for protesters, I, guess a two-part question is anyone thinking about PPE that could be donated for the people that are out there, but also to enforce I'm sure the cops with all the money that they have PPE I've seen that some do and some aren't wearing them.
So that's a little bit of an update there, and also you should know that the speaker, along with council member drum and gibson, wrote a letter to de Blasio de Blasio about the inequities of the budget and how unfair it was that agencies like dycd is, you know, being asked to cut 36 percent, but the police are being asked to cut less than one percent Thank you for the support of the open.
Moving on to luke of control of scott stringer's office, hi, everybody luke from comptroller scott schringer's office We have the overlapping crises of a pandemic economic crisis and then, of course, the disproportionate impact of policing on communities of color, which has been front and center the past few weeks, but has been going on for far longer We believe that we do need to start breaking down a lot of the structural racism that has been in new york city and the police department and one of the ways we really need to do that through the budget So, we put out a proposal to cut 1.1 billion dollars from the NYPD over the next four years and take that money and transferred into community programs, and the community is most disproportionately impacted by policing On the economic side.
So over 30 percent of the pantries across the city were closed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the city has done a great job, ramping up So we're still really focused on making sure that everyone across the city can get the quality and accessible food that they need, and one last thing we're working on is making sure that we're holding the city accountable so that in case there is a second wave We are joined by our wonderful state, senator brad, hoyleman, brad You know I just want to thank you for your statement about racism and police brutality and I'm happy to say that I passed a bill this week called the police, stat It's called the police statistics and transparency act and , for the first time, new york's going to be collecting statistical data from ranging from low-level misdemeanors all the way to deaths while in custody, The division of criminal justice services, state of new york was actually news.
We have jeremy unger caught from carlina's office Now we put out a letter or open statement from carlina and a couple of local black women leaders from lower Manhattan, addressing both I think the nypd's over enforcement and escalation in protests, but also the fact that the city did not do enough to put our small businesses in a better place to be kept safe and protected, particularly as they were being you know, addressed you know being hit by You know.
Think there's been a lot of really great things coming from the community on ways to address police issues, and you know happy to hear from anyone else.
Blizz too, was very happy and very satisfied to be an elected representative up in albany having passed help to pass so many of this comprehensive legislation to confront the policing and public safety issues in our city to follow up on that just know that next week we are going to be hosting two virtual town halls on topics that were brought up.
Second thing, of course, is we've been working not so much in your area, but with the buses and trying to find more bus lanes around the city and, more importantly, how we can involve more in terms of having the buses uptown more along fifth avenue and 181st degree, as you know, were announced the other day and then I just want to say summer is coming and school is coming in september.
Okay gail before you go, I think nick athanal, the head of our liquor, license committee, would like to speak with you great thanks, vicky hi gail I just wanted to address your comment about the open container law, saying that it should be relaxed.
We've got a resolution tonight that comes to the opposite conclusion, because we've been getting a lot of complaints about people loitering in front of restaurants that are serving liquor, not respecting social distancing and we've been having a lot of trouble with with things that would be resolved by the open container law, It's uncharted territory.
I've been shut down during this whole Covid-19 time, but I've stayed in new york It's such an important time to really look at the budget and look at the six billion dollars that NYPD has and really think about how pulling finding some excess in there and pulling it out and being able to put it into resources that the communities really need right now in order to rebuild whether it's mental health or youth, employment or housing or food banks or anything.
Also, a small business owner in your district and I am new to local politics I am also just calling I'm very heartened to hear this community board's position in fighting racial injustice and pushing for more just city, so I'm also just here to add my voice to help redirect some of the six billion dollars in funds allocated for the NYPD to reinvest in social services for the communities that are hurting the most right now and I.
This time only board members will participate by hearing reports and opining on agenda items that are presented by committee chairs by way of questions comments and, finally, by voting on the issue before then The first thing that we're going to do is the election of officers with evan meyerson We noted during the may meeting the role of the nominations committee concluded at last month's meeting.
That's me and my report to the board this evening is to bring something to the board's attention, which is the community board committee's letters to the mayor regarding shaping the city's response to Covid-19 19 I'm, not sure if everyone knows at our last full board, meeting borough, President gail brewer spoke of the mayor.
We also asked that any cuts in the DOE be made to the back office rather than front line teachers, and we were supporting We, were unanimous in our support for DOE to place a social worker in every single school, and our last request in the letter is that the city fund, the summer youth employment program, which is so critical to so many children and their families Thank you so much renee excellent next ej califorski, who is speaking for the joint committee meeting regarding outdoor seating This, was a meeting of transportation and environment, public safety, quality of life and parks and public spaces.
That would charge the city most likely the department of transportation to select streets to close and the DCA to issue these permits to create this new permitting scheme very quickly, because the proposal-- you know, as you heard, a lot about tonight- was moving very quickly and because new york city ha itself has already moved into phase one and because, while restaurants and bars are slated to be in phase three and the state is already allowing outdoor dining in other regions, seemingly already in phase two Obviously.
We were very much aware that which streets get selected for closure will have a tremendous impact on not just the flow of people in traffic to the city, but also which businesses will get to benefit economically and commercially We suggested criteria to maximize the benefit of any such area along the lines of the matrixes or matrices that we often use as a board to determine public benefit of issuing a liquor license.
Thank you so much ej and you can move into the report from your committee after the joint committee meeting about outdoor dining tne also met to have a wide-ranging discussion about all the other effects that the kova crisis is having on the transportation and environment of our district and to express the sense of the committee around our concerns and suggestions regarding the city's response, notably many of the enacted and proposed changes already dovetail with some pre-existing priorities and long-term plans that the that community board five has weighed in on like reducing traffic through congestion, pricing, other street use reconfiguration, and so you know we wanted to emphasize that the plans should not just be looked at in the context of the crisis, but also our long-term priorities as well.
We also wanted to emphasize the second half of our committee's name, the environment, and to ensure that the city is looking at and providing data on noise and pollution and other environmental effects that are affected by any of the types of proposals or changes that we that we just mentioned Obviously the city needs to move fast to respond to the crisis, and we simply ask that the city also likewise step up the speed and and the responsiveness of its reporting and transparency throughout the process as well.
There are further thoughts and questions about our parks and our pedestrian plazas in particular that we want to highlight so district fives parks, As, you all know, bryant park, central park, madison square park, union square park and harold and greeley squares are very beloved public spaces to say the least, and now in this time are critical because they offer new yorkers a safe opportunity given the following of probably proper health protocols to get outside and move around and get fresh air, which is good for physical and mental health.
We, certainly appreciate that, and therefore the land use committee is very much committed to continuing to work on these issues as they are ongoing and, as we better understand the needs that the city is going to have to evolve to to address these.
You know it's kind of a no-brainer, so we took it upon ourselves as you've seen throughout the review of these letters done by other committees and by my colleagues that you know, we've been hard at work doing that, but we also want to tell the mayor that community board members should be appointed to these advisory councils, and we know that other community boards feel the same way and you know may actually sign on to a similar type of letter and and call to the mayor, but further You know how we're heading into this healthcare crisis Basically, the first resolution underscores those two points we would like to be appointed to the advisory councils.
If that's okay with you, vicky I, would like to bundle the the certainly the two Covid-19 response resolutions So. The second resolution that we felt was really important to pass is that, right now, as I said, you know we're committed to working on what our urban planning, zoning and land use response should be.
We are asking for a planned vision of what services, what infrastructure both on What we're saying is that what we know is that closing 20 hospitals in the course of 20 years as critical as one may want of this I mean our hospital system was put under a strain that was just untenable and Anyone have any comments to this resolution?
The scrutiny that we bring to these cafes is about signage and about making sure that, although these, these cafes, which is basically you know, a set of chairs and tables are authorized to, you know, provide you know, sort of like accessory support to the cafe, but the seating should remain open to the public and that no purchase is necessary because the intent, the original intent of these areas is to serve the public in exchange, the developer got a much taller building than they would have so the way the committee has approached these resolutions and these applications is to basically say we will support the cafe and you know, let's say tables with white cloth- We want to make sure that these cafes are open to the public, but that also they are clearly notified and marked as being open to the public and that no purchase is necessary.
So, although it's a renewal, although we have really no issue with the cafe, it has operated in compliance, we still call them in and we ask them to agree and commit to continuing to advertise these tables and seats as being open to the public, So I'm, very pleased and to report that to the committee and to report that to the full board and we voted to support.
The mayor asked the state liquor authority to provo, propose some guidelines for licensees to deliver alcohol with their orders or to provide them on a to-go basis, and the resolution outlines the guidelines from the state liquor authority, which senator hoyleman is now suggesting be made permanent for a period of two years after the end of the state disaster Emergency, the legislation that hoyleman is proposing does have a few modifications from the from the current guidelines of the sla, and that would provide community board input and it would require some hearings and some other things.
So before we vote, we kendall I'd, like you to now in case it has any bearing or any questions that might apply to those two resolutions, so we'll do it before we vote It's a proposal that we are very interested in community feedback on and all of your questions and comments are definitely something that I'll take back and discuss with the senator I just wanted to touch on a few points, namely a few people.
Any questions to the resolution, just a minute, All I have to say is the landmarks committee has been doing such great work and I believe that cb5 should start creating a binder now where we have these poster child case studies which happen with relative frequency on all of our committees, where we can point to very concrete examples when our deliberations resulted in a better result for the public But I just wanted to thank the committee for the really great work That I think that community board 5 does a better job than the lpc I was going to say.
We do not want the city funding to be cut for children or programs and agencies that strengthen underfunded and underserved communities that need our support right now more than ever, but perhaps more importantly, our resolution asks that the NYPD not be exempt from its share of significant budget cuts.
Council members quotes council member rivera, all people for whom I have great affection and respect I, just wonder whether it's appropriate in a resolution of the community board to have a reference to some electeds and not all who have the same position, a I'm not going to say unanimous, but the fact that there is a kind of sea change in the way that people are looking at this right now, I personally, when I read that felt that it showed that we were all kind of locking arms in what we believe to be the priorities of the district I just wanted to second, exactly what clayton said: Okay joseph sorry to be repetitive, I'd like to third that and the only new take I have on it.
I think this is actually a question versus a comment, but the that lines 574 and 575 that they talk specifically about a reinvestment reduction, mitpd budget and reinvestment in communities, particularly when it comes to critical social services.
The point that is made in line 574 and 575, which is that the reinvestment of the move from the NYPD budget and reinvestment in communities particular comes to those social services is sort of it struck me I think that their reference should be kept in the resolution.
