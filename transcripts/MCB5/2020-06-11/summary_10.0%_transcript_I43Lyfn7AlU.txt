, I, remember saying it's the first time Talked about it afterwards in the history of community board So welcome to our third virtual board meeting I thought: I'd open tonight's meeting by reading Cb5's statement of Solidarity to protest.
According to the municipal, Arts Society New, York, City's housing stock is the fourth most segregated in America, and communities of color are dying from Covid-19 in disproportionate numbers.
We will continue to maintain an open forum to hear the concerns of the public and engage with the administration city agencies and other entities to exact the strongest possible solutions for social justice.
So I'd like to say that there is an awful lot of work that has to be done and our bex Committee will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing, models, access to housing, new approaches to criminal justice and the provision of education, educational equity to all students.
These meetings will be open to the public and community Board five and the beck's committee ask and encourage members of the public to attend and participate.
We are doing, that the Post act, which is about understanding new yorkers understanding how surveillance equipment is being used here in New, York City we're doing a bill, that's related to discipline and requiring that they publish- Mark will probably fulfill the ones I forgot, but we had a really meaningful and long public safety hearing the other day to talk about ways that the city can move forward.
Both I like counterfeiters and talk about his, but I think we both have been calling for the council to do more than what the mayor has recommended by a large margin when it comes to the budget.
Mayor's proposed budget basically makes essentially zero cuts in this fiscal year, but puts all the burden of cuts onto programs like summer youth, employment, we'll talk about composting in a bit which I have a bill on that.
All of us feel not just to look at the number and the numbers, but to look at the role of policing in New York City when it comes to transportation, homeless, services and mental health services and police, and as the schools to have a better idea of what we want policing to look like in the future.
If you have questions or businesses that want to know more about the grants, I've announced today, just have them reach out to my office.
I believe tonight, or at least discussing related to my bill on composting in New York City, which is one of the programs that was cut as part of the mayor's budget cuts and still an uncertain future.
Shortly, I think our budget, our budget, Committee Chair, Renee Kinsella, is joining like a coalition of other boards on helping small business.
There might be opportunities to do more, but also just ease regulations in the city, around small businesses, so renee I'll make sure I connect with her You to you all briefly in my capacity as chair of the health committee, about what I think is a very complicated upcoming phase in our battle against Coronavirus and, of course, as councilmember powers, and you.
Racing can interrupt that chain and what it means, and what it's meant now for 10 days is that if you get a positive test, result, you're going to get a call, those calls are going out and we need people to answer that call and complete an interview with the contact tracer to talk about who you may have been in contact with close contact for at least 10 minutes or more right.
You work with, but as we open and things like restaurants, come back, they'll probably be more avenues for exposure I think very few new yorkers even understand that this is happening and would be wary about talking to someone with such private information.
That's a lot that I've shared with you, but I want your help as community board members as community leaders, as ambassadors from public health to communicate no less than you've communicated on the importance of the census.
You know people need to go out and protest, but I've been really concerned about it becoming a public health crisis and causing you know quite an immediate spike, especially because it's you know the disproportionate deaths by Covid-19 and the black and brown communities.
But I was told by many organizations that actually the bigger issue is the fact that people on the ground in those protests were saying that the NYPD we're not wearing masks, and I was wondering if that was something that the council, you know, U.S health chair could address, but also in addition on that.
I guess a two- part question is anyone thinking about PPE that could be donated for the people that are out there, but also to enforce I'm sure the cops with all the money that they have PPE I've seen that some do and some are not wearing them, but how you know an enforcement issue needs to happen because this first and foremost, they're You, know we do not want people to die.
Are we setting if public sector workers are not doing that, And we're not going to stop until police officers are doing the right thing to protect their communities.
So, that's a little bit of an update, there, and also you should know that the speaker, along with council member Drum and Gibson, wrote a letter to De Blasio De Blasio about the inequities of the budget and how unfair it was that agencies like DYCD is, you know, being asked to cut 36 percent, but the police are being asked to cut less than one percent.
We believe that we do need to start breaking down a lot of the structural racism that has been in New, York, City and the police department and one of the ways we really need to do that through the budget.
One of the steps that we think we should be taking now is restarting our city's capital program as a way to invest in schools, affordable, housing, theaters outdoor spaces, to make sure that our city is ready to recover and reopen, and it's also one of the best job multipliers to get our city going and on the cobra front.
The peaceful protests have been, I, think, obviously far outnumbering, anything that involves property damage, And I'm, happy to say that I passed a bill this week called the police stat It's called the police statistics and transparency act and for the first time, New York's, going to be collecting statistical data from ranging from low- level misdemeanors all the way to deaths, while in custody.
We put out a letter or open statement from Carlina and a couple of local black women leaders from lower Manhattan, addressing both, I think, The nypd's over enforcement and escalation in protests, but also the fact that the city did not do enough to put our small businesses in a better place to be kept safe and protected, particularly as they were being you know, addressed, you know, being hit by.
You know, I think, there's been a lot of really great things coming from the community on ways to address police issues, and you know happy to hear from anyone else.
As Senator, Hoyman, said, Brad, Blizz too, was very happy and very satisfied to be an elected representative up in Albany having passed, help to pass so many of this comprehensive legislation to confront the policing and public safety issues in our city to follow up on that just know that next week we are going to be hosting two virtual town halls on topics that were brought up this evening on next Wednesday June 17th liz will be in conversation with Insha Rahman, who is the director of strategies and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice to discuss this issue of policing and public safety going forward.
We have Betsy Schmidt from Congresswoman Carol Maloney's, office, We just wanted to put out you know things as well, just about with all people acrosss the country protesting marching to condemn police violence, demand justice and declare unequivocally that black lives, matter.
She's supporting Rep Presley's house resolution, 988 condemning all acts of police, brutality, Rep, Justin Amash's in qualified immunity, act, which would end the practice of qualified immunity which protects officers from civil suits, H.R 4359, the peace act, which would require law enforcement to use de- escalation techniques and use force only as a last resort, as well as Rep Jeffrey's, HR, 4408, Eric, Garner, excessive use of force prevention act which would ban the use of choke holds by law.
Let me see, what's available, for individuals to donate okay, thank you, and this is Jeremy I'll, just say generally like When there's like so many different types of places, you can donate But, like I think when in doubt the best place to donate right now is like the mayor's fund to advance New York City, because that is going to a bunch of different things and because that is a quasi- government nonprofit organization that can sometimes more easily donate to small businesses, which are for profit ventures than the city can, through other funding.
Members of the public are invited to speak on issues that they think would be of importance to the board.
You can hear me now sorry, the state liquor thought it was on the phone And you might want to have them come and discuss what would be relevant for your topic, because the short version is that if a restaurant is simply going to a little bit in the outdoor cafe or even perpendicular out into a parking space, there is not a lot of forms to fill.
I think we've been working a lot on that issue of more street space for the restaurants.
That's, something that needs to be decided very quickly, and I know that independent budget office did an analysis of some of this today in September school , I believe, there's 178,000 young people going to summer school.
This would be another project that people want to work on that we're now working with the executive superintendent in Manhattan, because I know jcc to their credit, has 200 volunteer tutors and they are all signed off on by the Department of Education They're, all fingerprinted, et cetera, so they're going to help starting working with students, because if you did not get through during the year, I do not know if you're going to get through during the summer.
We've got a resolution tonight that comes to the opposite: conclusion, because we've been getting a lot of complaints about people loitering in front of restaurants that are serving liquor, not respecting social distancing and we've been having a lot of trouble with with things that would be resolved by the open container, law.
I've been shut down during this whole Covid-19 time, but I've stayed in New, York The low under- resourced communities have been in our city and those majority black and brown populations, and I just think.
Now it's such an important time to really look at the budget and look at the six billion dollars that NYPD has and really think about how pulling finding some excess in there and pulling it out and being able to put it into resources that the communities really need right now in order to rebuild whether it's mental health or youth, employment or housing, or food banks or anything.
This time, only board members will participate by hearing reports and opining on agenda items that are presented by committee chairs by way of questions.
That's me, and my report to the board this evening is to bring something to the board's attention, which is the Community Board Committee's letters to the mayor regarding shaping the city's response to Covid-19.
I'm, not sure if everyone knows at our last full board, meeting borough, President Gail Brewer spoke of the mayor, having established several advisory councils to help the city reopen and recover from the coronavirus.
We want parity in any budget cuts, but believe that housing, the summer youth employment program in our schools, areas, where we've always called for more funding, must not be duly impacted by the deficit.
The general thinking at this point is that outdoor seating is much safer than indoor seating with recirculated air and close quarters and difficulty social distancing, because this is a proposal that has very few examples or precedents in New, York City, and we do not receive proposals like this very frequently.
That would charge the city most likely, the Department of transportation, to select streets to close and the DCA to issue these permits to create this new permitting scheme very quickly, because the proposal, you know, as you heard, a lot about tonight, was moving very quickly and because New York, City ha itself has already moved into phase one and because, while restaurants and bars are slated to be in phase three and the state is already allowing outdoor dining in other regions, seemingly already in phase two.
We ask that the city work closely with the local bids to establish security for any closed area, to clearly define whether or not the business is responsible for enforcing the social distancing and the safety of customers that define who is responsible for setting up erecting barriers and ensuring the safety of everybody on the on the closed block or lane that they relax signage regulations, so that the restaurants can advertise themselves and their outdoor areas and coordinate with food trucks.
The joint committee meeting about outdoor dining Tne, also met to have a wide- ranging discussion about all the other effects that the Kova crisis is having on the transportation and environment of our district and to express the sense of the committee around our concerns and suggestions regarding the city's response.
And so you know we wanted to emphasize that the plans should not just be looked at in the context of the crisis, but also We agreed on some broad principles, first, that actions that the city takes be rooted in research and data and accompanied with very consistent reporting about changes that are being made and their effects.
We also wanted to emphasize the second half of our committee's name, the environment, and to ensure that the city is looking at and providing data on noise and pollution and other environmental effects that are affected by any of the types of proposals or changes that we that we just mentioned.
There are a lot of questions about how the city can ensure that our parks can stay welcoming and accessible and maintained, especially given the prediction that they will get more intense use this summer than ever.
We have questions about how the city will work with them in managing the crisis and their contractual obligations, for example, phase two, which will allow for the extended outdoor, dining proposal.
Was the DOT commissioner's recent public statement that the city's enforcement of the new outdoor dining spaces would be handled quote with a light touch?
We, certainly appreciate that, and therefore the land Use Committee is very much committed to continuing to work on these issues as they are ongoing and, as we better understand the needs that the city is going to have to evolve to to address these, these health issues.
First, one is an issue that vicky underscored in her initial statement, introducing the work that the committees have done, which is that currently, the mayor has created a number of advisory, councils, 10 of them to be to be precise, and in the this These advisory councils are, you know, made up of a number of individuals who have you know some level of expertise, but it is really striking to see that there are actually no community activists and, as Vicky said, no community board members who have been appointed to to these councils- So we took it upon ourselves as you've seen throughout the review of these letters done by other committees and by my colleagues that you know, we've been hard at work doing that.
But we also want to tell the mayor that community board members should be appointed to these advisory councils, and we know that other community boards feel the same way.
You, know the mayor and the City Council to create a system, a mechanism that is going to give us an opportunity to be consulted, weigh in so have a reactive response, but also have a proactive approach to the urban and land use issues and broader issues.
We are asking for a planned vision of what services, what infrastructure both on The, you know, the sort of like hard shell of our city.
If that's okay, given that I want to do the third, if that's okay with you, let's give it a try So we also had an application, and this application is for the renewal of a chair certification for an open- air cafe in a public plaza.
The developer got a much taller building than they would have so the way the committee has approached these resolutions and these applications is to basically say we will support the cafe.
Resolutions, and I want to thank Wally, Kim Luke and at the board office as well.
My I was concerned about this whole issue of what can we do if all of these people that are out on the street or loosening the rules for good reason, and we all agreed that it was critical for all these restaurants and small business to get out there?
Alcohol, and I know that I think that Kendall offered to speak to it, but our understanding was that there's already the ability for liquor stores to do delivery, and so the question was in the time in this moment in Covid-19, when restaurants have are having such trouble with their potential trouble with their business.
That's that was, I guess, my logic in why we were supporting it, and then we just wanted to make sure that the loopholes that a lot of people have experienced around getting deliveries and not having to show Thank, you, July.
I mean that's just known, so I guess just to put a finer point on what you take back to the senator and what you guys think about moving forward the proposed legislation, just saying, it'd be required it just it kind of is not enough, because it's already the law- What can be done to actually take that a little more seriously, especially given that I think, until we are fully reopened and back in a normal world, people are going to be having private parties.
But I just wanted to thank the committee for the really great work.
Since time is of the essence, and this week and next week the budget will be finalized by the mayor and the City Council, and since it did not go through the beck's committee, the whole board must now act as a committee, which means that we are now.
When the mayor, issued his executive budget and that's what comes out in April, it immediately and specifically called for cuts to some programming like the summer.
We, do not want the city funding to be cut for children or programs and agencies that strengthen underfunded and underserved communities that need our support right now, more than ever, but perhaps more importantly.
We as a board start looking at the budget and our request in June as we prepare our community needs.
Other thing I would say is that I know that some people have voiced their interest in police.
One reason why I like those references is because all three of our council members are sharing our position so aside from whatever idea about politics or optics or something we work to represent the constituents in our district, as do they and the fact that there is A I'm, not going to say unanimous, but the fact that there is a kind of sea change in the way that people are looking at this I.
I think this is actually a question versus a comment, but the that lines 574 and 575 that they talk specifically about a reinvestment, reduction, mitpd budget and reinvestment in communities, particularly when it comes to critical social services.
I think it would be remiss of us to pass a resolution on the Nypd's budget without mentioning police brutality specifically.
