Five The executive committee meets once a month for the purpose of being apprised by each committee, chair of actions and or discussions that have been taking place at the committee level, which leads us to our main purpose, which is to form and finalize the agenda for the full board meeting the executive committee, Members of the public are provided the opportunity to attend the meeting in person or in the case of the pandemic, to attend during a virtual meeting Anyone who is attending the meeting as a non-member may sign in as an attendee see we have three There will be a public session at the beginning of the meeting, where anyone who is interested in speaking will have two minutes.
Just to let everyone know that, at the end of our business session, the committee will be moving into an executive session, which means that there will be an opportunity to deal with one of eight subject: area: exemptions to the open meetings.
The applicant is proposing to install plexiglas partitions to delineate the the area and we felt that it was tasteful and that it was appropriate, and the committee voted unanimously to approve the request.
You know, pass through all the various pieces, but it was very helpful that the applicant was able to to brief the committee ahead of the actual action when they come next month.
It's no action, but I wanted to make sure that the exact committee is aware that the court theater appeared at our land use meeting Is there a definite timeline on that or do they have to come next week?
This was actually the very first skyscraper in built in new york city The committee felt that the proposed replacement was adequate, mostly because the roof is is not visible, except for very minor visibility from far away and that the proposed roof treatment did not detract from the quality of the of the building, and we voted to approve the application unanimously.
The first rezo took us two meetings to put together because we had a very robust conversation, lots of people joined in about the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD What we ultimately did was we used the template that the transportation committee had developed as a way of organizing the conversation into the facts and core principles and then recommendations.
2021 executive budget You remember that came out at end of June, beginning of july 1st, which was the distribution of cuts among the agencies, and so it's We had a lot of concern about people who were impacted by Covid-19 and the new york city police department, and we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into our board's fiscal 2022 budget request.
It was sort of following the transportation template transportation committee, template When we, you have to remember we're going back two months, but at the time of our discussion there was at least a nine billion dollar hole in tax revenue to the city that was being lost for fiscal year 2021 and the preliminary executive budget was making up a lot of that loss through cuts to social services, housing, education, infrastructure, You may remember the youth education program There were a lot of people calling for a billion dollars to be removed from NYPD funding in that 21 budget.
I think they would agree with me that this has become such an important committee on community board five and the work that you and julie and all your members have been I, don't know how we would have handled the whole Covid-19 issue without bex being led by these two people.
but I have to say it's mostly the committee you've got really great people, fabulous people, I, don't know what happened to it, but I also just wanted to add that there were a number of people, members of the public and others who spoke at our June cycle and weighed in about this issue, who I'm sure would be very interested who might not normally attend our meetings and so I'm wondering if we might want to look at that sign-in sheet from june's full board meeting in order to identify who those people were.
But I, don't know that it merits a report during a full board meeting, because we fully expect them to come back to us again next month with a final version of that complete street proposal and so anything that we would anything that we would report out now would be would be incomplete, particularly in terms of the configuration of fifth avenue and the final rules of the final busway rules and whether or not they'll be the same type of rules.
