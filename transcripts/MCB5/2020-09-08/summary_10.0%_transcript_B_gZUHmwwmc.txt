We will start the meeting with a public session, followed by the committee moving into the business session, where only members of the committee will be recognized during discussion.
The main purpose of the executive committee meeting is to form and finalize the agenda for thursday night's full board.

The applicant is proposing to install plexiglas partitions to delineate the the area and we felt that it was tasteful and that it was appropriate, and the committee voted unanimously to approve the request.
But I'm sure that next month, we'll be able to you know, pass through all the various pieces, but it was very helpful that the applicant was able to to brief the committee ahead of the actual action when they come next month.
The first was the committee's consideration, the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD, and the second was the support of the small business tax credit against the commercial rent.
You, remember that came out at end of June, beginning of July 1st, which was the distribution of cuts among the agencies, and so it's We had a lot of concern about people who were impacted by Covid-19 and the new york city police department, and we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into our board's fiscal 2022 budget.
You may remember the youth education program and it was impacting seniors, kids, communities of color There were a lot of people calling for a billion dollars to be removed from NYPD funding in that 21, budget, and What actually passed was that the NYPD was allocated 5.22 billion dollars, which ended up being a 414 million dollar reduction and they saved it by cutting only 55 million by cutting one of the annual classes of new recruits by putting a hiring freeze on non-safety positions, filling fewer dea, vacancies, canceling one cadet class and reducing some of their outside contracts.
There were a lot of people involved and as part of our advisory process for budget recommendations and in association with our record of supporting schools and children and communities of color and frontline service workers, and our conversations about how resources for public safety should be allocated.
We ask for in our resolutions is for clear and honest communication from elected officials about the budget decisions, a formal plan to achieve targeted reduction in NYPD overtime, spending, a full report on the shift of some of the homeless outreach services from the NYPD to the DHS and from NYPD to the DOE.
I think they would agree with me that this has become such an important committee on community board five and the work that you and julie and all your members have been I, don't know how we would have handled the whole Covid-19 issue without bex being led by these two people.
Don't know what happened to it, but I also just wanted to add that there were a number of people, members of the public and others who spoke at our June cycle and weighed in about this issue, who I'm sure would be very interested who might not normally attend our meetings, and so I'm wondering if we might want to look at that sign-in sheet from june's full board meeting in order to identify who those people were, if possible, just to make sure that I mean.

In, particular, I I look forward to having a conversation either exec or with the committee chairs about how we might all want to weigh in on this, because there's obvious land use ramifications, but also they really are asking for our help to weigh in on this idea when it comes to our requests for the budget as well.
But I don't know that it merits a report during a full board meeting, because we fully expect them to come back to us again next month with a final version of that complete street proposal and so anything that we would anything that we would report out now would be would be incomplete, particularly in terms of the configuration of fifth avenue and the final rules of the final busway rules and whether or not they'll be the same type of rules.
