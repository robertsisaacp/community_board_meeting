The executive committee meets once a month for the purpose of being apprised by each committee, chair of actions and or discussions that have been taking place at the committee level, which leads us to our main purpose, which is to form and finalize the agenda for the full board.
We will start the meeting with a public session, followed by the committee moving into the business session, where only members of the committee will be recognized during discussion.
The main purpose of the executive committee meeting is to form and finalize the agenda for Thursday night's full board.
At the end of our business session, the committee will be moving into an executive session, which means that there will be an opportunity to deal with one of eight subject: area: exemptions to the open meetings.
The applicant is proposing to install plexiglas partitions to delineate the the area, and we felt that it was tasteful and that it was appropriate, and the committee voted unanimously to approve the request.
But I'm sure that next month, we'll be able to you know, pass through all the various pieces, but it was very helpful that the applicant was able to to brief the committee ahead of the actual action when they come next month.
It's no action, but I wanted to make sure that the exact committee is aware that the court theater appeared at our land use meeting.
The committee felt that it was actually an improvement because they're relocating some mechanical equipment that is currently visible to areas that will be non- visible, And, we're actually quite excited, and we voted to approve this proposal.
The first was the committee's consideration, the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD, and the second was the support of the small business tax credit against the commercial rent.
We had a lot of concern about people who were impacted by Covid-19 and the New York City Police Department, and we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into our board's fiscal 2022 budget.
There were a lot of people calling for a billion dollars to be removed from NYPD funding in that 21, budget, and What actually passed was that the NYPD was allocated 5.22 billion dollars, which ended up being a 414 million dollar reduction and they saved it by cutting only 55 million by cutting one of the annual classes of new recruits by putting a hiring freeze on non- safety, positions, filling fewer Dea, vacancies, canceling one cadet class and reducing some of their outside contracts.
The safety agents and the school crossing guards to NYPD and the New York City's independent budget office said that this really meant that the DOE was going to operate a program that had already been underwritten because they had already been sending 307 million to the NYPD for the school safety program.
There were a lot of people involved and as part of our advisory process for budget recommendations and in association with our record of supporting schools and children and communities of color and frontline service workers, and our conversations about how resources for public safety should be allocated.
What we ask for in our resolutions, is for clear and honest communication from elected officials about the budget decisions, a formal plan to achieve targeted reduction in NYPD overtime, spending, a full report on the shift of some of the homeless outreach services from the NYPD to the DHS and from NYPD to the DOE.
I think they would agree with me that this has become such an important committee on Community, Board five and the work that you and Julie and all your members have been I, do not know how we would have handled the whole Covid-19 issue without bex being led by these two people.
This cycle, but I did want to let everyone know that we are following open street dining and our district has encountered very few complaints.
They have released a policy report and recommendation advocating for the creation of a position in city government titled director of the public realm, and it is the type of creative top level big idea, thinking that we rarely see- That is very refreshing and exciting, and the committee was thrilled to hear this excellent presentation.
In, particular, I I look forward to having a conversation either exec or with the committee chairs about how we might all want to weigh in on this, because there's obvious land use ramifications, but also they really are asking for our help to weigh in on this idea when it comes to our requests for the budget as well.
But I do not know that it merits a report during a full board meeting, because we fully expect them to come back to us again next month with a final version of that complete street proposal and so anything that we would anything that we would report out now would be would be incomplete, particularly in terms of the configuration of Fifth Avenue and the final rules of the final Busway rules.
September this month, run by DOT We, anticipate another cab meeting before DOT decides or announces any of their any of the rules or configurations of their final proposal, and then I anticipate we'll hear again about the community's concerns and responses to that I think he was, and also fred cirillo from Grand Central, because even though there's a small portion of it with grand central people are very concerned over how that whole thing is going to play out with residential vehicles.
