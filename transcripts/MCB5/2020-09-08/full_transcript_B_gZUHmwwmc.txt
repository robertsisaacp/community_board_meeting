So hope everyone had an enjoyable wonderful labor day weekend. This is the executive meeting of Community Board five. The executive committee meets once a month for the purpose of being apprised by each committee, chair of actions and or discussions that have been taking place at the committee level, which leads us to our main purpose, which is to form and finalize the agenda for the full board meeting the executive committee. Seldom takes action, however, on rare occasions and in emergency situations will do so. This evening we have no such actions. Members of the public are provided the opportunity to attend the meeting in person or in the case of the pandemic, to attend during a virtual meeting. So anyone who is attending the meeting as a non- member may sign in as an attendee see we have three. There will be a public session at the beginning of the meeting, where anyone who is interested in speaking will have two minutes. Please use the raised hair hand feature to be called on. We will start the meeting with a public session, followed by the committee moving into the business session, where only members of the committee will be recognized during discussion. Please keep in mind that this group will not be deliberating or voting on any issues this evening again, the main purpose of the executive committee meeting is to form and finalize the agenda for Thursday night's full board meeting. However, all members of the public are encouraged to sign up for and participate in the public session of the full board meeting on Thursday if they wish to speak to issues that are before the board for action and any other matters that may be of common interest to the board, something out of the ordinary this evening. Just to let everyone know that, at the end of our business session, the committee will be moving into an executive session, which means that there will be an opportunity to deal with one of eight subject: area: exemptions to the open meetings law. Only members of the committee will be in attendance and anyone else will be unable to observe the meeting at the end of the executive session. The committee will adjourn that meeting return to the business session of the committee and immediately adjourn the business session of this evening's meeting. It's a little cumbersome, but that is the procedure as per the committee on open meetings, so without further Ado. I will now open the public session I'll see if anyone is interested in. I do not see anyone with a raised hand and we have four people. So this is, you know the public session. If anybody would like to speak at this meeting now, is the time feel free to raise your hand, and you will be allowed to speak for two minutes. Okay, I see none. We have four attendees, so we will move into our business session. Let us start with our committee reports, starting with land use, housing and zone zoning layla all right good evening, good afternoon, hope everyone had a good weekend. We had two items during our land use, housing and committee meeting, but only one action item, so I'm going to go through this one first, this is an application by the Ibm building. They are proposing to legalize tables and chairs that are adjacent to a kiosk inside a privately owned public space that is unclosed. It is one of the most successful pubs in the city, and this this pops is actually quite interesting, because not areas of this course that are all public and opened open to the public. Not all of those areas were actually generating a bonus, and the area in question where the tables and chairs are being proposed is actually in the non- bonus section of of the pops. As such, the committee felt that adding chairs and tables for the sole purpose of the serving the patrons of the kiosk was appropriate. Initially, when the the space was constructed, it was actually planned for private use and news that were contemplated were a newsstand or a a flower booth. So the committee felt that a private use such as a service area, was in keeping with the initial provisions. The applicant is proposing to install plexiglas partitions to delineate the the area and we felt that it was tasteful and that it was appropriate, and the committee voted unanimously to approve the request. Okay, anybody have any questions about this or any comments. Okay leila, you are on for landmarks, okay, so for landmarks. Let me actually pull sorry, so we had three application. Oh no, I'm sorry! I actually want to stay on land use. Very briefly. To mention that the court theater appeared in front of the committee. It was for information purposes they are proposing. They have a land use action that is pending. They will be certified very soon and they will return to the committee next month because by then they will have been certified. It is a transfer of air rights that they're seeking approval of it is a euler action and they came to give us a a presentation. It is a really very technical application and but I'm sure that next month, we'll be able to you know, pass through all the various pieces, but it was very helpful that the applicant was able to to brief the committee ahead of the actual action when they come next month. So it's no action, but I wanted to make sure that the exact committee is aware that the court theater appeared at our land use meeting. Is there a definite timeline on that or do they have to come next week next month? Yes, they do they do and they were not. We were not able to vote or take action at this past meeting because they had not yet been certified, so the clock will start ticking when they are certified, which I believe is going to be next week. Okay, so they will return for our October cycle. Okay, okay, so moving on to landmarks, we had three applications. The first one is 130 West 42Nd street. This is the Bush tower. This was actually the very first skyscraper in built in New York City. The application is for roof replacement. So it was interesting because they're really proposing something that is pretty extensive. The existing roof, which is the historic roof, is copper. It has deteriorated beyond repair, it's actually been patched and repaired many times it is currently covered with a sort of mastic type of of coating. So the copper itself is actually non- visible currently and the applicant is proposing to put to use a a resin that is going to have the color of copper, but it that is much easier to install and has a better wind resistance. This is a fairly exposed roof that has suffered from wind damage. So, although they're not proposing to use the original material, the committee felt that the proposed replacement was adequate, mostly because the roof is is not visible, except for very minor visibility from far away and that the proposed roof treatment did not detract from the quality of the of the building and we voted to approve the application unanimously. Okay, that's great any questions or any comments from anyone on the committee. Okay, the next one layla. Next one is 201 park, Avenue South, which is also 51 East 17th street. This is the currently the W hotel, which is to be the guardian life insurance building at the corner of Park Avenue South in 17. A very fine and well- known, building very well recognizable for its very large neon side, sign on the roof and it's a four- story. Mansard Roof, the applicant is proposing to do a rooftop edition, which, initially, when we read the description, got us a little nervous. What they're proposing actually is to relocate all the mechanical equipment, some of it, some of which is currently visible and to push it in areas that is non- visible and to build a one- story addition that will serve as a lounge and bar area for patrons of the hotel. All of it will be non- visible, with the exception of a tiny minuscule sliver that will actually blend with the background. The primary facades are in no way impacted by this edition. The proposed structure is tasteful and very elegant. The committee felt that it was actually an improvement because they're relocating some mechanical equipment that is currently visible to areas that will be non- visible and we're actually quite excited, and we voted to approve this proposal unanimous approval. I, like those unanimous approvals. Okay, any questions, any comments: okay, next one layla and the final one is 135Th Avenue. This is a an application for the replacement of storefronts on West, 18Th, Street and Fifth Avenue. Currently, it is occupied by express the clothing brand and the applicant is cvs. They are proposing to do some storefront reconfiguration, the the main one that was the point of most of our discussion is that they're proposing to turn a window into a door and they want to make this door a automatic door. We had great issues with the opening mechanism. Opening automatic doors in historic districts, especially in the ladies mile, are really non- contextual. The committee felt that this proposal was not appropriate and we voted to deny. We also had concerns about the amount of lighting. Although the lighting that concerns us is interior, it will bleed into the street as CBS. You know, for their branding has a pretty pretty strong lighting and we felt that this was also problematic, so which was a denial and once again, unanimous folks, Yay okay, so that was a deny unanimously. Okay, anybody have any questions on that one or any comments all right, seeing none we're going to move to x. Rene. Sorry about that. Thank you, hi everybody. We had two meetings since the last full board. The first was on August 4th and the second was on August 25th, and from that we had six issues, but only two resolutions. The first was the committee's consideration, the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD, and the second was the support of the small business tax credit against the commercial rent tax. The first rezo took us two meetings to put together because we had a very robust conversation, lots of people joined in about the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD. What we ultimately did was we used the template that the transportation committee had developed as a way of organizing the conversation into the facts and core principles and then recommendations. Our second resolution is similar to one we had previously supported regarding the commercial rent tax. I'll talk about that. One first, businesses below 96th street are subject to a commercial rent tax which is 3.9 percent. It's a levy on annual rent applied to businesses who pay more than half a million dollars in annual rent and more than 5 million in annual revenue. So in 2017 you may remember our council member grodnich Lesson that he raised a 250,000 rent threshold to half a million dollars for those businesses earning 5 million in revenue or less, and that was to protect small businesses, and there was a sliding scale that also followed that bill was supported by CB5 and then it was implemented in June 2018. council member powers has introduced a bill intro to 2007 to 2020, which would suspend the commercial rent tax during Covid-19 for all businesses paying less than a million dollars in rent, regardless of business income. So our committee had a really good discussion. We were really concerned about how many businesses fell into the suspension that were chain stores or entities that really did not need the relief. We looked at 2019 data and it seemed that this bill was going to cost the city about 21 million dollars in tax revenue. So there's a real tension between alleviating the burden for small businesses and those that needed relief and keeping it for those that could still pay it. We ultimately had a unanimous vote in favor of the bill, with the recommendation that the council consider exempting those that are not in need. We left it to the council to figure out how to do that, but there was anonymous approval of the proposed bill, so you have one reso. No, we have two, the other one is a resolution. Also, okay, all right. Does anyone have any questions on this one or any comments? Okay, we will go to the second one. Okay, our second resolution is very long and it was our response to the fiscal year 2021 executive budget. You remember that came out at end of June, beginning of July 1st, which was the distribution of cuts among the agencies, and so it's you know. There was a lot of. We had a lot of concern about people who were impacted by Covid-19 and the New York City Police Department, and we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into our board's fiscal 2022 budget request. It was sort of following the transportation, Template transportation committee template. So when we, you have to remember we're going back two months, but at the time of our discussion there was at least a nine billion dollar hole in tax revenue to the city that was being lost for fiscal year 2021 and the preliminary executive budget was making up a lot of that loss through cuts to social services, housing, education, infrastructure. You may remember the youth education program and it was impacting seniors, kids, communities of color and it was leaving the NYPD pretty much unscathed. There were a lot of people calling for a billion dollars to be removed from NYPD funding in that 21 budget, and what actually passed was that the NYPD was allocated 5.22 billion dollars, which ended up being a 414 million dollar reduction and they saved it by cutting only 55 million by cutting one of the annual classes of new recruits by putting a hiring freeze on non- safety positions, filling fewer Dea vacancies, canceling one cadet class and reducing some of their outside contracts. They also shifted some of the homeless outreach services to DHS. The problem that we saw in this was that the NYPD had been exceeding its overtime budget by 398 million and 407 million in 2019 and 2020, and this budget reduced overtime spending by 60, but there was no real, but that was in 21, but after fiscal year 21 there was no reference to reducing overtime. Another issue that we saw was that the budget counted on partial hiring freezes at most agencies and with agreements with the city's municipal labor for about a billion in labor savings and potentially layups, as you know, for up to 22,000 workers, but all but 62 million of the reduction of the NYPD budget reduction comprised either fringe benefits, unenforceable, overtime and future commitments that were not really included in the signed budget itself. It also included a future commitment that school safety agents and a shift of the school crofting crossing guards to DOE, so it just shifted from the NYPD. The safety agents and the school crossing guards to NYPD and the New York City's independent budget office said that this really meant that the DOE was going to operate a program that had already been underwritten because they had already been sending 307 million to the NYPD for the school safety program. Anyway, we also found it hard to see the units of appropriation in the NYPD budget, they're, really broad, really hard to parse. We need a lot of people in to try and explain it to us, but it was very difficult for us and we believe for the public and elected officials to really provide any clear oversight on Nypd's spending. So we talked about all of this. There were a lot of people involved and as part of our advisory process for budget recommendations and in association with our record of supporting schools and children and communities of color and frontline service workers, and our conversations about how resources for public safety should be allocated. We created a set of core principles that would guide us when making our budget recommendations. They are in the resolution that you see, but it's that the budget is really a statement of values so that municipal budgets are a fraction of the city's values and we want them to be diverse, provide economic opportunity and inclusion, and we think our budget decision should be made in alignment with those values. We think there should be an efficient use of funds. There should be equal opportunity that budget decisions must be made in alignment with the self- described mission of the given agency, so in the case of NYPD, very specifically, it's to enhance the quality of life in New York City by working in partnership with the community. We think that you know the purpose of mission needs to be front and center. That city agencies should reflect the diversity of New York City, that there should be transparency and accountability. There should be ethical, legal, behavior and trust and respect. So we came to the conclusion that there was a failure in prioritizing frontline services during the pandemic and that budget cuts should be fairly distributed. Acrosss agencies, including the NYPD. What we ask for in our resolutions is for clear and honest communication from elected officials about the budget decisions, a formal plan to achieve targeted reduction in NYPD overtime spending, a full report on the shift of some of the homeless outreach services from the NYPD to the DHS and from NYPD to the DOE. We ask that the Office of Management and budget work with NYPD to develop fiscal 2022 budget appropriations that are organized so you can compare year to year and that you can really understand what you're talking about so you're, not talking about apples and oranges and also to standardize the formatting of the past spending so that we could compare budget line to budget line. We also asked in our resolution that the NYPD released detailed information on annual on an annual basis about its spending on the acquisition and maintenance of military- grade equipment and their specific projected uses. And then we also asked our formal plan to enable and require NYPD to dismiss, rather than keep on modified duty, those who've committed illegal or unethical behavior, and we want and would like the city to reconsider the role that police officers should play in the city and to think about alternative agencies and initiatives that might better accomplish aspects of the Nypd's mission. I know that was a lot, so that was our resolution and it was unanimously approved incredible resolution. I mean I do not know, but it was really unbelievable. What month did we pass the first resolution on lightly touching on this? Was it so? The August 4th the August 4th meeting was when we had. We had a lot of people attending that meeting. I think it was very topical at the time, so we had a lot of people and the meeting went on for a long period of time. We took all the notes on August 4th did not take a resolution. We asked. We said that we would come back on August 25th, which we did and put it into a resolution format which we did and then we had friendly modifications to that on the 25th which resulted in this resolution, but did not. We also touch upon that in a resolution right after the protests started and everything. I think that's what I was referring to. Yes, very briefly right, but we did not. Yes, I mean we refer to this, that our support, for you know fair funding acrosss when we say that CB5 is supported, fair funding, acrosss all agencies. That was a brief resolution we had just before the budget came out. Yes, I believe that was our June resolution, yeah, okay, but we were waiting because we could not really it did not make sense in terms of the numbers until we knew the numbers right. So we wanted to wait for the budget to be issued, so that's sort of how this all played out just in terms of a timeline incredible. Does anyone have any questions or comments on this? I have a quick question: renee. Are there any other areas of the budget that we are sort of mandated to to respond to? Can you just refresh our memory on the the process for commenting on the on the executive budget? Sure so leila? We had already. We do not we're not required for the executive for this portion of the budget. We just felt compelled to weigh in at this point, given what was happening and how people felt in the comments we're having for the community. So when the budget comes out our next piece of this, it's a circular piece, we will be making recommendations for requests. Our capital and executive requests will come about in October and then that won't be digested and brought to the fore until next year and then, once that preliminary budget comes out, then we'll be asked to comment. Okay, thank you. Okay, anybody else, I'm going to say this out loud because I said it to renee. I can not thank her enough for the direction she has really. I mean it renee. It's really true the with the help of Julie who's been in there right behind you and with you all of those of us who have been on the board before you took over becks. I think they would agree with me that this has become such an important committee on Community, Board five and the work that you and Julie and all your members have been doing- and I said to I said this to renee earlier, but I want to say it again and that is I do not know how we would have handled the whole Covid-19 issue without bex being led by these two people, so I just want to say a big fat. Thank you. Thank you so much, but I have to say it's mostly the committee. It really is, this is hard stuff and they yeah you've got some you've got really great people, fabulous people, absolutely fabulous clayton thanks good thanks for the reason I do not have a raised hand feature anymore. I do not know what happened to it, but I also just wanted to add that there were a number of people, members of the public and others who spoke at our June cycle and weighed in about this issue, who I'm sure would be very interested who might not normally attend our meetings, and so I'm wondering if we might want to look at that sign- in sheet from June's full board meeting in order to identify who those people were, if possible, just to make sure that I mean obviously there might be on our email list, but to make sure they know that this is on the agenda, because you know we want to make sure there's people know there's follow up on this. That's a good point, okay, anything else. I do I just if I, if I could mention that we have a clean up day. I do not know. If is this the appropriate time to mention cleanup sure great, we are partnering with Speaker Johnson's office and fit to clean up the block between 26th street between 7th and 8Th Avenue, this saturday at 10 o'clock. You guys can all sign up. It's on our website. The flyer is going to be circulated and the department of sanitation is going to provide all the shovels and the bags and everything we need to pick up the trash on the on the block. If you guys it's been, there's 106 million dollars cut from the sanitation budget, and so things are tight and collections are have not been what they once were. So every little bit helps what was the Block 26Th Street between 7th and 8th, we're meeting on the east side of 26Th Street, the East Southeast side. I should say, and the day this saturday it is the I want to say the 12th right, the 12th 10 o'clock, 10 A.M 12 at 10, A.M, okay, I just want to say also for information purposes. We had a presentation from nyu who will be taking over the W hotel in union square. Their students are going to be housed there. They provided a telephone number to us. Should we encounter any clustering problems, they're trying not to do that. There's one student per room I'll. Just let you know that the restaurant there is not being run by Nyu. That's something separate, but if you have clustering problems or have a problem, we can share that number with you. Okay, going back to cleanup is that on our website, I think I saw it I had asked. I do not know if Luke's there I had sent it to him to ask but it'd be put up. I did not check yeah, so I can definitely put it up. I did not know if there was a final approval here, but yeah. That is something definitely that we'll put up on the website. Okay, good, okay, renee! Thank you again, anything else that anyone has any questions or issues. Can I give a brief report from psql sure Ps2L does not have any resolutions for us tonight this cycle, but I did want to let everyone know that we are following open street dining and our district has encountered very few complaints. The number of complaints we received- I mean maybe three- and I think only one of those was legitimate, so CB5 is doing very well as far as open street dining we're going to continue to monitor it. We have been seeing anecdotally, what's been going on in other districts and we're confident that the SLA is doing the enforcement that they need to. So if we ever do have problems, we feel confident that there are methods in place to address them. You know, I think I saw the figures on how many are in CB5. Do you know offhand, or did you see them? I think we have a huge number do not we. I heard that as well. It's a very large number and surprisingly few complaints because of it yeah, that's great. Everybody is adhering to what they're supposed to be adhering to. Obviously, okay, I do not know. I do not know about that, but we are not getting complaints, okay and I'm sure if there were people were violating what they were supposed to do and we'd be hearing about it. Sure, okay, anything else! I at this point I think we should. I want to make sure that the order is okay. I'd love to just give a update about the non- agenda item for parks sure. So we had two non- action items at committee this month, but one of them was super exciting and I just wanted to alert you guys to it. You might have already seen the press release from municipal art society in collaboration with New Yorker, New Yorkers for parks. They have released a policy report and recommendation advocating for the creation of a position in city government titled director of the public realm, and it is the type of creative top level big idea, thinking that we rarely see- and that is very refreshing and exciting, and the committee was thrilled to hear this excellent presentation. We did not take a vote on this because it's an extremely early stage proposal- and it's not quite appropriate since there's so many questions yet to be fleshed out, but our input and concerns and questions and feedback was quite appreciated by them as they continue to develop this idea- and we are going to. We did agree to send a letter of support to whomever in the administration, our city council. It would be useful to do they're recommending that this position be created as a mayoral office position. So it would not be a city agency which would because creating a new city agency is basically a non- starter for a zillion reasons so and a person in that position at that level would, in theory, have the authority to coordinate and communicate between all the very many city agencies that govern all the very many different types of public spaces. So we're talking about pops as well private entities, I mean that are publicly owned, private spaces privately on public spaces. Sorry, the pedestrian plazas, our parks, of course, sidewalks, there's some still, some uncertainty about street bed and street fares and how streets would play into it. But all these questions are things that we're going to be continuing to look forward to how they roll out and when it comes to land use and becks. In particular, I I look forward to having a conversation either exec or with the committee chairs about how we might all want to weigh in on this, because there's obvious land use ramifications, but also they really are asking for our help to weigh in on this idea when it comes to our requests for the budget as well. So there's a lot of interesting questions before us and I look forward to working on you all with that. This is super exciting, so great, I think we're all excited about it. Everyone on the committee was right: yeah, okay, that's great, and was there another thing or was that the only one clayton? We did also hear an update about the very good news of the administration's change of tune to issue sports fields permits? Oh right! Oh that's! Some groups very important and we're not done with that, but it was. It was a. It was a good news. Night yeah! That's right! I mean they've said yes, it's just a question of ironing it out. Now I think. Well, yes, and also you know, the and adults are the next yeah. Okay, wonderful! Anything else is the order: okay, land views, first landmarks and then budget, and should we have some reports to the full board? I think we should, I think. Actually. I think there should be a report from Ps2L nick, even though it's short, I think it's important and and parks sure Clayton yeah. Maybe then we want to intersperse one of those reports between landmarks and land use so that I can catch my breath sure why do not? Why do not we put the you want to put the two reports in there together sure yeah we'll put the two in between land use and landmarks and then now is there anything from T E Ej that we need to know in the form of a report? I know you did not have any action. I do not think so. We received a number of interim reports from interim updates from DOT two reports on the 14th updates: sorry updates on the data from the 14th, Street Busway and current status of open streets that were very you know, interim brief updates and then a larger walk through of the current status of the Fifth Avenue Complete street proposal, but not the final version of the Fifth Avenue Complete street proposal. So there was a very full walk through of the current status of the proposal and a lot of discussion and questions. But I do not know that it merits a report during a full board meeting, because we fully expect them to come back to us again next month with a final version of that complete street proposal and so anything that we would anything that we would report out now would be would be incomplete, particularly in terms of the configuration of Fifth Avenue and the final rules of the final Busway rules. And whether or not they'll be the same type of rules. We see on 14th street, which will really determine things like access of private vehicles, access for residents through traffic. We can't answer any of those questions yet so we fully expect them to come back to us next month. Did you have you heard anything since your meeting from the bids and from the stakeholders that expressed their concerns? I think we heard a lot during the meeting about their concerns and- and I believe, we're still waiting to hear on the final Community Advisory Board meeting that is supposed to be taking place. That's right, September this month run by DOT yeah. So there's we anticipate another cab meeting before DOT decides or announces any of their any of the rules or configurations of their final proposal, and then I anticipate we'll hear again about the community's concerns and responses to that yeah. Okay, I know I got a call from Jerome Barth, which I have not been able to return so I'll, give him a call tomorrow and see what he has to say. I think he was in on your meeting. I remember correctly. I think he was, and also fred cirillo from Grand Central, because even though there's a small portion of it with grand central people are very concerned over how that whole thing is going to play out with residential vehicles, you know people wanting to come down fifth avenue. How are they going to do it so? Okay, that is going to be interesting, to say the least. Okay, anybody have any comments or questions about that. So we won't do a report right ej, it's a little premature right. I would agree. Okay, anything else from anyone Vicki. I do not know if you think it's important to mention. What's been going on with the homeless, shelters and the hotels, not that we've had it at our committee, but we've been working, we've been the board office has been receiving a lot of complaints and we've been attending a lot of meetings. Julie myself, Joseph fewer as well with electeds and different people trying to resolve some of the issues that we're seeing, particularly with the kicks being the Hampton Inn, and also the blakely in the wellington, we're starting to nibble around it with some potential solutions. Talking about automated public toilets, safe injection sites, things like that, but also working to ensure that providers work to make sure that their clients are being good neighbors, so we're just monitoring it as Nick says, with with you know the restaurants we're doing that in the same way with the homeless, shelter and the outreach with other community boards. It's very important because you and I both have been getting a lot of feedback or a lot of what are you guys doing regarding this? How can we do it better, collectively and so on, and so I think both you and Julie have been in touch with other boards. Is that yeah board eight? I mean Board seven board four this morning and so we're going to try and work collectively and work together, because you know strength in numbers yeah. I always say that: okay, yeah! That's very! I wonder if we should report that what do you think I mean? That's really a big issue right now, huge issue, I mean we have been getting an awful lot of complaints about this, a lot, an awful lot of photographs that no one wants to see photographs, yeah lots of photographs. You know it's drug use with defecation and revolution how about after your phone call with Maria now with the mayor's office? Cau? Yes, who have kind of reached out and said they want to help. Let's, let's see if we get enough information and maybe something positive, that we can report to the board to say that we've been working on this and we've been trying to collectively have some kind of a group joint discussion on how we might or how this might be better handled or handled at all. And then we will decide to read whether or not it should be reported. Is that okay with everyone? You know we won't say? Yes until I mean if we do not have something concrete, it would be nice if we could say they're going to do this or they're going to do that or whatever. So I know you're having that phone call tomorrow and then we'll see how it plays out if everyone's okay, with that all right- yes, okay, good, all right anything else. If not, I think yes Luke. I just want to make a note that one thing CB5 has done with regards to homeless issues, we've been seeing a lot of complaints on 35th street about the Amazon distribution center there, and we from a long time ago we had a one contact at Amazon and we started sending them photos of all of their Amazon employees loitering on the street. You know, in addition to the homeless street homeless, people that were loitering too, and since we heard I think late last week, that Amazon has, in response to some of our complaints, that we've been escalating. That direction they've actually signed a lease for a for a kind of like employee holding area in a nearby office building so that their employees do not have to loiter in front of their distribution center and they're, also making sure that some of their deliveries are done inside instead of being staged on the sidewalk. So that's a small. It's not exactly homeless, but it's kind of one of the complicated factors that make the street life challenging there. So that's one update that we've kind of had an effect on that's positive. Okay, renee! Is there anything else that you need to add to that? No I mean just one of the things is that when you talk to we've been in a lot of meetings with a lot of providers in DHS and one of the things is the identification you know, is it their client? Is it this person's client? It's not my client. So when we get pictures and we get complaints, it's very hard and people have been pointing at Amazon to say: oh, it's not even clients of the hotels, it's Amazon people that are maybe smoking Marijuana or doing something untold. So that's what Luke is referring to. Okay, great okay! I think that leads us to the conclusion of this business portion so vicky. If it's time I'll make a motion that we put the committee into executive session okay to discuss a second okay. So now the full board, I mean the full board. That's Thursday night! The committee will move into executive session which, as I explained earlier, is I think you have to say what the subject is: Nick I'll be reporting to the committee on the individuals we're considering for the district manager position, okay, all righty, so we will now move into executive session. That concludes this portion of the business session. At the end of the executive session, we will adjourn that meeting go back into our business session and adjourn that meeting since we finished our business. But that's the way the procedure is that we have to follow so. At this point it will only be three six nine ten people on this.
