First wish everybody a happy holidays and to say thank you for everything that the community board does throughout a very difficult year.
I. Do look forward to you know, seeing all you applications come in, make sure you reapply if you're up this year and if you're, if you are, you know one of mine, you're, probably in good hands, because you're all doing such a great job.
And he's going to be great, welcome, say hello to Marissa, because I, don't think I've seen you since you've been here and also just say, Thank you and happy holidays to everybody for well.
I, think Liz Krueger, yes, Senator, Liz Krueger is with us welcome Liz. We go hi, everyone, well, I, don't even want to go after Keith, because he pretty much said what I was also coming.
To say, which is thank you for all the work that this community board does and doing such an extraordinary job representing the people of CB5 and making it easy for your elected officials to learn about issues that matter and to work with you to try to come to the best resolution.
We live on Hollywood squares like this, but work continues in a very difficult time, and so many people in our city and our country are suffering but government, Even when we get things wrong.
And, I, Think, it's going to stay and people who don't know Brad who's been with me.
I did a hearing actually on maternal mortality, This past Monday because of the issue and familial support and visitation to those in labor and delivery rooms, and we also did another hearing on vaccines which, If you haven't seen, they are expected to roll out in a phased approach as soon as December 15th lots of questions and concerns, there.
You know if it's on quality of life issues, you know, we've been working to restore some of the sanitation services that have been cut or working with some of the local block associations, even to remove something like a couple phone booths that have been incredibly problematic throughout the community.
At the start of the pandemic, our office launched an investigation into the city's response, and we wanted to find out what happened in those early days, weeks and months to make sure that next time, around now, when we're in the second wave we'd be able to respond better to this crisis.
We hope for more, because I think people are realizing that the garment center can still be a place that you want to have garment manufacturing, given the fact that retail and business and so on, is not so fast returning.
Any community board is welcome, certainly with the Eastern District Helicopter Association Etc and some of the companies have agreed to participate and then, When we figure out exactly what New York's position is we're going to meet with all of the folks in New Jersey we've been in touch with all the elected officials in New. Jersey.
I want to thank you for your public realm proposal, you're, the first board to do it.
You make an application, You know it's one of those good things, but it needs a public realm czar, because now there's another agency to add to your list.
As you know, Committee, Board applications for new members and for those who are hopefully reapplying are due February.
I. Think it's a really important step forward in New, York, City having home rule over its traffic laws.
We have to make sure we have the revenue, so I'll be fighting for that over the next few weeks, third I advocated, along with councilmember powers, a survival plan for small businesses in grand central terminal that have had little to no revenue because of the foot.
Having ceased in that and that great space, We worked out a deal with the MTA, where the small businesses are going to be giving a portion of their actual earned revenue to the MTA, and we think it's a model for other commercial landlords.
I think just an hour ago wanted to let you know that I was a guinea pig for that at the Nyu Lange Langone Vaccine Center.
The Fda's regulations are in place for a reason to make sure that the safety is upheld and I really want to thank Nyu Langone for participating in this trial and making sure that you know we fight our way out of this virus as soon as possible, and that the vaccine is widely distributed and fairly distributed to the communities, mostly black and brown, that have suffered the hardest during this crisis.
In their buildings, and, finally, just kind of an end-of-year wrap-up, Our district office and community volunteers have continued throughout this year to ensure that residents will not go hungry.
The community gets input if every occupant every applicant for a liquor license knows they can just go to an electric elected representative, Then they're not going to work with the community and the community's interests are not going to be, are not going to be taken into account, so, I'm, very distressed at Keith Powers.
I am representing guilty house, and I want to basically represent how disappointed sad and frustrated we are with the decision that recently was passed by the SLA to approve the beer and wine license of 1204 broadway.
What we've heard, it was based upon the recommendation of council member Keith powers, whom this whole building, including our attorney Kate Quinn, and of Course Leslie Hendricks.
We've lived here since 2010, I'm speaking out to express my deep disappointment at the Sla's decision to approve the wine and beer application at the glass ceiling located right next door at 1204, Broadway.
Well, you know I ought to share it with the rest of all of you, because you've worked so hard on these things, but just to give you an idea of what we really accomplished this year so bear with me, because here we go in January, we learned that Gail was opposed to term limits for board members and she encouraged members who agreed to voice their opposition.
We passed a resolution ray congestion pricing requesting at least two members of the traffic Mobility Review board to include one individual, representing interests of those living within the area and one living outside.
We announced that our committees will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing, models, access to housing, etc, and we invited and encourage the public to attend and participate in order to best represent the needs of everyone in our district and provide a voice for all the committees of the board reported on their letters to the mayor.
We urgently requested removal of the current moratorium on park, space and ball field permits, and we urge the parks department to consider and remove all structural barriers regarding participation in summer youth programs in the fall in September with the city proposing the relocation of clients from the Lucerne hotel to the Harmonia permanent Shelter at 31St, street.
We spent actually our Bex Committee, in particular an inordinate amount of time working with various agencies, our electeds and community members.
We supported the bill to exempt additional small businesses from New York, City commercial, rent, tax, and we addressed and supported the municipal arts, society's advocacy and proposal for a new position in city government called director of the public realm in October.
We recommended approval of the Flatiron buildings alterations and in November we address fiscal year, 22 district needs statement and budget priorities and the.
Let's hope that next year, at this time, we will no longer be talking about thinking about worrying about Covid-19 matters or what the latest twitter will be coming out.
Events at 1204 Broadway, the tavern wine license, allows the premises to serve beer wine cider things like that anything, but hard, liquor, This location for people who don't know is immediately adjacent to the guilty.
We denied the application, which is rare for us, We reserve the denial of liquor license applications only for those most extreme cases and because of the rooftop location, so immediately adjacent to the residential building.
Our denial was supported by guilty house, of course, other neighboring buildings, the 29th Street Association, as well as various elected officials, assembly, member Gottfried, Senator Krueger for President Brewer and council member Keith powers in April, The state liquor authority agreed with us and denied the applicant's application for a full liquor.
We immediately responded to their application again requesting denial on the same grounds, The fact that the rooftop is so close to the residential building.
So we're a little bit disappointed in council member powers for his lack of transparency for failing to consult with us before he changed his position on us and for his lack of hearing the resident's position before he changed his position, and it was mentioned during the SLA hearing, The members of the liquor authority said that the electeds being in favor of the new application was dispositive.
Generally, Restrictions like that you know, could certainly be appreciated, but in a situation like this, where the rooftop is so immediately adjacent to a residential building, Even restrictions like this can not mitigate the disturbance that this is going to cost to the residents.
Draft scope of work basically defines what should be reviewed in the environmental study, So the question that was in front of us was not really whether we like the building.
We want to make sure that you know the additional pedestrian traffic that is going to be caused by this building is not only mitigated, but that the original you know like the like structural, endemic pedestrian congestion, is also taken into account and mitigated.
We emphasize that we talk about sustainability and we want to make sure that this building is going to be as efficient as possible.
We also want to know what is the source of energy that this build building is going to use, and we are also raising concerns about the base formula by which the density is being calculated.
So in that particular case, the site where the building is going to be built, is you know where the current Grant Hyatt sits, but the applicant did something that is, you know quite interesting, and we had not seen that before.
You know like the bread and butter of reviewing East Midtown zoning, open, space, shadows, historic and cultural resources.
We also want to make sure that you know these new developments are coming online are not designed in a vacuum.
I should add that, in order for the developer to get this bonus density that they're applying for they are doing some transit upgrades, We did talk about the transit upgrades at our land use committee meeting, but we feel that the transportation and environment Committee should take a look at it, which they're going to do.
We basically ask that the environmental impact statement incorporates all these elements and looks deep into those issues so that we have as good a building as we can possibly can.
So with this particular application, they are actually proposing an amount of open space that is conforming in compliant with the zoning resolution, so they're not asking for any special permit or amendment they are from the get-go proposing ten thousand square feet of open space.
The question with this particular project is that the proposal calls for this open space to be actually located on the second and third level of the building, and you know, th.
It has the perception of being less accessible, and you know this is something that we talk about in the resolution where we want to make sure that accessibility and perceived accessibility are assessed and addressed.
Now they're, talking about adding all these thousands and thousands of additional square, feet, I'm thinking the empty state building from the 1930s that has that I know.
It serves as a you know, a loading area for the post office and other buildings, so the functionality is not going to change.
We are certainly on record, saying that you know developing so much commercial office space in our district may turn out to be problematic.
This is an application for BSA variants to permit the development of a non-conforming, 12-story, mixed-use commercial ground floor and residential above building in an m16 district.
We deal with these applications actually quite often, So this is a site that is located in an m16 district, which means that it is zoned for manufacturing in a manufacturing district, the permitted uses are commercial and manufacturing, and residential is absolutely not permitted.
You know the air and light in a way that would not conform with the zoning requirement of the m16 district, and we found that actually commercial use for class b and class c office space is much needed in cv5, And finally, our overall, you know.
And you know we said during the committee meeting that maybe the time has come for this area to actually be rezoned and become a commercial district in which residential uses are permitted.
Think that moving this small building, which it's not really unreasonable, that they would struggle to turn a profit to be a commercial use given the size is really going to take too much away from the district or this community.
The next resolution is the zoning for coastal flood resiliency, a city-wide tax amendment to update and make permanent the temporary 2013 flood resilience Zoning tax amendment, so you're probably wondering why we're even discussing that we are land blocked and we don't have any coasts, but we felt that it was actually important to look at this text because it's a city-wide text and what we wanted to weigh in is not whether you know it's a good text.
I, don't see any okay next resolution, all right, so the next application was 21, East 21st, street.
We voted to support this application for the use change at 2125, East 21St street.
Our borough president said in her comment earlier: tonight, governor's island is really a city-wide resource, so it is technically part of community board.
One and CB1 is in the process of reviewing this very important, very significant major land use proposal that entails a number of things, including the redevelopment of 4.7 million square feet of development on the island because of its significance, CB1, basically reached out to all the Manhattan community boards and asked for our input.
The second comment that we made is that you know if we want governor's island to continue to be a successful island serving its purpose, which is you know, providing recreational space to residents of New York City.
I wholeheartedly agree with the committee's position on this, and that language should really cause us all to be very concerned about the city's thinking, Just imagine if the Central Park Conservancy or the Madison Square Park Conservancy or the Bryant Park Corporation, If the dire economic crisis that has happened this year continued or there were other reasons.
Why we're hearing this tonight at full board three months ago, when the parks and public Spaces Committee first heard this very initial policy proposal from the municipal arts, society and New Yorkers for parks.
After that, The same proposal was heard both at the transportation committee and also at the land use committee, and so with all of that extra information and input and questions from other board members and then to Beck's, where it became a priority for the parks component of the budget request.
My thinking that hosting this event would in some ways serve as an endorsement not by us, but a use of the public space to promote an organization and that the value of that work is being called into question and.
This is an application for storefront alterations, Rooftop edition landscape roof at the existing building and a new building at the adjacent parking lot at 9, West 17th, street.
