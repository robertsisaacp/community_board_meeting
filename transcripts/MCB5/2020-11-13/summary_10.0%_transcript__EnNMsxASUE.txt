The council's committee on hospitals is really focused on the rise of Covid-19 cases in New York City.
You know usually hospitalizations usually lag by about two weeks when you see a spike, so we'll be certainly monitoring that in the coming weeks, but right now we're still seeing pretty stable hospitalization rates in New York City.
You know we got a lot of questions about absentee ballots and pulse sites.
And I just want to thank Community Board five's committee on budget education and city services.
Matters got an opportunity to talk about councilmember powers bill to support installing absentee ballot, drop-off boxes in New, York City.
We know there were big problems, of course, with the board of Elections Administration of the election, we're holding a round table in December on a bill that Senator Kruger carries to professionalize the board of elections in the city.
Great first I, want to thank CB5 for working with our office on issues regarding 23rd, 24th and 25Th street Sixth.
First, the comptroller sent a letter to the mayor and Chancellor Kuranza, urging the city to act immediately to close the digital divide, which we know leaves over a hundred thousand students each day without internet.
So second, the comptroller authored a op-ed with advocates for children, focusing on supporting the needs of over the 13,000 students living in family shelters in our city.
This week, comptroller's trainer renewed us called the restart New York City's lagging capital program.
We think that our infrastructure needs are so significant and so ongoing that we should continue spending on our capital budget to make sure we're making investments for our future.
Thanks the census ended and though we will not know what happens in regards to accuracy and the time it gets to the data end for a little bit.
We do know that New York City did pretty well given the circumstances and that the Census Bureau says that they are confident they were able to enumerate almost all of the households.
She called on the usgs director James Riley, to be removed after an inspector general investigation determined that he retaliated against a whistleblower she's, seeking information on the administration's efforts to withhold federal funds from cities deemed anarchisture additions jurisdictions and this week in light of the transition issues mentioned earlier, the congresswoman joined other House Committee chairs and sending dozens of letters directing White, House and federal agencies to preserve documents in accordance with the law.
I, think that is it on the representatives of the electeds, correct, I, believe so, yes, okay, that moves us into hearing from anyone from the public for two minutes.
Sometimes people like Harvey Weinstein, who have been trying to silence speech by passing by introducing lawsuits, often in the area of defamation, and our new bill is going to make it harder for those lawsuits to move forward.
This new bill will prevent those lien sales from going forward and and protect a lot of personal possessions that are, you know up in the air as a lot of new yorkers are trying to get back up on their feet and get employed.
The new building is going on an empty lot on 28th street, it's in the college's footprint and that's where our main loading dock and sanitation, pickup area, is.
I'm pleased to see that the New York Times Editorial Board wrote about the situation with open restaurants and to hear that other things are happening from the mayor's office.
We had concerns about the way the blade sign is going to be anchored into the building, and we want to make sure that it will not cause any punctures through the terracotta that is covering the facade.
It's an application to the board of standards and appeals, and it was filed by h hotel for the renewal of a building permit at 58-60, West 39th street.
The Department of City planning introduced an amendment that would render a hotel use no longer conforming and would require a special permit.
Pursuant to common law and the common law of New York says that if a owner has a vested interest, meaning that they have spent a lot of money and with this new zoning, it would render them that their investment useless and they can claim hardship and the BSA has the ability to renew this building permit for a use that is no longer conforming.
We have learned through the MTA- that the train shed that is located under you, know, partially under the Park Avenue Malls, is in a state of grave disrepair.
You know that this is going to keep us busy, but we felt it was important that we're on record saying this is the kind of vision we want for for the malls.
In order to be as clear as possible, I'm wondering if you'd be open to not using the word activation, but simply to say, as you said, Community Board, five is committed to being part of the Park Avenue Mall's redesign and the public process regarding their use or something along.
I, think that it is important that some of them, not necessarily all of them, actually need to receive the same treatment, but some of them should become open to the public, should become recreational areas.
Maybe there's an another way of saying that you know we want humans to be able to use the space so that you know this intention is expressed in this resolution.
You sure, I, think anything along the lines of opening for public use.
Okay, so maybe you and I can you know, like figure out some language now off via email, and then we can send this language for it, for the result to be sure, amended.
I mean if there's some way to occasionally monetize the space then does not new York City need that money.
You, know fighting corporate events and pedestrian plazas and all the things that have happened over the last 12 years, so I do not think.
The argument is that this resolution specifically should say no commercial events, which is not what I suggested in my prior comment or the friendly amendment either, but simply that, like all of our public spaces.
It has been following the board of elections and voting as an issue for the committee.
They did is they briefed us on bills that have recently passed and affect elections and voting, and these are early voting, which we saw this year, the consolidation of federal and state primaries, which is going to save us time and money, the transfer of voter registration, which is streamlined now for people who move within the state of New, York and pre-registration for 16 and 17 year.
We also learned that there are two bills that were passed last year, that are constitutional amendments, so they need to pass into successive legislatures and then be voted on by referendum, and those two issues are the same: day: voter, registrations, meaning you can vote register and vote on the same day and number two is no excuse.
This is something that we're going to follow in order to talk about within the committee and perhaps support other issues that came up.
We learned that more pull sites are needed and Senator Krugel is carrying a bill that we're going to look at, and it prohibits the use of schools for early voting, but also mandates that building that use state tax exemptions that are owned by an entity that gets more than a million dollars in state grant.
It involves both the city and the state, because part of the makeup of the Board of Education is the New York State Constitution.
The state and city will have to come together on this, but this is again something that our committee will follow and look to support or have a view.
We also heard about council member powers, pre-considered resolution in support of the state bill to establish absentee drop-off ballot locations and then two more important city council items that we're following one is the voting Rights advancement bill, which would require federal oversight for states with a proven history of voter suppression, and it would protect all the eligible citizens constitutional right to vote, and then an oversight hearing was held on the election administration during Covid-19 and that the purpose of that was to lay out the challenges and plans for problems with absentee votes and ranked choice, voting, which is going to come.
The second item is the budget report, but I do not know.
The district needs statement, the most pressing issue survey for each of the silo areas, the expense budget requests and the capital budget requests may I deem them red.
Okay, second, you're, going to look at the most pressing needs survey and that's a live.
Anyone have a conflict with the budget, information and requests and the district needs.
So I wanted to ask how this budget request process relates to that discussion because I'm looking through and it does address, moving responsibilities over to DOT, which I personally really appreciate and I- think that's a great thing to include.
You know when it comes up again in 2020 or 2021, that being really the forum for continuing that discussion about NYPD funding, sure we're going to go through this whole process again and we're going to keep looking at it.
Given that we're, we are on board with the budget request for capital expense for this.
So great job of the committee for coming up with all these I did have one proposed amendment or addition to the capital, expense requests and basically it's just adding a 30th item.
If you said in the school that we're suggesting you know as a capital that we request that money for this concrete, then I get it as a capital, expense, and.
Think that many of our you know our top requests go to affordable, housing, homelessness.
You know the lockers are okay, that they I think a lot of our requests.
Thank you passes, okay, so the district needs statement and budget priorities passes.
If I hear about green new deal one more time without specifics, I'm going to throw up so one of the issues, because you know it's very nice.
Three new deal, what the hell does that mean in New, York, City, I, remember, I, spent years getting buildings to go from six to four to two and then try to get the electrical and that's the frackies go on and on so I.
This concrete issue might be part of it, just something to think about, because today I was in a commercial building, that's being built and they have a new I'm going to call it an hbac system.
Well I, do not really know what blah is, but it sounded very impressive and it is the only one in New York City.
Probably we need other ones like it, but since I do not know what it is.
What I'm saying is what is green new deal for New York City, something to think about because it's what we want, but I've, never heard specifics.
I do not know if there were schools early voting in Europe, Community, Board and board five, but I think there were, and the issue is what I'm trying to say.
I do not know how many of them are flying helicopters into New, York City, but we are totally in contact with those elected officials.
And I want to thank you for again being the leader as I said, I, know.
