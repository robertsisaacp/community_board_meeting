I said two presentation: one is a presentation for an action by an applicant for the Ibm building. The other one is a presentation by the court. Theater a presentation is a no action item on the end of this committee. The court theatre wanted to appraise us of an application that they will be bringing to us, and that is about to be certified by the Department of City planning. A few words about how this meeting is going to run you're pretty familiar with our format, but I will just reiterate just for the sake of making it clear to everyone. Each applicant will have the opportunity to give a full and uninterrupted presentation after this presentation concludes. I will open up the four to questions by members of the committee once this question period concludes. I will turn to members of the public who will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments to the application. The applicant will have an opportunity to respond to those questions and address these comments. After this period concludes, we will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are able to discuss the matter at that time. Members of the public or members of the team of applicants are no longer allowed to speak unless recognized by the chair. That would be me after a discussion on the matter and comments are made by members of the committee. We will make a motion and this motion will be voted on by the committee. The vote of the committee will be presented as the position of the committee to the full board of Community Board. Five, the full board meets on September 10th at 6:00 pm and the full. The vote of the full board becomes the official position of community board five. So we are going to start the meeting tonight with the application, which is the action item 9,590 madison avenue. This is the Ibm building. Typically, we have a brief introduction by the member of the committee who were who was assigned the due diligence for this. This application tonight we're just going to jump into a presentation just for the sake of expediency and but if the member of the committee who was assigned this application wishes to make some comments before we go into question period, I will certainly allow that. So I believe we have the team of applicants for the Ibm building layla. This is Bob Fleyhive I'm here I did not expect to be on until the second item. So I'm going to need a couple of minutes to get the architect. Okay, then I can I we can go to the court application. It's here we're here. That's fine! That's fine! With us! I'm available! Okay! Let's go to the court theater! I think that they are. The team is ready, and so members of the committee- I just want you to understand. This- is a no action item. They are here with us tonight because they want to give us a presentation. It is a long process. It has been a long process. This a section of this proposal has been in front of the board before in front of the Landmarks Committee, because there's a landmark component. So for the edification and given the complexity of this proposal, they wanted to give us a presentation and we felt that it was a good idea so that we can digest all this material and then, when they are certified, they will come back to us for for us to make a recommendation when it's you know time to to take an action. So members of the the court theater, if you want to bring a screen up, if you have a visual presentation that you want to share with us, you can do that or if you want to yeah okay, perfect. So it's up to you guys. Please tell us about this. This proposal we're ready to hear it. Hello, everybody in Community board five. My name is Julio Peterson, I'm the vp of real estate at the Shubert organization and we're really excited about bringing this project forth. It's been a long time since we've been working on this project as layla had referenced, we were supposed to be certified in March and then Covid-19 hit. So we've been a bit anxious we're in essence here to present the restoration and the expansion of the court theater project. It's an unique opportunity for us to be able to expand the theater, given the fact that we have very limited opportunities to find adjacent parcels next to our theaters in the theater district. The court theater is hampered by numerous things, and we want to make sure that, as it relates to the expansion and the rest of the historic restoration that we address, the inefficiencies of the theater, those inefficiencies will be addressed by members of our team. We part of our team here includes Paul Selver and Adam Tavman, who are land use, counsel, John, Darvey who's, our senior vice president of facilities at the Schubert Organization and Fran Russo who's, our architect for the restoration of the Interior and Exterior Landmark Court theater. You know this has been a very difficult time for the Broadway community and we're really excited about bringing this project forth. To maybe be a symbol of the fact that you know Broadway will come back and we want people to get excited about that. There's not for us too much for us to be excited about right now, but we think that this project merits a full bonus and that it's also going to be something that the community, the Broadway community and just the new yorkers will be proud of. So I'm going to turn it over to Paul silver who'll go over these speci. The specifics of the mind, use action and he'll then turn it over to other members of our team. Thank you so much. Thank you, hello and good evening. Laila hi Vicki hi good to see you it's good to be in front of a community board again. It gives us a sense of that. There's a real euler out there and a reality to the process that we have not seen. Actually, I think one of the last. The last time I was before Community Board was before your committee layla on a different project just before everything stopped. So this is the this is the dry part, the nuts and bolts part it's a 47,000 square foot site you can see. There are four owners. Schubert owns the court theater and the area that's outlined in Red is the site that it acquired from Rockefeller, and that will be the site of the annex that we'll be talking about. Mcsam owns Watts 55 through 59. Mcsam purchased the site from Rockefeller the Rockefeller group earlier this year, or maybe late last year. It was sometime in the last year and highgate hotels owns lot. Seven. They also purchased from rgi the mcsam sites being developed with an as of right hotel. The highgate hotel site is an existing hotel. That's going to remain and finally lot 11, which is owned by clarity, is the site of a new hotel and that's the hotel that will, we hope, receive the benefit of the bonus floor area generated by the theater rehabilitation. The site is a split lot about. 35,000 square feet is in the c6 5.5, with a base, far of 12 and a maximum far 14.4 and the balance 12,000 square feet is in the c67 t, with a base of 14 and a maximum. Far of 16.8, the entire site is within the theater sub- district core. The application seeks a special permit under section 81,745. The permit would authorize a bonus floor area of 119,000 square feet for the substantial rehabilitation of the listed theater and that floor area would be transferred to clarity to the some of the the bonus floor area will be generated by land, that is on the c67 T side of the district and residential use floor area can cross that boundary back and forth freely commercial use can not, and for some tech a variety of technical reasons. We in order to take advantage of that four area, we are proposing a text amendment that would allow, for a limited, a very limited group of zoning, lots of which actually, this is the only one that is really that has any ability to use it. The ability to use bonus floor area anywhere on the zoning lot, regardless of where it's been generated, and, secondly, the text amendment would clarify the description of qualifying rehabilitation work, because this proposal, as you will see, kind of expands the envelope on what has been done in the past to enhance and modernize a broadway theater. If the full bonus is granted. The clarity building Cardi hotel would be 49 stories and about 264,000 square feet. So what we'd like to do tonight is talk about the problems of the court, as Julio said talk about why the work that's going to be done is so important to the future of the court and talk about the way in which the work provides all of the public benefits, and we really feel it's virtu. It virtually touches every base in the text of the benefits that the theater rehabilitation bonus has been adopted for, and that is that is a large part of the reason why we believe and hope and hope, you'll agree that this project qualifies for the full bonus. So that's the sort of the technical background, John Darby is going to talk about the court today and what the work that's being proposed will do to it John good evening good evening. Everyone and thank you for the opportunity to present our project here, I'm Schubert's senior vice president of facilities. I've been involved with the schubert's broadway theaters for over 35 years. I've been involved in many restorations. The court theater project is going to be very special, as Julio earlier alluded to. The opportunity of acquiring a plot of land adjacent to the theater is extremely rare here in the theater district, and it is going to enable us to address a lot of the deficiencies of this building. Now the building dates from 1912., it's one of the older of the existing broadway theaters from pre- world war, one. It really is a theater that harkens back to the late 19th century in terms of theater design and theater practice at the time. So it's really several generations behind the 21st century, theater that we're doing today and to adapt the building to these modern day uses can be very difficult. The theater it's the auditorium itself. The audience chamber has often been cited and in particular by the late Hugh hardy, the renowned theater architect. He often cited the court as coming closest to the ideal of what he called enclosure geometry, the basic shape of the room. It's the relationship of the audience to the stage the way the theater architecture focused the attention of the audience on the stage it came close to an ideal in theater design, but having said that, the with the age of the building and the obsolescence of the design it is lacking in in the back of house, the backstage is lacking in many features needed for modern day productions. Similarly, in the front of the house, there's very little in the way of audience amenities, very limited, restrooms, very limited lobbies and lounges circulation is extremely tight and there was literally no ADA accessibility. People with disabilities would really be excluded from this theater as it was originally designed, and the opportunity of this project is going to be able to address all of these problems. If we can go to the please here is a planned view of the theater as it now exists, and as far as the back of house or backstage areas, I'd like to call attention to well the stage area itself. The stage is flanked by what we call the wings. The wings are extremely important for theater production in. That is where the stage manager is calling the show giving everybody their cues, making sure everything happens in the proper order and at the proper time, so the performers, entrances and exits are all done from the wings. Scenery is often moved. Props are often moved and manipulated, costume. Quick changes often happen in the wings and here at the court. The left stage left wing is extremely small to the point of being quite a handicap. For this theater and right next to where the left stage left wing is shown there, the dressing rooms and the pink highlighting as you can see, 407 square foot of footprint, it is extremely tight. The rooms are pathetically small and very little upgrade has been able to be done over the years, so it is very difficult for the performers. Now this house was originally intended. It's one of what we call the straight play houses. It was not intended for musical theater, which normally has larger, casts and greater scenic scenery and scenic effects. But these days it's important for all the broadway theaters to be able to house musicals, since that is predominant. As far as the as far as the art form, not that there are still not straight plays, but it's very important for these houses to be able to accommodate a musical, in addition to the tight stage space and the inadequate dressing rooms you'll see in a moment a picture of the loden door, it's very difficult to get scenery in and out of this theater, given the existing conditions. So why do not we go to the here on the left? You see one of the dressing rooms. The two pictures on the dressing room is actually the same room from two different angles, and this is a probably a room for a featured performer because it has its own toilet, but, as you can see, there's absolutely no privacy there. It is absolutely cramped quarters the next moving to the right. The next photo where it says, dressing room wall. This shows the stage left wing and you can get a feel for how cramped it is at the bottom of the photo. Is the upstage end where there's a stairway which further exacerbates the tight quarter and to the right of the photo? That's actually some scenery there for a box set, and so you see the space that's left over is it's pretty tough to deal with, especially if you have a large cast on the other side of the stage right, we're showing also encumbered by a stair and a large duck that actually serves the auditorium. There was no room in this theater when it was finally air conditioned sometime after World War Ii and they actually put the main air conditioning for the auditorium on a fly floor, a platform or a bridge, that's above the stage right wing here where they originally operated. The ropes for the rigging, the flying, scenery and the lights and other items that are suspended above the playing area last the photo shows the loading door and what you see on the right there with that dark shadow is a stairway going down to the under stage level. So this is only a 10 foot wide alley space and you only have about half of it to get to the two large brown doors, which is the loading door. So it's a real choke point for any show that has to load scenery into this theater please. This is a plan of the seller level, the under stage level as we call it, and this theater has to peculiar early 20th century the remnants of a ventilation system. So in the pink where it says, Plenum there's this cross corridor that was intended for air circulation. The problem with it is, it greatly impinges on what we call the trap area, the area of the stage where trapdoors or elevators or other scenic effects, where things have to come through the stage deck itself. This hampers you because the important downstage area, this the end of the stage closest to the audience, which is often the most important, is totally hampered by this old air ventilation system. Next, please, we actually have to use that trap area under the stage deck under where the performers are playing for wardrobe operations. So, on the very left there you see some laundry machines. This is where they maintain the costumes, so them fit them to the performers, and it's really a drawback when you have to be under the stage there in most theaters, the only thing in a trap area would be stage: Machinery, Associated, Stage machinery also to the right. There's a small bathroom there. This one bathroom has to serve everybody backstage except the performers, so that means all the stagehands. It's a if it's a musical the musicians, the wardrobe people- everybody involved in the performance- has to share this one bathroom because of the tight quarters and the inadequacy of the building. Next, please, this is another schematic viewer, sectional view of the stage looking east or towards stage right, and this just shows in the dark brown there. The air conditioning equipment that I mentioned earlier, so it's a huge encumbrance to have that. Actually in the stagehouse which is needed, you know, every square cubic inch is needed for the scenery and the performance. Next, the front of house is equally hampered by many inadequacies. All the way on the right there. That photograph shows a cramped box office that often three and even four people have to work in you can see the middle photo is that's in the historic ticket lobby. Looking at the Box office windows, also in the front of house there's a number of inadequacies I mentioned earlier, there's very few restrooms for the patrons literally no lounge space. There's the bars are very cramped in there as far as concessionaires, if they're selling any souvenirs for the show they have to bring in their stock every day, because they do not even have a closet to be able to store their stock. Everything is cramped and, as you will see, the circulation for the audience is equally cramped. We can go to the please patron restrooms, as I mentioned originally you'll, see on the lower left, the cellar level there to the far left of that yellow, highlighted area there. It shows three stalls that was what the building was built with. Originally for all of the orchestra level. Patrons the women only had three stalls. There were a couple more on the two balcony levels upstairs, but it was far below what is required and what is required is usually far below what is really adequate for an intermission crowd when people have to use the restrooms. Similarly, the men's room was tiny. As you can see, we had no place here for an accessible restroom, even a single unisex, accessible restroom to meet ADA requirements since obtaining the annex site. We actually put a portable restroom trailer that was accessible for wheelchairs out there, but before that people would have people in wheelchairs would have to go acrosss the street to a restaurant or down the street to a hotel to use a restroom, and this was one of the very few places Schubert has 17 historic theaters on Broadway and in all of them, except a few. This being one of them, we were able to find places where we could build accessible restrooms, but unfortunately, there was just absolutely no space at the court theater next and the I mentioned earlier, the bars you see the the bars are basically at the rear of the seating area at the top on the plan, the plan drawing on the left there, the bar is highlighted in yellow and it's literally a few feet from the patrons who are watching the show. So as the bartender is preparing for intermission, he's got to be an artist, that's staying quiet with all the bottles and glasses and getting ready. Then when intermission happens, it is so cramped. In that relatively small crossover, the area behind the seats, it can be a nightmare at intermission. Similarly, upstairs the bars are equally cramped and just simply in the auditorium space there's no separate lounges next and circulation. One of the worst things I've seen in this theater is this stairway that says 43 inches the top left photograph that goes down to the women's room and, unfortunately, the women have to cue on that stair as they wait for a restroom to be available. So you have two- way traffic on that very narrow, stairway one side, the women waiting to get down the other's returning. So it is a very tough situation. Similarly, on the other side of the theater there's a narrow stair going down to the men's room, but both of these stairs the way the theaters were built back in the early 20th century late 19th century they did not. The two genders did not mix at intermission, so these are basically one- way stairs you go down, there's no other way in or out, so people have to come back up the same stairway. Similarly, the way the theaters were built very much along class lines. The upper balconies were totally separated circulation wise from the lower balcony and the orchestra seating sections. It was really following an english model where the classes were the lower classes were kept separate, and you see vestiges of that at this theater. So when people come in for those going up to originally the first balcony, there's only one stairway going up there. Nowadays, we do not have that separation, so the two upper balconies, the people can mingle, but they only have one stair from street level to start going up to their seats. Please. So we have these problems that have just enumerated all these deficiencies in this theater. Yet we think, with the opportunity provided by this being able to build what we are calling the annex adjacent to the theater to the west. We can solve most of this. In fact, we can solve all of it and really make it one of the best theaters on broadway. The plot of land that was acquired is 25 feet wide, but the annex will also utilize the 10 feet of what was an egress alley where there were exterior fire escapes and still are at the moment, serving what we call the house right side of the theater, the west side of the theater. So you see the annex will essentially be 35 feet wide and we can do a. We can do a lot with that as you'll see next, so here's an exterior rendering you see the annex on the right there. The top of it is lined up with the top of the stage house or the fly tower as we call it and the intent here, and it was really also with the the desire of the Landmarks Preservation Commission that we not try to make the nx ape the architecture of the original theater or make it look as if it had always been there. They wanted something that would contrast and be modern. Looking yet in terms of textures and materials, have a relationship to the historical building, but not to detract from or try to be part of the historical building. So next, so here we're showing the planned view of stage level or street level showing theater plus Annex and I'll start from the stage. So now we have a stage left wing over on the annex side that is close to being equal to the stage right wing. It's a full depth wing for the stage there. So stage operations can happen. Much more smoothly. It can accommodate. Bigger, shows, bigger casts to the left of that where it says Dr that stands for dressing rooms. We have a whole stack or tower of dressing rooms there that more than doubles the size of the inadequate rooms that were there, each one being bigger, more capacious, more better appointed going toward the top of this. Drawing you see, evie there is an elevator and the elevator was placed there to be able to serve audience during show times when the public is in the theater and then during the day time or during loadings or loadouts, when scenery is brought in and set up, and the elevator can also serve the show and will be very valuable, even on a daily basis, to allow wardrobe people to wheel their wardrobe racks to costumes and place them in the dressing rooms on upper floors. It's a great boon to have an elevator that can serve those functions, the house or the auditorium in the purple there. That remains the same and, as I said it is, it is an exquisite house. It is an exquisite place to watch a show from the ticket lobby. We are going to maintain and restore decoratively the tickle lobby francesca our restoration architect will talk about that in a little bit, but, as you can see, there's in the green there the annex is providing a tremendous increase in space for the audience. So at orchestra level, where about half, if the house was filled up about half of the audience, is down at orchestra level. They have a nice capacious bar lounge. They are a few steps away from their seats. Why do not we go to the this harkens back to back of house again? This is a comparison of what the new dressing room facilities will be to the old. So you see, on the right hand, side to the very right, a stack of floor plans showing the old, inadequate dressing rooms and then the new, much more than doubling in size, also with a specific wardrobe area, where the costumes can be much better maintained away from the stage as it's proper and then also accommodations for hair and wig for shows that need that separate facility next, so in it. So, as we've shown, this expansion provided by the annex addresses all these major problems backstage even the lodendore gets rebuilt. We get to remove that stair that encumbers the loading door, because we will have access otherwise to the understage, and we will also create a room there where recyclable and trash containers can be put that are out of the weather, but essentially out of the building. We are also creating a new stage door access. The stage door used to be served by the alley that is being utilized by the Annex and the new stage door. We will come into what used to be an exit. I mentioned earlier how the upper balcony originally was a separate area where the crowd up there did not mix with the other audience. So there was an exit stair all the way down to the street. It's no longer necessary, so we will use that door at street level for the stage door. People will come in there, the cast and crew. They will go down a stair to the under stage level and right backstage so that if the audience is at the theater early and people associated with the show do not have to go through the public areas to get backstage and get to work next. This is another sectional view. This is looking west toward the stage left side of the theater, and one of the things featured in this slide is the fact that in this in this project, we will be providing a modern day rigging system, including a replacement of the gridiron again, the theater being built so long ago for a totally different type of theater. At that time they if they had to fly something or lift something above the stage, it was usually canvas flats with light lightweight wood. Nowadays, there's lots of steel and other heavy scenic elements, so the grid iron will provide that structural capacity and a modern, counterweight rigging system will provide state- of-, the- art rigging, and it's also adaptable to new or relatively new automated means of rigging. The theater right now has the what we call an old hemp system, so they utilize ropes and then they counterweight anything that has to have a counterweight off stage with sandbags shows actually will bring in other rigging equipment nowadays. But the actual rigging system at the theater right now is an old hemp system that harkens back to the 19th century and also mentioned here that air handler that we saw on that other section. That's going to be totally removed. We will have a state- of-, the- art, rooftop air conditioning system that will much better serve the theater next. One feature that this project will enable is to create a dedicated rehearsal space at this theater, which is a luxury to shows there's only a couple. Broadway theaters that have anything close. This will be a space atop, the annex on the top floor, totally column, free and the dimensions will allow full blocking of a show. In other words, they can lay out where senior cena will be where actors or dancers have to be it's basically the full size of the playing area of the stage and then some. So it's a tremendous facility to have next there's a little rendering of what the rehearsal space will. Look like the front of house. I mentioned earlier we're going to preserve the historic ticket lobby and we are going to restore a lot of lost ornament and whatnot, and Francesca will talk about that. But I should point out that, like other items of accessibility here, a wheelchair patron will be able to come to this theater on their own without assistance come into the lobby and go up to a ticket window where they can be served in their wheelchair next. So for the improvements in general in the front of house, you can see by the comparison as far as patron restrooms. We are more than doubling the number of fixtures available to patrons and by the way we have over recent years, we've tried to cram restroom fixtures and every nook and cranny. We can it's been so inadequate, but now it's going to be quite capacious. Similarly, we will have lounges and bars in the separate annex, no more bars right in where the audience is watching the show and the circulation provided by an elevator, a grand stairway in the annex. It's going to be so much better than the current situation you can see in these floor plans the stack of floor plans on the right there, basically, the circulation in blue elevator and the grand stair, the restrooms and the brown color, the lounges and the green. So it's quite a bit of floor area that will accommodate the audience in this house next and here's a rendering of the street level or stage level lounge for the patrons at the orchestra level, and you can see the stare in the background. Okay, now I'm going to turn it over to francesca russo. Who can tell you about the restoration work that will be done to the historic building? Thank you good evening. I'm Francesca russo, the restoration architect for the theater, and this slide shows the facade as it is now. The finish is in need of rehabilitation. The three window sets that you see above the marquee are actually the original windows, but they're, worn and obscured and broken, and they have ac units that are placed within them. The marquee is from the 60s. It was replaced after the original marquee, which actually had a glass roof was removed early on and the doors are contemporary, as well as the signage frames, and they do not fit the historic facade. Next, please, this watercolor rendering shows the windows restored to their original, beautiful use and the new marquee, which is evocative of the original, although it does not have a glass groove and replacement doors and sideage frames that are more appropriate for the historic facade. Next, please. This is just a sample of what we are doing with the interior, the slide of the rendering on the left. If you look at the detail around the drapery, that is actually a lattice work, plaster detail and a fleur- de- Lis motif mostly and then some other elements behind which was original tiffany art glass lit from behind this has not been in use for years and years, and the intent is to restore it. In addition, the remainder of the plaster detail that has been damaged or lost throughout the theater is going to be restored, and the original palette, which was champagne in Sienna, will be seen again in the painting of the plaster and decorative work. The small rendering in the center shows the original bar relief plaster that was in the ticket lobby and is being restored. This whole interior was actually based on the petite tree and on adversary, and many of the details that you see here can be seen at versailles. Next, please. What has happened since the theater was originally built is, of course there was the need for air conditioning, and, unfortunately, the way air conditioning was done then is ductwork was simply strewn throughout the theater, obscuring the beautiful historical detail and not integrated into the historic fabric, because that simply was the way things were done. Next, please, on the left, you can see what is called a light pen, and that was placed many times on the fascia of the balconies. In order for the lights to be placed inside, it was typically both a visual screen and also a safety factor to secure make sure the lights were secure, which is not needed at this time. The same like box is seen in the upper right and then there are also structural elements that have been placed throughout the theater exposed to secure different pieces of equipment and scenery. Next, please, the intent of the rehabilitation and restoration is to take all of these elements that are obscuring the view and not integrated into the historic fabric and hiding them within the theater architecture itself. One of the ways that this is done is this new soffit in fascia, within which duct work is going to be placed, and that's the only part of the new air delivery system that will be seen the rest of it will be done through registers and grills throughout the theater. And next, I believe, there's a summary I think I said in the beginning and Clear said in the beginning that we felt that this the work that was being done here more than met the qualifications for substantial rehabilitation in the zoning resolution. I just would like to review that quickly. The point one is the expansion of the theater, which comes about by construction of the annex, which is made possible by the acquisition of the land from Rgi, improves the functionality of the theater's design. It allows the uses in the theater to be unpacked and it gives them the space that they need to function properly within the theater itself. The alterations and enhancements improve its commercial viability by giving it the capacity to take a wider range of productions and especially musicals, so it becomes a more flexible, theater and more commercially viable theater. And then, if you look at the kinds of things that substantial rehabilitation is deemed to include, as we you've seen, this work will involve increasing the size of the stage ring wings. It provides a rehearsal space for the first time it expands dressing, room, space and wardrobe space. It significantly increases the level and functionality of the lobby and the insulary spaces. It provides for greater handicapped access, then, is technically legally required, and it includes a really a comprehensive, high quality and sensitive sensitively handled historic restoration. So if you were sort of touching bases in this statute, we think that this project would do all of the things that it needs to do to support the bonus and, as Julio said in the beginning, the fact that there is this kind of investment in the theater business at this time is itself a strong indication of support for the theater legitimate theater, for Broadway and for the city next, and this is the last slide. This is the hotel, the Ryu hotel that you can see in the sort of the light, Blue and purple 49 stories again about 264,000 square feet. 119,000 of those square feet would come from the theater next to it on the left. In the background, although it does not really show up so much as background, but is the 34 store, is the 34 story, mcsam hotel and in front of the mcsam hotel is the night hotel, the highgate hotel. The buildings themselves are pretty much in context with what's going on around them in Midtown, there's the Fox building to the east at 49 stories and almost 600 feet and there's a excuse me another new hotel to the West along 7Th Avenue. So these are what we're talking about here is the kind of development that you would expect in West Midtown and with that we're happy to take questions, and we thank you very much for your patience. Thank you so much for a a thorough presentation. Before we go into questions. I just want to make sure that everybody on the committee, especially the new members, understand what Community board five's position was on the landmarks portion of this application. So, as the applicants mentioned and explained, there is a big restoration component to this to this proposal and this restoration had to go through the Landmarks, Preservation Commission for review and approval and before they went to LPC it had to be reviewed by the Community Board and we had to opine on the proposal. So we basically had you know great support for the alteration and restoration to the theater itself and we had great grave reservations for the annex. So you know I just want to put this out there. Certainly the component that we're looking at today we're not relitigating the landmarks position of community board. Five. This I mean you know we wrote a resolution. We said what we had to say we're looking at the land use component and basically, what we have to determine is whether the work that is being proposed is going to be an enhancement that justifies this bonus. But I just want you to know that, on the pure restoration of the theater, we were just in awe of the quality, and you know exquisite attention to detail that was paid for the restoration. So with that being said, we're going to go to questions. I Wanna remind also everyone that we're not taking any action tonight. This proposal, if I understand correctly and Paul correct me if I'm wrong, but has not yet quite been certified, correct, yeah it's going to be certified on the 14th of September so because it has not yet been certified. We can not take any action because you know if anything, changes materially. We want to make sure that we actually only weigh in on applications that have been certified by the Department of State planning. It is imminent, as you have seen through. You know, lengthy presentation. It is a pretty complex and complicated set of actions that are in front of us, so I think it's helpful that we had a chance to hear it, but the applicant is going to come back to us for action so that we can opine and we'll have an opportunity to ask more questions. So what I would like to suggest is that tonight, if you have pressing questions that would help you dig into the material and better understand what is in front of us. Let's do that. Otherwise we can hold those more technical questions and you know maybe even the more philosophical questions that may actually look like comments for next month. I assume you guys are going to come for the October committee meeting. Is that the plan Paul the well. We think I think it's the September 30th meeting. Yes, that would be our October. That said, yes, we're going to be coming for that. Okay, so if you have any members of the committee, if you have any questions that would help you better understand the action that is in front of us go ahead. Otherwise I would suggest that you hold. You know the more technical or more philosophical questions for next month, so use the raised hand button that is located somewhere. Look. Maybe you want to tell members where the race hand button is located. It's in the participants panel on the lower right hand, side. Thank you by now. I think everybody is pretty fluent with zoom. So any questions from members of the committee. Okay, I see no hands raised. I would make this. Oh, I see your hand raised. Yeah Julie go ahead. I guess I'm a little confused about the far and how that works. It says that 119,000, so it's two questions hundred nineteen thousand can be transferred, but somebody's determining if it's all of it or part of it and then my other question is that in the text it says that, even if you do not get this 119,000 square feet for your 264,000 development hotel development, you can, you will still be able to build 230,000 square feet because you're getting some floor area from other parts of the theater district. I guess I'll take that so to answer. The first question in the general rule in zoning is that you can not transfer four area acrosss zoning district boundaries where the districts, the two districts, have different maximum basic maximum permitted floor area ratios. So this is a boundary that has that quality for commercial uses and so that, in order to transfer the floor area in order to both generate the bonus in both sides of the line and to utilize all of the commercial floor area in the c5.5 effectively transferring it acrosss the line. We need to have a text change because it would result in a slightly higher footprint, far in the c5.5 than would otherwise be permitted in terms of the 230 that's a that is. I would call that a hypothetical analysis, but it is designed to show to illustrate the difference between what you're, seeing here by way of the build size of the buildings and what could be done as of right and so to talk about that. There are two as of right mechanisms for enlarging the hotel. One is the floating air rights transfer, which would be an as of right transfer from a theater on a different zoning lot to this zoning lot, and that would allow for an increasing floor area and then the second would be a transfer, a limited transfer of floor area acrosss the zoning district boundary, which is also permitted as of right, but it's limited, which is again part of the reason why we're looking and hoping to get a text change so that we can utilize all of that floor area. If you put those two together, you get a building, you would get a building on the clarity hotel side of 230,000 square feet. What you would not get is you would not get the restoration, the kind of high quality restoration that's being proposed here. You would not get the full benefits that come from this proposal, both to the theater itself, the back of house space, the audience amenities and so on, because they're the bonus is working here to encourage the kinds of enhancements that are being proposed. Does that answer your question Julie? So, okay, I know it's a little arid we're going to have time to review that you know in a more serene and in- depth fashion. Until the applicants come back next month, Aaron, you have a question: go ahead, Aaron! So just you know. I know we'll give in some more details about this, but you know you're clearly making a real case for the hardships of this theater to operate in the modern era. When you know a lot of these same challenges would impact every other theater in the district. What might be really helpful is some more comparisons right, like is the court theater really on the on the worst side of these issues, because a lot of the things you're claiming are consistent challenges, acrosss the board and it's to say that court can't compete with everyone else. You know I'm sort of not seeing that connection. So some more examples about where court sits on the spectrum, because even the some of the things you're talking about are challenges acrosss the board. You know that I think would really be helpful for us to sort of validate. You know these concerns, which are valid but again are common in every historic theater. Let me just say one thing and if John and Julio, if you want to add, but I'm going to talk about it from the policy standpoint, and that is that the theater rehabilitation bonus is not designed to help some theaters and not others, it's really there and it was adopted to encourage all theater owners to do the highest quality restorations and enhancements and rehabilitations that they can do so that the theater industry as a whole modernizes in a very high quality way for the next century. It's not it's not it in the course of doing that, you're going to address you're going to have to address the deficiencies of all of these theaters, but it's designed it's designed to encourage all of them to to be enhanced and improved. It has not been used very much. It's only been used twice before this, because it is very rare that you have a situation, and this have a you, have a situation where a theater is going to be dark through a at a time when a development site is being developed on the same zoning line. It's just it almost never happens, and this was a very rare. This was happened to be a very rare case and it Covid-19 does not really have anything to do with the theater being dark in this context, because the Schubert organization was prepared to keep the theater dark in order to accomplish the rehab because of the many advantages it brought to this theater now, the court does have some greater disadvantages, and I guess, if John and Julio, if you want to, if you're, if you want to, I think I think John could explain it. But let me just can explain it better than I can. But we've looked at this and we do have examples that we can provide you sort of create a comparison between the court theater and some of the other theaters in our in our portfolio. If I can just jump in quickly applicants before you further address Aaron's question, you know just to put a little bit of our structure in how these bonuses work. Basically, you know it is a discretionary action and basically the question that is asked of us when we chime in at opine- and you know to the Department of City planning- and you know finally, to the city Planning Commission. The question is the improvement, valuable, substantial and meaningful enough to the public to justify this bonus and the reason why this particular type of industry is eligible for these bonuses is because theaters are deemed to be a public service, a public benefit because they're cultural institutions. So you know as much as I think it's valid to look at what other theaters look like. I think that really the reference point is the theater itself, and you know I can tell you that when we're reviewing the landmarks proposal, we actually had a a tour of the theater. The photos that you have seen do not even come close to describing the tightness and the really you know difficult condition of working in this theater. It's a miracle that they even are able, you know to put productions, and you know to get the show going. So you know the difficulty of the site. Constraints are real and if indeed the bill to you know what has been shown. You know the improvement is substantial. Now we still have to determine if it is substantial enough to justify the bonus that they are asking, given that you know they want the maximum bonus permissible, and you know once again this is you know discretionary, so that this is more. You know the range of what we're looking at is not oh, are we are they going to match? You know the capabilities and comfort and improvements of another hotel, but are they really going from where they are here to really? You know an upgraded standard that they would not if they did not receive this bonus, and you know by all means applicants I do not know if julio or others on the team want to further address that, otherwise we can move on to the next question. I think John can ask that as well. I can briefly address a couple of Aaron's points there. The theater is unique. Some of the deficiencies we pointed out the loading door. I can not think of another broadway theater that has that kind of a restriction and that causes scenery shops to have to build things in a certain way, so they can be brought into this theater. It puts up, puts a premium on the cost of getting a show into this house. The stage left wing there are some theaters with somewhat restricted wings less than ideal, but this is an extreme case and I think, if you looked at all the broadway stages and the depth of wings, you would find that this is at the worst end of the spectrum. Similarly, if we took dressing rooms and showed available dressing room square footage, you would find that this theater is very deficient in that regard. So a lot of things that were appointed, I completely understand your point in that all of the most of the broadway theaters, the historic ones, are pre-1930 early 20th century audiences and shows have changed greatly. So, there's a lot of things that the broadway theaters share that are difficult, yet they are presenting world- class theater, probably the standard for live theater in the world, but this house has unique deficiencies that really make it stand out. Thank you. Thank you. I should add one other thing: yeah go ahead, John in doing the rehab of the auditorium, removing exposed ductwork, removing other structural elements doing alterations so that the side of the house adjoining the annex can work with the Annex and the exiting works on that side. When we do all this work in the auditorium, we're not gaining one more seat, in fact we're probably going to lose somewhere on the order of nine or ten seats. So, unlike most businesses, where a major investment in a facility would result in better opportunities to increase revenue or build your business in other ways here, there will actually be a slight reduction in revenue. That's why it's so important to allow such a scope, a great scope of improvements to get this bonus to allow that to happen. Thank you. Do we have any further questions by members of the committee? Okay, so none I will turn to members of the public if members of the public have any questions or comments to this application, please use the raise hand button. If you are calling in you can punch star. Nine will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's star nine and when you do that, Luke will permit you to join the conversation, any questions or comments from members of the public. Okay, so I see none we're going to move to business session, which basically is non- existent. Given that it's a it's, not an action item, I just want to wrap up very quickly to remind members of the committee that the applicant will come back to us. I really urge you to read the the very thorough material that the that the applicants have submitted. I know it's deep and dense, but I really encourage you to follow on the lead of Julie's question. I know it's technical and I know it's dry, but this is really what we're looking at. So I'm available in the coming weeks to you know, help you understand the the mechanisms that are being triggered and I look forward to the applicant coming back and giving us a bridge presentation this time, given that we're pretty up to date and to further discuss this matter and come to a resolution. So thank you very much applicants for coming and giving us this presentation and we'll see you next month. Thank you. Thank you, members of the committee. We really appreciate your time. Thank you so much. Thank you. So now we are moving on to the application, which is our final item on the agenda. 519 Madison Avenue. This is the Ibm building. This is an action item, so we'll have to take a vote. I just want to make sure the members of the committee are aware that we are at Quorum, but we're not comfortably over Quorum, so please do not leave because we certainly do not want to be in a situation where. Finally, when it is time to vote, we have lost the forum. This has happened in the past. It is a very uncomfortable situation. I will also ask Luke to closely monitor the attendance, and I will ask members of the committee if you do have to leave and you have no choice and you have a good excuse. You're about to you know, go through something I do not know whatever your reason is. It has to be really serious to leave drop a note in the chat so that I'm aware of any change in attendance. Okay. So that being said, we're going to go to a presentation by the applicants for the Ibm building. I think the team is here and you have the floor. Go ahead, oh good evening, Madam, chairman of the committee, my name is Bob Flyhive, I'm with frame 11., I'm joined tonight by Jeff Sussman who's, the executive vice president of the Edward J minskoff representing the owner, and then our architect is Dan Shannon and Juan Carlos Otto Zarnaga from Moabis and Shannon I'll start Jc. Can you load the presentation? Oh good, all right? Okay, let's go! Let's go to the the please is my screen froze okay, we are okay. The the 590 madison the Ibm building is on the southwest corner of Madison East 57Th street. It was constructed as one of the regional offices for Ibm and it's probably its two most prominent features are the arcade at the corner of 57th street and its indoor public space, which has been recognized since the day it's opened as one of the most successful public spaces in New, York City. Let's go to number two, as you can see here, here's the site. It's currently in a split lot when it was built, it was in a 15-time zone and the special permit was for 46 story 18 far building it was approved in 1977 Ibm, ultimately decided to construct a slightly smaller building a 43-story building at 16.9 far, but the even a smaller building retained all of the ground floor, public spaces. It's currently in a mix of a 15 zone and a 12 zone. So it's overbuilt by about 128,000 square feet. The building is about 830,000 square feet. Zoning! Please the! Let's see that a little logic. How can everyone see this? Okay, the 1977 special permit modified, heightened setback and approved the floor area bonus for the arcade, which extends from 57th street to 56th street it all the building also included as of right bonuses for a covered pedestrian space, which is a triangular shape outlined in red, an urban plaza on the corner of 56Th Street and the arcade I mentioned, which is a corner arcade at the corner of Madison and 57th street within the interior public space. There is also a seating, slash retail area of approximately 3,500 square feet that did not receive a bonus, but since it's within the envelope of the space is also governed by the approved drawings of the special permit. There were two previous modifications of three actually, the first two were relatively minor, but they enclosed the 57th street entrance in a 56 street entrance and installed revolving doors. Previously, the through block was open to the elements and then and then the second modification added a revolving door adjacent to the urban Plaza on 56th street. So the space itself, although we consider it in interior space because it's all roofed, does not have the standard ventilation that you would normally provide if it had not been approved with openings. You know as part of the through block the current plan or the current. The existing condition was actually approved in 1995, so the space opened in 1983. It was viewed immediately as being a very successful space. The new owner purchased it in 1994 and sought an approval by the City Planning Commission. That would establish that we would move three trees and establish the current sculpture garden. So the first 12 years of his existence was under essentially the same approved form since 1995 has really been operating as his indoor sculpture garden. That also has, in addition to the rotating sculpture, exhibits. It has eight trees, 32 movable tables, 10, movable chairs and a food kiosk. The food kiosk as you'll see in the next drawing is currently down in the southeast corner. The proposed cafe seating: let's go to the the proposed cafe seating, which would take up approximately 1400 square feet of that 3,500. Non- bonus area is designed to visually integrate the cafe seating with the larger public space. If there are no questions in terms of the action before you I'd like Dan, to not only discuss how the proposed changes to establish his cafe seating, but also detail the upgraded public space signage that we've agreed to do to reflect city planning's recent public space Dan. Do you want to sure, of course thank you, Bob and, as Bob said in his comments, I think we all recognize the space that was created in the original building by Edward Larabee Barnes has to been a very successful covered. Pedestrian space and public space for the Plaza district is tonight we're to talk about improvements made to what you see on the lower right hand corner around the existing Kiosk Food kiosk. That is there it's possible to use the cursor so that you can yeah yes, so that this is the area of focus in the non- bonus area in making the open- air cafe, as Bob said, more integrated to the space. So it fits with the planning principles of open air cafe that they do not establish as distinct boundaries between what is dedicated seating for the cafe and what is public seating for the rest. So the plan is Bob says it indicates the existing Kiosk, the entry from Madison Avenue, the in the space, is one of the trees and then the seating around that Jc. If you could go to the please. Thank you. This indicates the entries, the primary entries to the space, the through block the building itself and then the retail associated retail of the property in the please. This is a picture of the existing facility prior to the pandemic when it was still functioning and as you can see, through the landscaping elements and some of the other pieces that made the the facility function, that it essentially created a boundary that is not in keeping both visually or with the city planning regulations regarding open air cafes, our proposal Jc. The please is simply removes the landscaping elements that are around there and installs simple, elegant moving partitions that are transparent, that allow one to see into the space but give a very simple demarcation between what is waiter seating and what is not seeding. So the substitution of that the removal of certain large service counters to that the integration of very simple on signage. Behind you see the Kiosk, the Kiosk Functions in two three ways: actually one is a very important grab and go where you can go up and order from the menu there and sit in the public space or go on your way. Another is that there is seating at the kiosk for a quicker bite to eat, and then, of course, it's the service area for the cafe itself. There are no proposed changes to that. The reason there is, as you can see, the one bamboo assembly that remains as part of the iconography of the space and the umbrellas are there as Bob alluded to you know, the climate control in the space is not as modern as it could be, and the umbrellas do function as very important. Solar shades throughout the year in the space and we go to the this- is a simply a diagram of the partition that demarks the area. It's not permanent. It does not get bolted into the floor. It does not change the architecture of the space, it's frosted only as a modesty screen, so people feel comfortable sitting next to it. Next, with that, there are improvements to the current sign regulations, so there are upgrade to the entry signs throughout the space that, with the new, the new standards attached to that and what else and just really quickly if we could go further Jc, I just want to show the detail one more of the space. You can see it blown up here, the kiosk as it is the seating and the grab and go. Is it in the upper left hand? Quadrant and Jc could ser where you know where you go up just to order a coffee right along. There are those seats at the bar, so to speak, there's a high table next to the window and then, of course, the seating throughout we've moved the service areas, so they are not in the public space proper. There's a menu board adjacent to the service counter in the location as Jc is showing today and that's our proposal. It's we found that this cafe was one that functioned very well. As you all know, they're, because you know trying to bring food and beverage service through a kiosk is challenging at times the operator prior to the pandemic. It was a very high quality and did a very good job, and it was well served throughout by the public and the office workers. Obviously, the pandemic has put quite a pressure on that and if you have any questions or if Jeff wants to speak to the current conditions and future plans, he certainly can. Thank you all. Thank you. If you have any more members of your team who want to address the committee, I think that would be great. We typically just run through the entire presentation before the committee goes into questions. Do you wish? No, I you know, I think we'd be happy to answer questions Sam awesome! Thank you so much okay. So I will open up the floor to members of the committee. Are there any questions to this application for members of the committee? Mike? Really, you have your hand up Mike go ahead, hello. What are the hours that the public space will be open for the public space is open from 8 A.M to 10 P.M and has been since 1995., and will you will you'll be contemplating changing it to our a little bit earlier than 8 A.M? No, we have not had any discussion with city planning about that and we do not really see any benefit to it. To be honest of opening it, I mean this time gives the staff the ability to clean it up, get it ready for the morning and eight o'clock is ready to open and that's when the kiosk, which is one of the amenities also opens, but for workers that are coming in the morning. They could not sit down there before the kiosk opens well, no, the kiosk and the and the public space opens at the same time opens and closes at the same time. Okay, thank you. I see that Nancy has her hand up nancy go ahead. My question is: I'm not clear that there seems to be a private space and a public space right. Am I right about that? There's a non- bonus space, which is that southern edge, where the kiosk in the cafe is, and then there are the bonus spaces which are to the north within the red, the covered pedestrian space and then the through block, but they're all consider they'll operate as one indoor space. It's just that technically we're not taking any area to privatize that generated a bonus. Okay. My other question was: I was concerned about in the rendering, where you have the clear panels. The floor supports, look like they're, a tripping hazard, particularly for elderly, and those people that might be sight impaired. What are we going to do about those opportunities for tripping? This? Is it the feet? Connectors of the panels are in the circulation area. Right now I understand a question: Dan: do you have a design approach that might avoid that issue? The primary person of the selection is not to make it a permanent fixture and we can move them slightly back so that they are not in the path that happens to be the particular design of that item. Okay, I have a question lately I'll wait until the business session, but I'm concerned about the signage that we require to be throughout the space that it's open to the public, the areas that are open to the public and it's very clear, laila. You know what I'm talking about absolutely. I just have to admit that I am now a little confused. What exactly is in front of us and who has jurisdiction over this particular area, given that it is a non- bonus area is still part of the pops and yes, it is absolutely it's just another bonus. Technically we city planning has asked that we amend the restrictive deck to call out this area as a pedestrian access area, a paa which would give it some more legal standing, but within that paa would be the kiosk, which is a required amenity of the largest phase, and this cafe seating, which is what we're seeking to show on the approved plans. But it's all under the jurisdiction of city planning, okay and but it is under the same zoning. You know section of the zoning resolution as the bonus area or not. It is because what happens is that you, the plans that we've submitted as part of the application would become the substitute approved plans for the ground floor. So we, the requirement of special permit, would be that the space be constructed and maintained in accordance with those plans, and that covers the whole space as well as the outdoor public space. Okay. So, although it is non- bonus, it is not treated any differently so now. Something that I'm not totally clear about is that this seating area does currently exist. Yes, it does and it is exclusively used by patrons of the kiosk who on table service, that's correct and is it in compliance with the current writing of the approval of this area? No, the current drawings just show it as a retail seating area without showing, what's in that area, which is why the department of buildings issued a violation back in 2017, saying that the cafe was not shown on your approved plans and we sat down with city planning and said, we'll be happy to amend the approved plans to show the cafe and they've been supportive of it. But you know it's taken a while to get the point, so you mean that you are trying to cure a violation. Well, no, we already, but yes, we paid the fee, but the full of the same need to pay that in your presentation at any moment, so you're trying to cure yes, but by updating the approved plans. Okay, I have much more questions, but I think that we have some right- hand. Members of the committee, I want to give everybody a chance to ask their questions. There were raised hands and I do not see them anymore, then. I will continue with my questions, so just so that I understand correctly in 2017, so you've been operating this seating that is dedicated for table service exclusively for patrons of the kiosk and you've been operating in 2017. You were issued a violation by the department of building, citing that this is in non- compliance with the plans, as filed with the Department of City planning, correct, okay, and then you continue to operate it. But then you went the route of trying to cure this violation to make it permissible and to change the approval of what the use of this space is dedicated. To is okay, several months of discussion with city planning about what type of barriers they would feel would work best. We went back, we had landscaping options. We won the reaching agreement that we thought these frosted acrylic panels would be the better way to go. Okay, but just to be clear, the violation is not about it's not only about the landscaped barriers. It is also about the tables. Oh absolutely, okay, and have you had conversations with the Department of City planning on the tables? Yes, they recognize that. Well, let me explain how and Jeff can jump in, as I understand how the operator has dealt with this, the kiosk, which is on the approved plans, has both you know, grab and go for the public space or for office or whatever, and had added this sit- down element to it, which otherwise would be permitted. What they found out was that by adding a sit- down element, they were able to expand the offering on the menus, because you have a you know and also obtain a liquor license because they had a defined space and that, in turn, made the cafe, I'm sorry, the kiosk, a more functioning business enterprise. So over the years prior to 2017, it's been there a fairly long time. What originally started as kind of an informal place in order at the Kiosk, the server will bring it over to a table, became more of this formal. Oh, I have this landscaped area. Cordendorf you can sit. There now will be a waiter who will go to the kiosk and bring you your food or beverage. It never diminished the public amenities in terms of the number of tables or chairs being provided for the public or the other amenities the sculpture was not location was not moved. It's just to the west of that it was, as my client explained, the other day, the operator kind of morphed, what was kind of a informal relationship into a more formalized. You know these tables are part of a cafe. Please order off the same menu as a kiosk. Overall, we have not had resistance from city planning and on any level, because even the covered pedestrian space to the north that permitted under the fifth Avenue districts up to one- third of the area could be an open air cafe. So it was envisioned as part of the that district, and it said in 1977 that up to one third of the area could be a cafe on a theory that reserve seating would activate the space, encourage more people to use the overall space and kind of extend the hours of activity. Not only you know in midday when you expect it and some in the morning but into the evening and make people feel more comfortable. So when we came to city planning, we pointed out where the location was, and we jointly came to the realization that, although it's only fourteen hundred square feet, it, which is like twenty percent of the the calf of the of the common pedestrian space, is less than 10 of the whole area. It's a relatively small element, so they did not feel the use was intrusive and in fact the cafe use was permitted by the special part by the Fifth Avenue district. The problem was, it was never shown on our plans. It was just listed as a you know, retail seating area, so we were not operating in accordance with the approved plans and hence we had to go through a minor modification of special permit. I have lots of follow- up questions, but I see that we have one of our members who has a question. So let me take it ej, you have your hand up, go ahead, yeah, I'm just I'm just looking for even more clarity on the timeline. I understand that the violation was issued in 2017. and, and so it was, the setup was in violation of the special permit for some period of time. Before that you know, I understand that you're saying it was sort of a gradual morphing of the use of the space. So maybe you can't pinpoint a particular time where the violation started, but do you have any information on a when this vendor came in maybe what year that was and b a year by which that you know the space was being used in this way, even though the actual violation was not issued until 2017., I personally do not think Jeff Sussman. You know I do not recall, but it was probably somewhere around 2015 or 2016 that it started becoming a little bit more permanent. I think one of the things you know to mention here and again I live this space day in and day out. Is you know, overall, the space is very well used highly utilized by the public, and one of the things that makes it so well received is the fact that anyone can come in here, get some food and sit and have lunch or have a coffee have a coffee and a muffin. You know and the fact that there's something there a place for them to buy it. The issue, of course, is that you know these kiosks are business ventures they're, not charitable organizations, they're not there to lose money, so you have to give these guys an opportunity to make enough money to be able to provide this service. These guys, you know, really got hammered when in November 2016 without you know reminding everyone what happened in November, 2016 56th street was closed. 57Th street became you know, covered in police barricades and the entire areas. You know, nature changed, so you know these guys been trying to make a living. You know, prior to Covid-19 and doing what he can to you know, have enough business to be able to ride the grab and go part of what's going on here. I do not think anyone, you know, you know maliciously did anything as much as you know we were you know he just kept trying to improve his business and try and make it profitable enough to keep it in operation. This is the third operator in the space since 1995, and you know as times change and people change. You know these things have to change in. You know to match the times and continue to be businesses. Ej. Did that answer your question. I did not mean to ask your question yeah as much as much as it can in terms of giving me a sense of the points and time we're talking about. I just have a quick follow- up to Ej's question, who was permitted to use this seating prior to 2016.. Well, the cafe seating that you see you go back a slide. You know behind the landscaping, was added by the tenant and was in addition to the public seating required. We always maintain 110 movable chair chairs into 32 tables. This was additional furnishings that the tenant owns and put out so it did not exist. What so? What was there? I think it was you know. If I remember correctly, it was just part of the open space areas where we either put some of the artwork and just you know, circulation space, much like where, if you went back to the floor plan, you know much like where you see the sculpture and the area. You know that's adjacent to it on the south right and then you have, and you see other areas where there's no seating, I mean the seating here is the where the seating, the public seating is that was mandated in the original declaration, where those seats were so the rest of it was really just open circulation space. Okay, thank you, members of the committee, any further questions. Okay, seeing none, I will open up the floyd to members of the public. Do we have any questions from members of the public? If you have a question, if you wish to speak, use the raise hand, function and Luke will permit you to speak any questions comments, okay, seeing none! We will move to a business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and members of the committee. I would like to hear your comments. Do we have any comments on this proposal? Nancy yeah. I think we have to encourage them to do our signage requirements right, for example, or just I do not understand how that would apply or signage, but you know they would have to abide by what we require of any applicant, which is that you know it. It's okay to operate a cafe, it's okay, to have a seating, but it has to be available to non- purchasing customers as well as yeah, and that's what I'm that's what I'm confused about, because I do not quite understand how that applies, because the pops, what we require with the pops in terms of eating restaurants, cafes and pops, is very different than what this is doing. That's why I'm not really is basically what they're proposing is to extend the capacity of the the out the public space, the public seating, and they want to dedicate this additional seating exclusively to you to be used by patrons of this kiosk. So you know if it were like a brand new application, they would basically say: okay, we want to install you, know 12 tables and 24 seats right. You would say: yes, that's fine. We have no issue with that, but it has to be also available to non- purchasing customers. So what do we do so? Do we not so do we want to give our opinion that we do not want those partitions that separate it off or because it seems that that's yeah? So I think that you know we and we probably are going to have to you know, get out of business session and you know seek the the comment of the applicant on the policy that we have, which is to ask that you know. Applicants do agree that the seating can not be you know solely used by patrons and that non- purchasing visitors can sit and that the signage has to reflect that signage, that we typically asked to be on the table. Little plex glass, little standing cards and table tents table ten yeah as well as the sandwich boards. So layla, then do we have to advise them that we have these rules and requirements, because I do not think they're aware of them. Yeah I want to. I want to hear more comments from Mexico and then I think we're going to have to get out of business session to re-, engage with the with the applicant to share what our policy is and what our views are of this specific application and then we'll move back to two business session. Ej has his hand up go ahead, Ej well, just on the same topic and Nancy said a lot of what I was going to say already. If and I'm having a hard time. Thinking of a specific other example, where we've allowed a cafe under the same rules, but where it's had the same sort of segregated area, you know tied to the kiosk, even with say a sandwich board, and I do not know where it would go in this in this little layout here, but maybe just outside of the frosted glass partition and little sandwich signs on the on the tables inside the partition. You know with the partitions specifically making it look like a private restaurant. I think I think you know you you'd have a hard time even getting the point acrosss to people that they could, that they could enter that area and sit down, and that is their space that they're allowed to sit at whether or not they're buying anything from that vendor. So I think you know I think we'd have to either make sure that the signage goes above and beyond, or just make sure that the signage rules are adhered to extremely strictly. You know to make it clear that this is not just space for customers yeah that that's right, so I think that the way to look at it- and you know we're getting a little confused, maybe because in the end it is you know, an attempt to cure violation. But let's pretend for a second that there is no seating at that particular location and that the applicant is coming fresh and telling us that they want to increase the seating. We would basically tell them what we tell any applicant, which is you know, it's probably fine. We probably have no objection to bringing more intrusions. We feel that you know seating is a public benefit, but the seating, although it is close to the kiosk and will have a direct relationship with the kiosk, can not be solely for the private use of the patrons of of the kiosk. So I think that you know here we're in a kind of you know similar situation, and I agree with you ej. I think that, as a result, the partition is something that we can not support. I see that Nancy has her hand up nancy go ahead. I think things are further complicated with the fact that this operator has a liquor license. That is correct, because if anyone comes into this space, children, teenagers, young people they're under their underage- how does that work with a liquor license yeah? So that's a that's a real complication for me. So I'm again I'm confused about how to do what we normally do and yet maintain the boundaries that I believe would be required if they are serving alcohol. That's correct! So what I would like to do is to move out of business sessions so that we can communicate to the applicant what our policy is on these types of applications, and then we can move back to to business session, so we're out of business session, and I just want to communicate to the applicants that typically, you know in the instance that we're not dealing with it with a violation there would be no tables and an applicant would come to us with an application to install more tables would basically typically support such application, provided that the number of tables is reasonable tables and chairs, and we would ask that these tables are open to non- purchasing visitors and that they're open to the public and not reserved for the patrons of such establishment. Typically, this is you know what we have negotiated with many applicants over the years and all of them actually have agreed to sign such affidavits. That would state exactly that. In this case, as Nancy said, it's complicated by two facts: the fact that it is already in operation- and it already exists- it is enclosed by this- you know boundary, which has provided the opportunity to the operator of the Kiosk to gain a to obtain a legal license. So I think that we, the committee, would support an application that would basically be for those tables that you currently have. I think we do not have an issue with a number of tables and chairs, but we would ask that the seating is open to the general public and visitors that the barriers be eliminated and that signage would mention that the the seating is open to to any visitors and that no purchase is necessary to use these these seats. I see that Nancy has her hand up. So I'm going to take your question or comment, and then we will have we'll give the opportunity to the applicant to respond okay, so, okay. So what is different about this particular space? Is that all of the other seating areas that we have proved in pops are outside and are auxiliary. In addition to an indoor restaurant space, this particular operator, this is their only space that to me, is also a complication and may set this up a little differently now, in my mind, as I'm thinking about it, because this is their whole space, this is not auxiliary to an operation, so I think we need to keep that in mind as well. Okay, let's hear what the what the applicant has to respond to our policy if any, and then we can continue back to business session, I'm actually aware of you, having articulated our policy for open air cafes that are actually taking away from what otherwise is bonus public space. I think there are a number of levels of distinction here, one we're not in we're not occupying bonus space, whereas the outdoor cafe the entire area was open to the public in order to achieve the bonus and the open- air cafe allows up to 20 of the area to be restricted for cafe seating as a permitted obstruction. That's much different than our case. The bonus area never included this space. The second thing is that there's a com very complicated operational here and the SLA is definitely part of it. We spent many months with the SLA and city planning trying to interpret their regulations, saying that I'm quoting that establishments with an on- premises license the sale and consumption of alcohol must be confined to specific areas licensed by the authority, because, initially city planning said they had no problem with the cafe. They did not like the barriers. They wanted us to use the open air bonus regulations that were just the white lines on the on his case on the floor, but came to the realization that, because of the liquor license type of operation, that would jeopardize our ability to operate such a such a premises because we could not define it. Someone could theoretically order a glass of wine a bottle of wine and just walk off without knowing that they were supposed to be sitting in a designated area. So you know, I guess our plea would be twofold. One is that we feel we're much different than your standards that you would apply for a bonus area, that's being privatized. This has never been a bonus area and then, secondly, because of the nature of the operation, the kiosk is viewed as an amenity to space. The pops book cites that the earlier Fifth Avenue district encouraged people to put private cafes in, like in a Sony building a private space in order to help activate it during those off hours. It draws people it's a magnet and we have a difficult business here issue with a tenant who has not been in contact with the owner since March. When he closed up. We do not know if he's coming back under what circumstances he would come back. So you know I can't see how we can. I mean I can respect what you put into your recommendations, but I can't see how we can agree to not having any barriers and having it having open to the open to the public, I'm not sure what would be left for either this operator when he comes back or to attract the next operator. I see that Mike really has his hand up. We are we're still in a question and with the applicant I will let you know when we move back to business session. Mike go ahead. So is this floor area with the tables and chairs? Is it private space or is it public space? It is? It is considered part of the public atrium because it's on the drawings, but it never generated a bonus. It's a very unusual situation, situations 3,500 square feet. That was at the original approval that granted the bonus said it was to be used for retail and seating area. At one point I saw in the record they were going to put a flower market in there that never happened, and it was only in 1995 when a sculpture garden was approved, that the kiosk was moved to that entry and that the current situation minus the cafe you know- has been operating so it's operated successfully for 25 years. So I still do not understand. Is it private or public? Well, it's privately owned, but it's part of what's called a pop space. You know it's subject to the regulations of city planning. It's all! It's all one giant room! It's you know 65 feet to the roof. It's glass covered, it's one giant room. It just happened to be as part of the approval showing his retail and seating area and did not generate a bonus which you can see on the the I think was page three, which was the original 77 approval. There's no question about that. It did not generate, whereas this is the original look in the lower right hand corner. This is the original 1977 approved plan. It's listed as a non- bonus area and at Monday's review session. Both the chair and members of the commission expressly presented that as an unusual set of circumstances. They did not say whether you know they were going to vote for this, as is how they were going to consider it, but they acknowledged that this was a very unusual set of circumstances. Can you actually enlarge the area in question so that we can get a better it's this lower rectangular area? Can you see my cursor? I do not know. If I can control it, we can see your cursor okay. This is the this is a 77 approved plan. It's this area. This is the this side is all building, and now I do not. I do not see your cursor anymore. Oh maybe it was not my cursor Jc. Is it yours, yeah? Okay, that's Jc, show the footprint of the building, which is like the the upper right hand, two quadrants, that's the footprint of the building and then the three areas within what's called the public atrium is a dashed red area which is a common pedestrian space. Okay, and that is the portion that generated the bonus that generated a bonus. It has the right bonus and then the area to the west of that where it says through block Arcade that goes from 57th that generated a bonus as part of the special permit. Okay, I should also mention in terms of bonus, I'm sorry keep going so the area that we are talking about can make is go around. That is, that 3,500 square feet of the seat. What was called seating, slash retail area- you can see it on the original plate and it is non- good ethereum. Non- bonus right, okay and all those bonus calculations are in the upper right hand, corner. We do not need to go through them, but it's all documented on this original approval and that's why I think it's much. I joined a distinction between you know a cafe physically sitting outside on a bonus, plaza, that's generated floor area Bonus, and I understand your position that the public should not lose that and the amount of privatization should be limited here. This was a benefit that was presented by the owner just to finish out the atrium space. It could have become another form of retail. It could have become, as you said, like a flower shop or other form of retail correct what I had. So what I saw was a flower, mod type thing you're thinking of, and I think it even says that on a plan, if you jc, can you make this? It says seating area, retail. If you make that a little larger, it says probably new stand and flower sales, flowers kiosks, but that was a theory, but at the time of the original approval that never came to fruition, okay, but the kiosk itself is not located within this dotted blue line. It is located in the square that says urban Plaza. No, it's a blue line, it's just to the left to the sky, we're coming in more and that's where kiosks, and that is on the approved plan. Okay, so the amount of seating, the existing seating open to the public is not being reduced. It's not being altered in any way shape or form. The kiosk itself has been approved and is not part of what we're looking at the seating that is auxiliary to the kiosk is the only portion that we're talking about and we're talking about it in a complex way, because it was installed in violation and you're now trying to cure the violation. Okay, all right nancy go ahead. You have a question: can is it possible to show this non- bonus area line in the plan that has the seating? Do you have a yes plan showing that? Yes, that Jc that's the next, I think that's in the should have that. Maybe one more yeah, okay, there, okay great! Thank you, that's what I needed to see oops and that that's just designated, but it looks like somehow it looks like purple one of mine, I'm not sure, okay, but we have. We have a good visual representation, so, okay, so the kiosk is there, and so what we're talking about right now is solely those additional tables that are cordoned off or we're also talking about the seating around the kiosk, as well as the the high tops to the east of the group. No, the seating around the kiosk is on the approved plans, and the high tops were also part of the approval. Okay and are those reserved for patrons of the of the cafe, not really yeah it's Jeff. Can you I'm not sure how that really operates? It would probably strike me that if you purchase something at the takeout line and wanted to go sit over here, that was fine, because you know I mean it's, but you can. You can also sit there. I've sat there without being a patron of the cafe. So and probably you know, evidence is really meaningful. It does not have it's not a table service area, it's not something where it's not table service drinks or dinner or something okay. Thank you all right. Do we have any more questions by members of the committee and, if not, then we can move back to a business session. Is everybody really clear on what is in front of us and why so just to make sure on the applicant's front, the the idea that you would remove the the barriers and make it available to non- purchasing patrons is something that you can not entertain for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is a little license attached to this particular seating area. Yes, that's correct, okay and it looks like Luke Sabatos, who is the Community Board Community associate, may have some information about the liquor license Luke. Do you wish to share that information with the committee as well as the applicant sure, so we received this liquor, license renewal notice in December 2019, and it got a no comment from the psql committee, primarily because you know whenever we get liquor licenses and pops, that's usually checked as an outdoor licensed area, and this renewal notice did not give any information about that. This is in a pops or anything. So I think for future renewals or liquor licenses. We'd ask the applicant to specify and flag that this is you know in a pops and that's why you know Psgl did not communicate with land use because it did not come up on our radar. Okay. Thank you. That's that that's helpful, just also for clarification from the applicants. When was the original license granted Jeff, you might know the exact date. I do know that the previous well the tenant as through March Obika. He renewed a previously granted license because one of the things we were looking for, which we were not able to find because he was in the original licensee looking to see what type of plans were provided to support the quote premises of the establishment. Jeff. Do you have a time frame when that the previous? You know what is how long are the liquor licenses for? I'm still right now, looking through the records, but I see a renewal from 2013, so at least till 2011.. That sounds. That sounds a lot farther back than I remember, but I mean again, if you have it, you have it. I you know I do not know. I can't tell you more specifically and look what you see is a renewal in 2013 right and renewals come their two- year, term periods, so, okay, so at least 2011. okay. So it's been going on for almost 10 years. Okay, all right, any more questions from members of the committee, seeing not we are moving to business session and with the intention to stay in business session this time. So it is a complicated situation. It is an unusual situation and it is a situation that, to my recollection, we have never been faced. So you know, I would like to hear your comments on this very unusual application. Ej well to the question that Nancy is raising in the chat to my understanding- and I guess this is in conversation with you layla to my understanding. It does not. The fact that they had a liquor license does not immediately mean that they're, in violation of that they were that the existence of a liquor license means they were in violation of a special permit. My understanding is that, even if the liquor license was issued in 20 2011 for a kiosk that was in a pop space that it was the eventual addition of seats and partitions that eventually brought them into violation. Does that match what your understanding would have been like a liquor license like you can sell a beer in a pop space right? Oh, you need to have an unclosed premise in order to sell alcohol and therefore they would qualify for legal license only because it was enclosed, meaning that, for example, the open seating that is part of the bonus area could not receive a liquor license. Even if there was a high- end restaurant using the seating because it is open and not cordoned off you can not. You can not use it as your premise and you do not think that the SLA would have considered the fact that they were indoors to be sufficient. No okay, you need to be divorced, but it has to be cordoned off so to get the learner license. They would have had to have introduced the partitions, correct yeah, which you know to the point that Bob was making. You know it would be interesting to see what they filed with in their original application with the SLA, but they had to represent that it's entirely enclosed. You know so that you're, preventing you, know inadvertently serving alcohol to to minors yeah, okay. Well, that would be that. That being the case, you know, I, like you, said it's complex, there's overlapping jurisdictions of different licenses. You know going on here. I think that I mean we're not we're not psql, and we have to really look at the land use application. That is in front of us. I think there are two you know separate issues here. The first one is there's a violation that basically has triggered a chain of events that you know the seating started to creep in and then they decided to put partitions around and then they got the liquor license. They did it in the absolute wrong sequence. Okay, so you know today 2020 this is the reality. Now we have to determine how we feel about the violation, but we also have to decide if it was not a violation just on the merits of what is in front of us how we feel about it. So I think those are the two questions that we need to to address. If this were, you know brand new situation, we had an applicant who would come and say you know this is a non- bonus area. We have every right to have a commercial activity in this particular area, and this is the commercial activity we plan to have number of tables number of chairs and we plan to have a little license. What would be the position of the committee? Nancy has her hand up nancy, go ahead. Well, considering what's going on in the city in terms of Covid-19, and also the fact that 56th street between Madison and Fifth is a very difficult street now because of what is going on with Trump tower, I think we should do everything we can to help this space remain active. So I would like to support this in some way, because I think it's a part of the city, that's not in the best condition in terms of street and sidewalk activity, so I just wanted to make that point yeah. Thank you, Ej yeah! I was just going to add my current position is. I do not want to torpedo you know this vendor here, particularly given the situation. All the restaurants in the city are in. So you know as long as long as we, I think, made it clear through our usual signage and usual stipulations that you can enter the partition space, which, of course, is necessary for liberalism. You can enter the partition space and sit and not be harassed for not ordering anything. You know I do not. I do not right now have a real problem with this. My understanding is that the applicant wants to retain the commercial use of all the seating for the benefit of the patrons they're, not willing to entertain sharing the space, and the sharing of the space means that miners may end up sitting and consuming alcohol like there could result in a conflict with the liquor license. I see nancy, so I would have to disagree with Ej on this, because I think that I want to maintain the enclosure of the space that is serving alcohol, particularly to prevent miners from getting a hold of alcohol, and it's, I think, it's problematic. It's not part of the it's not part of the bonus space. So to me, it's okay to have it closed off and in fact, they're not even taking all of the non- bonus space. It looks like they're only taking a little more than half of it, so I would I'm fine with the way it is, and I would support that as a resolution. Okay, we have comments from Matt go ahead. I just Wanna. I agree with nancy that, given it's in the non- bonus area and even in the non- bodus area, there's space that anybody can use, that seems that seems positive and I would support her position. Thank you Ryan. Likewise, I would support it and part of my rationale in that. In addition to everything that's been described is if this was a scenario with say a flower market and and a newsstand, it would take up some footprint similar to this, where obviously people would be able to go and and as they can now go to the kiosk and get food themselves. But you know that sort of hypothetical scenario I would be comfortable with as well recognizing that a lot of that footprint would be inaccessible to the public for the operations of the the businesses as well. So, in addition to everything described, even these other sort of hypothetical scenarios make me comfortable with it all in the context of this being a non- bonus space. If this were in the bonus space, it would be an entirely different conversation, but I'm very comfortable with it as presented. Thank you, John Jonathan, Raybar yeah, I'm also in support not to get too repetitive I'll just say also that the benefit of having the enclosed space is or sorry the benefit of having you know, the liquor license is helped with the enclosed space. I think there would be a lot of confusion if this wide open space, you know, was able to be accessed entirely by the public. You know, and then I think that really you know serving liquor and that would be would go into like the red zone that we're looking at here so kind of demarcating. Where one can have you know alcohol consumption as part of that businesses? You know area probably makes the most sense. If there was not liquor, then perhaps we could push more for having the whole area open, but given that and also the being in the non- bonus space, I think should be appropriate. Okay, thank you. Any further comments, I'm one over okay, so I actually concur with with all of you guys. I think that the fact that is non- bonus that it was originally planned, as you know, for commercial use for retail use. I think it's then consistent. You know with with the spirit of this this area. I personally do not like violations, and I feel that you know like legalizing. A violation is a little bit problematic because we do not want to encourage the bad behaviors. In that case, you know somehow, given that you know it is that the use that is in violation is actually in compliance with the spirit of the area but was not properly certified, makes me feel a little more at ease, and you know it looks like it was. You know stemmed more from miscommunication between a tenant and the the landlord. I do not think there was any malice. What I think is also very important to recognize is how successful this particular pops has been. I think it's in my book, it's the most successful in our district, so you know. I think that this is also something that we have to keep in mind. You know, certainly I think that rewarding you know good actors that do activate the space that do provide. You know, quality service that you know maintain the other. The public seating that you know provide art with the sculptures is something that we have to. You know keep in mind in the on this scale. I think that, in order for us to make sure that we're not creating a president, we have to be very clear as to explaining the rationale why we believe that it is okay to have this private seating, why it is okay to have boundaries and why it is okay to have these particular boundaries. I think we should add some language about the tripping hazard that Nancy raised in her question. We just want to make sure that you know it is very circumscribed to you know this particular condition and that you know, and no other pops operator should. You know, take this as a reason to come back and say well. Actually we do want the same, so I you know. I think that we are all in agreement that this should be a an approval, a restrictive approval and very well argumented, but an approval nonetheless. So if anyone wants to make a motion now is the time do we have a motion to prove? Second, all right- and here is my Goat sheet: okay, so Julie, yes, Aaron, yes, Nancy, yes, Mike! Yes, ej! Yes, John! Yes, Evan! Yes, Ryan! Yes, Matt! Yes, did I miss anyone. Did I call everybody? Okay motion passes it's a unanimous vote and thank you to the applicant for their patience and, as I said, this will be presented to the full board of Cd5, which means on September. 10 attendance by the applicant is not mandatory but highly encouraged, and on that note the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Thank you very much, happy birthday time, good night. Thank you. We will be there. The tenth thank you.
