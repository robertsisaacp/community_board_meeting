Mcsam purchased the site from rockefeller the rockefeller group earlier this year, or maybe late last year, They also purchased from rgi the mcsam sites being developed with an as of right, hotel, The, highgate hotel site is an existing hotel, That's going to remain and finally lot 11, which is owned by clarity, is the site of a new hotel and that's the hotel that will , we hope, receive the benefit of the bonus floor area generated by the theater rehabilitation.
The ability to use bonus floor area anywhere on the zoning lot, regardless of where it's been generated, and, secondly, the text amendment would clarify the description of qualifying rehabilitation work, because this proposal, as you will see, kind of expands the envelope on what has been done in the past to enhance and modernize a broadway theater The full bonus is granted the clarity building, cardi hotel would be 49 stories and about 264 000 square feet What we'd like to do tonight is talk about the problems of the court.
So here we're showing the planned view of stage level or street level showing theater plus annex Drawing, you see evie, there is an elevator and the elevator was placed there to be able to serve audience during show times when the public is in the theater and then during the day time or during loadings or loadouts, when scenery is brought in and set up, and the elevator can also serve the show and will be very valuable, even on a daily basis to allow wardrobe people to wheel their wardrobe racks to costumes and place them in the dressing rooms on upper floors.
It expands dressing room space and wardrobe space It significantly increases the level and functionality of the lobby and the insulary spaces it provides for greater handicapped access, then, is technically legally required, and it includes a really a comprehensive, high quality and sensitive sensitively handled historic restoration If you were sort of touching bases in this statute, we think that this project would do all of the things that it needs to do to support the bonus and, as julio said in the beginning, the fact that there is this kind of investment in the theater business at this time is itself a strong indication of support for the theater legitimate theater, for broadway and for the city.
So any questions from members of the committee and then my other question is that in the text it says that, even if you don't get this 119 000 square feet for your 264 000 development, hotel development, you can, you will still be able to build 230 000 square feet because you're getting some floor area from other parts of the theater district.
It's opened as one of the most successful public spaces in new york city Here's the site currently in a split lot when it was built, it was in a 15-time zone and the special permit was for 46 story.
the 1977 special permit modified, heightened setback and approved the floor area bonus for the arcade, which extends from 57th street to 56th street it all the building also included as of right bonuses for a covered pedestrian space, which is a triangular shape, outlined in red, an urban plaza on the corner of 56th street and the arcade I mentioned, which is a corner arcade at the corner of madison and 57th street within the interior.
Public space There is also a seating, slash retail area of approximately 3 500 square feet that did not receive a bonus, but since it's within the envelope of the space is also governed by the approved drawings of the special permit.
The through block was open to the elements and then and then the second modification added a revolving door, adjacent to the urban plaza on 56th street The space itself, although we consider it in interior space, because it's all roofed- You, know as part of the through block the current plan or the current The existing condition was actually approved in 1995.
As his indoor sculpture, garden The proposed cafe, seating The proposed cafe seating, which would take up approximately 1400 square feet of that 3 500 non-bonus area is designed to visually integrate the cafe seating with the larger public space There are no questions in terms of the action before you I'd like dan to not only discuss how the proposed changes to establish his cafe seating, but also detail the upgraded public space signage that we've agreed to do to reflect city planning's.
For the rest, bob says it indicates the existing kiosk, the entry from madison avenue, the in the space is one of the trees and then the seating around that jc The primary entries to the space, the through block the building itself and This, is a picture of the existing facility prior to the pandemic when it was still functioning and as you can see, through the landscaping elements and some of the other pieces that made the the facility function, that it essentially created a boundary that is not in keeping both visually or with the city planning regulations regarding open air cafes, our proposal jc.
No, the kiosk and the and the public space opens at the same time opens and closes at the same time , My question is: I'm, not clear that there seems to be a private space and a public space right There's, a non-bonus space, which is that southern edge, where the kiosk in the cafe is, and then there are the bonus spaces which are to the north within the red, the covered pedestrian space and then the through block but they're all consider they'll operate as one indoor space Just that technically we're not taking any area to privatize that generated a bonus , The floor supports, look like they're a tripping hazard, particularly for elderly, and those people that might be sight.
The kiosk, which is on the approved plans, has both you know, grab and go for the public space or for office or whatever, and had added this sit-down element to it, which otherwise would be permitted.
We have not had resistance from city planning and on any level, because even the covered pedestrian space to the north that permitted under the fifth avenue districts up to one-third of the area could be an open air.
It was envisioned as part of the that district, and it said in 1977 that up to one third of the area could be a cafe on a theory that reserve seating would activate the space, encourage more people to use the overall space and kind of extend the hours of activity Only you know in midday when you expect it and some in the morning but into the evening and make people feel more comfortable When we came to city planning, we pointed out where the location was, and we jointly came to the realization that, although it's only fourteen hundred square feet, it, which is like twenty percent of the the calf of the of the common pedestrian space, is less than 10 of the whole area.
It's a relatively small element, so they did not feel the use was intrusive and in fact the cafe use was permitted by the special part by the fifth avenue district It was just listed as a you know, retail seating area, so we were not operating in accordance with the approved plans, and hence we had to go through a minor modification of special permit.
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and members of the committee, it's okay to have a seating, but it has to be available to non-purchasing customers as well as what they're proposing is to extend the capacity of the the out the public space, the public seating, and they want to dedicate this additional seating exclusively to you to be used by patrons of this kiosk You know if it were like a brand new application, they would basically say: Okay, we want to install you, know 12 tables and 24 seats, right, So, I, think that you know we and we probably are going to have to you know, get out of business session and you know seek the the comment of the applicant on the policy that we have, which is to ask that you know.
Thinking of a specific other example, where we've allowed a cafe under the same rules, but where it's had the same sort of segregated area, you know tied to the kiosk even with You know with the partitions specifically making it look like a private restaurant you'd have a hard time even getting the point across to people that they could that they could enter that area and sit down, and that is their space that they're allowed to sit at whether or not they're buying anything from that vendor.
That is correct, because if anyone comes into this space, children, teenagers, young people they're under their underage- I'm confused about how to do what we normally do and yet maintain the boundaries that I believe would be required if they are serving alcohol What I would like to do is to move out of business sessions so that we can communicate to the applicant what our policy is on these types of applications, and then we can move back to to business session, so we're out of business session There would be no tables, and an applicant would come to us with an application to install more tables would basically typically support such application, provided that the number of tables is reasonable tables and chairs, and we would ask that these tables are open to non-purchasing visitors and that they're open to the public and not reserved for the patrons of such establishment.
So I think that we, the committee, would support an application that would basically be for those tables that you currently have I think we don't have an issue with a number of tables and chairs, but we would ask that the seating is open to the general public and visitors that the barriers be eliminated and that signage would mention that the the seating is open to to any visitors and that no purchase is necessary to use these these seats What is different about this particular space?
I think there are a number of levels of distinction here, one we're not in we're not occupying bonus space, whereas the outdoor cafe the entire area was open to the public.
They wanted us to use the open air bonus regulations that were just the white lines on the on his case on the floor, but came to the realization that, because of the liquor license type of operation, that would jeopardize our ability to operate such a such a premises because we couldn't define it, someone could theoretically order a glass of wine a bottle of wine and just walk off without knowing that they were supposed to be sitting in a designated area.
This has never been a bonus area and then, secondly, because of the nature of the operation, the kiosk is viewed as an amenity to space The pops book cites that the earlier fifth avenue district encouraged people to put private cafes in, like in a sony building a private space in order to help activate it during those off hours.
A very unusual situation, situations 3 500 square feet said it was to be used for retail and seating area One point I saw in the record: they were going to put a flower market in there that never happened, and it was only in 1995 when a sculpture garden was approved, that the kiosk was moved to that entry and that the current situation minus the cafe you know- has been operating.
Is everybody really clear on what is in front of us and why so just to make sure on the applicant's front, the the idea that you would remove the the barriers and make it available to non-purchasing patrons is something that you cannot entertain for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is a little license attached to this particular seating area, and it looks like luke sabatos, who is the community board community associate, may have some information about the liquor license.
I do know that the previous well the tenant, as through march obika, he renewed a previously granted license because one of the things we were looking for, which we were not able to find because he was in the original licensee looking to see what type of plans were provided to support the quote, premises of the establishment, Okay all right, any more questions from members of the committee seeing not we are moving to business session and with the intention to stay in business session this time So it is a complicated situation.
I think there would be a lot of confusion if this wide open space You know was able to be accessed entirely by the public.
