This application tonight, we're just going to jump into a presentation just for the sake of expediency If the member of the committee who was assigned this application wishes to make some comments before we go into question, period, I will certainly allow that.
Part of our team here includes Paul Selver and Adam Tavman, who are land use, counsel, John, Darvey who's, our senior vice president of facilities at the Schubert Organization and Fran Russo who's, our architect, for the restoration of the Interior and Exterior Landmark Court theater.
That's going to remain and finally lot 11, which is owned by clarity, is the site of a new hotel and that's the hotel that will , we hope, receive the benefit of the bonus floor area generated by the theater rehabilitation.
Permit would authorize a bonus floor area of 119,000 square feet for the substantial rehabilitation of the listed theater and that floor area would be transferred to clarity to the some of the the bonus floor area will be generated by land, that is, on the c67 T side of the district and residential use floor area can cross that boundary back and forth freely commercial use can not, and for some tech a variety of technical, reasons.
What we'd like to do tonight is talk about the problems of the court, as Julio said talk about why the work that's going to be done is so important to the future of the court and talk about the way in which the work provides all of the public benefits, and we really feel it's virtu.
People with disabilities would really be excluded from this theater as it was originally designed, and the opportunity of this project is going to be able to address all of these problems.
As far as the as far as the art form, not that there are still not straight plays, but it's very important for these houses to be able to accommodate a musical, In addition to the tight stage space and the inadequate dressing rooms you'll see in a moment a picture of the loden door, it's very difficult to get scenery in and out of this theater.
Actually, some scenery there for a box set, and so you see the space that's left over is There was no room in this theater when it was finally air conditioned sometime after World War Ii And, they actually put the main air conditioning for the auditorium on a fly, floor, a platform or a bridge, The ropes for the rigging, the flying, scenery and the lights and other items that are suspended above the playing area.
Similarly, upstairs the bars are equally cramped and just simply in the auditorium space One of the worst things I've seen in this theater is this stairway that says 43 inches the top left photograph that goes down to the women's room, and, unfortunately.
There is an elevator and the elevator was placed there to be able to serve audience during show times when the public is in the theater and then during the day time or during loadings or loadouts, when scenery is brought in and set up, and the elevator can also serve the show and will be very valuable, even on a daily basis, to allow wardrobe people to wheel their wardrobe racks to costumes and place them in the dressing rooms on upper floors.
You see, on the right hand, side to the very right, a stack of floor plans showing the old, inadequate dressing rooms and then the new, much more than doubling in size, also with a specific wardrobe area, where the costumes can be much better maintained away from the stage as it's proper and then also accommodations for hair and wig for shows that need that separate facility.
They will go down a stair to the under stage level and right backstage so that if the audience is at the theater early and people associated with the show do not have to go through the public areas to get backstage and get to work.
This is looking west toward the stage left side of the theater, and one of the things featured in this slide is the fact that in this in this project, we will be providing a modern day rigging system, including a replacement of the gridiron again, the theater being built so long ago for a totally different type of theater.
I. Just want to make sure that everybody on the committee, especially the new members, understand what Community board five's position was on the landmarks portion of this application.
As the applicants mentioned and explained, there is a big restoration component to this to this proposal and this restoration had to go through the Landmarks, Preservation Commission for review and approval and before they went to LPC it had to be reviewed by the Community Board We basically had you know great support for the alteration and restoration to the theater itself We had great grave reservations for the annex.
Even if you do not get this 119,000 square feet for your 264,000 development, hotel development, you can, you will still be able to build 230,000 square feet because you're getting some floor area from other parts of the theater district.
You would not get the full benefits that come from this proposal, both to the theater itself, the back of house space, the audience amenities and so on, because they're the bonus is working here to encourage the kinds of enhancements that are being proposed.
Let me just say one thing, and if John and Julio, if you want to add, but I'm, going to talk about it from the policy standpoint, and that is that the theater rehabilitation bonus is not designed to help some theaters and not others It was adopted to encourage all theater owners to do the highest quality restorations and enhancements and rehabilitations that they can do so that the theater industry as a whole modernizes in a very high quality way for the next century.
Okay, the 1977 special permit modified, heightened setback and approved the floor area bonus for the arcade, which extends from 57th street to 56th street it all the building, also included as of right bonuses for a covered pedestrian space, which is a triangular shape, outlined in red, an urban plaza on the corner of 56Th Street and the arcade I mentioned, which is a corner arcade at the corner of Madison and 57th street within the interior.
There is also a seating, slash retail area of approximately 3,500 square feet that did not receive a bonus, but since it's within the envelope of the space is also governed by the approved drawings of the special permit.
Non- bonus area is designed to visually integrate the cafe seating with the larger public space.
I'd, like Dan, to not only discuss how the proposed changes to establish his cafe seating, but also detail the upgraded public space signage that we've agreed to do to reflect city planning's, recent public space, Dan. Of course thank you, Bob and, as Bob said in his comments, I, think we all recognize the space that was created in the original building by Edward Larabee Barnes, Pedestrian space and public space for the Plaza district We're to talk about improvements made to what you see on the lower right hand corner around the existing Kiosk Food kiosk.
Yes, so that this is the area of focus in the non- bonus area in making the open- air cafe, as Bob said, more integrated to the space.
The plan is Bob says it indicates the existing Kiosk, the entry from Madison Avenue, the in the space, is one of the trees and then the seating around that Jc. The primary entries to the space, the through block the building itself and This, is a picture of the existing facility prior to the pandemic when it was still functioning and as you can see, through the landscaping elements and some of the other pieces that made the the facility function, that it essentially created a boundary that is not in keeping both visually or with the city planning regulations regarding open air cafes.
Behind, you see the Kiosk, the Kiosk Functions in two three ways: Actually one is a very important grab and go where you can go up and order from the menu there and sit in the public space or go on your way.
Technically we city planning, has asked that we amend the restrictive deck to call out this area as a pedestrian access area, a paa which would give it some more legal standing, but within that paa would be the kiosk, which is a required amenity of the largest phase, and this cafe seating, which is what we're seeking to show on the approved plans.
It does and it is exclusively used by patrons of the kiosk who on table service, that's correct and is it in compliance with the current writing of the approval of this area?
Has both you know, grab and go for the public space or for office or whatever, and had added this sit- down element to it, which otherwise would be permitted.
What they found out was that by adding a sit- down element, they were able to expand the offering on the menus, because you have a you know and also obtain a liquor license because they had a defined space and that, in turn, made the cafe , I'm sorry, the kiosk, a more functioning business, enterprise.
We have not had resistance from city planning and on any level, because even the covered pedestrian space to the north that permitted under the fifth Avenue districts up to one- third of the area could be an open air cafe.
It was envisioned as part of the that district, and it said in 1977 that up to one third of the area could be a cafe on a theory that reserve seating would activate the space, encourage more people to use the overall space and kind of extend the hours of activity.
When we came to city planning, we pointed out where the location was, and we jointly came to the realization that, although it's only fourteen hundred square feet, it, which is like twenty percent of the the calf of the of the common pedestrian space, is less than 10 of the whole area.
This is the third operator in the space since 1995, and you know as times change and people change.
It was just part of the open space areas where we either put some of the artwork and just you know, circulation, space, much like where.
If you went back to the floor plan, you know much like where you see the sculpture and the area.
It's okay, to operate a cafe,, it's okay, to have a seating, but it has to be available to non- purchasing customers as well as Is. Basically, what they're proposing is to extend the capacity of the the out the public space, the public seating, and they want to dedicate this additional seating exclusively to you to be used by patrons of this kiosk.
Applicants, do agree that the seating can not be you know solely used by patrons and that non- purchasing visitors can sit and that the signage has to reflect that signage, that we typically asked to be on the table.
You know in the instance that we're not dealing with it with a violation there would be no tables and an applicant would come to us with an application to install more tables would basically typically support such application, provided that the number of tables is reasonable tables and chairs, and we would ask that these tables are open to non- purchasing visitors and that they're open to the public and not reserved for the patrons of such establishment.
So I think that we, the committee, would support an application that would basically be for those tables that you currently have.
I think there are a number of levels of distinction: here, one we're not in we're not occupying bonus space, whereas the outdoor cafe the entire area was open to the public.
In order to achieve the bonus and the open- air cafe allows up to 20 of the area to be restricted for cafe seating as a permitted.
They wanted us to use the open air bonus regulations that were just the white lines on the on his case on the floor, but came to the realization that, because of the liquor license type of operation.
They were going to put a flower market in there that never happened, and it was only in 1995 when a sculpture garden was approved, that the kiosk was moved to that entry and that the current situation minus the cafe you know- has been operating.
What was called seating, slash, retail area, I joined a distinction between you know a cafe physically sitting outside on a bonus, plaza, that's generated floor area.
The kiosk itself has been approved and is not part of what we're looking at the seating that is auxiliary to the kiosk is the only portion that we're talking about You have a question: Is it possible to show this non- bonus area line in the plan that has the seating?
My understanding is that, even if the liquor license was issued in 20 2011 for a kiosk that was in a pop space that it was the eventual addition of seats and partitions that eventually brought them into violation.
The open seating that is part of the bonus area could not receive a liquor license.
I think there would be a lot of confusion if this wide open, space, you know, was able to be accessed entirely by the public.
Then I think that really you know serving liquor and that would be would go into like the red zone that we're looking at here so kind of demarcating.
There was not liquor, then perhaps we could push more for having the whole area open, but given that and also the being in the non- bonus, space, I think should be appropriate.
I think that the fact that is non- bonus that it was originally planned, as you know, for commercial use for retail use.
The public seating that you know provide art with the sculptures is something that we have to.
