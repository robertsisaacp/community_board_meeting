Get a quorum and then we can start okay good evening it looks like we do, have a quorum, so we're gonna get started. Thank you for being with us. This is the land use, housing and zoning committee of Manhattan community board five. My name is leila lokiseko, I'm the chair, a few words about how the meeting is going to run tonight. We have two applications. We are going to get a full presentation by the applicant for each application after this uninterrupted presentation concludes. Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions about the application after this question session concludes. I will open up the floor to members of the public. Members of the public will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments once this question coming period concludes by members of the public. We will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter. We will comment the application and then we will make a motion and a vote will be taken on this motion, whether to approve a deny or a proof of condition or deny unless and conditions are met. This motion and this vote will be forwarded to the full board that meets on thursday or july, the 9th at 6 00 pm, and this motion in this vote will be put up for a vote by the full board. The vote of the full board becomes the official position of the community board. So with that being said, let's start the the meeting with a presentation. So the first item on the agenda is for an application to obtain a four-year extension of time to complete construction of a new building, and the address is 12-14 east 48th street. This application was assigned for due diligence to mike really for the sake of expediency. We're gonna go directly to the presentation, but mike looked thoroughly into this application, so we can turn to him for any insights and he may have the more pointed questions. So I think we have the applicant here with us tonight. I hope so. Yes, I see you so if you are ready to share your screen, you can go ahead, share the screen so that we can have the benefit of your presentation if there is any or if you don't have any screen sharing for this proposal, you can just go ahead and give us your your presentation, so what I would add as the app the application is being uploaded, that if you're, not speaking, just go to newt when it will be your time to speak, don't forget to unmute, and so we are ready to hear the presentation by the applicant. Can you hear me we can hear you absolutely not sure that I got it right. Okay, I'm deirdre carson, I'm an attorney with greenberg traurig. We represent 1248 associates which owns the property. That is the subject of this application with me this evening is my associate peter museum. Peter is in charge the visuals, so he bears no responsibility. If I fail to give him correct instructions about when to change a slide. I want to thank the board first of all for the expedition with which you got this onto the calendar and have arranged for us to present this evening. I have to say that we- this is my first experience doing this with the community board since the covet 19 shutdown and I have been extremely impressed by your organization so on to the application. This is an application based upon a request that the board determined that the owner of the property has a common law vested right to complete construction. Many of you will remember that we were in front of you last october on this property. At a time when we were seeking the one-year extension of time to complete that was authorized by the midtown east legislation that imposed the prohibition on new health hotel construction without a special permit. The the way that was originally drafted was that our project was quite specifically grandfathered in as a vest, as it was vested subject to being de-vested or divested in that it had to meet certain criteria for having a building permit full plans and specifications approved by the department of buildings, and we met those criteria. As of the date of enactment of the amendments to the east midtown text, and then the second part of the vesting language said that if we didn't complete by two and two and a half years in essence, from the date of enactment, we could obtain a one-year extension by making certain showings that were detailed in the statute. The owner of the property proceeded with the development they encountered. Some difficulties, which were you know, presented to you in the last hearing on this last year. It delayed the project for about a year and they came back and sought the additional time, and that was granted by the board of standards and appeals. After review by your committee on december, 10 2019 and the findings that were made are in many ways relevant to the findings that have to be made in a common law vesting case. The hotel statute didn't provide any anything specifically that would allow for further extensions of time. So the the remedy here to state where we are factually the client proceeded with its construction after it's got. Its last got its last extension. However. In January they began to do pressure tests, water pressure tests on the windows, and they discovered that multiple windows were failing these tests, which suggested that there was some need for remediation and when they took the windows apart to try and figure out what was going on, they discovered that there was. There was a structural defect in the way the window assembly had been installed, so they fired the contractor. Who was doing the windows and hired a new contractor and signed an agreement with them to move forward. They were then in a position where their lenders had had placed them in had served them with notices of default under their loans, because they were past time for completion and the and the draws under those loans had stopped in an effort to refinance, which is what they were looking to do. They were constantly being questioned about the fact that they only had until January the end of January in 2021 to finish under the statute, and that made it difficult to find a lender, a problem that was greatly exacerbated in mid-march when the governor shut down the city and eventually shut down construction on march 27th. So so that was having already had some delays. They now had these additional delays. The remediation work for the windows is approximately 40 to 50 days of construction, added on to the construction budget and timetable that they already had re-mobilizing after the governor's order was lifted. Raised has raised its own difficulties, they getting the contractor back on site and so forth. As of this week, they are re-mobilizing, but we don't expect that they're going to start physical construction until the middle of july, and at that point there is some concern that they will not be able to finish a hundred percent of the work to get a tco for the entire building by the existing expiration date. So, in the absence of any statutory basis for further extension of time, the option that presents itself is to seek a common law vesting remedy, and the reason for doing that is that common law, investing is, has been regarded by the courts and is now regarded by the board as an alternative to statutory vesting that preserves essentially what are considered to be vested constitutional rights. The there's a considerable body of case law that says that this is really a con, since zoning is in derogation of common law, property rights. Generally speaking, zoning resolutions are interpreted against the not against the interests but they're interpreted most favorably to the landowner and the that there is an obligation in the judicial system and, by extension, to the administrative administrative bodies that review these applications to recognize that cutting somebody off from completion at a certain stage is confiscatory. So that's that is this separate body of common law vesting. Traditionally the board grants four years in these applications. There's no mandate that they do so. We've asked for the full four years. We don't believe we'll need it by any stretch, but we don't want to come back if it's up to the board. Ultimately, what will be granted in terms of number of years, but you know the basic amount that's allowed for what is a minor development and a minor development is essentially a new building with a foundation is six years, two years to finish maximum extensions for two years to finish foundations and up to four years to finish the building. So you know we may not get the full four. The board may feel that's inappropriate, but some number of a year and a half time to give us ample time to complete and be certain that we don't have to come back and seek any further relief. So the doctrine of common law vesting basically requires three showings three findings. One is that substantial construction has been carried out pursuant to lawfully issued permits. Two is that substantial expenditures have in fact been made and three that a considerable financial loss would be incurred by the property owner, if required, to comply with the amended zoning regulations. There have actually been two common law, vesting cases involving hotels decided by the next slide, peter decided by the board in the last couple years, and they have found that percentages of completion or number of days expended or percentage of total number of days required to complete that were sufficient to establish a common law right to best, far less than what exists here. In this case, we have completed 1138 out of 1380 days of construction and over 92 percent of the hard cost budget, which is about 54 million dollars and that doesn't take into account the soft cost budget, which is over 40 million dollars, most of which could not be repurposed because it would require new plans. New designs, there's a lot of soft costs in this project, because it was for a hotel that are not appropriate for any other use like hotel room furniture. That has been ordered, and you know the the design of the space for individual rooms rather than for you know something that would be more appropriate for an apartment and certainly not for an office. So the two cases which are cited in our memorandum or our statement of facts and findings on page eight, our matter of 30 west 39th street, where the bsa found that the 93 days of construction out of a projected 686, which was 13.5 percent of the total, was sufficient to vest and in matter of 11-31 ryerson street. The applicant had completed 1014 days out of a projected 2457 representing 41 of the total required. So you know in the scale of things we're way past that point in terms of common law. Vesting next slide peter the next finding is, I I'm sorry, go back peter go back. The first finding includes the notion that the owner had a valid permit issued pursuant to approved plans and specifications when the zoning was enacted, and that has already been determined by the board of standards and appeals in the first application, and the board is a quasi-judicial body. We have asked them to take judicial notice of the documents we submitted previously and to treat that finding of fact, as essentially or collateral established, with respect to this issue, that there were valid plans and specs filed and the proper permit issued as of the necessary date and so now, moving on to finding two peter, as I mentioned before, we've spent nearly 54 million of the total hard costs, which is nearly 93 of the budget. Again, this amount is far more than both the board and the courts have found appropriate for a finding of common law vested rights in west 39th street, which I meant mentioned earlier. They found substantial expenditures when the applicant had spent 13 million of 117 million, which was about 11.4 percent and in the ryerson street case they had spent 42 percent of the budget and, in another case, 638 east 11th street, which was not a hotel, but it was a common low vesting case they had spent 19 of the total budget cost so again, we're at a level here which far exceeds what the board has found to be appropriate for a finding of common law vesting in other cases, the third finding peter. If we could considerable financial loss would be incurred by the property owner if required, to comply with the amended zoning resolution. This this is very similar to the finding the third finding that we had to make under the one-year statutory exemption, which basically requires us to show that we couldn't repurpose the expenditures that were made for a conforming use and the board was satisfied. That was the case here. Residential would come would have required a complete reconfiguration of the building because it doesn't have an adequate rear yard. It has an unlawful court. The room sizes wouldn't lend themselves to apartments because they're, relatively small, the plumbing condition and so on, wouldn't permit you to have both kitchens and bathrooms. So residential is really not an option. I mean you have to take down the rear wall of the building, all the way down to the ground, build a new foundation and then build a new rear wall, and given the amount of money, that's already been sunk in this thing, that would be ruinous offices. This does not have a lot of the accoutrements that a first-class office building would need and they'd have to rip out a lot of what they've already built. If we go back several slides, you may recall photos the photos peter. If you could take me back to the photos. You may recall, because we showed these at the last meeting, that the substantial progress had been made on the bathroom plumbing. This actually was still fairly early in the process, but most of the bathrooms. At the time we were in front of you in december, of 2019 were plumbed and the tiles were in. They didn't have all the fixtures in by this time. Many of the fixtures are in and all of them are plumbed and tiled, including the ones that were in the area of the hoist way where originally the construction, materials and laborers went from the ground up to the top of the building. That's now been removed and the floors have been filled in and the finishing work has been done, but all of that would have to come out if you were going to do an office building, so the board made that finding. Essentially, in the last round of this, they found that we would have to pay back loans. We would be defaulting on a our forward sale to the hilton corporation of this project. This is a built to suit, essentially we're building it and then we're turning it over to the hilton and that contract was signed back in 20, I believe, is 2016 or 17.. They would be unable to fulfill it and in the default provisions of the document. There's an 18 million dollar liquidated damage clause. That default would trigger defaults under there, because the consummation of that transaction would have been used to pay off their loans. The 95 million dollars that they borrowed would not have been paid off and it hard to imagine a scenario in which the lenders, having held stuck it out. This long, would then have stuck it out further for them to go through the process of refinancing redesigning, getting new approvals and rebuilding, so the amounts of the loans total not but not over 94 over 90 million dollars at this time. So that's those are the three findings peter and I think that's essentially what we have to say and we're happy to answer any questions that the board may have all right. Thank you very much. We will start with questions from our members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raised hand function if you need any assistance with the interface luke zavados, who is a the community board associate, is with us and can chime in, but hopefully you're all fluent with the zoom platform, and so please raise your hands and yeah. We have a question from mike really mike go ahead. Hello, all right! Thank you for the presentation. I just wanted to make sure that you said you did not need the full four years and how much time do you expect, given that we don't know what's going to happen with Covid-19, but how much time do you expect to complete the construction if we can, if we are able to fully mobilize and get all the required workers on the site, we believe will be done by the end of march, if there's no further shutdowns, if we don't, you know in a second wave, have to close the job again. That is the that is the client's expectation, they've done a new schedule, that's where they think they're going to end up. Okay. Thank you any other questions by members of the committee any questions, so I have a question regarding the loans who is the lender. There are two lenders here: there is the principal lender, which is midland national insurance and the there's a mezzanine lender, which is a madison 54 partners. Okay, all right, let's see any other questions from other members of the committee. Okay, I don't see any raised hands. I just want to make sure that I don't have any other questions. Okay, now I don't have any other questions on my end, one more time, members of the committee, any questions. Okay, seeing none! Let me open up the 40 members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments from members of the public? You can use the raise hand, function and luke if you want to provide guidance on how attendees can do that, please feel free to chime in sure. So it looks like we have one person calling in from a phone. If you would like to raise your hand calling in from a phone, you can press star nine. Otherwise you can find the race hand button in the middle of the screen, all right any questions from members of the public. Okay, I see none. So, let's move back to a business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and we need comments on this application. How do does the committee feel about this request? Any comments, don't be shy, all right I'll, be calling on people mike go ahead. Oh mike you're, muted, okay, I have no problem with the giving extension to work. I just think there's an issue with giving four years, because, even though they say they don't really need the full four years, I just worried that the traffic on 48th street there's a lot of construction going on the next block over is the is the jp morgan tower that's being demolished, and I just want to make sure that the date is more firm than just four years. Maybe not I mean march 2021 whether it's 2022 2023 24 is a long time to be non-committal, so I would, I would prefer a one-year extension instead of four years. Okay, I see some raised hands ryan go ahead. Thank you to the applicant for their presentation. I am comfortable with giving them an extension, obviously there's an extraordinary amount of work that has been completed, and I think particularly this is a time for us to be to recognize and to and to assist whenever possible projects like this to be fully completed. I also recognize that it is imprecise projecting when something like this is gonna, be complete and so like mike four years, feels like a long time to me. At the same time, I'm not sure where to draw the line before that, and so I'll just say up top and very comfortable with an extension here for sure and if we ended up as a group saying four years, I would be fine with that. If there were something short of four years that had a kind of strong rationale of why we would do something less than four years. I'd be very open to hearing that, but I'm concerned about picking something arbitrarily short of that, because I'm not sure exactly what the foundation would be for us to do so, but I'm interested in listening. Thank you. Aaron go ahead. I sort of you know, share the same thoughts. I think 2025 feels like a long way away. I think a year is more appropriate, but I think lay the question for you, like. Obviously, this original proposal intentionally had an end date. You know what is a an end date supposed to protect against, because I guess like what is there a downside of saying, okay, you can have another four or five years like what is that meant. You know in this process originally like what does that mean to sort of protect? You know the city against happening if yeah so- and you know, there's a number of reasons why you want to. You know, make sure that those are not totally open-ended. You want to make sure that you're not setting a precedent. So in that particular instance, I think we all recognize that the applicant does meet the requirement, for you know these criteria to make this determination. This applicant has been in front of us in october and we felt comfortable actually granting the initial extension now. We also recognize that you know this. It's really very difficult circumstances for the construction business and that you know it's. The situation they're in today is to no fault of their own. Now, if you were to decide that you know it can be sort of like open-ended another applicant, that may be, you know less professional in the way they're handling a situation could actually take advantage of it, and we don't want that type of situation where you know a project may be stalled and it may be in the interest of the developer to actually install a project so that, for example, they can speculate that you know the market is going to boom and it would be beneficial to actually wait a little bit before a project gets completed, or you know. Conversely, it may be in their interest to wait that the market crashes so that they can make a transaction that would be. You know, like shorting a you know, a stock on the stock market. So in essence, you basically want to protect yourself from you know some sort of like rationale that doesn't really have to do with the actual meat and potatoes of building a building and completing a building. In that particular instance. I see the rationale for asking for the maximum amount of time, and I see the rationale for making a recommendation that would be less than what is being requested, as the applicant stated in the end, it's up to the board of standards and appeals to make this determination. So it's pretty standard to ask for the maximum and once again there is actually no real maximum. It's not written in the books. It's just that. You know the customs that the bsa has been granting four or six years, typically or less. So in that particular case, what remains to be done seems to be pretty minor. You know the applicant stated that 92 well, 92, 92.8 of the budget has been has been spent in terms of amount of days were also up in the 90s. So there's not much left to do it's just. You know this issue with windows: a bad contractor, a you know, terrible pandemic that are getting in the way of completing this project. We don't want to be in a situation where you know, for whatever reason, the loan you know that they end up defaulting on the loan. For other reasons, you know, maybe they have other projects that are also in difficulty and then we would end up with you know another party purchasing the site and you know taking those four years to their advantage. We don't want to be in this situation, so I think that we all agree. You know granting the extension is fair. The request is fair. The situation is to really no fault of their own, but four years it seems excessive and- and I also agree with ryan- I don't know where to draw the line, but we can certainly say to the bsa that you know four years seems excessive. We're not comfortable with that, and we can say that you know we feel that one year would be good and that maybe two years is still okay. Personally, my comment is above two years: I'm not comfortable and 34 years is too is too much the. This is the recommendation that I think you know we make to to the bsa, but only eager to hear more comments. I see that nancy has raised our hand. Nancy go ahead. My concern is that with the Covid-19 pandemic, so much of the manufacturing distribution and supply lines are disrupted and it seems to me like they may have to re-buy all the windows if they're removing the windows, I'm just concerned that they may run into problems with that, because manufacturing is going to be really screwed up. So I would say: let's go for three years. I I'm worried two years isn't enough four years, maybe too long, but I think we should give them three years because they still have to buy. They probably have to buy all new window frames. You can't like uninstall and reinstall windows before taking them out. You ruin them when you take them out. So I'm concerned about that. Okay. Thank you. Nancy. Other comments, other comments on that. So I will, I will add one comment, sort of responding to nancy's point, so I totally agree that you know it. It's the whole. You know, supply chain has been disrupted and may be disrupted further because we're still in the middle of a pandemic, and you know as much as we are hoping that you know it's going to be in control soon. We still don't have a cure. We don't have vaccine and there's a lot of you know disorganized parts in this country that are making it difficult to really control the pandemic. That being said, it's not a one-time shot for them. If they need more time, they can come back, and I think that you know putting the burden of the proof on them for another two-year extension. If we were to recommend a you know, an initial two-year seems pretty reasonable. It looks like you know, as for their statement right now, they're expecting to complete in march 2021. If we were to you, know, support a an extension to july 2022. It seems reasonable, with the understanding that you know. If they run into further difficulty, they can come back and you know most likely. We would remember the history and listen to their arguments in fairness and recognize that you know they have been. You know up to today. You know a good, a good developer, so I think it would be two years seems reasonable. I see that ej has his hand up ej go ahead. Yeah I mean without knowing a tremendous amount more about the precedent of these types of cases and how we thought about them in the past two or three years sounds appropriate to me and I'd probably be willing to be inclined to support either of those yeah. Thank you and then mike has had his hand up mike. If you still want to yeah. I just wanted to reiterate that they said that the applicants said that it they estimate 50 days to reinstall the windows, so even if that was tripled, that would still be six months so I'd I don't I don't. Unless there's another wave of pandemic that causes a whole another longer shutdown. I don't. I don't see the need for two or three years, but I'm okay with two years, but after two years I think it's too much nancy. Would you would you consider two years with the understanding that you know they can come back and we would certainly you know, look at the arguments favorably. You know I would hate to have a disagreement over. You know the amount of time that we're supporting because, in essence, we're all saying the same thing. You know we're comfortable with the request. We feel that you know four years is a little too long. You know I'm hoping that you know a two-year would be you know, sort of like reasonable recommendation so that the bsa can make their final determination in the end. You know the bsa makes the determination we don't if the applicant is able to convince the bsa that they really need four years or that three years would be absolutely necessary. They also have a shock at that. I you know. I would really hope that we have a a unanimous vote on a on resolution on this application. Would you be comfortable with two years nancy? Oh you're, muted, nancy, you're, muted nancy. We can't hear you you're, still muted we're going into phase two and phase three and phase four moves moving very rapidly. A lot of these manufacturing plants are in other states where there are large major difficulties in opening up, particularly in manufacturing. So would you consider two and a half years? That's what I would like to see, because I just I just think that supply chain is a problem right now in every construction site in the city. You know, I don't want us to be in this bargaining situation. If two and a half years makes you happy, you know we're not going to you know nickel and dime. I just hope that the rest of the committee will agree that you know we need to move this along. Basically, what we're saying to the bsa is that four years is too much. You know we will settle on two and a half. I really want to have a you know, a unanimous voice on that, because really what matters to the bsa is to know that we are comfortable with granting this extension, and we want to be comfortable that you know next time an applicant comes in front of us. This would not come and haunt us. If we have a you know, lesser quality application that they would use our position to basically force us into improving something that we're not comfortable with. So it does. Anybody object firmly to two and a half mike go ahead, I'm okay with two and a half as long as we can put in the provision that they still meet with the east midtown special sub-district hotel permit findings that so that would be like what would prevent other people from saying that this is a precedent that the findings that they met last time with us in october that because I believe the applicant says that they still meet all those same findings and they meet these. Also, these common law findings, plus the hotel special permit findings I'll be okay with two and a half years. Okay, great all right! So I'm gonna make a motion to approve the application, with the recommendation of a two and a half year, extension spelling out very precisely and clearly why we are granting this. You know like lending our support to this to this application. You know the specificity, all the details, the fact that the applicant was in front of us in october, 2019 the circumstances, the windows, their window situation, the pandemic and the halt to their job progress, and those are really the specific reasons why we're comfortable with granting this permit and that anything else. Would you know that it cannot be seen as a precedent for any other circumstances? So this is the motion and I need a second all right, and this is the first vote of the evening andreas. I don't think andreas is with us julie, yes, aaron, yes, nancy! Yes, mike, yes, tristan, yes, ej, yes, ed! Yes, john, yes, evan! Yes, clayton is not here, rachel, yeah ryan, yes, dave, yes and layla! Emma! Yes, did I miss anyone in the vote. I captured everybody, okay, fantastic all right! Thank you very much to the applicant and we are moving on to our second and last application of the evening, and I just want to thank you all members of the board. Thank you. Thank you. So much for the presentation, the our next application is bear with me. I'm sorry this is a 1633 broadway, and this is an application for an open-air cafe. This was assigned to aaron for due diligence once again we're going to jump directly into our presentation, but aaron looked thoroughly at this, and they have some good pointed questions and insights to share with the committee, but I want to invite the applicants to share their screen and start getting ready for their presentation. Great. Thank you. So much laila rachel is going to share her screen with you now and I am just going to give a brief overview. While she does that good afternoon, all my name is ellen gustafson and I'm an assistant director at greenberg trower, and we represent siren retail corporation, which is before you today. I am joined by my colleagues, rachel scall peter messi, as well as taya, stenson who's here on behalf of siren realty corporation. We are before you tonight with a city planning application for a minor modification of a special permit number cp202 to allow a 639 square foot outdoor cafe in a privately owned public space at 1633 broadway. The proposed outdoor cafe would be part of the princy company, which is a bakery and restaurant that is a result of a partnership between italian baker. Rocco princess and starbucks princey has been operating at this location since november of 2018. before I turn it over to rachel to get into the details of this application. I'd just like to provide a little bit of background. We began working on this application in 2018 well before Covid-19 started and the application itself contemplates an outdoor cafe meant for our hopeful eventual return to normalcy. However, given where we are at now in the world, we will also go over a plan for how we will operate this space with adherence to social distancing guidelines so that you have both sort of operational plans in front of you. So the non-covet cafe and then the Covid-19 cafe as you well, so I will now turn it over to rachel to give you some of the details of this application. Hi everyone, my name is rachel skull and I'm an associate at greenberg troy just to check. Are you all seeing the presentation right now? Could someone confirm? Yes, we are great, because I can't see you while it's on my screen, so I apologize. Okay, as ellen said we are here for princey, is located at 1633 broadway on west 51st street near the northwest corner of broadway. It's located in a c67 zoning district in the theater subject: district of the special midtown district. The site has a lot area of approximately 89 500 square feet and it makes up the majority of block 1022 that you see. There has about 450 feet of frontage on west 50th street 200 feet of frontage on broadway and 440 feet of frontage on west 51st street. The existing building at 1633 broadway was constructed pursuant to a 1968 city planning special permit that allowed modification of heightened setback regulations and an increase in far from 15 to 20.8. In exchange for the provision of two new theaters on the site, pursuant to former zoning resolution, section 8106., the building is 48 stories tall and it contains office and retail uses, as well as the gershwin and circle in the square theaters. At the time, the original special permit was approved. The site had approximately 14 000 square feet of open space upgrade with at grade plaza and and sorry sunken plaza space fronting on broadway sidewalk widenings along both of west 50th street and west 51st street, in a through block arcade and driveway. At the western end of the site. In november, 1989 city planning approved the first minor modification to the special permit to add additional seating, planting lighting and trees, as well as to relocate stairs associated with the two. Then two sunken plazas in august 2012 city planning approved a second minor modification allowing for decking over of the sunken plaza on the northern portion of the site, because to allow more space at grade and to allow a one-story structure to be constructed as an entrance to the blockade retail space and an increase in planting and seeding in may 2014 city planning approved a third modification allowing an outdoor cafe for azalea ristorante, which is over here that application or that outdoor cafe was renewed last year. It might sound familiar to some of you who were here last year today. The site contains about 16 700 square feet of open space and to give a quick tour of photos. The top two images here, the left of those trees. You see the sidewalk winding on west 50th, the bottom image you see, the sunken plaza remaining on the southern portion of the broadway frontage of the site. Here are a couple views up top of the at-grade plaza space on broadway, as well as that one-story retail entrance that was constructed when the northern sunken plaza was decked over. Here we have some views of the corner of the plaza space on broadway and west 51st street and that bottom left image. You see the princy storefront on west 51st street and here's the azalea cafe that I mentioned the outdoor cafe that was renewed last year and then two images of that arcade and driveway space on the western end of the site. So we are here today for a fourth minor modification to the special permit to allow princey to operate a 639 square foot outdoor cafe, adjacent to its west 51st street frontage shown there in pink. To give you a better idea of what we're talking about here is an image as if you're standing in the plaza on broadway facing west, you see princey's store front facing onto the plaza. The outdoor cafe would be located between the building line and this tree over here and then this is a view of prince's store front facing onto west 51st street, and the outdoor cafe would be roughly between these three trees here back behind them in the building line, and here is that outdoor proposed outdoor, cafe and plan highlighted in pink there right in front of princess storefront on west 51st street. The cafe, as contemplated for post Covid-19, would contain 15 round tables, one rectangular table 48 chairs and two umbrellas. It would be monitored and bussed by princeton employees and would be ada accessible. The cafe would operate april through october 7 days a week for breakfast lunch and dinner in the off season november. Through march, all furnishings would be removed from the cafe area into storage. The outdoor cafe would be separated from the public sidewalk by about five feet of the existing sidewalk widening where these trees are. So. This is about five feet of area here, and the public sidewalk itself is just over 15 feet wide up here. We hope that the outdoor cafe can activate this portion of the of west 51st street, make good use of an underutilized open space and provide an amenity to people living, working and eventually visiting the area. As I mentioned, we began this application or, as ellen mentioned sorry, we began this application before Covid-19 and we were seeking approval of a cafe meant to operate after Covid-19 this past saturday, the mayor issued a mayoral order, suspending provisions of the zoning resolution that require cpc certification for outdoor cafes in privately owned public spaces in order to provide restaurants. The flexibility needed to open in this time of social distancing princey will be looking to take advantage of the mayor mayoral order in the short term and I'm going to hand it over to taya stenson, on behalf of the client, to walk you through the precautions that prince you will be taking. Thank you good evening to the board. Thank you for seeing us once again this evening. I'd like to take you through some very specific, we'll call them covert related precautions, that this location will be adhering to not just with the outdoor seating area, but the precautions that we are currently operating with now, the first you can see we are dedicated and disciplined to social distancing in all of our spaces. So, as you can see on the patio space in the play on that, rachel showed you earlier. There were lots of tables and lots of chairs. We are reducing that number significantly to just include seven seven tables and two chairs in each that will allow for us to ensure social distancing for all of our guests that choose to enjoy this outdoor patio. Also on the inside space, as our guests come in, we have clearly marked please wait here, lines shields to protect all the customers and our employees in places where they have longer interactions such as the pos. In addition, all of our employees are provided and wear face coverings at all times, and we have put into place some significant cleaning procedures. Not only do we set timers to remind for sanitation every 30 minutes, but in addition, we are taking a an extra precaution to ensure that all furniture tables chairs any railings planter boxes handles, etc. Any high touch areas would be sanitized as needed and what that means for us is after every customer use. So as an example, if a guest might sit at one of these tables and chairs as soon as that guest would leave, we would ensure that those tables and those chairs are wiped and sanitized immediately before the next customer sits down. So I think that's our whole presentation we're happy to take any questions that you have either about the application or about the plan you're. Looking at right now, all right. Thank you, members of the committee. Do we have questions to this application? Aaron go ahead, hey layla! Sorry! I had a technical glitch there, so I missed the first couple slides but, but I you know had reviewed this earlier, so I let you know, I commend you guys for the social distancing plan, it's great to see that in practice, because you know we'll be seeing more of those. Can you just clarify that it's hard to figure out right, because a lot of stuff is closed right now, but can you clarify on the adjacent to princey? What what's happening right now, on the plaza on the broadway side? Is that a current open air cafe on the broadway side? That's just a public puzzle. Let me just go back to a photo. Well- and I remember you know this is a few years ago that, where it was there was that restaurant mars 2020 or something that you used so- and I remember there was a lot of entrances to seating. I don't think that restaurant had seating, but I was trying to remember the configuration or what is the future plan of that area, which is immediately adjacent to this area right like? Are there other tables and outdoor cafes like right against? You know this proximity or what is the plan for that area? Yeah right, so that area which you can see in that top right image. It's the area on the left. That area is just a public plaza. There are no outdoor cafes in that area and princey is not planning to put an outdoor cafe in front of its storefront in that area, which you see over here, we only represent princey the applicant on this application, so I don't know plans for the larger building, but I'm not aware of any other plans for any outdoor cafes in that area, and there is already a see if I can find a better image. It's a little bit hard to see because the signs up here, but there's already seating all throughout that area- that's just open to the public, so there isn't really the kind of space for an outdoor cafe. There got it okay, so there's no there's no and the poor. The former restaurant space, that's in the sunken plaza, is now an equinox gym. If that is helpful, oh got it. Okay. So even got it so there is no opportunity for that, because that's no longer a restaurant got it, although I believe that they do have a cafe. Equinox, I think, has a cafe. So they have a food and beverage section just quickly a clarification, so the the first outdoor cafe was actually certified in 2013.. Is that correct? Did I get that right? In my notes? I have 20, may 2014 oh 2014, okay, and can you actually show us on the on the plan this cafe? So it is a different cafe from the one you're proposing today correct. So looking at the site plan? Oh you know what let me go to the other one, sorry, okay, looking at the site plan, the pink here is where princey would like to be located and then azalea is over here. So the other end of the building on west 51st, before you reach this arcade driveway area and between them. There are some bike racks in the in the sidewalk widening area, as well as a loading dock, and then they are the two storefronts on west 51st street, okay, so the other there. The cafe is operated by another operator. Yes, okay, thank you other questions by members of the committee, any other questions. Okay, seeing none, let's go to members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments from members of the public, seeing none, I'm moving back to members of the committee nancy. Do you have a question? What are we going to do about our signage requirements and use by the public, or is that not relevant here? Because there is other seating locations in this plaza another in the on the corner there? No, it is, it is very relevant. I think it's something that is very much needed in this conversation, because you know this is this has always been our position, so I don't know I don't know if the applicant is aware of our signage requirements. So do you do you want to explain the or position to to the applicant? You can do that all right so well, I will ask you the applicant if, if you're familiar with our signage and seating requirement for air cafes and pops, we are not. Can you please so we are overall supportive of open air cafes, provided that the the seating is not exclusive for patrons of the the food and beverage establishment, but remain open to the public and that no purchase is necessary to use the seating and that proper signage is made so that visitors and pedestrians and users of this area would know that they can actually use the seating that it is public seating and that no purchase is necessary. What would you need from us the applicant to ensure that we met those requirements from you all? So what we have established with the other applicants is an affidavit that basically spells out the type of signage, and you know the signage is slightly different based on the location, but typically it involves a you know, sort of a sandwich board that could be located near the the perimeter of the cafe, as well as little menu cards placed on the tables with a lettering. That is large enough that it can be read from a certain distance spelling out that this is open seating and that no purchase is necessary and we can. I can certainly you know we can work with you on. You know showing affidavits that other applicants have signed in the past so that you know you can we can agree to the same to the same language. Great. I think we want to review that with we review the language with the client before committing to doing anything, but certainly open to reviewing the language and certainly adhering to what the community board would like in terms of signage yeah. You know this is a very typical situation where you know the attorneys like to go back to the client and, of course, you know, check and make sure that they are in agreement. So typically what we do in these situations that we issue a denial unless this condition is met, and then, if the condition is met, then it is, it turns into a a straightforward approval. Great. We actually had the situation last month and it ended up working out and the applicant ended up agreeing to our stipulations. So we were able to present a a full approval and support for the for the open air cafe great, and you would just need that a few days before full board correct along with the official affidavit. Yes, absolutely nancy, I see that you have your hand up go ahead if they want an idea of what we're looking for, they could look at our resolution. We passed last month great I'm happy to look that up. Don't you think that would be a way to go to have them at least give them an idea or yes, absolutely- and I can. The resolution does not include the affidavit, but I can send you the the affidavit that we finalized with the applicant last month, and you know we can. We can take the the language and you know, make it adequate for your footprint and your address great excellent, any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, seeing none. Let's move to business session, so comments. I think that we're all on the same page on you know basically applying the the policy that we have applied in the past is everybody is in agreement with that any objections. Okay, I see some thumbs up and some head nodding. Okay, so I'm gonna make a motion to deny the application unless the affidavit with the provisions for signage is signed by the applicant, with the great hope that it would then turn into a straightforward approval when the affidavit is signed- and I need a second second second and final vote of the evening, but I should preface it by saying don't run away, because I need to bring you up to speed on a very recent development that you need to be aware of and that we need to figure out how we're going to handle. But first, let's take the vote. Julie. Yes, aaron! Yes, nancy! Yes, mike, yes, tristan, yes, ej, yes, ed yeah, evan, yes, oh john, yes, rachel, yeah, ryan, yes and dave! Yes and laila. I mean yes and we will be in touch with the applicant. We will work with the applicant tomorrow to provide the affidavit and get that in good order, so that, hopefully, by next week we will have everything in place all right. Thank you to the applicants, okay, so members of the committee I wanted to let you know that, like an hour ago, we received a notice from the governor's office that the governor is going through with its plan for redevelopment of penn station. This is something that had been announced. I want to say probably like six months ago, and the thought that had been floated was that you know the governor wants to expand penn station and in order to do that, he is proposing to basically take over. I believe six blocks around penn station through eminent domain and demolish them and rebuild them as part of this proposal. There's a big transportation component, which ej is fully plugged in and working on, but there's also obviously a very big land use component, because what the governor is proposing is to basically do an upzoning of these blocks so that by generating additional far that he would then sell the proceeds of the sale would fund the below grade improvements and the transit upgrades. So we're going to be working closely with tna on. You know what that means. But the big news today is that the governor has finally issued the their scoping document, all right, so the scope, the scoping document has been. I mean the draft scoping document has been issued and in his infinite kindness, the governor has agreed to give us 20 days to review the scoping document and issue our recommendations. So we need to provide our recommendations by july 20th. I haven't had a chance to look at the the scoping document yet, but I think it's you know pretty thorough good summer reading and it is massive I mean what is being proposed is massive from what I understand he is proposing and observing to bring the far to 35, which is kind of unheard of. I know, julie is like pulling up her chair. I saw that yeah. I had the same reaction. So to give you a point of comparison, e smith town, which you know already got us to choke pretty seriously, was only 30 far here. The the proposed far for some sites is 35., but if I understand correctly, once again, you know I haven't had a chance to really dig deep in the the document, but he is proposing eight sites that would be eligible to reach a 35 far, and these eight sites are, you know, obviously pretty concentrated around grand central. So you know it raises a number of issues, including the fact that it is in very close proximity with the empire state building, and that currently is you know there is no mechanism to protect. You know vista corridors, so you know that's a concern. I mean that's just one concern. You know there are many others, you know equally or even more serious to to consider so given that tonight is our last meeting of of this cycle and that we're going to hiatus over august and that we have 20 days to provide some comments on this really very substantial proposal, of which I should mention that you know, because it's a state process, basically euler does not apply, and the community board does not have a formal role, although we will be consulted with that, we have been assured of, but the role of the community board is not codified. The way it is with euler and given that it is not a city action. There is no council vote, there's no involvement of the board president, so it's a whole different process. So all of that being said, we have 20 days to read the document and figure out what we think of it and make recommendations, because, as you know, if the scope is not clearly determined, if you know if the scope is too broad or too narrow, then anything that falls out of the scope can no longer be part of the conversation. So if we want to have you know any meaningful impact, now is the time. So my question to you is: how do we do that? Any thoughts no need to raise your hand. Just unmute yourself, speak yell scream. How many pages is the document layla? You said I actually didn't look at the. Let me let me see I mean you know. Typically, a scoping document is like you know, between two and 300 pages. It's 45 pages, this document that we received. Oh 45, yeah. Okay, so maybe it's not that bad. If we could get a link to it would be great. Yes, I'm going to just to send you the link, so I think it would be a good idea that we schedule a meeting before 20 days so that we can have a chance to you know, review it say something meaningful and and be on record, because on july 20th there will be a a public hearing and it will be our opportunity to log our comments on the on the scope leila. Are you picturing a? Are you picturing a land use meeting, that's more specifically focused on land-use issues, or do you think it would need to be a joint meeting and I think, there's. I think that it would be better to join because really it's impossible to separate one from the other. You know, I think it's very similar to east midtown. You know it was all about. You know. Shifting air rides getting some below grade improvements. Getting some above grade improvements, public realm. I think it's gonna be very difficult to you know separate both. So I would be very much in favor of you know a joint joint action and you know maybe it is a task force. I don't know what do you think ej yeah? I think that's all. I agree with you, as I said, snarkily by email. I think it's light on some of the transportation details that I would otherwise like to be able to evaluate. But you know, if wishes were horses so yeah, I think I would agree with either a say, joint meeting of our two committees or a task force with select members of our two committees. If you think that would be more efficient yeah, I would. I would love to hope to hear what our members of the the committee feel do you all want to get involved. Do you think that it should be a smaller group? I mean this is going to keep us busy for the years to come. I mean you know. Scoping is super important, but it's not the only stuff, obviously of the environmental review process for this project leila there. It says on here that there's a july 20th public scoping hearing. So the comments are due before that yeah, okay, he's giving us 19 days. I guess you know in the dead of summer during a pandemic. If we're gonna wait until after this board cycle is over, I guess we're talking sometime during the week of the 13, maybe early the week of the 13th to re review. The documents come together as a meeting, get our thoughts together at that meeting and then and then we have four or five days to write up whatever it is that we're gonna submit yeah. So maybe we should decide that you know the 13 or 14 will have a joint meeting that gives us. You know roughly two weeks to look at the material. Do some research. I think it's going to be important to reach out to the various stakeholders. You know we really need to hear from all these property owners. Well, there's a number of landmark worthy buildings on on these sites. There's a church. So we need to find out what the archdiocese thinks and you know, do they welcome the opportunity to knocking down a 100 plus year church. Do they on the country feel that you know it's a problem and we need to better also better understand the transportation component which right now I don't know how well-baked all of that is. So maybe we can yeah laila vicky it possible, since it's two large committees, and you would have to be doing everything that at that joint meeting initially, would it be possible to have maybe five or six members from each committee try to do an initial go through with to try and get it? You know a little bit more condensed by the time it gets to a giant meeting of like it's gonna, be maybe 35 people with the two committees yeah. I totally agree. I think it's because our two committees combined is going to be pretty much. You know like half of the board, exactly more, which is great, it's good, but it's it becomes a little harder to maneuver. Yes, so maybe we can, you know, do a a small group who is the overlap between tna and land use, who sits on both committees, ryan johnny, j? Okay, so are you guys game for a little deep dive on the land use? Okay? So let's do that any other members of land use who would want to take a deep dive into the the scoping documents raise hands tristan. You always raise your hand yay. All right, so tristan is in rachel, usually always raises her hand. Sorry I do you have the bandwidth. Are you able to yeah sure great awesome anybody else who would want to join in and then ej? Would you suggest others like maybe sam or yeah I'll, of course, I'll of course sing the transportation committee and identify a couple of folks who would want to be involved from that and that's fantastic great and then maybe we can do you know so sort of initial work. You know on our end and then gather our thoughts in you know some email and be ready to make some recommendations when we meet with the whole group, which you know hopefully will then be congealed into a recommendation that we can submit during the hearing sounds like a plan. Awesome layla. We all we're all getting in with the spoken document on both committees say that again mike sorry, all the committee members are getting the email with the scoping document. Yes, yeah, okay, all right, yeah and vicky. I don't know how you feel, but I think it would be a good idea that it is circulated to all members of the board. Absolutely it's going to keep us busy. This is going to be another east midtown, exactly gigantic whatever and on which we're not we're. Gonna have much less ability to really. You know, comment and leverage and and negotiate, because our role is baked into the review process. Exactly okay, so yeah we will circulate the the documents with with the entire board, and so we have our working group and please mark it down that either the the 14. I'm sorry. What did we say, the 13 or the 14th? We will have a joint meeting of tna and land use and ej, and I will just confer quickly later tonight so that we can pick the date and we'll let you know later, but put those two dates already on hold. It's gonna be really important that that we all you know, show up and all ready for that all right. So on that note, that pretty much concludes anything and everything that we had to discuss. Is there anything else that you guys want to discuss, bring up talk about? Okay, then we will adjourn the meeting so happy summer and see you in two weeks. Thank you. Bye.
