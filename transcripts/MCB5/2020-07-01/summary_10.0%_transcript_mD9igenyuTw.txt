Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions about the application.
The first item on the agenda is for an application to obtain a four-year extension of time to complete construction of a new building, and the address is 12-14.
This is an application based upon a request that the board determined that the owner of the property has a common law vested right to complete construction.
But we don't expect that they're going to start physical construction until the middle of July, and at that point there is some concern that they will not be able to finish a hundred percent of the work to get a tco for the entire building by the existing expiration date.
There have actually been two common law, vesting cases involving hotels decided by the next slide, Peter decided by the board in the last couple years, and they have found that percentages of completion or number of days expended or percentage of total number of days required to complete that were sufficient to establish a common law right to best, far less than what exists.
First, finding includes the notion that the owner had a valid permit issued pursuant to approved plans and specifications when the zoning was enacted, and that has already been determined by the board of standards and appeals in the first application, and the board is a quasi-judicial body.
This amount is far more than both the board and the courts have found appropriate for a finding of common law vested rights in west 39th street, which I meant mentioned.
We will start with questions from our members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raised hand function if you need any assistance with the interface luke zavados, who is a the community board?
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and we need comments on this application.
I just think, there's an issue with giving four years because, even though they say they don't really need the full four years, I just worried that the traffic on 48th street there's a lot of construction going on the next block over I am comfortable with giving them an extension.
If you were to decide that you know it can be sort of like open-ended another applicant, that may be, you know less professional in the way they're handling a situation could actually take advantage of it, and we don't want that type of situation.
Anybody object firmly to two and a half mike go ahead, I'm, okay, with two and a half as long as we can put in the provision that they still meet with the east midtown special sub-district hotel permit findings that so that would be like what would prevent other people from saying that this is a precedent that the findings that they met last time with us in October that, because I believe the applicant says that they still meet all those same findings and they meet these.
These common law, findings, plus the hotel special permit findings, So I'm gonna, make a motion to approve the application, with the recommendation of a two and a half year, extension, spelling out very precisely and clearly why we are granting this.
You know the specificity, all the details, the fact that the applicant was in front of us in October, 2019, the circumstances, the windows, their window, situation, the pandemic and the halt to their job progress, and those are really the specific reasons why we're comfortable with granting this permit and that anything else.
This was assigned to aaron for due diligence once again we're going to jump directly into our presentation, but aaron looked thoroughly at this, and they have some good pointed questions and insights to share with the committee, but I want to invite the applicants to share their screen and start getting ready for their presentation.
We are before you tonight, with a city planning application for a minor modification of a special permit number cp202 to allow a 639 square foot outdoor cafe in a privately owned public space at 1633.
You, see the princy storefront on west 51st street and here's the azalea cafe that I mentioned the outdoor cafe that was renewed last year and then two images of that arcade and driveway space on the western end of the site.
We are here today for a fourth minor modification to the special permit to allow princey to operate a 639 square foot outdoor cafe, adjacent to its west 51st street frontage shown there in pink.
We hope that the outdoor cafe can activate this portion of the of west 51st street, make good use of an underutilized open space and provide an amenity to people living, working and eventually visiting the area.
The mayor issued a mayoral order, suspending provisions of the zoning resolution that require cpc certification for outdoor cafes in privately owned public spaces in order to provide restaurants.
The flexibility needed to open in this time of social distancing, princey will be looking to take advantage of the mayor mayoral order in the short term, we'll call them covert related precautions, that this location will be adhering to not just with the outdoor seating area, but the precautions that we are currently operating with now, the first you can see we are dedicated and disciplined to social distancing in all of our spaces.
We only represent princey the applicant on this application, so I don't know plans for the larger building, but I'm not aware of any other plans for any outdoor cafes in that area, and there is already a see if I can find a better image.
You know what let me go to the other one, sorry, okay, looking at the site plan.
We were able to present a a full approval and support for the for the open air cafe great, and you would just need that a few days before full board correct along with the official affidavit.
So members of the committee I, wanted to let you know.
Given that tonight is our last meeting of of this cycle and that we're going to hiatus over august and that we have 20 days to provide some comments on this really very substantial proposal, of which I should mention that you know, because it's a state process, basically euler does not apply, and the community board does not have a formal role.
