Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions about the application.
The first item on the agenda is for an application to obtain a four- year, extension of time to complete construction of a new building, and the address is 12- 14 East, 48Th Street.
This is an application based upon a request that the board determined that the owner of the property has a common law vested right to complete construction.
A time when we were seeking the one- year, extension of time to complete that was authorized by the Midtown East legislation that imposed the prohibition on new health hotel construction without a special permit.
They are re- mobilizing, but we do not expect that they're going to start physical construction until the middle of July, and at that point there is some concern that they will not be able to finish a hundred percent of the work to get a tco for the entire building by the existing expiration date.
In the absence of any statutory basis for further extension of time, the option that presents itself is to seek a common law vesting remedy, and the reason for doing that is that common law, investing is, has been regarded by the courts and is now regarded by the board as an alternative to statutory vesting that preserves essentially what are considered to be vested constitutional rights.
There have actually been two common law, vesting cases involving hotels, decided by the Peter Decided by the board in the last couple years, and they have found that percentages of completion or number of days expended or percentage of total number of days required to complete that were sufficient to establish a common law right to best, far less than what exists.
In terms of common law, vesting Peter, the next finding is, I The first finding includes the notion that the owner had a valid permit issued pursuant to approved plans and specifications when the zoning was enacted, and that has already been determined by the board of Standards and appeals in the first application, and the board is a quasi- judicial.
This amount is far more than both the board and the courts have found appropriate for a finding of common law vested rights in West 39th street, which I meant mentioned.
We will start with questions from our members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raised hand function if you need any assistance with the Interface Luke Zavados, who is a the Community board.
How much time do you expect, given that we do not know what's going to happen with Covid-19, but how much time do you expect to complete the construction If we can?
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and we need comments on this application.
I just think there's an issue with giving four years because, even though they say they do not really need the full four years, I just worried that the traffic on 48th street there's a lot of construction going on the next block.
Two and a half Mike go ahead, I'm, okay, with two and a half as long as we can put in the provision that they still meet with the east Midtown special sub- district hotel permit findings that so that would be like what would prevent other people from saying that this is a precedent that the findings that they met last time with us in October that, because I believe the applicant says that they still meet all those same findings and they meet these.
These common law, findings, plus the hotel special permit findings, So I'm, going to make a motion to approve the application, with the recommendation of a two and a half, year, extension, spelling out very precisely and clearly why we are granting this.
You know the specificity, all the details, the fact that the applicant was in front of us in October, 2019, the circumstances, the windows, their window, situation, the pandemic and the halt to their job progress, and those are really the specific reasons why we're comfortable with granting this permit and that anything else.
We are before you tonight with a city planning application for a minor modification of a special permit number Cp202 to allow a 639 square foot outdoor cafe in a privately owned public space at 1633.
The western end of the site, in November, 1989 city planning, approved the first minor modification to the special permit to add additional seating, planting lighting and trees, as well as to relocate stairs associated with the two.
You, see the princy storefront on West 51St street and here's the azalea cafe that I mentioned the outdoor cafe that was renewed last year and then two images of that arcade and driveway space on the western end of the site.
We are here today for a fourth minor modification to the special permit to allow princey to operate a 639 square foot outdoor cafe, adjacent to its west 51St street frontage shown there in pink.
We hope that the outdoor cafe can activate this portion of the of West 51St street, make good use of an underutilized open space and provide an amenity to people, living, working and eventually visiting the area.
The mayor issued a mayoral order, suspending provisions of the zoning resolution that require Cpc certification for outdoor cafes in privately owned public spaces.
The flexibility needed to open in this time of social distancing princey will be looking to take advantage of the mayor mayoral order in the short term, we'll call them Covid-19 related precautions, that this location will be adhering to not just with the outdoor seating area, but the precautions that we are currently operating with now, the first.
I. Do not think that restaurant had seating, but I was trying to remember the configuration or what is the future plan of that area, which is immediately adjacent to this area right, Are there other tables and outdoor cafes like right, against?
We only represent princey the applicant on this application, so I do not know plans for the larger building, but I'm not aware of any other plans for any outdoor cafes in that area, and there is already a see if I can find a better image.
We were able to present a a full approval and support for the for the open air cafe great, and you would just need that a few days before full board correct along with the official affidavit.
So members of the committee I wanted to let you know.
Given that tonight is our last meeting of of this cycle and that we're going to hiatus over August and that we have 20 days to provide some comments on this really very substantial proposal, of which I should mention that you know, because it's a state process, basically euler, does not apply, and the community board does not have a formal role.
