This is an application based upon a request that the board determined that the owner of the property has a common law vested right to complete construction At a time when we were seeking the one-year extension of time to complete that was authorized by the midtown east legislation that imposed the prohibition on new health hotel construction without a special permit The way that was originally drafted was that our project was quite specifically grandfathered in as a vest, as it was vested subject to being de-vested or divested in that it had to meet certain criteria for having a building permit full plans and specifications approved by the department of buildings, and we met those criteria.
After the governor's order was lifted, Raised has raised its own difficulties, they getting the contractor back on site and so forth, but we don't expect that they're going to start physical construction until the middle of july, and at that point there is some concern that they will not be able to finish a hundred percent of the work to get a tco for the entire building by the existing expiration date So in the absence of any statutory basis for further extension of time.
That's that is this separate body of common law, vesting Ultimately what will be granted in terms of number of years, but you know the basic amount that's allowed for what is a minor development and a minor development is essentially a new building with a foundation is six years two years to finish maximum extensions for two years to finish foundations and up to four years to finish the building You know we may not get the full four The board may feel that's inappropriate, but some number of a year and a half time to give us ample time to complete and be certain that we don't have to come back and seek any further relief.
Furniture That has been ordered, and you know the the design of the space for individual rooms rather than for you know something that would be more appropriate for an apartment and certainly not for an office The two cases which are cited in our memorandum or our statement of facts and findings on page eight, our matter of 30 west 39th street, where the bsa found that the 93 days of construction out of a projected 686, which was 13.5 percent of the total, was sufficient to vest and in matter of 11-31 ryerson street You know in the scale of things we're way past that point in terms of common law.
We will start with questions from our members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raised hand function if you need any assistance with the interface luke zavados, who is a the community board associate, is with us and can chime in, but hopefully you're all fluent with the zoom platform, and so please raise your hands and how much time do you expect, given that we don't know, what's going to happen with Covid-19, but how much time do you expect to complete the construction if we can, if we are able to fully mobilize and get all the required workers on the site, we believe will be done by the end of march, if there's no further shutdowns, if we don't, you know in a second wave, have to close the job again Thank you any other questions by members of the committee.
At the same time, I'm not sure where to draw the line before that, and so I'll just say up top and very comfortable with an extension here for sure I'd be very open to hearing that, but I'm concerned about picking something arbitrarily short of that, because I'm not sure exactly what the foundation would be for us to do so, but I'm interested in listening You know what is a an end date supposed to protect against, because I guess like what is there a downside of saying, okay, you can have another four or five years like what is that meant.
As for their statement right now, they're expecting to complete in march 2021 If, we were to you know, support a an extension to july 2022 and I'd probably be willing to be inclined to support either of those Unless there's another wave of pandemic that causes a whole another longer shutdown, You know I would hate to have a disagreement over I would really hope that we have a a unanimous vote on a on resolution on this application What I would like to see, because I just I just think that supply chain is a problem right now in every construction site in the city?
You know the specificity, all the details, the fact that the applicant was in front of us in october 2019 the circumstances, the windows, their window situation, the pandemic and the halt to their job progress, and those are really the specific reasons why we're comfortable with granting this permit and that anything else This is the motion and I need a second all right, and this is the first vote of the evening.
We are before you tonight, with a city planning application for a minor modification of a special permit number cp202 to allow a 639 square foot outdoor cafe in a privately owned public space at 1633.
Pursuant to former zoning resolution section 8106, the building is 48 stories tall and it contains office and retail uses, as well as the gershwin and circle in the square theaters At. The time the original special permit was approved, The site had approximately 14 000 square feet of open space upgrade with at grade plaza and and sorry sunken plaza space fronting on broadway sidewalk widenings along both of west 50th street and west 51st street, in a through block arcade and driveway The western end of the site, In november 1989 city planning, approved the first minor modification to the special permit to add additional seating, planting lighting and trees, as well as to relocate stairs associated with the two Then two sunken plazas.
We hope that the outdoor cafe can activate this portion of the of west 51st street, make good use of an underutilized open space and provide an amenity to people living, working and eventually visiting the area As I mentioned.
We began this application or, as ellen mentioned sorry, we began this application before Covid-19 and we were seeking approval of a cafe meant to operate after Covid-19 this past saturday, the mayor issued a mayoral order, suspending provisions of the zoning resolution that require cpc certification for outdoor cafes in privately owned public spaces in order to provide restaurants, The flexibility needed to open in this time of social distancing princey will be looking to take advantage of the mayor mayoral order in the short term.
We actually had the situation last month and it ended up working out and the applicant ended up agreeing to our stipulations We were able to present a a full approval and support for the for the open air cafe great, and you would just need that a few days before full board correct, along with the official affidavit Yes, absolutely nancy, I see that you have your hand up go ahead if they want an idea of what we're looking for, they could look at our resolution.
You know, I, think it's very similar to east midtown Getting , some above grade improvements, public realm I, think it's light on some of the transportation details that I would otherwise like to be able to evaluate I would love to hope to hear what our members of the the committee feel.
