Five, the executive committee meets once a month for the purpose of being apprised by each committee, chair of actions and or discussions that have taken place at the committee level, which leads to our main purpose, which is to form and finalize the agenda for the full board meeting the executive committee.
The main purpose of the executive committee meeting is to form and finalize the agenda for Thursday night's full board.
Okay, I, see that we have, I believe, three people in attendance and no one I think, So we will move on to the business session of the board, which is what we are in right now of the board of the executive committee, and it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you our new district manager, Marisa Mock, welcome aboard.
Finding you, I am first vice chair of the board under Vicki And I'm, chair of the Committee on public safety and quality of life, which is our liquor license.
I've been on the board since 2009 and prior to being chair of the parks and public Spaces Committee.
You know we oversee everything that occurs in most public spaces aside from streets, so the streets is really left to transportation, committee, but sidewalks.
I'm, the Secretary of the board, I'm, also the vice chair of two committees, parks and public spaces under Clayton and public safety quality of life on your neck.
Know, between infrastructure and land use work also closely with the Parks Committee, because we also have some super lab.
A cyber Cafe, Street Fairs street renamings and those kind of stuff You know passionate about the work that that we do and very much looking forward to working with you and really excited to have you on board.
And I have been a chair of a committee, And, so you know I familiar with your joy and your pain, And I'm, really looking forward to speaking with each of you individually and getting into the nitty- gritty of what's going on and upcoming agenda items and anything that I can be helpful with just in thinking through upcoming agenda items as well.
Maybe another committee can can give their report Let's go to parks sure we actually had no action items on the agenda.
It was a sobering, but also very optimistic, update from these three entities and important entities in our district about how these vital spaces are still being so lovingly cared for and with the Madison Square Park Conservancy has done an incredible job, with communicating with their users exactly what's going on with the programming changes with the staff, I mean they've, just been extremely communicative and upfront about the struggles with Covid-19 that the staff have had And they've done incredible work in making sure that people can be working there safely and only the people who are really essential and staggered shifts, etc.
Last month, we had voted to send our support for the proposed position that Mas and New Yorkers for parks have put forth for the position of the director of public realm in the city administration as part of a mayoral office, and other chairs can speak to this.
But, we consulted with Vicki and kind of came up with an idea to have this be as broad based as possible in terms of support from the board and that the best way to do that would be for every relevant committee to submit to renee, as Beck's committee chair, our kind of bullet points for the ways in which we believe that position would be helpful for the various jurisdictional priorities that our committees oversee and that then, as bex moves forward with their budget request cycle next month.
That was an action item we had last month that is kind of still in progress, and that's all we had this month, a really important one for sure you want to take it from there renee, since we're mentioning Bex will do We had two resolutions well just following up on Clayton, absolutely we're taking on board all of those all of those points from the other committees, so that we can not only include it as a budget request, but also weave that into our district statement.
People are looking for housing The voucher amounts are not sort of in line with New York City rents.
They were concerned, particularly by the fact that the coalitions that had been spoken to really did not include a lot of the landlords, and the committee wanted to see that they were also concerned by the definition of 25 or full- time or fewer full, time, employees being the definition of small business and ask whether that could be expanded, and the elected representative agreed that you know, because this is just a framework he was going to take that back to Senator Hoyleman.
A piece of legislation has its merits, especially if it funnels federal funding, but its broadness in you know being applied to the entire state rather than specifically to the city, may get in the way, and I'm just wondering.
You know what I mean if there's appropriations to the state of New York we're getting those monies and that's even a very big The state level is much more likely potentially because the state does not have money to give to the city.
I'm sure the committee knows all of the issues that community members have been having with some of the hotels, particularly on the upper West side, on West, 55Th, street, and also not so much anymore in the 30s, but certainly We've been working with the borough presence office to try and set a meeting with the providers and are elected in order to get some movement.
Think at the end of your resolves, it would be helpful that people hear that okay, We had one application and one presentation: The presentation was in the continuation of what Clayton described the municipal arts society came to to our committee this month to present on their advocacy, to create a post of director of the public realm.
It would be a great strength for the work that our committee is doing and especially for our district, because you know.
You know the whole technical conversation that we had, but basically it boiled down to the lot that is going to use these air rights Is, actually a split lot, meaning that the density on one side of the split is not the same as the density that is permitted on the other side of the split and therefore the applicant proposed a zoning text, amendment, meaning that they want to change the zoning text.
You know we're not saying that you know it's going to be a broad application of this new language and because that is so restrictive And, because of those reasons we felt that we could support the zoning tax.
There is going back to the director of public realm issue and the importance that many of us feel that you know supporting that in some way- I think we're in the forefront simply because Mas came to us first and others have expressed an interest.
I, think that makes sense, because I mean I won't speak for layla, but it was part of her report for this round of meetings anyway, at land, use.
And, I'll kind of allude to hearing from, depending on how you want to order the committees in the agenda elude that we'll be hearing more about it, laila You can just you know, give the report.
Would that work for you, Clayton Sure, so, just to be clear , I would I would speak, but within the land use report, is that right, leila, whichever way, makes most sense what's that?
I think it would just be a committee report on this issue and then layla can just hand it over to me when that comes up listed under land use, but not under parks, Because ours was last cycle, It's already been done, I'm happy to bring it up again and also by the way I did not actually say this, but I think it would be helpful to give a report from parks to full board just about It's just so that people know that ice skating is happening and that the various updates we got from Bryant Park and Madison Square Park.
