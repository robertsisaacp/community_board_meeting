Everyone for joining us tonight, if you're, not otherwise, aware you're at the August meeting of the transportation and environment committee for Manhattan Community board five, where we hear issues related to the transportation environment in the space that affect our district.
We have three items in our agenda: tonight: they're, all updates from the department of Transportation who has who's joining us here, tonight, we'll be hearing updates on a couple different topics, including the status of the open streets and restaurants, program, which of course, is ongoing, we'll be hearing updates and some follow- up information that we asked DOT to come back to us with regarding data and observations about the 14th street Busway, which of course has been underway for many months.
So without further ado, we'll we'll get started with the the first of those items on the agenda, which is an update on Fifth Avenue and the design process, which I will I'll introduce briefly to provide some context for the members of the committee and Then I'll send it over to Ed Pinkar and the team from DOT to to present what they brought.
There are several elements of improving fifth avenue that we've heard about over the years, including a long- standing desire to continue to add to the city's interconnected bike.
Community board is that commuter five is actually already on the record supporting the addition of a protected bike lane on Fifth Avenue.
So, for that reason, and to kind of set expectations for the for the committee, because the design we're seeing is not final, because the bus way is actually still under discussion and the rules and goals of it are not finalized yet and because Community Board five is frankly already on the record relative to the concept of a protected bike.
This month, because it's still in development DOT, will certainly come back to us after the final cab meeting relative to the busway after continuing to design and discuss the rest of the Fifth Avenue development and continuing to iterate on the kind of complete street design.
We expect DOT to return to us in the coming months, And I do not expect us to take a final position on this tonight, so I just wanted to set expectations for any action by the committee tonight, but we're looking forward to seeing the status update.
You know asking questions from members of the committee and members of the district And I'm sure that DOT is interested to hear our feedback as the design process continues and is.
We were happy that Fifth Avenue was included in that plan and we convened two Community Advisory board meetings, thus far over the summer to start discussing what those improvements could look.
One of the things that we quickly heard from some of you from our elected officials and from other community stakeholders, is that Fifth Avenue serves a variety of interests and needs not only new yorkers who work there, who live nearby, who commute through it, but also millions upon millions of tourists who come to this most iconic avenue each and every year, and hopefully, they'll be back in mass.
This is something that community board 5 has long called for a more complete street type, treatment, four fifth avenue and has also been one of the requests from our elected officials.
We presented not only our initial ideas for how a bus way could operate, but also the bones of a complete street for Fifth Avenue, including both needed pedestrian space, as well as a protected bicycle lane, and we're excited tonight to run through that presentation to give you a sense of what we're thinking for the corridor as we look towards implementing a project later.
Obviously I personally, I hope that we get some good feedback on the complete street design in 2017, along with a former member of Janet's team, we presented the double busway proposal and I.
Restart plan was announced among highlighting the critical role that buses have played during the Covid-19 pandemic and as the city adapts and reopens, ridership numbers are still indicating that bus ridership has increased while subway ridership remains low and This furthers a need to provide reliable transit service that prioritizes the bus, especially as we can anticipate people have a greater desire for alternatives to the subway, which will include a shift to buses, bikes, walking war and private vehicles.
We just include this to emphasize the role improvements on Fifth Avenue has for the entire city and communities with limited options to talk more about the daily bus riders who use fifth Avenue, I'm, going to hand it over to a colleague at the MTA laura who will share a few slides with you all hi Ola. City Transit just want to elaborate a bit on the bus service on 5th avenue.
I'm happy to answer any more questions about bus service if they come up, but with that I think I can hand it back to Chelsea flora thanks and right now, continuing.
Ed and others have already acknowledged that this that there are, we have received support from the community previously, when the double bus lane was implemented in 2018 and that there have been longstanding requests for more of a complete street approach, including a protected bike lane in this Midtown portion of fifth avenue and all the time we're making sure accommodating the highest pedestrian volumes in this area, especially during the holiday season, and just to elaborate on the complete street approach.
There are multiple opportunities that present themselves on fifth avenue, as we consider how critical it is to improve bus speeds and reliability, create more pedestrian.
Space, safer conditions, adding a protected bike lane and accommodating the vehicle, pickups and drop- offs that take place in such a busy corridor and also finding ways to incorporate beautification efforts with these opportunities.
A. Complete street approach will provide space to have a dedicated safe area for bikes during the city's recovery and when looking at the vehicle travel speeds, it's useful to think about what traffic typically would look like on fifth avenue and also looking at where we are in the middle of this token.
So now we'd like to present to the board a complete street proposal for Fifth Avenue just to catch everyone up on where we are, since the mayor's announcement, starting with Outreach and engagement, a community advisory board or a cab which is made up of the of elected officials, Cb members, representatives of local institutions, property, owners, transit advocates and bus riders on 5Th Avenue.
The initial proposal, limited Southbound through movement to buses, bikes and emergency vehicles, requiring all others to turn off before 57th street, but still allowed local access for pickup and drop offs.
We are continuing to without evaluate this feedback and suggestions that we're receiving and we'll be meeting with the cab again next month, and even though we are still evaluating all of the possible traffic restrictions in this project area, we know we want to move forward with the safety elements, including the protected bike, Lane sanded, Pedestrian space and the pickup and drop off zones.
We will be returning to the Cb in September, as well, with any updates on proposed Turner structure restrictions and a monitoring plan to make the avenue work as well as possible for buses, bikes and pedestrians.
Our proposal tonight includes a parking protected bike lane along the corridor by providing dedicated, space, we're able to boost safety and better organize the roadway to promote better interactions amongst all street users.
You, know you're able to set things in the roadway pause and then and then find a gap acrosss the bike lane and make your way to the sidewalk or the pedestrian space.
We think these will be on almost every block and the point is to provide space for taxis and other free for higher vehicles to be able to pull over outside of the travel lane and maintain traffic flow.
We want to make the existing double bus lanes on fifth avenue work as well as possible.
Obviously, you know, if that slips at all my office, will keep CB5 and other cab members updated along the way and then, when we get to implementation, certainly depending on what goes in the ground.
The most helpful schedule will be moving forward on providing updates, but my office attends the transportation committee meeting every month and we're happy to you know provide updates along the way if we need to do something more formal in terms of additional presentations.
I, we'll start by throwing it open to members of the committee to any ask any questions that may have come up during the presentation after that, we'll turn to members of the public who have been asking questions through the Q&A feature in zoom Ask them to the DOT, but for the time being, Luke.
First of all, we started off not only this presentation, but the original idea for the project, understanding that Fifth Avenue is an iconic corridor that serves many different uses, not only all of the pedestrians who walk through the area, both on the avenue and the cross streets.
You know pick up and on this new on this new corridor, to kind of make it more clear , That's another great question, and we learned a lot from our experience with 14th street in that respect, and certainly when we launched the 14th street Busway, it was not seamless in dealing with the taxi industry and some of the others, the trucking industry and other buses.
You know companies so that they would take drivers on a different route from earlier on and there are a lot of different ways depending on where people are coming from and where they're going that traffic would be able to find its way and still ensure local access.
The whole part of the better buses restart program was to allow us to implement projects before all of the traffic came back so that we would be doing this monitoring instead of a lot of intense upfront studies like the kinds that we may have done on 14th street.
So, that's where this monitoring comes in and where, if we're, if we end up a bus way and those traffic restrictions, are a pilot where we could actually study how those things are working as it goes along and make adjustments as we needed to okay.
It's something we're working on thanks next question: DOT is expected to come back next month with a final design, was not the busway supposed to be installed this summer and should not something be implemented before traffic comes back?
You, know, stakeholders throughout this corridor and beyond, who had legitimate questions and concerns, and it's certainly been beneficial to us and to our teams at DOT to be able to hear those questions, and you know, try to work through them to make sure that we are implementing the best possible proposal for Fifth Avenue, And, you know, I, think the inclusion of a complete street plan is a worthy inclusion and it's certainly taken some time to do some of that engineering.
We've learned a lot since we put out the initial barrels over the summer The next question, protected by lanes and bus lanes, would increase the number of people going through the area who might stop into busi.
I. Do think that you know we we're absolutely looking at ways to improve bus service throughout the city.
Those bus riders are very well represented, but we're happy to take any question comment feedback complaint from different community boards or residents throughout the city.
Some of the data from one of our data partners called street light about how vehicles move along the corridor and that's helping us inform some of the traffic restriction, ideas that we're evaluating So we're still working on that I'm, not sure if you hear some of the symphony coming from the other room, but obviously Janet and Jennifer and Kimberly and others are going to remain online.
Right now we are trying to get through a lot of the early planning stages meeting with the cab, making sure that the cross sections that we're working towards make sense- You know a little later in this process, but I think could be included in this plan and just to note that, generally, we have gotten a lot of requests for increased bike parking as buildings anticipate folks coming back to work on bike, so we are working on expanding our bike.
I will say that we have added some camera enforcement on fifth avenue already and we will be looking to do more if we think that is a particular issue or concern, I mean, as you should know, pickups and drop- offs, are allowed in the bus lane.
110,000 bus riders a day is a huge number of people that come to Fifth Avenue from all over the city, working in all kinds of jobs, and you know we are trying to make their commutes as easy as possible, encourage people to take public transportation.
So this complete street proposal is really trying to balance out all of the means of the corridor in the best way possible to make it work for everyone, thanks.
We present protected bike, lane projects, but just as a reminder when we implement those kinds of projects, we see safety benefits for everyone on the street.
The cab is evaluating, separated from the rest of the complete street proposal, so I think one of the challenges here is that we're looking to install a bike, lane, Be it temporary or permanent, and some pedestrian, space.
We work through some of the other concerns, we've heard and tried to just come up with the best plan for the bus as well feel free to add anything to that D.O.T. Okay, thanks next question is how will adding these painted lanes affect the black lives matter, Mural, currently painted on 5th Avenue?
That's part of what we'll bring back to the cab and to the Cb final question: If there will be polls and cameras and signage added all along Fifth, avenue, Dot wants to speak to visual corridors in general from a community board perspective.
We'll continue to try to do better and improve on this process as well, but with that we'll we'll wrap up this agenda item talking about Fifth avenue, thanks again to DOT and thanks again to all the members of the public who participated in it with that we'll go to what I believe should be much briefer sections of our meeting.
It was, and that's what's reflected in the second report that came out in May You know it shows it shows mixed opinions of how the corridor has worked for some people and not and not for others, and it's there's a lot of data in there about the public feedback.
Are there, any sort of open or lingering questions for members of the committee that they'd like to direct to DOT at this point, perhaps relative to any questions that we might have brought up the last time we were discussing this with them feel free to raise your hand if you have a question: okay, not seeing any.
The cabs were acknowledgement that we could not do that same thing for these projects that we have been doing for 14th, street, and I think that the process that we've had for 14 through the boards and other means has been effective, and we can continue to take questions from the community through the board.
We do not have specific data on that Ej, but you know generally, traffic volumes right now are lower due to the pandemic, but if there are any questions about certain congested areas, we could take a look.
Restaurants, program, bj, I, think you're speaking specifically about the open, streets.
