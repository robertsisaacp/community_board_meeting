We have three items in our agenda: tonight: they're, all updates from the department of transportation who has who's joining us here tonight, we'll be hearing updates on a couple different topics, including the status of the open streets and restaurants program, which of course, is ongoing, we'll be hearing updates and some follow-up information that we asked DOT to come back to us with regarding data and observations about the 14th street busway, which of course has been underway for many months.
At this point and we'll hear an update on the ongoing fifth avenue improvements, design process So without further ado, we'll we'll get started with the the first of those items on the agenda, which is an update on fifth avenue and the design process, which I will I'll introduce briefly to provide some context for the members of the committee and There are several elements of improving fifth avenue that we've heard about over the years, including a long-standing desire to continue to add to the city's interconnected bike lane network, to improve cyclist and pedestrian safety and to provide a little history.
Another component, obviously relative to fifth avenue What you might have heard about, is the is the busway which the mayor announced earlier this summer to be installed at some point soon , That has been the subject of ongoing community advisory board meetings or cab meetings, Being run by DOT in communication with the community to discuss and design whatever the rules and structure of a bus way would be in dialogue with the community, but I believe what we're going to see is essentially a an in-progress draft design by DOT, as it attempts to address these multiple changes to fifth avenue, but in a in an eventually comprehensive way, but for for reasons related to the fact that the busway design and conversations are still underway, which will be what we're gonna see, I believe is very much a work in progress So. For that reason, and to kind of set expectations for the for the committee, because the design we're seeing is not final, because the bus way is actually still under discussion and the rules and goals of it aren't finalized yet and because community board five is frankly already on the record relative to the concept of a protected bike.
I. Don't anticipate there being a vote or the taking of a position by the committee on this proposal this month, because it's still in development DOT will certainly come back to us after the final cab meeting relative to the busway after continuing to design and discuss the rest of the fifth avenue development and continuing to iterate on the kind of complete street design and I.
For the for the first presentation of the evening, vicky members of the committee and the board and I'm dot's Manhattan borough, commissioner I thought that wally rubin was a handful, but being the new father of twins, I assure you they are a lot more difficult to deal with, but we certainly miss wally, already chelsea gill games from her team shawn macias from our bike group Of course, deputy borough, commissioner jennifer santinez, kimberly, rancourt, colleen, chattergoon and jackie lazaro from my office, as well as our great colleague, leah flax from new york city transit We, are really excited to present the committee with an update on the agency's thinking and plans for fifth avenue.
We were happy that fifth avenue was included in that plan and we convened two community advisory board meetings thus far over the summer to start discussing what those improvements could look like One of the things that we quickly heard from some of you from our elected officials and from other community stakeholders, is that fifth avenue serves a variety of interests and needs not only new yorkers who work there, who live nearby, who commute through it, but also millions upon millions of tourists who come to this most iconic avenue each and every year, and hopefully they'll be back in mass pretty soon.
We presented not only our initial ideas for how a bus way could operate, but also the bones of a complete street for fifth avenue, including both needed pedestrian space, as well as a protected bicycle lane, and we're excited tonight to run through that presentation to give you a sense of what we're thinking for the corridor as we look towards implementing a project later.
The, better buses restart plan was announced among highlighting the critical role that buses have played during the Covid-19 pandemic and as the city adapts and reopens, ridership numbers are still indicating that bus ridership has increased while subway ridership remains low and this furthers a need to provide reliable transit service that prioritizes the bus, especially as we can anticipate people have a greater desire for alternatives to the subway, which will include a shift to buses, bikes, walking war and private vehicles.
You know to complete their journeys more quickly and reliably I'm happy to answer any more questions about bus service if they come up, but with that I think I can hand it back to chelsea flora thanks and right now, continuing Double bus lane was implemented a little bit Yes, I was just saying that we wanted to acknowledge that there have been requests from the community as well.
Ed and others have already acknowledged that this that there are, we have received support from the community previously, when the double bus lane was implemented in 2018 and that there have been longstanding requests for more of a complete street approach, including a protected bike lane in this midtown portion of fifth avenue and all the time we're making sure accommodating the highest pedestrian volumes in this area, especially during the holiday season, and just to elaborate on the complete street approach.
There are multiple opportunities that present themselves on fifth avenue, as we consider how critical it is to improve bus speeds and reliability, create more pedestrian space, safer conditions, adding a protected bike lane and accommodating the vehicle, pickups and drop-offs that take place in such a busy corridor and also finding ways to incorporate beautification efforts with these opportunities.
A complete street approach will provide space to have a dedicated safe area for bikes during the city's recovery and when looking at the vehicle travel speeds, it's useful to think about what traffic typically would look like on fifth avenue and also looking at where we are in the middle of this token.
So now we'd like to present to the board a complete street proposal for fifth avenue just to catch everyone up on where we are since the mayor's announcement, starting with outreach and engagement, a community advisory board or a cab which is made up of the of elected officials.
We are continuing to without evaluate this feedback and suggestions that we're receiving and we'll be meeting with the cab again next month, and even though we are still evaluating all of the possible traffic restrictions in this project area, we know we want to move forward with the safety elements, including the protected bike, lane sanded pedestrian space and the pickup and drop off zones.
Our proposal tonight includes a parking protected bike lane along the corridor by providing dedicated space, we're able to boost safety and better organize the roadway to promote better interactions amongst all street users.
You know we like it won't get started until october, so we'll do our best to get as much as we can in, if not We will install temporary lanes to maintain that space over the winter until we can come back in the spring The next proposed treatment is creating space for pickups and drop off drop-offs and what they're calling pickups and drop-off zones We think these will be on almost every block and the point is to provide space for taxis and other free for higher vehicles to be able to pull over outside of the travel lane and maintain traffic flow Last but not least, we are still looking at strategies to improve bus speeds and reliability.
Some of the strategies that we're considering cyclists that are currently using the bus lanes will be relocated to the new projected bike lane bus lane cameras can be used for enforcement and, of course, we'll continue to monitor the use of the new pickup and drop-off zones can also continue monitoring seasonal traffic and if there needs to be any seasonal traffic restrictions on 5th avenue again, all traffic restrictions are continued to be evaluated and sharing the ways we plan on monitoring.
An office corridor for midtown Manhattan We've heard some really good questions from the local stakeholders who feel that restricting private vehicular traffic at this time could really jeopardize the recovery from Covid-19 You know all options are certainly on the table.
It always needs to serve buses and emergency vehicles and local access as well, but we are seeing whether we're able to restrict more general traffic a little bit more stringently So when the 14th street busway was implemented.
You know this stretch of fifth avenue sure that's another great question and we learned a lot from our experience with 14th street in that respect, and certainly when we launched the 14th street busway, it was not seamless in dealing with the taxi industry and some of the others, the trucking industry and other buses.
Instead of a lot of intense upfront studies like the kinds that we may have done on 14th street That's where this monitoring comes in and where, if we're, if we end up a bus way and those traffic restrictions, are a pilot where we could actually study how those things are working as it goes along and make adjustments as we needed to.
The second item on the agenda tonight is to get an update and learn a little bit more about some of the effects like that from 14th street It was a little bit of a sophie's choice as to whether or not to do get those numbers before we dug into fifth avenue here, but it will I think be useful to see what we learned from 14th street and bring that I think to the next cab meeting final call for any questions from the committee We'll take a look at the questions that have been submitted by the public via the q, a feature there's of course 108 people in attendance tonight For the first time, So ask you to bear with us, but we're going to try to take advantage of the q a feature here and prioritize the questions that have been upvoted by the most members of the public to try and efficiently answer the the questions coming from the most individuals first and and we'll very much see how far we can get in what kind of efficient way I'll just start heading down the the list of q A questions great first question: Why does the bike lane not connect to central park in the north and the protected bike lane on 25th street in the south?
Wasn't the busway supposed to be installed this summer and shouldn't something be implemented before traffic You, know, stakeholders throughout this corridor and beyond, who had legitimate questions and concerns, and it's certainly been beneficial to us and to our teams at DOT to be able to hear those questions, and you know try to work through them to make sure that we are implementing the best possible proposal for fifth avenue and you know I think the inclusion of a complete street plan is a worthy inclusion and it's certainly taken some time to do some of that engineering.
Put them back, That goes in sure, and again we certainly hope and pray not to have to use any interim materials here on fifth avenue or elsewhere for the other projects that we're considering in Manhattan Yes, we've learned a lot since we put out the initial barrels over the summer The next question, protected by lanes and bus lanes, would increase the number of people going through the area who might stop into busi The bus speeds that were mentioned in the spring.
We certainly are aware that many of the bus riders along fifth avenue are coming from outside of Manhattan Those bus riders are very well represented, but we're happy to take any question comment feedback complaint from different community boards or residents throughout the city.
I will say that we have added some camera enforcement on fifth avenue already and we will be looking to do more if we think that is a particular issue or concern I mean, as you should know, pickups and drop-offs are allowed in the bus lane.
110 000 bus riders a day is a huge number of people that come to fifth avenue from all over the city, working in all kinds of jobs, and you know we are trying to make their commutes as easy as possible, encourage people to take public transportation, but we also know that people need to get to all of their businesses via fhv.
You want to address whose job it is so we're hoping that this design will organize the street put cyclists in a space where pedestrians and cyclists expel excuse me and motorists I think that's our overarching goal is to by organizing the street You know creating a space for everyone and improving those interactions in terms of enforcement that does fall on NYPD We present protected bike lane projects, but just as a reminder when we implement those kinds of projects, we see safety benefits for everyone on the street When we're talking about safety, implementing a project like this, we do see as a benefit for pedestrians and cyclists and even motorists.
That was a one-time initiative from the mayor's office to have blm You, know street murals painted across the city, I, guess I, read I read the question Is: Will we be painting over it with the bike and pedestrian space We haven't looked at the detailed design yet for that block, but obviously we'll deal with that really sensitively and consider, but, like jennifer said, By christine correctly, if there's not parking protecting the protected bike lane, will there be any kind of vertical grade change to protect the bike lane from traffic in the spaces where the parking drops we would likely add delineators That would be the vertical element in that space Next question: does it making every car turn at the first intersection create more of a safety hazard?
You speak very briefly at a high level about the principle behind that the principle behind that would be that there would be many fewer vehicles on the corridor in general that only vehicles that actually had business on fifth avenue would typically come to fifth avenue The current bus lanes are in effect, 24 hours a day for any other traffic restrictions that we might employ here, we'll we're still examining that and that's part of what we'll bring back to the cab and to the cb final question: If there will be polls and cameras and signage added all along fifth avenue, what does that mean for the community board's established priority of clear, visual corridors?
Think in the short answer is that we certainly heard some concerns raised about access to their stores for deliveries and other things, but we don't have hard data on the impacts of that on the on those businesses and by hard data you mean like receipts and income data, maybe but or survey data I know that going door-to-door was some of the preliminary work that was done by DOT or sam schwartz, contacted by DOT before the before the bus way was implemented and I was wondering whether that kind of survey of businesses on the corridor was done.
Yet I think I want, at this point to open things up to the committee and see if there are any any particular questions again, knowing that we still have this We have this may report from sam shorts The second report that can be that can be studied Are there, any sort of open or lingering questions for members of the committee that they'd like to direct to DOT at this point, perhaps relative to any questions that we might have brought up the last time we were discussing this with them feel free to raise your hand if you have a question, okay, not seeing any If, if that is continued, if there have been any changes to it, I recognize that enforcement on this stretch might have undergone some pretty significant changes.
, So I think there's a couple questions there, which I think are very valid, given what we've heard the intention of the fifth avenue cab to continue operating in a in a feedback and iteration sort of way, even after it's theoretically implemented, is anything equivalent is an equivalent community advisory board planned for 14th street.
You know, whenever requested on a fairly regular basis prior to sort of prior to Covid-19, at least, and we've done a number of walkthroughs so and we've been constantly responsive to elected officials and everything else, and then the sam schwartz report has provided a lot of the feedback that people were looking for and sort of monitoring people looking for The cabs were acknowledgement that we couldn't do that same thing for these projects that we have been doing for 14th street and I think that the process that we've had for 14 through the boards and other means has been effective, and we can continue to take questions from the community through the board process and I.
