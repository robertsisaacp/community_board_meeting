We have three items in our agenda: tonight: they're, all updates from the department of transportation who has who's joining us here, tonight, we'll be hearing updates on a couple different topics, including the status of the open streets and restaurants, program, which of course, is ongoing, we'll be hearing updates and some follow-up information that we asked DOT to come back to us with regarding data and observations about the 14th street busway, which of course has been underway for many months.
So without further ado, we'll we'll get started with the the first of those items on the agenda, which is an update on fifth avenue and the design process, which I will I'll introduce briefly to provide some context for the members of the committee and There are several elements of improving fifth avenue that we've heard about over the years, including a long-standing desire to continue to add to the city's interconnected bike.
Community board is that commuter five is actually already on the record supporting the addition of a protected bike lane on fifth avenue.
What we're going to see is essentially a an in-progress draft design by DOT, as it attempts to address these multiple changes to fifth avenue, but in a in an eventually comprehensive way, but for for reasons related to the fact that the busway design and conversations are still underway, which will be what we're gonna see, I believe, is very much a work in progress.
So, for that reason, and to kind of set expectations for the for the committee, because the design we're seeing is not final, because the bus way is actually still under discussion and the rules and goals of it aren't finalized yet and because community board five is frankly already on the record relative to the concept of a protected bike.
This month, because it's still in development DOT, will certainly come back to us after the final cab meeting relative to the busway after continuing to design and discuss the rest of the fifth avenue development and continuing to iterate on the kind of complete street design.
You know asking questions from members of the committee and members of the district And I'm sure that DOT is interested to hear our feedback as the design process continues and is.
We were happy that fifth avenue was included in that plan and we convened two community advisory board meetings thus far over the summer to start discussing what those improvements could look.
One of the things that we quickly heard from some of you from our elected officials and from other community stakeholders, is that fifth avenue serves a variety of interests and needs not only new yorkers who work there, who live nearby, who commute through it, but also millions upon millions of tourists who come to this most iconic avenue each and every year, and hopefully, they'll be back in mass.
This is something that community board 5 has long called for a more complete street type, treatment, four fifth avenue and has also been one of the requests from our elected officials.
We presented not only our initial ideas for how a bus way could operate, but also the bones of a complete street for fifth avenue, including both needed pedestrian space, as well as a protected bicycle lane, and we're excited tonight to run through that presentation to give you a sense of what we're thinking for the corridor as we look towards implementing a project later.
In 2017, along with a former member of janet's team, we presented the double busway proposal and I remember getting some pretty strong criticism from this committee and from a lot of members that it failed to include any pedestrian or cyclist improvements.
The, better buses restart plan was announced among highlighting the critical role that buses have played during the Covid-19 pandemic and as the city adapts and reopens, ridership numbers are still indicating that bus ridership has increased while subway ridership remains low and This furthers a need to provide reliable transit service that prioritizes the bus, especially as we can anticipate people have a greater desire for alternatives to the subway, which will include a shift to buses, bikes, walking war and private vehicles.
We just include this to emphasize the role improvements on fifth avenue has for the entire city and communities with limited options to talk more about the daily bus riders who use fifth avenue, I'm, going to hand it over to a colleague at the mta laura who will share a few slides with you all Okay, great hi, I'm, laura azizing from new york city transit Just want to elaborate a bit on the bus service on 5th avenue.
I'm happy to answer any more questions about bus service if they come up, but with that I think I can hand it back to chelsea flora thanks and right now, continuing.
Ed and others have already acknowledged that this that there are, we have received support from the community previously, when the double bus lane was implemented in 2018 and that there have been longstanding requests for more of a complete street approach, including a protected bike lane in this midtown portion of fifth avenue and all the time we're making sure accommodating the highest pedestrian volumes in this area, especially during the holiday season, and just to elaborate on the complete street approach.
There are multiple opportunities that present themselves on fifth avenue, as we consider how critical it is to improve bus speeds and reliability, create more pedestrian.
Space, safer conditions, adding a protected bike lane and accommodating the vehicle, pickups and drop-offs that take place in such a busy corridor and also finding ways to incorporate beautification efforts with these opportunities.
A. Complete street approach will provide space to have a dedicated safe area for bikes during the city's recovery and when looking at the vehicle travel speeds, it's useful to think about what traffic typically would look like on fifth avenue and also looking at where we are in the middle of this token.
So now we'd like to present to the board a complete street proposal for fifth avenue just to catch everyone up on where we are, since the mayor's announcement, starting with outreach and engagement, a community advisory board or a cab which is made up of the of elected officials, cb members, representatives of local institutions, property, owners, transit advocates and bus riders on 5th avenue.
The initial proposal, limited southbound through movement to buses, bikes and emergency vehicles, requiring all others to turn off before 57th street, but still allowed local access for pickup and drop offs just that cars would have to make the next available turn off.
We are continuing to without evaluate this feedback and suggestions that we're receiving and we'll be meeting with the cab again next month, and even though we are still evaluating all of the possible traffic restrictions in this project area, we know we want to move forward with the safety elements, including the protected bike, lane sanded pedestrian space and the pickup and drop off zones.
We will be returning to the cb in September, as well, with any updates on proposed turner, structure, restrictions and a monitoring plan to make the avenue work as well as possible for buses, bikes and pedestrians.
Our proposal tonight includes a parking protected bike lane along the corridor by providing dedicated space, we're able to boost safety and better organize the roadway to promote better interactions amongst all street users.
You, know you're able to set things in the roadway pause and then and then find a gap across the bike lane and make your way to the sidewalk or the pedestrian space next slide.
We think these will be on almost every block, and the point is to provide space for taxis and other free for higher vehicles to be able to pull over outside of the travel lane and maintain traffic flow.
We want to make the existing double bus lanes on fifth avenue work as well as possible.
We benefit from a monitoring system called midtown emotion, which captures traffic congestion and travel times we'll continue to coordinate with colleagues at the mta, reviewing bus speeds and reliability, data and In the meantime, project information can be accessed at this website on new york.
The most helpful schedule will be moving forward on providing updates, but my office attends the transportation committee meeting every month and we're happy to you know provide updates along the way if we need to do something more formal in terms of additional presentations.
First of all, we started off not only this presentation, but the original idea for the project, understanding that fifth avenue is an iconic corridor that serves many different uses, not only all of the pedestrians who walk through the area, both on the avenue and the cross streets.
The whole part of the better buses restart program was to allow us to implement projects before all of the traffic came back so that we would be doing this monitoring instead of a lot of intense upfront studies like the kinds that we may have done on 14th street.
So, that's where this monitoring comes in and where, if we're, if we end up a bus way and those traffic restrictions, are a pilot where we could actually study how those things are working as it goes along and make adjustments as we needed to okay.
It was a little bit of a sophie's choice as to whether or not to do get those numbers before we dug into fifth avenue here, but it will, I think, be useful to see what we learned from 14th street and bring that I think to the next cab meeting final call for any questions from the committee.
Wasn't, the busway supposed to be installed this summer and shouldn't something be implemented before traffic You know, stakeholders throughout this corridor and beyond, who had legitimate questions and concerns, and it's certainly been beneficial to us and to our teams at DOT to be able to hear those questions, and you know, try to work through them to make sure that we are implementing the best possible proposal for fifth avenue, And, you know, I, think the inclusion of a complete street plan is a worthy inclusion and it's certainly taken some time to do some of that engineering.
We've learned a lot since we put out the initial barrels over the summer The next question, protected by lanes and bus lanes, would increase the number of people going through the area who might stop into busi.
I. Do think that you know we we're absolutely looking at ways to improve bus service throughout the city.
Those bus riders are very well represented, but we're happy to take any question comment feedback complaint from different community boards or residents throughout the city.
Right now we are trying to get through a lot of the early planning stages meeting with the cab, making sure that the cross sections that we're working towards make sense- You know a little later in this process, but I think could be included in this plan and just to note that, generally, we have gotten a lot of requests for increased bike parking as buildings anticipate folks coming back to work on bike, so we are working on expanding our bike parking, around.
I will say that we have added some camera enforcement on fifth avenue already and we will be looking to do more if we think that is a particular issue or concern, I mean, as you should know, pickups and drop-offs are allowed in the bus lane.
110 000 bus riders a day is a huge number of people that come to fifth avenue from all over the city, working in all kinds of jobs, and you know we are trying to make their commutes as easy as possible, encourage people to take public transportation.
So this complete street proposal is really trying to balance out all of the means of the corridor in the best way possible to make it work for everyone, thanks.
The cab is evaluating, separated from the rest of the complete street proposal, so I think one of the challenges here is that we're looking to install a bike, lane, Be it temporary or permanent, and some pedestrian, space.
While we still are looking at the corridor holistically We work through some of the other concerns, we've heard and tried to just come up with the best plan for the bus as well feel free to add anything to that D.O.T. Okay, thanks next question is how will adding these painted lanes affect the black lives matter, mural, currently painted on 5th avenue?
That's part of what we'll bring back to the cab and to the cb final question: If there will be polls and cameras and signage added all along fifth avenue, Does that mean for the community board's established priority of clear, visual corridors?
We'll continue to try to do better and improve on this process as well, but with that we'll we'll wrap up this agenda item talking about fifth avenue thanks again to DOT and thanks again to all the members of the public who participated in it with that we'll go to what I believe should be much briefer.
We sent a couple questions along in advance, not sure if you want to speak at all to to those questions and whether or not you had any thoughts on addressing them and some of the data that we had talked about in the past in terms of continuing to assess, 14th street sure I think there were just a few questions about the busway and so just to speak generally, as you may know, DOT, through our through the consultant, sam schwartz engineering, released two monitoring ports monitoring reports about the busway, each, which showed really positive results for the busway pilot.
By hard data you mean like receipts and income data, maybe but or survey data I know that going door-to-door was some of the preliminary work that was done by DOT or sam schwartz, contacted by DOT before the before the bus way was implemented, and I was wondering whether that kind of survey of businesses on the corridor was done.
Are there, any sort of open or lingering questions for members of the committee that they'd like to direct to DOT at this point, perhaps relative to any questions that we might have brought up the last time we were discussing this with them feel free to raise your hand if you have a question: okay, not seeing any.
, So I think there's a couple questions there, which I think are very valid, given what we've heard the intention of the fifth avenue cab to continue operating in a in a feedback and iteration sort of way, even after it's theoretically, implemented, is Anything equivalent is an equivalent community advisory board planned for 14th street.
The cabs were acknowledgement that we couldn't do that same thing for these projects that we have been doing for 14th, street, and I think that the process that we've had for 14 through the boards and other means has been effective and we can continue to take questions from the community through the board.
Don't have specific data on that ej, But you know generally, traffic volumes right now are lower due to the pandemic, but if there are any questions about certain congested areas, we could take a look.
You know like a 12 to 15 foot, emergency lane, I'm, not quite sure what the specific example is here, but If there are questions or if there's a restaurant owner or a restaurant group, that's asking you can connect them with myself And There are the open streets that were you know, selected by DOT and announced by the mayor.
