The first two items were that the committee wanted to briefly touch base on current status of two different issues, and you know I want to invite members of the committee who have concerns or observations about either of these things to feel free to bring them up, because I think we just kind of want to do as much fact-finding as possible and also invite folks from D-O-T who may have answers to some of our questions too, to feel free to answer that as well.
So again just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone does have any new information for the committee that we can kind of pool in terms of our collective knowledge, hi EJ, their street closures on 8th Avenue and 35th 36, and then I was near Bryant Park yesterday and there are definite street closures from like 40 streets, 43rd, Street, bored streets and 6th Avenue, okay, pedestrian street closures or, if you were I, saw a couple that had to show or say that they lived on that block in order to be led boom.
This was PD who's doing in have the board reached out to the local priests and to get more information or you folks, at DoD, the mayor's office I believe we tried to contact the precincts That's been occurring, and my guess is that it's all related to the protests in Manhattan, but if I'm not mistaken, you're, probably talking about local law 24, which is the closure of a particular streets or streets in the city in which you know we understand that their protests related, but you know wondering some of the more specifics about how long that'll last and to what degree they have notified the community or do t as they've as they've been doing it I've heard over the weekend that the pedestrian street closures are potentially going to be upgraded and made more secure and more permanent?
I'm left to work through that through we're still working on how exactly the enforcement is gonna play out, trying to be a little bit creative, potentially using some kind of ambassadors as well as obviously, if, depending on the severity of the issue, we would be working with PD and FDNY Okay thanks and then for eventually the street seating right in assuming that could those places could eventually be identified as streets that are currently part of the pedestrianisation closures, as well as say any of the future streets that you decide to add to the program exactly so any place where we have interests in an existing open, street?
and you know at this point I invite folks who aren't on the committee , so I apologize, I had to join late, but I was joining because I have a lot of concern about with the second that the open streets I mean the expanded outdoor dining plan was released.
I think it's that we of course, as do see, were focused on the sort of Street limitations and how and the street safety So that's why we direct folks to other resources which, quite honestly, if you're, opening a restaurant at this point , you should probably be reviewing the state's guidelines anyhow, rather than just this particular program, which applies only to seating in the street and on the sidewalk So I would expect that anyone trying to open a restaurant would be reviewing those other guidelines elsewhere , I'm using restaurant owners I'm talking about existing restaurant owners right existing restaurant owners who are opening up seating, which they have not been able to do over the past several months right, it's been takeout only so there's a lot of guidelines out there for how to reopen your business following the requirements of Phase two, not from D-O-T no guidance requirements.
This is a way to important issue to consider that you know, because somebody else is doing it It's enough, so just to reiterate the link on our page to the SBS restaurant reopening guide, which goes through what operators must do before opening summary of guidelines and health and safety, and that sort of thing there, which is really not My comment you may want to consider, although it is not the narrow application of duties for you to add some language, because this is a very serious issue and the public and businesses need guidelines and guidance and leadership , I think I would say: I Think I would second that as well.
This is a very new program, like I said it's on a very accelerated timeline, so these are issues that we are hearing Can. Everybody hear me yes, great, so I'm with the Fifth Avenue Association and first I'd like to say Kimberly It's, a difficult feat, so appreciate your efforts going through all this from an operational standpoint, these restaurants are going to need to be serviced both getting deliveries and trash hauls Will there be a consistent time that streets are going to be closed or is it sort of block by block or You mean that dining will be closed or You know, for instance, when deliveries and carting services that are gonna be needing to access a lot of these spots.
The closures will be limited to maybe the evenings, but in terms of street closures, how that's going to affect operations so I think you're getting at one of the challenges that we have right now overall, at do is he which is trying to manage a lot of the different demands, especially the curb space, which is always a challenge for us, but is especially challenging right now, as we're getting asked to provide more pedestrian space, more space for bikes make sure buses are moving quickly and accommodate deliveries as businesses come back and add outdoor dining So as far as open streets.
Those fans of activities are always allowed to happen on them at the moment, because local traffic for deliveries and pickups or services are is allowed if they are At. This point: all open streets are accessible for trash pickup and deliveries As far as what happens when a street that may have a lot of restaurants on it, limited-access at the curb for deliveries, I think it's something we're gonna have to work through, as we see it sort of on a block by block in situation level, because this is something very new to us, and maybe it means that in certain streets it's best, you have to try to create an open, Street there, so that there's less through traffic and more ability to do deliveries, but it's definitely an ongoing process and figuring out how it works.
Many of the streets of tents with travel lanes simultaneous with shared lanes, which can feel narrow when they're used also as a shared bike lane The streets could be overall that are organized and updated with in terms of the regulations to have better use of the curb and more efficient loading space Finally, if there's no dedicated space for cyclists, any lanes that go on cross town streets in this section are generally shared lanes which are frequently blocked As. You can see in some of the photos and both of these photos actually show cyclists traveling in the shared lane on 39th Street, which, when conditions are congested, it's not the most comfortable bicycle facility, and so some of the factors we took into consideration for route selection are similar to our other products in terms of continuity of the streets connectivity to the first avenue bike lane But a new factor was the network challenges of the street grid.
There are a lot of issues that the tunnel access points So. We prioritized connecting all the way through from 11th Avenue to the first avenue bike lane so in the eastbound direction, starting at the South 36th Street overlaps with the main entrance and exit points to the Midtown Tunnel on the east side, any further south than that, and it's a little too close to the 26 and 29th street pair Half mile spacing of the routes to the north.
The parking protector design does require the removal of approximately ten spaces per block on average to accommodate day lighted, intersection, designs and also mid block, no standing any time zones for emergency clearance , The bike lane would run along with South curved, with the rush hour lane along the north curb and would involve similar parking changes to 38th in terms of the day lighting and so to summarize, the existing capacity allows for two travel lanes and 2 loading lanes throughout the entire day and during the peak period.
Some of the tools that we've used on our other projects include those curb regulation updates, either shortening the duration or changing the time frames, also using markings such as no standing any to maintain emergency access or clearance for large vehicles at specific locations Finally, the special markings we've been using at locations such as hotel loading zones, schools, health centers theaters, have really helped to highlight locations where there's frequent passenger pick-up and drop-off needs The, intersection, designs included in our proposal will improve efficiency at the intersections through three different design.
So when we work on our proposals, we review them with the fire department to talk about emergency access along the corridors, and although our off-peak design will take the lane down to a single traveling, it would include markings that I indicate no standing any time allowing for people to have an extra space to pull over and out of the way if there's some passing - but as I mentioned earlier, This will also have two lanes open during the peak period during the day time period.
I want to make sure and want to have the confidence that you know we're not creating a problem for the very unlikely, hopefully a situation where we would need to evacuate the whole island its if I could just chime in for a second That said, one of the big differences between this design and that stop the other things that you've seen in Midtown is that we've been we've really gone to one lane in most places here we're keeping the two lanes, because this is such an important corridor to move vehicles on, for some of the reasons like you're.
It's, interesting that you say that, because there has been a lot of success and people have looked at these in bikers, like them, but I think there are other places of the city, especially north of here, where we've heard some interesting, so I'll just throw that in as a caveat, but it's not in you're, not in Midtown That makes sense, and you detailed why 38 and 39 were the most obvious or most amenable corridors for slotting, something in between the 20s and the 50s, which makes sense so, though, as you've detailed comes with some additional caveats, such as the desire to not go down to a single lane of traffic for this corridor for the whole day.
As a committee we'll take it into a committee discussion to talk about what, if any actions the committee wants to take right now, I'll simply start the discussion by pointing out you know, as I just said, we have for all these other for all the other bike lanes that have been installed over the last two or three years The committee has generally and with a lot of consensus, approved the general concept and execution of all of them, usually with for the almost boilerplate, with four resolves for four stipulations.
So, you know, I'll just put a pin in that, but generally we do call on enforcement of the existing laws to help We generally call on deity to do as much outreach and teaching of good cycling behavior as possible, which often also calls on D-O-T to expand the street ambassadors program to as much as possible again understanding that funding is always an issue to encourage good cycling, behavior and teach the rules of the road again , hopefully maximize success as much as possible, so I sort of just want to lay out what we usually do for the committee I With that being said, does anyone on the committee have any other thoughts that would preclude us from talking about the way that we have been talking about the other elements of Midtown, crosstown, protected bike lanes or any thoughts in general, not seeing any hands from the committee?
Any, one from the committee still on the call with me Don't, it's important that you know this bike lane gets executed because it's just I think this makes sense, along with our other, like resolutions, understanding that this is an interesting time for a city and a number of ways, but I don't see why those current issues and future issue should impact what this made us So for that data cost fashion Are there any other thoughts from the committee or otherwise any motions relative to the template resolution, as I sort of laid it out, not a hand from jewel.
It doesn't mean that it's permanent in the exact same condition that it is right now, but we did see really good numbers over the months when it was first installed and then, of course, we've had have not been able to collect data in the same way that we were during the first several months, and so we're happy to feel questions about that as far as fifth avenue we're looking to do something similar, but obviously the roadway is very different We don't have a final plan yet and we will be looking to set up a Community, Advisory, Board and cert meetings as soon as next week to take bring people together.
The main piece right of a bus way that distinguishes it from a bus lane or from some other treatment, is the limitation of traffic traveling through on Fifth Avenue I think we would start from is obviously maintaining buses along 4th Avenue truck traffic, having a transit truck priority street like what we have on 14th Street Maintaining local access in the area, and a lot of that is done initially can be done with signage and then, as we kind of see how the traffic pattern adjusts and as people are, you know, starting to travel, more We have kind of a sense of how the area is behaving, and then we have, you know more capacity on Fifth Avenue to do other things as well.
It would be good if there was some community input about where those bus stops are, but also keeping in mind that if we're gonna have a bus way having the bus stops adjacent or next to the subway entrances was a principle that had generally been regarded as an important one by elderly, but also people with mobility challenges thanks Sam Noah are there plans to change the existing bus infrastructure in terms of I know when the 14th Street bus way was implemented both of the 14 a and the 14 D were converted to a select bus, service?
Can we do now about the tremendous increase in traffic on our one lane of traffic Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and I- It's a question for the community board and for the Transportation Committee of exactly what actions you will take to either remediate or reverse the situation So in terms of data that we received.
T is data from 14th Street going to be an integral part of the planning process and the community council meetings that you will set up is that something is that data, something that can be reviewed in that venue for the community that sort of feels like they see a disconnect with the data Their experience on side streets between their experience and the and the data that you kind of continue to see and collect relative to the side streets, I, Let Allison speaks of looking at that data in the context of Fifth Avenue Just note that we did have two quarterly reports that are still available on sensuousness website, so you are able to go and access data, and also that we did collect a lot of public feedback through business surveys and community surveys and to this regular interaction from folks.
It was after the first one, so we should definitely take the opportunity offline to dig into the second one, but we would also very much appreciate I think to Buzz's point, perhaps two months from now, when our committee is back in session, for whatever it is, the August cycle, maybe getting a readout on what you learned from the code from the progressive to quarterly reports, and maybe whether or not more data is helping to explain more of what residents are seeing on those side streets and then, certainly, if you want to put in the no right turn as Bosley just makes everyone happy So anyway, you know I'll, throw it back to the to the committee one more time to see if there are any other thoughts at this at this point in time and I'd like to get a sense of whether the committee thinks that as well, BJ Both the comments from the community as well as you know, people who are upset about it.
Think I'd have to be able to give you better answers when we have like a full agenda item with maybe a presentation and some folks from our 14 suite team The second piece was the Well: we've been engaging with the community for a while on 14th Street, so we it's in a different place than 5th Avenue, which we're just kicking off and looking for ways to engage over the accelerated timeframe and during the summer, when we don't have our standard or more standard that community Ford process, Please contact me It may be a mix of things.
For example: we've talked with folks at site, visits and other times about potentially making changes to University Place, which might include like a reversal of a block or something like that and that would have to go to the community board, would C be to other things like parking regulation, Please, sorry, children that we might, that really are responsive to things that we have been hearing that maybe it might make sense for us to do before community board and to the other question at least as far as fifth avenue is concerned and I, said officials, our community board and stakeholders from on the corridor, be it property owners or others and like to get some representation from West writers, as well?
I know we've passed that topic, but the fact that he doesn't know what's going on and has not been spoken to is really troubling to me, because Gayle has come before our committee and before the full board many times to be heard by D-O-T, so I'm asking is there a way that we can get a list of the community members that do T is reaching out to regarding the 14th Street bus, way?
They can't continue down the corridor and you know we want to make sure that we also consider pickup drop-off areas on both sides of the street I think that's something we want to look carefully at block by block kind of acknowledging that every block is a little different and just making sure you know that we are meeting the needs of where people need to be where they need to access where they need to pick up.
You know there's no traffic right now, even though we hear that you know, car axis is going to be allowed, I mean to allow a car to go one block or one and a half blocks is really not the answer along Fifth Avenue It's, a wider one-way street, so I just want to You know throw that out as you as you proceed, and also just remind everyone that the parking were is an essential business even under the under the governor's guidance, because parking garages have now been parking essential employees for all these months: doctors, nurses, law enforcement and other people that work in the essential businesses that are open and now that other businesses, starting to slowly reopen We, just need a place for these people to park.
I also just want to point out and say thank you to the committee members and D-O-T for being here for what has been a little bit of a lengthy and but substantive committee meeting : we've, one more topic on the on the agenda on the website and then, as the committee members know, we want to discuss potential principles to hand off to one of our peer committees, but right now we'll let D-O-T talk about pedestrian hands myths around Central, Park, South and Grand Army Plaza We have books from our pedestrian unit Almost everyone from duty tonight who are gonna talk about our proposal to make some changes in the area and such a Park South and Grand Army, Plaza building and some other previous work that was done in the area, so I believe it's me, I was gonna.
Already we really shouts of a Plaza Hotel and we plan to meet with them and discuss the proposal and talk through issues in the area, but we usually come to the committee boards first with our proposal and then meet with stakeholders like that Like a traffic circulation perspective, there were some things that they wanted, like making 6th Avenue to way, and things like that We also are continuing to discuss.
If, you go hey I'll, go ahead with the bus way and would make sure that this plan doesn't take away any options from that I think that's an excellent point and matches a theme where we always prefer a holistic and comprehensive look about how any changes affect the options and the overall traffic network of streets in the entire district That is also something that I think would be extremely appropriate to put in our resolution and condition our approval on So. Seeing no other comments from folks who aren't on the committee will kind of move explicitly into our committee business session right now, Regarding this topic and I.
There are different levels inside of NYPD right now, for example, there are certain units that are only allowed to give parking citations There is precedent for making sure that the right enforcement is equipped for them for the right situation that they're going to go into I : I'd, open it up to the committee as to whether or not we want to draw any harder, fast lines in this Would you mind if I jump in with a specific purpose proposed addition that people can react to or for work?
