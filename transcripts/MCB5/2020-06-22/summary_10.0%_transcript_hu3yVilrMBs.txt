First two items were that the committee wanted to briefly touch base on current status of two different issues, and You know I want to invite members of the committee who have concerns or observations about either of these things to feel free to bring them up, because I think we just kind of want to do as much fact- finding as possible and also invite folks from D- Who may have answers to some of our questions too, to feel free to answer that as well.
First issue is the street closures that have been noticed by many people and reported in media outlets like Gothamist outside of NYPD precincts right, now.
So again just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone does have any new information for the committee that we can kind of pool in terms of our collective knowledge, hi EJ, their street closures on 8th Avenue and 35Th 36, and then I was near Bryant Park.
Today, as the city went into phase two we're all inside on the internet, right now, so I do not know how many, how many of us have gotten the chance to say, experience it yet or take a real look at them at how it's going my understanding from reading the rules Is that three scenarios are allowed starting today previously certified sidewalks eating backyard, patios and curb Lane parking, Lane seating It's not only previously a proof, sidewalk, cafes.
It's, also sort of the application process that opened last Friday under open restaurants allows for businesses to request or apply to use sidewalk space, even if they do not have a pre- existing from it and curb lane.
Understandably, so, as people are trying to, you know, get their businesses back up and running at this point, we're limiting it to the space and directly in front of your establishment.
You, know the state etc that you need to be following right: now, so that you, as a business, you know, have a one, stop shop for all the rules, to make sure that your customers are safe, You were opening outdoor seating in a backyard- The current text for the plan on do tees website does not mention adhering to the state's guidelines or requirements.
We know that not all restaurant owners are lawyers or legal experts or and can spend a lot of time, understanding the intricacies of all the different jurisdictions that they do need to follow.
That kind of thing sort of gets abandoned when all the different groups can and agencies know that they're only a sliver of the jurisdiction, there, but I think we'd, encourage you folks to potentially find a way to provide summary.
Will there be a consistent time that streets are going to be closed or is it sort of block by block Or You mean that dining will be closed Or So you know, for instance, when deliveries and carting services that are going to be needing to access a lot of these spots.
Getting at one of the challenges that we have right now, overall, at do is he which is trying to manage a lot of the different demands, especially the curb space, which is always a challenge for us, but is especially challenging right now, as we're getting asked to provide more pedestrian, space, more space for bikes, make sure buses are moving quickly and accommodate deliveries as businesses come back and add outdoor dining.
Far as what happens when a street that may have a lot of restaurants on it, limited- access at the curb for deliveries, I think it's something we're going to have to work through, as we see it, sort of on a block by block in situation level, because this is something very new to us, and maybe it means that in certain streets, it's best.
If there's outdoor dining on the street, you know where you're, seeing a larger sort, But I, guess that's really more of a question for NYPD, but a good question and we'll continue to have conversations with them.
Meeting about the temporary bike lane we heard there was interest in learning more about what our plans are to build that out in more permanent materials, and so we're happy to be here tonight and be able to share that proposal with you of course, builds on our past work, I'm, 26:29, 52nd and 55th, as well as 12 and 13th streets.
The routes are spaced evenly apart, every half mile throughout Midtown, from Union Square up to Central Park and as Convention we installed twelve thirteen, twenty six and twenty ninth streets in 2018 and last year installed 52nd and 55th streets, and so we found that the new lanes in the 50s and the 20s resulted in an increase of cyclists using the lanes from vehicle travel times.
When conditions are congested, it's not the most comfortable, bicycle facility, and so some of the factors we took into consideration for route selection are similar to our other products in terms of continuity of the streets connectivity to the First Avenue Bike Lane.
We prioritized connecting all the way through from 11Th Avenue to the First Avenue Bike Lane, so in the eastbound direction, starting at the South 36Th Street overlaps with the main entrance and exit points to the Midtown Tunnel on the east side, any further south than that, and it's a little too close to the 26 and 29th street pair Half mile spacing of the routes to the North 40Th Street Has challenges such as the Lincoln Tunnel entrance, which you see the aerial image of it's a very complex, lock to cross as a cyclist and also just generally, yes.
This was a quick installation and since our last update in May, we have returned to the location and installed markings in terms of long lines and also bicycle symbols to indicate and clarify the expectations how users come Street users can park on this road, and so the barrels are in need of ongoing maintenance and our staff visit the location on a nearly daily basis to shift barrels back into place, speak to businesses and drivers, and also post additional signs as needed, and so getting into our proposal.
Both streets between 8th Avenue to Madison Avenue have to travel veins and two passing lanes, and our proposal includes the same parking protected bike, lane design that we've used before, and that also mirrors what we've started with you: temporary lanes.
The difference is that there will be two travel lanes during the peak period and so the second lane on the opposite side of the bike lane the opposite curve of the bike lane would be converted to a rush hour travel lane, which means that loading and parking is still available overnight and off- peak, and we also heard the concern the last time we spoke that there is no traffic in this area.
There is interest, especially from specific businesses, and just a highlight again that what we have seen a lot of is that even when there's available loading space, so people still double Park, and so our proposal will really help to encourage from a more efficient use of the street space.
One is the split phases which offer a separated space for cyclists to travel, the offset crossings which helps to calm turning vehicles and open up sight lines between pedestrians, drivers and cyclists, and the third is installing additional right turn Bay's, which is the side away from the bike lane at locations that need additional capacity.
This image shows an example of what the offset crossing typical has looked like on most of our crosstown bike lanes, and you can see that the vertical elements help to slow turning vehicles as they approach, cyclists and pedestrians, and so to give some additional context on what the routes the proposed routes look like, as we continue to the East and to the west to see before and Cv6.
And then can you speak to the Hudson River, because I know that on 11th Avenue, just south of 42Nd Street, there's always a large traffic jams of people trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel.
So when we work on our proposals, we review them with the fire department to talk about emergency access along the corridors, and although our off- peak design will take the lane down to a single traveling, it would include markings that I indicate no standing any time allowing for people to have an extra space to pull over and out of the way.
That said, one of the big differences between this design and that stop the other things that you've seen in Midtown is that we've been we've really gone to one lane in most places here: We're keeping the two lanes, because this is such an important corridor to move vehicles on, for some of the reasons like you're, exactly saying.
This is wrong, but this sort of completes the set of protected bike, lanes, spaced at half miles for Midtown going acrosss town, and so you know If I'm understanding this correctly, you would not be aiming to slot in more Midtown crossed acrosss time protected bike corridors following this one.
It's, interesting that you say that, because there has been a lot of success and people have looked at these in bikers, like them, but I think there are other places of the city, especially north of here, where we've heard some interesting, so I'll just throw that in as a caveat, but it's not in you're, not in Midtown, That's.
So not seeing any hands raised right, now, I'll kind of ask one final question with all these other proposed bike lanes that we've that you guys have come to tell us about in the past, including the 20s, the 50s 6Th Avenue, 8th, Avenue, we've passed a resolution.
If any actions, the committee wants to take right, now, I'll, simply start the discussion by pointing out you know, as I just said.
We generally call on deity to do as much outreach and teaching of good cycling behavior as possible, which often also calls on D- O- T, to expand the street ambassadors program to as much as possible again understanding that funding is always an issue to encourage good, cycling, behavior and teach the rules of the road again, hopefully maximize success as much as possible, so I sort of just want to lay out what we usually do for the committee.
You know generally personally think that this does kind of complete the set of what do T has been pursuing over the last several years in terms of crosstown bike, lanes.
It's important that you know this bike lane gets executed because it's just It's dangerous for cyclists to ride in one of the one of the city's busiest areas that I've almost gotten in an accident numerous times from cars, just thinking that they can speed and ignore whatever is going on right beside them, so I think it's a good prop.
I think this makes sense, along with our other, like resolutions, understanding that this is an interesting time for a city and a number of ways.
But we did see really good numbers over the months when it was first installed and then, of course, we've had have not been able to collect data in the same way that we were during the first several months, and so we're happy to feel questions about that as far as fifth avenue we're looking to do something similar, but obviously the roadway is very different.
The main piece right of a bus way that distinguishes it from a bus lane or from some other treatment, is the limitation of traffic traveling through on Fifth Avenue.
I think we would start from is obviously maintaining buses along 4Th Avenue truck traffic, having a transit truck priority Street like what we have on 14th Street.
Maintaining local access in the area, and a lot of that is done initially can be done with signage and then, as we kind of see how the traffic pattern adjusts and as people are, you know, starting to travel, more.
I'll just say for myself: that, given the calendar, given the time that we're in and given how quickly it sounds like this process is going to move, we would certainly appreciate being involved in the Community Advisory Council, since there is not say a proposal for us to assess and vote on tonight, and there would not be that opportunity before it gets implemented.
I think we need to learn from what happened on 14Th Street, most specifically, some of the some of the education issues and some of the situation's of, like you, said elderly residents not able to get a get a yellow cab, not able to get an uber or a ride share of any kind.
It would be good if there was some community input about where those bus stops are, but also keeping in mind that, if we're going to have a bus way having the bus stops adjacent or next to The. Subway entrances was a principle that had generally been regarded as an important one by elderly, but also People with mobility challenges thanks Sam Noah.
This is this is a question via t, but are there plans to change the existing bus infrastructure in terms of I know when the 14Th Street bus way was implemented both of the 14 a and the 14 D were converted to a select bus, service?
Can we do now about the tremendous increase in traffic on our one lane of traffic Street between Fifth and Sixth, Avenues and I- It's a question for the Community Board and for the Transportation Committee of exactly what actions you will take to either remediate or reverse the situation.
Just note that we did have two quarterly reports that are still available on sensuousness website, so you are able to go and access data, and also that we did collect a lot of public feedback through business surveys and community surveys and to this regular interaction from folks, Just, add that, but Allison I want you to speak to, but using that data for Fifth Avenue and how that works.
You know between what we might see in the data and on paper and isolated issues that people are seeing on the corridor, so I think the CA B will give us a good way for Fifth Avenue to address that.
That leads me to think that we have two main avenues, one in terms of fifth Street, sorry, fifth avenue to participate as much as feasible in the Community Advisory Board, as that goes forward to try to use what has been learned from 14th Street and to have a voice via that planning vehicle.
It was after the first one, so we should definitely take the opportunity offline to dig into the second one, but we would also very much appreciate I think to Buzz's point, perhaps two months from now, when our committee is back in session, for whatever it is, the August cycle, maybe getting a readout on what you learned from the code from the progressive to quarterly reports, and maybe whether or not more data is helping to explain more of what residents are seeing on those side, streets and then, certainly.
And I'd like to get a sense of whether the committee thinks that as well, BJ You might not know this yet from the Department of Transportation, but based on the 14th Street weather.
Okay, no worries I'm, going to go to committee member Nancy Regarding the 14th Street bus, way.
I know, we've passed that topic, but the fact that he does not know what's going on and has not been spoken to is really troubling to me, because Gayle has come before our committee and before the full board many times to be heard by D, O- T, so I'm asking is there a way that we can get a list of the community members that do T is reaching out to regarding the 14th Street bus, way?
If any, ongoing community engagement looks like on the 14th Street bus way.
I think you know our plan was to have more quarterly reports and that involved, probably more discussion with folks at the community board some more opportunities to give feedback.
You say guarantee at this point that taxis and cars will theoretically be able to turn on for one block to make pickups and drop- offs similar to 14Th Street, or is everything more or less up in the air pending the planning process that you talked about as far as I know, No intention of removing local access.
They can't continue down the corridor And You know we want to make sure that we also consider pickup drop- Off areas on both sides of the street.
We want to look carefully at block by block kind of acknowledging that every block is a little different and just making sure you know that we are meeting the needs of where people need to be where they need to access where they need to pick up.
Even, though we hear that you know, car axis is going to be allowed, I mean to allow a car to go one block or one and a half blocks is really not the answer along Fifth Avenue It's, a wider one- way street, so I just want to.
As the committee members know, we want to discuss potential principles to hand off to one of our peer committees, but right now we'll let D- O- T talk about pedestrian hands myths around Central, Park, South and Grand Army Plaza.
Almost everyone from duty tonight who are going to talk about our proposal to make some changes in the area and such a Park South and Grand Army, Plaza building and some other previous work that was done in the area, so I believe it's me.
Looking at our the markings that we're going to be putting in on the East Drive hack stand we're going to be moving the pedestrian boarding area to be adjacent to that center, Median there, which is how its operating now And we're, also going to be installing a curb extension on the southwest corner of 60Th, Street and 5Th Avenue at sixth Avenue.
We also installed a horse only lane on the North curb of Central Park south and the curb regulation here is no standing any time, but it is frequently blocked by cars and buses, as you can see in this photo looking south to 58th Street, the CitiBike station acrosss, the street from the Plaza Hotel constricts, pedestrian movement here, and there is often illegal standing on the along the edge of the space.
We have a missing crosswalk here on the east side of this intersection, and we also have an underutilized, no standing in time space on the north, curb of 58th Street between Grand Army, Plaza and Fifth Avenue.
We really shouts of a Plaza Hotel and we plan to meet with them and discuss the proposal and talk through issues in the area, but we usually come to the committee boards first with our proposal and then meet with stakeholders like that.
If, you go, hey I'll, go ahead with the bus way and would make sure that this plan does not take away any options from that I think that's an excellent point and matches a theme where we always prefer a holistic and comprehensive look about how any changes affect the options and the overall traffic network of streets in the entire district.
You know folks, who have spoken up so far, seem to generally be supportive of these pedestrian enhancements with say some stipulations like Joel mentioned, examining whether or not time to lights are appropriate, suggesting that do T move forward with plans to talk to stakeholders like by the hotel that our pool will be conditioned on going to landmarks as well and considering network effect.
So, with all of that have and said, you know, I, see this as a as a as a scoped statement about what we think what we think the principle is, a good enforcement would look like and why we think that again, without getting into solutions and without getting into saying that the laws should actually be different than they are now That's how we can you know without stuffing out of our lane as a Transportation Committee Have, the most positive help The Becks committee, the most without stepping into their turf, as they have that discussion.
Think As, a committee and, like you said, we called on NYPD to enforce things.
I do not think we're moving towards a towards a vote here, but certainly if there are other thoughts or requested edits to this statement, you know feel free to feel free to speak up now, but otherwise- We present it female to Renee and the Becks committee folks, who want to the way that we had a lot of visitors tonight can certainly tune into the Backs Committee tomorrow and see how that discussion goes and participate.
Had a discussion with EJ a few days back that the starting to work on this- And, you know my sentiment to EJ- was that I felt that we as a community board, like most community boards, had some complicity in the way in which the NYPD has treated people of color in our city.
