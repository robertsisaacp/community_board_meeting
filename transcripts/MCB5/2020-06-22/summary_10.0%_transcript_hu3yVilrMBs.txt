First two items were that the committee wanted to briefly touch base on current status of two different issues, and You know I want to invite members of the committee who have concerns or observations about either of these things to feel free to bring them up, because I think we just kind of want to do as much fact-finding as possible and also invite folks from D-O-T who may have answers to some of our questions, too, to feel free to answer that as well.
First issue is the street closures that have been noticed by many people and reported in media outlets like Gothamist outside of NYPD precincts right, now.
So again just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone does have any new information for the committee that we can kind of pool in terms of our collective knowledge, hi EJ, their street closures on 8th Avenue and 35th 36, and then I was near Bryant Park.
It's, also sort of the application process that opened last Friday under open restaurants allows for businesses to request or apply to use sidewalk space, even if they don't have a pre-existing from it and curb lane.
Understandably so, as people are trying to, you know, get their businesses back up and running at this point, we're limiting it to the space and directly in front of your establishment.
You know the state etc that you need to be following right: now, so that you, as a business, you know, have a one-stop shop for all the rules to make sure that your customers are safe, I, think what we have at the moment is links on the website, along with our guidelines that lay out like that connect to those requirements, and if, for example.
We know that not all restaurant owners are lawyers or legal experts or and can spend a lot of time, understanding the intricacies of all the different jurisdictions that they do need to follow.
That kind of thing sort of gets abandoned when all the different groups can and agencies know that they're only a sliver of the jurisdiction, there, but I think we'd, encourage you folks to potentially find a way to provide summary.
Will there be a consistent time that streets are going to be closed or is it sort of block by block Or You mean that dining will be closed or So you know, for instance, when deliveries and carting services that are gonna be needing to access a lot of these spots.
Getting at one of the challenges that we have right now overall, at do is he which is trying to manage a lot of the different demands, especially the curb space, which is always a challenge for us, but is especially challenging right now, as we're getting asked to provide more pedestrian, space, more space for bikes, make sure buses are moving quickly and accommodate deliveries as businesses come back and add outdoor dining.
Far as what happens when a street that may have a lot of restaurants on it, limited-access at the curb for deliveries, I, think it's something we're gonna have to work through, as we see it sort of on a block by block in situation level, because this is something very new to us, and maybe it means that in certain streets, it's best.
Meeting about the temporary bike lane we heard there was interest in learning more about what our plans are to build that out in more permanent materials, and so we're happy to be here tonight and be able to share that proposal with you of course, builds on our past work, I'm, 26, 29, 52nd and 55th, as well as 12 and 13th streets.
When conditions are congested, it's not the most comfortable, bicycle facility, and so some of the factors we took into consideration for route selection are similar to our other products in terms of continuity of the streets connectivity to the first avenue bike, lane.
We prioritized connecting all the way through from 11th Avenue to the first avenue bike lane so in the eastbound direction, starting at the South 36th Street overlaps with the main entrance and exit points to the Midtown Tunnel on the east side, any further south than that, and it's a little too close to the 26 and 29th street pair Half mile spacing of the routes to the north.
This was a quick installation and since our last update in May, we have returned to the location and installed markings in terms of long lines and also bicycle symbols to indicate and clarify the expectations how users come Street users can park on this road, and so the barrels are in need of ongoing maintenance and our staff visit the location on a nearly daily basis to shift barrels back into place, speak to businesses and drivers, and also post additional signs as needed, and so getting into our proposal.
Both streets between 8th Avenue to Madison Avenue have to travel veins and two passing lanes, and our proposal includes the same parking protected, bike, lane design that we've used before and that also minors.
What we've started with you temporary lanes, but the difference is that there will be two travel lanes during the peak period and so the second lane on the opposite side of the bike lane the opposite curve of the bike lane would be converted to a rush hour travel lane, which means that loading and parking is still available overnight and off-peak, and we also heard the concern the last time we spoke that there is no traffic in this area.
If, there is interest, especially from specific businesses, and just a highlight again that what we have seen a lot of is that even when there's available loading space, so people still double Park, and so our proposal will really help to encourage from a more efficient use of the street space.
One is the split phases which offer a separated space for cyclists to travel, the offset crossings which helps to calm turning vehicles and open up sight lines between pedestrians, drivers and cyclists, and the third is installing additional right turn Bay's, which is the side away from the bike lane at locations that need additional capacity.
Then, can you speak to the Hudson River, because I know that on 11th Avenue, just south of 42nd Street, there's always a large traffic jams of people trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel.
So when we work on our proposals, we review them with the fire department to talk about emergency access along the corridors, and although our off-peak design will take the lane down to a single traveling, it would include markings that I indicate no standing any time allowing for people to have an extra space to pull over and out of the way.
It's really a combination of you, know, standing any time, markings, getting sort of a release valve for the traffic and Also that rush hour lane will help facilitate some any additional traffic.
We are in a in a bad situation, I, want to make sure and want to have the confidence that you know we're not creating a problem for the very unlikely, hopefully a situation where we would need to evacuate the whole island its if I could just chime in for a second That said, one of the big differences between this design and that stop the other things that you've seen in Midtown is that we've been we've really gone to one lane in most places here: We're keeping the two lanes, because this is such an important corridor to move vehicles on for some of the reasons like you're, exactly saying, you need to be able to have this release valve as you come into 37 on.
It's, interesting that you say that, because there has been a lot of success and people have looked at these in bikers, like them, but I think there are other places of the city, especially north of here, where we've heard some interesting, so I'll just throw that in as a caveat, but it's not in you're, not in Midtown, That's.
Just a quick question going back to the: How would you enforce the rush-hour traffic flow in terms of the parking regulations?
If any actions the committee wants to take right, now, I'll, simply start the discussion by pointing out you know, as I just said.
We generally call on deity to do as much outreach and teaching of good cycling behavior as possible, which often also calls on D-O-T to expand the street ambassadors program to as much as possible again understanding that funding is always an issue to encourage good, cycling, behavior and teach the rules of the road again , hopefully maximize success as much as possible, so I sort of just want to lay out what we usually do for the committee Does anyone on the committee have any other thoughts that would preclude us from talking about the way that we have been talking about the other elements of Midtown, crosstown, protected bike lanes or any thoughts in general, not seeing any hands from the committee?,?
I've, been trying earlier to say that I would be open to making our, whereas that regards enforcement, just making that directly dependent on whatever principles come out of that last Genda item that were discussing today, so maybe exploring changing the specific wording that we've used in the past I'm.
As you all know, the mayor announced the better buses restart to help speed up buses in key locations around the city during recovery and as part of that decided to make the 14th Street Bus way.
We can talk about potential site visits and things like that, but I think we'd probably be avoiding large-scale workshops, so primarily assume you have a sense of how many times it Do. You have a sense of how many times it could potentially meet and how quickly you plan to iterate on the design if it needs to be implemented in July, Maybe, weekly or bi-weekly give that July is very soon, and also just to make the point that this is certainly different than our typical process, and we would continue to me even after inflammation implementation starts.
The main piece right of a bus way that distinguishes it from a bus lane or from some other treatment, is the limitation of traffic traveling through on Fifth Avenue.
I think we would start from is obviously maintaining buses along 4th Avenue truck traffic having a transit truck priority street, like what we have on 14th Street.
Is, you know, even as it's framed as a one-year pilot, project, I, think what we've learned from past experience, and also now from the 14th Street being made permanent?
I'll just say for myself: that, given the calendar, given the time that we're in and given how quickly it sounds like this process is going to move, we would certainly appreciate being involved in the community advisory council, since there isn't say a proposal for us to assess and vote on tonight, and there wouldn't be that opportunity before it gets implemented.
I think we need to learn from what happened on 14th Street, most specifically, some of the some of the education issues and some of the situation's of, like you, said elderly residents not able to get a get a yellow cab, not able to get an uber or a ride share of any kind.
This is this is a question via t, but are there plans to change the existing bus infrastructure in terms of I know when the 14th Street bus way was implemented both of the 14 a and the 14 D were converted to a select bus, service?
I'm, a member of community board five, but I am NOT here in that capacity I'm here in the capacity of the president of our small tenant occupied co-op on 15th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, when the 14th Street bus way was proposed.
Can we do now about the tremendous increase in traffic on our one lane of traffic Street between Fifth and Sixth, Avenues and I- It's a question for the community board and for the Transportation Committee of exactly what actions you will take to either remediate or reverse the situation.
Just note that we did have two quarterly reports that are still available on sensuousness website, so you are able to go and access data, and also that we did collect a lot of public feedback through business surveys and community surveys and to this regular interaction from folks, But Allison I want you to speak to, but using that data for fifth avenue and how that works, Yeah, so 14th Street data at least gives us.
You know between what we might see in the data and on paper and isolated issues that people are seeing on the corridor, so I think the CA B will give us a good way for Fifth Avenue to address that.
That leads me to think that we have two main avenues, one in terms of fifth Street, sorry, fifth avenue- to participate as much as feasible in the community advisory board, as that goes forward to try to use what has been learned from 14th Street and to have a voice via that planning.
It was after the first one, so we should definitely take the opportunity offline to dig into the second one, but we would also very much appreciate I think to Buzz's point, perhaps two months from now, when our committee is back in session, for whatever it is, the August cycle, maybe getting a readout on what you learned from the code from the progressive to quarterly reports, and maybe whether or not more data is helping to explain more of what residents are seeing on those side, streets and then, certainly.
At this point in time, And I'd like to get a sense of whether the committee thinks that as well, BJ Both the comments from the community, as well as you know, people who are upset about it.
I'm sure we'll continue to be in touch as much as possible, as in particular that 5th Avenue plan develops and yes would very much appreciate the next time it's useable on the calendar for you folks to come back and continue to keep us read into 14th Street.
Please sorry, children that we might, that really are responsive to things that we have been hearing that maybe it might make sense for us to do before community board And to the other question, at least as far as fifth avenue is concerned, Who do you who do plan on, certainly and I, said officials, our community board and stakeholders from on the corridor, be it property owners or others and like to get some representation from West writers, as well?
If any, ongoing community engagement looks like on the 14th Street bus way.
I think you know our plan was to have more quarterly reports and that involved probably more discussion with folks at the community board some more opportunities to give feedback.
You say guarantee at this point that taxis and cars will theoretically be able to turn on for one block to make pickups and drop-offs similar to 14th Street, or is everything more or less up in the air pending the planning process that you talked about as far as I know, No intention of removing local access.
They can't continue down the corridor And You know we want to make sure that we also consider pickup drop-off areas on both sides of the street.
Think that's something we want to look carefully at block by block kind of acknowledging that every block is a little different and just making sure you know that we are meeting the needs of where people need to be where they need to access where they need to pick up.
Even, though we hear that you know, car axis is going to be allowed, I mean to allow a car to go one block or one and a half blocks is really not the answer along Fifth Avenue It's, a wider one-way street, so I just want to.
A lot of people are still afraid of mass transit, which I know So. With regard to the question by the public on access to stores along Fifth Avenue, keep in mind that a fourteenth Street near a model for this type of program.
As the committee members know, we want to discuss potential principles to hand off to one of our peer committees, but right now we'll let D-O-T talk about pedestrian hands, myths, around Central, Park, South and Grand Army We have books from our pedestrian unit.
We also installed a horse only lane on the North curb of Central Park south and the curb regulation here is no standing any time, but it is frequently blocked by cars and buses, as you can see in this photo looking south to 58th Street, the city bike station across the street, from the Plaza Hotel constricts, pedestrian movement here, and there is often illegal standing on the along the edge of the space.
We have a missing crosswalk here on the east side of this intersection, and we also have an underutilized, no standing in time space on the north, curb of 58th Street between Grand Army, Plaza and Fifth Avenue.
We really shouts of a Plaza Hotel and we plan to meet with them and discuss the proposal and talk through issues in the area, but we usually come to the committee boards first with our proposal and then meet with stakeholders like that.
If, you go, hey I'll, go ahead with the bus way and would make sure that this plan doesn't take away any options from that I think that's an excellent point and matches a theme where we always prefer a holistic and comprehensive look about how any changes affect the options and the overall traffic network of streets in the entire district.
You know folks, who have spoken up so far, seem to generally be supportive of these pedestrian enhancements with say some stipulations like Joel mentioned, examining whether or not time to lights are appropriate, suggesting that do t move forward with plans to talk to stakeholders like by the hotel that our pool will be conditioned on going to landmarks as well and considering network effect.
I had a specific question about the second bullet point: around automatic enforcement and just what was sort of the people who drafted this kind of intended to mean by that.
Think As, a committee and, like you said, we called on NYPD to enforce things.
Had, a discussion with EJ a few days back that the starting to work on this- You know my sentiment to EJ- was that I felt that we as a community board, like most community boards, had some complicity in the way in which the NYPD has treated people of color in our city.
