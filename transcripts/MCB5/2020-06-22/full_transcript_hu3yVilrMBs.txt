We don't have Ryan, Whelan or Hugo on yet do we believe they're the only two members that we're missing, correct, I, don't see either of them. Okay, well, I think we should go ahead and get started. Welcome everybody to our monthly meeting of Manhattan Community or fives transportation and Environment Committee via zoom I'm, also particularly on a new zoom setup right now, because I don't have any Wi-Fi or spectrum internet, so Luke's gonna generously help out as much as possible if I'm missing, for example, if there are hands raised or something in the chat right now, but I believe we can, we can go ahead and get started. We are having a number of presentations from Department of Transportation to see things three of them, in fact, which item is three four and five on our agenda. The first two items were that the committee wanted to briefly touch base on current status of two different issues, and you know I want to invite members of the committee who have concerns or observations about either of these things to feel free to bring them up, because I think we just kind of want to do as much fact-finding as possible and also invite folks from D-O-T who may have answers to some of our questions too, to feel free to answer that as well. The first issue is the street closures that have been noticed by many people and reported in media outlets like Gothamist outside of NYPD precincts right now. There is at least one in our district on 30th Street between 6th and 7th avenues, which has simply mostly been closed to traffic by the NYPD. For the last several weeks, I'm wondering number one if folks have noticed any other such closures with the with the aluminum barricades in our district number, two, whether they've been lifted and number three. If there has been an affirmative statement by the NYPD regarding how long they're likely to be there and also how exactly they're able to have those streets closed for longer than 48 hours, which I believe requires D-O-T authorization to close the street for more than 48 hours, so again just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone does have any new information for the committee that we can kind of pool in terms of our collective knowledge, hi EJ, their street closures on 8th Avenue and 35th 36, and then I was near Bryant Park yesterday and there are definite street closures from like 40 streets, 43rd, Street, bored streets and 6th Avenue, okay, pedestrian street closures or, if you were I, saw a couple that had to show or say that they lived on that block in order to be led boom. But if you don't live in that block, even the pedestrian traffic was closed off. Okay, thank you. So I would throw this question to Colleen or members of the D-O-T who are here. Do you do you folks have an update for us on the nature of these closures? How long they'll be closed for or whether or not do T approval was given for these closures to last for more than 48 hours from city transportation? Nice to see all of you quite a few of my colleagues are on the meeting with all of us here tonight. I'm gonna have my colleague, Kimberly raincoat, give an update on that because she's, the one who's been, you know leading the charge on the open streets and she might have more information than I do well Colleen. This is a separate issue than the open streets. This is PD closures around precincts related to the protests, I believe it's related to the protests. We have a lot of clarity on that. We're happy to hear your concerns and take them back. Okay, at this point, I think our concerns are mostly wondering what is going on and what the current status is. I was just gonna, say: I thought this was one of the streets that we closed off, but I didn't know. This was PD who's doing in have the board reached out to the local priests and to get more information or yeah board reached out to I. Think you folks at DoD the mayor's office I believe we tried to contact the precincts. We simply didn't I think for the most part were referred around and then an and didn't end up getting any kind of answer on timing or more specific rationale than protests from NYPD, and you know from do tea in particular. I think we're curious to find out about that 48-hour rule were these, where these closures signed off on by do T and isn't that generally required. Okay, so I think I know okay, I understand where you're coming from I, don't believe anything was signed off from do T if I'm not mistaking Kim can correct me on that I'm not familiar with the closure. That's been occurring, and my guess is that it's all related to the protests in Manhattan, but if I'm not mistaken, you're, probably talking about local law 24, which is the closure of a particular streets or streets in the city in which you know the Commissioner of DLT would have to sign off on you know any closures, whether it's temporary or whether it's permanent, but as far as I know, I have not I have not been privy or seen any documentation with signatures leading to the closure of those streets and Kim might have more information again on this than I. Do I don't have more okay. Thank you, yeah. Any further information that you folks could provide us with would be great. I can see that Lorri H spoke with Midtown North Precinct. Okay, thank you Laurie! So yeah. You know any further information we'll continue to try to engage NYPD to understand how long these closures are going to be here for as well. I think we understand that their protests related, but you know wondering some of the more specifics about how long that'll last and to what degree they have notified the community or do t as they've as they've been doing it so anyway. Yeah we'll continue to try and figure that out, but thank you I guess. While we're on the topic Kimberly, could you give us any potential context at this point and yeah I've heard over the weekend that the pedestrian street closures are potentially going to be upgraded and made more secure and more permanent? Now that many of the barriers wooden barriers have been damaged? Do you have any give any new information on the fact that some of the pedestrian closures have been losing than the original, the original protective barriers around them, and whether or not the city is doing anything around that yeah I don't have a very specific update on the measure, but I know we are still looking to expand and add new okhla ministries, but also at a point where we think it makes sense to evaluate some of the locations. We're hearing some complaints we have been. There are certain places where we have been hearing sort of repeated concerns about barriers not being put back and been working through conversations about how to make that work more effectively, but I haven't heard about any specific upgrades to the actual barriers. Okay, if there's again, if there's locations that you guys are concerned about where we've been fielding, those and kind of kind of tracking them and we're certainly always looking to reevaluate and see where we can improve upon what's out there or you know, make adjustments reasons that are certainly blocks if they're not working. Okay. Thank you. I'm gonna apologize to committee, one more time because I have to toggle on my little ghetto. Macgyver set up here to see hands that are raised, but it looks like Sam has his hand raised. Sam. Did you have a question? No I just wanted to clarify the difference between the street, my media, making in Times Square, which are directly related to the area and protests versus the street closures they're making where they have a precinct house or police station on the street. So I think that the question of what they're doing in time, where any given day, which doesn't seem to be frequent block closures from 40th Street up to 49th, even 50th Street I've spoken with Time Square Alliance about that, and some of that has been directly related to an individual projects that is different from where they're closing off an entire block. Just because there's a police station on it, and that has been going on for more than a couple of weeks, whether there are protests occurring or not and that's happening in the East Village. It's happening in cv4 cb6 all over the place, yep thanks very much Sam for that. For that clarification again, I think with all these things will just try to flag problems as we see them and try to get an answer. Try to get answers as much as possible. Nypd in particular, has I guess been reluctant to put out any kind of Public Safety public statement about what it is, that they're doing and we're just kind of reading the tea leaves on it. So the second bullet owner agenda and the final quick status update, saying I thought we could check in on, is obviously the fact that outdoor dining rules went into effect today, as the city went into phase two we're all inside on the internet right now, so I don't know how many, how many of us have gotten the chance to say, experience it yet or take a real look at them at how it's going my understanding from reading the rules is that three scenarios are allowed starting today previously certified sidewalks eating backyard, patios and curb Lane parking, Lane seating he's going sure. So it's not only previously a proof, sidewalk cafes. It's also sort of the application process that opened last Friday under open restaurants allows for businesses to request or apply to use sidewalk space, even if they don't have a pre-existing from it and curb lane space. So there's two types that you can apply for through that process: okay, thank you and then, and then coming down. The future are the final two scenarios which are potentially seating out in the middle of a closed street and seating in plazas. Is that correct, that's correct both of those would be working with local partners to determine how this heating gets arranged and how it works out for the open streets, we've been getting. Obviously, more open space requests really like specifically people specifically looking for space for restaurants and so beginning. Some at some point in July we'll be allowing that. But in the meantime, we're gonna be working with those partners to kind of figure out how to create a safe space, and it wouldn't be full-time closures. It would be like maybe just evenings and weekends so that we continue to have the more normal open street that allows local access throughout the day and then the plazas there's different models that we'll be working with bids and other partners on how to whether it's setting it up more like a cafeteria style, or whether it's exclusive dining, depending on the businesses that are there so working toward three different models. Okay, thank you. Could you talk a little bit about what exactly would happen if it became clear that someone who had the business who had self-certified is very obviously not complying with the rules? They're? Cramming the tables together they're there in the street they're taking space. That is not explicitly a lot like even under these rules, made available to the restaurant. What recourse and what commitment? Does the city plan to have in terms of enforcing those rules and shutting down that operator in short order? So that's. Why probably not one single answer, especially at this point. This is a program that we've been we've had to roll out very quickly and a much different schedule than our normal programs. So the first point is that most of our inspections and that's opened review are gonna, be a complaint Faith's. So as we get complaints through 3-1-1, those will get sent to the appropriate agencies. Obviously this is a multi-agency initiative us working with joh and with SPS and others. So, depending on what the particular issue is, it would be routed in that way we're still looking through. Certainly, we reserve the right to take away the certificate that allows you to put out the tables and chairs if you're, not following the criteria or the guidelines that are set and then I think, depending on what the particular issue is, we have to figure out how to resolve it. I think we want to be. We don't want to be very punitive in the beginning. We want to try to make this work and work with partners if we're having people like repeatedly be bad actors. I'm left to work through that through we're still working on how exactly the enforcement is gonna play out, trying to be a little bit creative, potentially using some kind of ambassadors as well as obviously, if, depending on the severity of the issue, we would be working with PD and FDNY. So if they're blocking roadways are not following the guidelines in that way, then we reach out to have gen-y, so they were still working through and we don't have a very clear, specific answer, but we look forward to working with our partners as well. Okay, thanks and then for eventually the street seating. Am I right in assuming that could those places could eventually be identified as streets that are currently part of the pedestrianisation closures, as well as say any of the future streets that you decide to add to the program exactly so any place where we have interests in an existing open street? We would work with restaurants and the community partners to see what works and then also people I'm sure have been already and will continue to apply. Specifically with that interest in mind and we're still rolling in different open streets, we hope to have an announcement soon about the next round. Okay, thank you. I know that I rolled a couple of our updates together there and Layla has her hand raised I'm gonna want to give her a chance to ask her question and then I'll, you know, throw it open to any other questions. Thank you. Each a clarification. Can you actually tell us whether the sidewalks that are permitted for these expedited sidewalk cafes is limited to the sidewalks that are authorized by the your zoning resolution, or does it go beyond that? The zoning resolution does not permit sidewalk cafes, for example, on 14th Street, 20 23rd, or these streets are going to be eligible for sidewalk cafes. They are eligible in this program. Yet under this temporary program. Okay and my other question on the similar theme, do you have any jurisdiction over pops and are there any guidelines from D-O-T on how pops seeding is going to be permitted? So we don't as far as I know, since they're privately owned I know that has come up. I think that's something that would have to be with other agencies involved right and our focus just on the city right-of-way, and if an applicant were to apply both simultaneously for a cafe and it pops as well as a sidewalk or street. Do you have any position and this the city have any position on that applying through a for a cafe and a separate from in this whole process, correct applying for both I. Don't think that we see any applications like that, so this is and just to give it a little more to elaborate a little bit on the application process for the open restaurants. It's a sound like a registration and self certification, so we are not reviewing individual applications because there are so many restaurants and bars in the city. They want to be as inclusive and as fair and as geographically equitable as possible. So it's self certification. So once the peasants goes online, if they're able to check out the boxes and provide the information, that's asked for they get an email saying what they're allowed to then put out their tables and chairs good. There is no restriction as to a an applicant who would already have outdoor seating and it pops, for example, correct not that I know. Thank you very much Joel about the process. So, on your website its website, it says that applicants are limited to the area directly in front of their frontage, so some of those, especially with smaller restaurants that are precluded from having any outdoor seating either because there's a finite River or whatever it's some kind of restriction. I was asked by one restaurant if they were able to arrange with the business next door, which is evenings. Is that permissible? Is it legal? How do they go about that? So not at present and is something that we've gotten a lot of questions about. Understandably so, as people are trying to, you know, get their businesses back up and running at this point, we're limiting it to the space and directly in front of your establishment, but this is an evolving process and we're monitoring and reviewing- and it might be, you know, we're looking to potentially expand opportunities as we move forward over the coming weeks. But we wanted to start sort of in this simple directly in front of your business limitation and ancillary. To that, is it only the restaurant they can make the application or in a new building with several small restaurants? Can the building owner make the application at this one? It's the individual business that should apply. Thank you, Thanks, and you know at this point I invite folks who aren't on the committee. If you have a question, you can raise your hand as well I see Clayton tan is up hi. Can you hear me? Yes, thanks everybody, so I apologize, I had to join late, but I was joining because I have a lot of concern about with the second that the open streets I mean the expanded outdoor dining plan was released. Last Friday I reviewed it from the point of view of a restaurant owner, many of whom were my friends and there nowhere in the text of the self-certifying form of the process to go through this. Is there any language whatsoever regarding public health regarding the SLA and the state of New York's requirements? That tables be six feet separate from one another so concerned about this I. As a member of the public emailed the general thing, D-O-T saying what gives what's the guidance here? What is the deal and I got a response. That said, please review the FAQ section of our site with a link. Now that is a section that I never would have seen on the forum itself. So if I were a restaurant owner, I never would have gone to it, but I did go to that page and on the FAQ page of this plan at D-O-T site, there is also zero, explicit text referring to social distancing or to public health zero. There is in response to one question about what should we do about something, an answer that said, please refer to the New York State for information on this topic. If you go to the website for New York State, you will eventually find a page with a very tiny font that says that tables are required to be six feet apart. I guarantee you that nobody is gonna, get that far. I only got that far, because I was hell-bent on figuring out what the guidance was on this issue. So my question for the D-O-T is: why do you not care about setting out guidance for restaurant owners who are understandably terrified about what they should do when it comes to the layout of their tables and seating? Why is it that you do not believe that this isn't for you to explicitly lay out for the public and for business owners and I would appreciate a direct answer. Sure so. I think that we do care. I, think it's that we, of course, as do see, were focused on the sort of Street limitations and how and the street safety. So that's why we direct folks to other resources which, quite honestly, if you're, opening a restaurant at this point, you should probably be reviewing the state's guidelines anyhow, rather than just this particular program, which applies only to seating in the street and on the sidewalk. So I would expect that anyone trying to open a restaurant would be reviewing those other guidelines elsewhere, I'm using restaurant owners I'm talking about existing restaurant owners right existing restaurant owners who are opening up seating, which they have not been able to do over the past several months right, it's been takeout only so there's a lot of guidelines out there for how to reopen your business following the requirements of Phase two, not from D-O-T no guidance requirements. That's why they're not included there and that's our we reference we make links and we reference to where those guidelines live. Those are not our requirements. Okay, so III know. This is not my committee, so I will I don't want to take any more time on this, but I. Just think that is a wofully insufficient and in fact, abdicating responsibility on do teas part, and my offer to the committee would be that it is our role to make sure that city agencies feet are to the fire when it comes to public health, and this is a complete abdication of responsibility. My friends who own restaurants want guidance, but they do not feel like they understand what they should do, not only for public health, but also for being shut down or getting violations. Have they gone to like the SBS restaurant reopening guide, for example, I can't speak to what specific actions they take in I only believe that do teas guidance for the plan for self-certifying should say somewhere in the text. What the expectation is about public health. This is not a minor shoo. Why is this not item number one highlighted in red? Fine, that's all I'll say so: okay, thanks Glenn, I, think I. Think. The question that I would ask at this point to sort of summarize here is that so restaurants that are offering outdoor dining are required to comply with both the state's phase two rules and the additional city D-O-T requirements around self-certifying. Is that correct, they're there they're bound by both of those I guess my question at this point you know along lines of Clayton's question. Is you know understanding that those are two different jurisdictions and that you folks are only one of those jurisdictions? Is there nevertheless a place where you as a restaurant owner, can go for a user-friendly summary of all the rules? City county? You know the state etc that you need to be following right now, so that you, as a business, you know, have a one-stop shop for all the rules to make sure that your customers are safe and I guess just to follow up if there isn't that right now. Would that would it be possible to create something like that? I can certainly look into it. I think what we have at the moment is links on the website, along with our guidelines that lay out like that connect to those requirements, and if, for example, you were opening outdoor seating in a backyard- and you had nothing to do with our program because you don't need to apply to it to do that, you would be looking in those other locations right. The current text for the plan on do tees website does not mention adhering to the state's guidelines or requirements. It does not at all. It does say that those food establishments that have been authorized by the governor of the state of New York to reopen under Phase two and want to use outdoor areas in the temporary basis, so it does in the big top of the website, mentioned the governor and place two requirements. It's not enough guys. It's not nearly enough. We can look into adding more okay thanks, clean Thank, You, Kim I saw that Leila has a question and then move on so Leila doing a brief. I just want a second with. We really need rules, but we need guidance, true guidance on what is safe, based on the information that the city is getting from the experts, so that we can continue to remain safe and be safer and contain this pandemic. So I really urge the D-O-T to do their share, even if it is mentioned elsewhere or by other agencies. This is a way to important issue, to consider that you know, because somebody else is doing it. It's enough, so, just to reiterate the link on our page to the SBS restaurant reopening guide, which goes through what operators must do before opening summary of guidelines and health and safety, and that sort of thing there, which is really not it's, really not your duty jurisdiction, which is why we wouldn't have those specific details, necessarily in the direct text of our program, but rather link to parents written out. My comment you may want to consider, although it is not the narrow application of duties for you to add some language, because this is a very serious issue and the public and businesses need guidelines and guidance and leadership, yeah I think I would say, I. Think I would second that as well. It's not it's, not your jurisdiction that you know that's clear to us, but we know that not all restaurant owners are lawyers or legal experts or and can spend a lot of time, understanding the intricacies of all the different jurisdictions that they do need to follow. So we would encourage that someone be thinking about how to provide as Lela and clay and said, provide guidance in a user-friendly way from the perspective of the business owner who needs to implement these rules for everyone's safety. Certainly that kind of thing sort of gets abandoned when all the different groups can and agencies know that they're only a sliver of the jurisdiction there, but I think we'd, encourage you folks to potentially find a way to provide summary guidance. You know how to unified how to for how to secure your business Evon. Yes, hello, we can hear you great first and foremost, thank you, everyone for everything. My name is Yvonne I'm, one of the owners at Casa nomads restaurant on Broadway between 29th and 30th streets. Why don't you just thank the community board? We've been working together with Luke and Joe, and a couple of other members to get her liquor license and we have finally gotten it in the midst of this pandemic. But my question just to kind of keep brief, is we're very excited as well as petrified to be coming back. You want to make sure to keep safety protocols very high. No, it's a most important to come back to the community as well as to just reopen. No there's not a lot of places. There's not a lot of restaurants on my block, in particular, with in fact we're the only restaurant, so we're excited to be coming back with. That being said, we're excited to be opening in front of the restaurant for outdoor seating, but my question in particular, was more about the municipality application to the temporary, to temporary, extend the licensed premises, which somebody touched upon this briefly and said that it was not gonna, be it's not gonna be put in place just yet, but the applications I think are live and we submitted everything our storefronts about 15 feet wide and with the regulations in place. It only allows us for a couple of tables which makes it very difficult to even break, even which I mean at this point. It might as well not even be a point of reopening until we have a little bit more rope so to speak and right in front of us. We have a bike lane. It's there's a lot of limitations. Obviously, would you be able to expand a little bit more? My partner is the building owner. So there's several storefronts that closed around 6:30 I've spoken with him before, and he said you know, we want to give you as much life to be able to have more tables outside. We would be able to take over some of these storefronts next door and have a little bit more seating, so I think that's the question that was asked before, which is that we we've received that question a lot I totally understand where people are coming from and why that's desirable. We just launched the program today and we are gonna, be monitoring it and we'll be looking to see if there are ways like creative ways like that, we can expand opportunities for restaurants and bars. But at this point we're limited to that space and I understand that it can be very limiting and in some cases it won't be feasible at all. In some cases it will be not as much space as people would really need to operate fully. So it's so it's a work in progress. This is a very new program like I said it's on a very accelerated timeline, so these are issues that we are hearing and we understand and we hope to have updates in the coming weeks to see how it can evolve. Okay, thank you. Thanks, Yvonne Matt Harmon did I see a hand from you. Iii put down there my aunt, my comments were too reflected. Okay, all right thanks, Alex matt testa hello. Can everybody hear me yes, great, so I'm with the Fifth Avenue Association and first I'd like to say Kimberly. Thank you. You've got a lot of good information been able to provide, especially throwing all this together on short notice. It's a difficult feat, so appreciate your efforts going through all this from an operational standpoint, these restaurants are going to need to be serviced both getting deliveries and trash hauls. Will there be a consistent time that streets are going to be closed or is it sort of block by block or what sort of information can we provide to restaurants, so they can get necessary supplies in and out so much searching about certain time that streets will be closed. You mean that dining will be closed or that streets themselves will be closed. So you know, for instance, when deliveries and carting services that are gonna be needing to access a lot of these spots. You know you might have a string of restaurants, tables and chairs, and so I mean I. Think you answered some of that. The closures will be limited to maybe the evenings, but in terms of street closures, how that's going to affect operations so I think you're getting at one of the challenges that we have right now overall, at do is he which is trying to manage a lot of the different demands, especially the curb space, which is always a challenge for us, but is especially challenging right now, as we're getting asked to provide more pedestrian space, more space for bikes make sure buses are moving quickly and accommodate deliveries as businesses come back and add outdoor dining. So as far as open streets, those fans of activities are always allowed to happen on them at the moment, because local traffic for deliveries and pickups or services are is allowed if they are. If the closures are more extensive, it would be time limited so, but that's something that we're still working through it. At this point, all open streets are accessible for trash, pickup and deliveries. As far as what happens when a street that may have a lot of restaurants on it, limited-access at the curb for deliveries, I think it's something we're gonna have to work through, as we see it sort of on a block by block in situation level, because this is something very new to us, and maybe it means that in certain streets it's best, you have to try to create an open, Street there, so that there's less through traffic and more ability to do deliveries, but it's definitely an ongoing process and figuring out how it works. But at the moment there's no limitation know if, like no overall limitation on deliveries or a trash pickup, it's just that. If we start to see the curb space really used up by restaurants, then we'll have to figure out how to work around. That. No I appreciate that. That's certainly, you know a tough one, other quick question and I'm afraid this might be a bit of a third rail, but with all the safety measures that NYPD has put into effect around the city and pedestrian plazas. Since the Halloween terrorist attack, I, have any discussions happen with NYPD about placing an additional sugar, cubes or bollards or things that might prevent some sort of mm-hmm attack. If you will, unlike an open street or around a dining area, we always have ongoing conversations with PD and we do specify different types of barriers depending on the type of roadway that the restaurant would be on where those outdoor dining in the street right. So if there's outdoor dining on the street, you know where you're, seeing a larger sort of- let's say concentration but I, guess that's really more of a question for NYPD, but a good question and we'll continue to have conversations with them. I'm sure. Thank you. Each I'm here make a note. Yeah go ahead, just for anybody who's joining us by phone. You can press star 9 to raise your hand and be recognized so I'm not seeing anymore hands right now on these two or three topics. But thank you to everyone who asked a question and thank you to do T and in particular Kim for fielding those. Obviously, we've flagged some concerns and appreciate you guys considering continuing to think about those, and just generally know that the whole the whole program will be a fast-moving and always changing thing. So we, you know, appreciate all the information that you can provide as it continues to develop. Okay thanks all so with that we'll move on to the what's. The third item on the discussion, which is the first, do T updates on the 38th Street and 39th Street bike lanes. However, you folks when I go about that. Well, this is a follow-up to our discussion at last ones. Meeting about the temporary bike lane we heard there was interest in learning more about what our plans are to build that out in more permanent materials, and so we're happy to be here tonight and be able to share that proposal with you of course, builds on our past work, I'm, 26, 29, 52nd and 55th, as well as 12 and 13th streets. Eileen body is here and she'll walk talk through the presentation, but just note that I will build on those it does. We have. The design is a little bit different. So just say tune taketh to see how it how it differs based on the traffic volumes and congestion that we see there. Okay, thanks, Eileen, feel free to take it away. I'll say really quickly before Eileen jumps on done a tremendous job as long as well as old wean on this takes all of our work on cross town, streets and kind of piles it into the one to the last corridor that we've been working hard on. The temporary lanes have shown us a lot and we're excited to show you guys what we have today. Hopefully she's ready now: okay, right thanks! So much is a screen visible to everyone. Yes, so tonight we're going to walk you through the background of other previous Crosstown protected bike lanes, we'll also share what went into the route selection criteria for these streets, also, the proposal details and, finally, some of the analysis that also led into this proposal development. So this not we've shared previously. It shows the ongoing comprehensive plan for crosstown that protected bike lanes installed in Midtown since 2018 and so for context or where they fit in together. The green and blue lines show the existing routes that we recently installed and the purple is our new proposal that we're sharing tonight. The routes are spaced evenly apart, every half mile throughout Midtown, from Union Square up to Central Park and as Convention we installed twelve thirteen, twenty six and twenty ninth streets in 2018 and last year installed 52nd and 55th streets, and so we found that the new lanes in the 50s and the 20s resulted in an increase of cyclists using the lanes from vehicle travel times not adversely affected generally maintained the new curbside regulation. Changes were also found to be effective and well used, and the bike lane design and Street design elements have been found to be very flexible and something that could be repeated in other locations throughout Midtown. Following the implementation of last year's projects, do tease Street ambassadors conducted education and outreach to cyclists along 52nd and 55th streets, interacting with many livery cyclists about the new infrastructure rules of the road distributing materials to educate them on that, as well. During the outreach process and throughout in the location of the project, we also conducted a number of walkthroughs and site visits with various stakeholders to make adjustments as needed and understand various issues, some examples of that food, adjusting signage and markings, fine tuning, the theater and hotel loading zone, entrances to accommodate arrival and departures and we're continuing to respond to feedback and recommendations moving forward if there are additional issues to address I, also want to mention that last year there were a number of construction sites along the routes know that those have generally completed. We will be returning to finish markings at those locations in the future. Now that we're beginning to start up our operations again. So next I'll share more about the existing conditions. What would interrupt selection and the design details? So this area of Midtown between 42nd Street down to 34th Street? It was very black high-volume destinations, the Javits Center Port, Authority, Penn, Station, Madison, Square, Garden and, of course, even have the ferries on the East River and the Hudson River. And when you look at all these destinations in this dense commercial district will relate with the bike map, it's very clear that there aren't many protected bike lanes or even conventional or standard lanes in this area. So it's really challenging to travel, especially crosstown in this especially busy area and there's know a lot of big infrastructure in terms of the technology of the streets in this area. There are several differences from what we were looking at in the 50s and the 20s. Some of those include the streets are wider with multiple travel lanes, we've also seen excess capacity during some of those off-peak hours. Many of the streets of tents with travel lanes simultaneous with shared lanes, which can feel narrow when they're used also as a shared bike lane. In this context, the streets could be overall that are organized and updated with in terms of the regulations to have better use of the curb and more efficient loading space. And finally, if there's no dedicated space for cyclists, any lanes that go on cross town streets in this section are generally shared lanes, which are frequently blocked. As you can see in some of the photos, and both of these photos actually show cyclists traveling in the shared lane on 39th Street, which, when conditions are congested, it's not the most comfortable bicycle facility, and so some of the factors we took into consideration for route selection are similar to our other products in terms of continuity of the streets connectivity to the first avenue bike lane. But a new factor was the network challenges of the street grid. There are a lot of issues that the tunnel access points. So there's a lot more to take into account here and again in terms of connectivity. There aren't any streets in this region that continue all the way from the Hudson River Greenway to the East River Greenway. So we prioritized connecting all the way through from 11th Avenue to the first avenue bike lane so in the eastbound direction, starting at the South 36th Street overlaps with the main entrance and exit points to the Midtown Tunnel on the east side, any further south than that, and it's a little too close to the 26 and 29th street pair and then we're getting away from that. Half mile spacing of the routes to the north 40th Street has challenges such as the Lincoln Tunnel entrance, which you see the aerial image of it's a very complex lock to cross as a cyclist and also just generally, yes, the Lincoln Tunnel entrance and then further north 34th Street is watched by Grand, Central un and again, that's a little too close to the other pair going in the westbound direction. 35Th and 37th Street on the east side are particularly challenging because they have two-way blocks and also overlap with the Midtown Tunnel access and that aerial image below shows how complex that section is as well. 37Th Street also overlaps with a bus route for several blocks and 41st Street doesn't continue all the way through due to Bryant Park. So here it's clear that 39th Street is the ideal Street in terms of continuity. Another element we examined was the number of blocks where we could but a protected bike lane and also maintain the existing number of travel lanes, and that is shown with these green boxes on that. So for the eastbound route, 38 Street of the greatest number of Y blocks where our proposed design could fit in the westbound direction. 39Th Street had the most blocks. That would be ideal for our design, and this is key to the design, particularly within cb5, since will share that next and so our previous crosstown bike lanes generally consisted of two main designs: a delineator protected bike lane with a single travel lane and also a parking protected bike lane with parking on both sides and also a single travel lane. And while our proposal will include elements of these two designs, especially on the east side and the west side, the portion we're sharing tonight, especially cv5, is quite different. We're introducing a new design to the pole to accommodate additional vehicle volumes, and so there are different characteristics as these streets travel through the different neighborhoods from west to east. On the west side, many of these blocks have a single travel lane with two parking lanes and generally, the land uses are slightly lower density in the commercial corner. Of course, there's a lot of activity in terms of loading, the commercial district itself, and here there are generally two travel lanes and two loading things all the way to the east side. There are a lot of irregular blocks that include multiple travel lanes, rush-hour lanes and they generally change from block to block, and so before we get into our standard proposal. I also wanted to provide some background and an update on the temporary lanes. So some of you have seen this last month, but just wanted to introduce this as well. In order to basically provide you transportation options as the city is reopening, we have been installing temporary bicycle routes throughout the city, 38th and 39th. Street is one of those starting. Last month we began installing barrels and signs from 11th Avenue to 5th Avenue on both streets. This was a quick installation and since our last update in May, we have returned to the location and installed markings in terms of long lines and also bicycle symbols to indicate and clarify the expectations how users come Street users can park on this road, and so the barrels are in need of ongoing maintenance and our staff visit the location on a nearly daily basis to shift barrels back into place, speak to businesses and drivers, and also post additional signs as needed and so getting into our proposal. Next, when I refer to existing conditions, I won't be speaking about the temporary lanes, I'll be referring to the previous design and the previous conditions before bid. So our typical design for the proposal, basically transitions from the temporary lanes into something that would accommodate higher vehicle volumes. Both streets between 8th Avenue to Madison Avenue have to travel veins and two passing lanes, and our proposal includes the same parking protected bike, lane design that we've used before and that also minors. What we've started with you temporary lanes, but the difference is that there will be two travel lanes during the peak period and so the second lane on the opposite side of the bike lane the opposite curve of the bike lane would be converted to a rush hour travel lane, which means that loading and parking is still available overnight and off-peak, and we also heard the concern the last time we spoke that there is no traffic in this area. This is a bit context than what we saw in the 50s and the 20s and that matches our analysis as well, so 38th Street does not currently have a bike lane. This is the eastbound route and the bike lane in our proposal would run along the north, curb with a rush-hour lane along the south, curb similar to our previous projects. The parking protector design does require the removal of approximately ten spaces per block on average to accommodate day lighted, intersection, designs and also mid block, no standing any time zones for emergency clearance. 39Th Street is the westbound route, and this currently has a shared Lane here. The bike lane would run along with South curved, with the rush hour lane along the north curb and would involve similar parking changes to 38th in terms of the day lighting and so to summarize, the existing capacity allows for two travel lanes and 2 loading lanes throughout the entire day and during the peak period. Our proposal consolidates the loading to one side of the street while maintaining two travel lanes and during the off-peak period. Other proposal instead removes a travel lane and permits loading to occur on both sides of the street and for an example. This photo was taken during off-peak period where the parking was utilized on both sides with light vehicle volumes passing through. So what led to the design decision to include a rush-hour Lane was an analysis both of the curb usage and also the vehicle volumes. So, in terms of the curb usage, we saw that the existing loading space actually exceeded the demand with less than forty to sixty percent of the space occupied on average during the peak periods. We also saw that, and most loading happens in hour or less, which is consistent with what business is reported to us. During the merchant survey we've demonstrated in our past projects that, when we've updated parking regulations to encourage turnover, for example, changing from three hours down to one hour, commercial meters, it matched the use better and also encouraged better turnover, and so in this particular project, shifting the parking to one side and consolidating it to one location for the peak period. I can also achieve that encouragement of turnover as well. So these charts show the vehicle volumes throughout the day, and what you see here is that they generally stay about the same throughout the day. They're, not dipping in the middle of the midday. The peak period actually is just continuing throughout the day, and so this speaks to. We need to maintain those two lanes throughout the midday peak period. In addition to the other tools, such as the rush-hour lanes and curb regulation updates. Another program that D-O-T offers is the off hour delivery program. This encourages off-peak deliveries, which generally coincide with the time frame that our project would allow parking to occur on both sides. This reduces double parking and congestion during the day. It also is often more efficient and convenient for some of the larger businesses, especially, and so this is something that we can explore with our Freight mobility program. If there is interest, especially from specific businesses, and just a highlight again that what we have seen a lot of is that even when there's available loading space, so people still double Park, and so our proposal will really help to encourage from a more efficient use of the street space. In this example, you can see that on the left side of the street, there are several spaces open, there's even a few on the right side, but someone still chose to double Park just beyond that available space, which is causing a hazardous condition for the cyclists passing through, and also a frustrating experience for the drivers. So design and parking adjustments can be made to accommodate different land uses throughout the project corridors. Some of the tools that we've used on our other projects include those curb regulation updates, either shortening the duration or changing the time frames, also using markings such as no standing any to maintain emergency access or clearance for large vehicles at specific locations. And, finally, the special markings we've been using at locations such as hotel loading zones, schools, health centers theaters have really helped to highlight locations where there's frequent passenger pick-up and drop-off needs. The intersection designs included in our proposal will improve efficiency at the intersections through three different design. Interventions. One is the split phases which offer a separated space for cyclists to travel, the offset crossings which helps to calm turning vehicles and open up sight lines between pedestrians, drivers and cyclists, and the third is installing additional right turn Bay's, which is the side away from the bike lane at locations that need additional capacity. This image shows an example of what the offset crossing typical has looked like on most of our crosstown bike lanes, and you can see that the vertical elements help to slow turning vehicles as they approach, cyclists and pedestrians, and so to give some additional context on what the routes the proposed routes look like, as we continue to the east and to the west to see before and cv6. There are different existing technologies of the streets in both of those districts and so, for example, on the west side generally, it will include a park, a protected bike lane with a single travel lane here in cv5. It's the typical of the parking protected bike lane with the option for two travel lanes during the peak periods and then on the east side, where there are multiple travel lanes, a lot of rush-hour regulations and different alignments approaching and exiting those tunnel access points. Those would often be delineator protected lanes and so again, just to emphasize. We have the temporary bike lanes out. There, we've been working to improve and maintain them. It is a work in progress. We really look forward to the opportunity to install this in a more permanent fashion with more of our standard materials that allow to clarify the space a bit further and at this time, I'm happy to open it up to questions thanks very much. Does anyone on the committee have questions not currently seeing any hands raised? Do any other attend? Not one questions. We've got one from Noah go for it all right! Thank you for the presentation. It was very thoughtful and I, especially like the idea of that unique, a bike lane that all hasn't been used in the past, but what I wanted to touch on was. Could you talk about the connection between the Hudson, River, Greenway and bike lane and the East River Greenway, because I believe the East River Greenway starts at 37th Street? So how are you thinking of putting a 2-way bike to a bike lane on First Avenue or how was that? That's a great question. Actually, one of our projects a few years back, has that two-way lane on East 37th, between First Avenue to the Greenway, and to connect to that there is a two-way portion between 38th down to 37. So for the eastbound side, bus looking to access the Greenway and it's not showing us not all. Basically they turn right at First Avenue and then they can access the lane leading into the Greenway and for people leaving the Greenway incoming Morse. They can also do the opposite since 1st Avenue was northbound the whole way, but yes, that to a section, has already been in place for a few years now so we'll be able to take advantage of that. And then can you speak to the Hudson River, because I know that on 11th Avenue, just south of 42nd Street, there's always a large traffic jams of people trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel. So how was that? Yes? So for that section and I apologize, we don't have a detail on that here. We tried to shorten it in the interest of time. Basically, there would be a to a portion along 40th Street, along the edge of the Javits Center between the Greenway to 11th Avenue and then a to a bicycle sidewalk stamp portion connecting to and from the new lanes for the for an interim treatment. So it's challenging right now, there's some construction at the Javits Center, so in terms of the timeline that might have to wait for the construction to wrap up, but generally that would be the connection on the west side, and then this map shows that East Side connection a bit better as well. Thank you, Thanks, no Leila I can imagine that there must be some evacuation routes around this area if the Manhattan needs to be evacuated. For whatever reason would these two streets being converted into you know accommodating bike lanes? Would that have any effect on any of the evacuation routes? And can you touch on that topic in any way? I know that you know some of it is a little sensitive, but if you could, you know chime a little bit of light on that sure. Absolutely so something I can show about how we handle this. On our other projects, so when we work on our proposals, we review them with the fire department to talk about emergency access along the corridors, and although our off-peak design will take the lane down to a single traveling, it would include markings that I indicate no standing any time allowing for people to have an extra space to pull over and out of the way if there's some passing - but as I mentioned earlier. This will also have two lanes open during the peak period during the day time period. So it's really a combination of you know, standing any time, markings getting sort of a release valve for the traffic and also that rush hour lane will help facilitate some any additional traffic. I didn't in a scenario where a full evacuation of Manhattan would be necessary, and you know in case of something very serious that would happen to Manhattan. Do you have any input from I? Don't know, for example, the NYPD counterterrorism unit that deals with these issues? Do you get any input from you know, other local state or federal agencies? I'm just know? If really, we are in a in a bad situation, I want to make sure and want to have the confidence that you know we're not creating a problem for the very unlikely, hopefully a situation where we would need to evacuate the whole island its if I could just chime in for a second I. Don't know if you guys can hear me, but yep we can. My name's Ted I run the bike program. It's a good question. This isn't the kind of thing that we usually go over with counterterrorism. That said, one of the big differences between this design and that stop the other things that you've seen in Midtown is that we've been we've really gone to one lane in most places here we're keeping the two lanes, because this is such an important corridor to move vehicles on for some of the reasons like you're, exactly saying, you need to be able to have this release valve as you come into 37 on. Basically, the tunnels on both sides, so I feel like it does accommodate that you know if it was late at night, you know they would be parked up. I think that's what Ilene is talking about and it's a good question. I would say that we have gone over with FDNY. That would be something that they would talk about, but I think that, like most of the time well, the way we look at this is during the rush hour when the most vehicles are moving. We want to make sure that those numbers vehicles can continue and people can get out. So I hope that answers your question and just to clarify that. Thank you so much. It's actually super helpful, but do you get input from NYPD yeah, not as project-specific as FDNY, but some of it I think we've talked to them about this I. Don't I can't remember if it was the exact specifics, it's kind of we haven't talked to the counterterrorism people I, don't believe unless somebody else knows differently, maybe Colleen or so we don't talk to counterterrorism, but we do share the presentation with the local precincts in the area and as Ted mentioned, we do get the blessings a review of FDNY. Okay. Thank you. We have a question from Barbara Blair Barberini. Yes, can you hear me okay? My question is on duty: are those protected lanes since you have the curb the fight, brain and then Park traffic, and could they be painted green? Yes, these would be painted green. Currently, the temporary lanes do not have green paint, because it's just temporary paint, so they would include green paint just like in our previous crosstown lanes, which really helps to clarify to drivers not to Parkin them, and you know where people can expect to see them riding a city. Bus over okay I would only add, and then out stand down that when the lanes are painted green, whether they're protected or not, it's a visual trigger for the vehicles and it's incredibly helpful, I'm gonna, add really quickly something that I think why we're back this month. Is that we're doing our youngest to go out there, replace the barrels long and get into Prairie lanes temporary lines and lean just said about putting Deborah green, it's so critical. So that's why we wanted to kind of get to you guys and get this thing down as soon as we can now granted. I can't promise and we're still ramping up, but I think it's something to your point. Barb agree. Thank you. That's helpful. Thank you, know, I'm just kind of a general question, which is that you know this sort of and correct me. This is wrong, but this sort of completes the set of protected bike lanes, spaced at half miles for Midtown going across town, and so you know I, it's filling the gap that exists now and if I'm understanding this correctly, you would not be aiming to slot in more Midtown crossed across time protected bike corridors following this one. Is that correct? Yes, in this area completely south, okay, yep and you've, obviously detailed cross site? It's interesting that you say that, because there has been a lot of success and people have looked at these in bikers, like them, but I think there are other places of the city, especially north of here, where we've heard some interesting, so I'll just throw that in as a caveat, but it's not in you're, not in Midtown, proper yep yeah. That's that makes sense, and you detailed why 38 and 39 were the most obvious or most amenable corridors for slotting, something in between the 20s and the 50s, which makes sense so, though, as you've detailed comes with some additional caveats, such as the desire to not go down to a single lane of traffic for this corridor for the whole day. You know I'm just generally wondering how closely after installation and I guess after traffic levels returned to normal. Theoretically in particular, would you be looking at whether or not there is increased congestion near the tunnel for traffic trying to enter the tunnel after you've reconfigured this corridor? And what would what would count as success or concern when you're looking at those levels afterwards, Eileen, perhaps can add more, but what I would say right now? The hardest thing about my job and all of our jobs D-O-T is that we are dealing with a situation. That's going to be different. We don't we have data from this from a year ago, which is helpful, the data that we get coming up and how we rate this that's going to be very difficult to do. What you've just said. I will say, though, the tunnels are a little bit unique because they're kind of you know they're the end of a funnel. You can't really squeeze much more in there, so I think it's gonna be really hard to look at data. I know, that's it's a non-answer, but I think it's probably the hardest thing that we're all dealing with on a day to day basis when we talk about all of our projects. So the fact that we're leaving two lanes in here is a big plus and I would have to that, but also the some of the reasons why we avoided. For example, thirty six and thirty seventh was those main access points to and from the tunnel on. The east side were primarily those streets are used so know about 38 and 39, wouldn't be the primary corridors to access the east side tunnel for most people. Okay, thank you. Mike K back you've a hand raised Mike, you should be able to press unmute. Is there any need for traffic signals for bicycles on the 38th or 39th Street? Yes, we'll be installing split phases here, Melissa, basically we'll be using a few different intersection designs. Some locations already have signals that can just be upgraded with this lens, for the cyclists phase at other locations will be installing new split phases and those are locations jaylee, where those turn volumes are higher at other locations that are lighter. We use this thing called an offset crossing which accommodates the terms by design rather than by the signal. Thank you, BJ yep, just a quick question going back to the: how would you enforce the rush-hour traffic flow in terms of the parking regulations? Yes, so generally PD has enforced regulations such as rush hour lanes, narasimhan's and other initiatives in Midtown, such as the clear curbs and clear lanes that have similar uses of the curbside rush-hour lanes. So we would follow that model. We can try to get more specifics as to exactly how that would be handled and share that back with you, but so that so for the cyclists, it won't be enforced that during rush hour, 38 to 39 streets, for example, it's not something that would be applied to the cyclists for that rush hour. Well, so right, so basically the proposed design, the cyclists can continue whether it's the rush hour or the non rush hour. So their side of the street won't really change. The parking lane will stay in place at all times, so the opposite curb is where the rush hour lane would alternate with an off-peak loading lane. So it's really. This is more of our typical design and then this is what kind of brothers and some of those properties of the clear lanes or the clear curbs work, we're adding capacity at locations so to be more of a parking enforcement or traffic enforcement for the vehicles there and the cyclists used, wouldn't really change and I. Think do you know if those are study done to see I know you said that 39th and 38th were not the main quarters to get to tunnel and 37 primaries. So if 38 and 39 those lanes are narrower or traffic flows, more congested, I'm wondering what 37 get more as it is. Eight babby and 37 as people are turning I, think left to come on to 37 as it's not a regular traffic flow. So I'm wondering is there going to study to show what percentage or what's the increase going to be, because then that means that traffic will be backed up on eighth Avenue as well, since 38th and 39th is going to be best. That's suggested speak to this and Eileen helped me out here, but that's the reason. That's the primary reason why we're leaving two lanes in place like there are today is that we don't want to see I think break down as people come in and out of these major gateways to the city and the design on the east side is a little different. It will actually follow more of the additional travel lanes that are already in place there and so that the designer that you said will accommodate the current number of lanes that it also has generally and I. Think you're, like Ted said we have the two lanes so during those peak periods, that's when they expect to see them used the most okay. Thank you thank you, so not seeing any hands raised right now, I'll kind of ask one final question with all these other proposed bike lanes that we've that you guys have come to tell us about in the past, including the 20s, the 50s 6th, Avenue 8th, Avenue, we've passed a resolution. Would you be looking for something similar today to get the sense of community board 5 and perhaps its support for this proposal today? It's always somebody else can pipe in. It's always helpful for us to get that. Yes, okay, thank you. So, with one last check to see if there are any more questions, I'm, not seeing any will, as a committee we'll take it into a committee discussion to talk about what, if any actions the committee wants to take right now, I'll simply start the discussion by pointing out you know, as I just said, we have for all these other for all the other bike lanes that have been installed over the last two or three years. The committee has generally and with a lot of consensus, approved the general concept and execution of all of them, usually with for the almost boilerplate, with four resolves for four stipulations number one saying that we approve the plan number two in insisting that do t come back after execution with data to tell us how it's going to tell us what changes have taken place, etc. Number three: we with almost every resolution that we passed as a committee talk about enforcement and the fact that we want to see better enforcement now. I'll attach the caveat here that there is a much larger discussion right now about how much enforcement NYPD should be doing in many different domains and whether or not it can be handled by other enforcement models. So you know I'll just put a pin in that, but generally we do call on enforcement of the existing laws to help. You know say this reconfiguration succeed and number four. We generally call on deity to do as much outreach and teaching of good cycling behavior as possible, which often also calls on D-O-T to expand the street ambassadors program to as much as possible again understanding that funding is always an issue to encourage good cycling, behavior and teach the rules of the road again -, hopefully maximize success as much as possible, so I sort of just want to lay out what we usually do for the committee I. You know generally personally think that this does kind of complete the set of what do T has been pursuing over the last several years in terms of crosstown bike lanes. I generally understand the rationale as to why these streets were selected, why this configuration was selected and I think that it's at least as well executed as all the other ones. So with that being said, does anyone on the committee have any other thoughts that would preclude us from talking about the way that we have been talking about the other elements of Midtown, crosstown, protected bike lanes or any thoughts in general, not seeing any hands from the committee? So you know I, think I think in the absence of any concerns or deviations, we would probably draft up a resolution again largely along lines of what we have said for similar proposals that we agreed with and liked, and attached enforcement and outreach stipulations -. Are there any countervailing thoughts or otherwise, just general support for that approach? Any one from the committee still on the call with me. Sorry we're not hand raised from Noah I. Don't it's important that you know this bike lane gets executed because it's just it's dangerous for cyclists to ride in one of the one of the city's busiest areas that I've almost gotten in an accident numerous times from cars, just thinking that they can speed and ignore whatever is going on right beside them, so I think it's a good prop. Is it's a good proposition that should be a executed? Okay! Thank you. Noah Jordan, thanks CJ and thanks tott Jason, your specific question about how to proceed. I, agree. I think this makes sense, along with our other, like resolutions, understanding that this is an interesting time for a city and a number of ways, but I don't see why those current issues and future issue should impact what this made us. So for that data cost fashion. Okay, thanks Jordan! Are there any other thoughts from the committee or otherwise any motions relative to the template resolution, as I sort of laid it out, not a hand from jewel, Joe I would move to approve what you laid out with those caveats in the, whereas clauses thank I, don't there's a second okay thanks! Very much for the motion and the second and with that template of a resolution we can go ahead and take this to a vote. So I'll run down the roll call and, as usual, go ahead and make sure you're unmuted, as your name comes up, I'll go authentically and you can go ahead and give me a yes or no yea or nay BAE whore, yes, Clark it's Clark still in the car with us. Can you hear me yep? You can hear me? Yes, we can Oh fantastic I. Yeah I've been trying earlier to say that I would be open to making our, whereas that regards enforcement just making that directly dependent on whatever principles come out of that last Genda item that were discussing today, so maybe exploring changing the specific wording that we've used in the past I'm. Sorry I wasn't able to put you in with my comment earlier. No worries thanks for thanks for saying so and yeah. That's generally, what I thought would be a good way to execute it in general, along the lines of the principles that we will discuss. So thanks, Chris I know you, okay sounds good Dale! Welcome back to Dale Goldman! Yes, so thanks Dale : go show Hartman! Yes, Lucic! Yes, parson, yes, ray bar! Yes stern! Yes, BJ sung! Yes! Schinkel! Did you join us? Yes, I'm here, your vote is yes, thank you web. Did you join us? Yes, and your vote is a yes thank you waylynn! Yes, hi Calais, yes, Lehmann! Yes, with the caveat, assuming that the important language has changed. Okay, thank you for rolling with our technical logistics. I, just like to note that if you're joining us from a phone Chris, you can do this too. You can unmute yourself by pressing star six and raise your hand by pressing star nine thanks all right. That resolution obviously passes unanimously. So we'll draft up a resolution of support that will go to the full board in two weeks time. The next item on our agenda is: do t, addresses questions regarding the 14th Street bus way and also proposed Fifth Avenue Brest bus way, so I'll get back to whoever's appropriate, do T to either present anything that you might have to present or to to field questions. Sure I'm back. So we don't have any formal presentation, but we do have Alison and Chelsea here, I believe from our transit development team to help answer questions. But essentially, as you all know, the mayor announced the better buses restart to help speed up buses in key locations around the city during recovery and as part of that decided to make the 14th Street Bus way permanent and just a good clarification on that. We know. We've had a lot of discussions with community boards and other stakeholders throughout the several months since it went into place and we've talked about potential changes and those discussions are not over we're still looking to make updates. Unfortunately, all of our implementation, this year, has been slowed due to the pandemic and due to our resources being so low, but we are still looking to make some updates and keep looking at it. So I just want make sure that everyone understands it just because it's permanent doesn't mean that it's permanent in the exact same condition that it is right now, but we did see really good numbers over the months when it was first installed and then, of course, we've had have not been able to collect data in the same way that we were during the first several months, and so we're happy to feel questions about that as far as fifth avenue we're looking to do something similar, but obviously the roadway is very different. So we don't have a final plan yet and we will be looking to set up a Community, Advisory, Board and cert meetings as soon as next week to take bring people together. We know that the mayor announced it would be implemented in July and obviously this is not a big time for community board meetings. That's a very accelerated schedule, so we're looking to at other ways of bringing people together to talk through the design and regulations, but Alison and Chelsea are here as well to add anything to that and then to answer our questions as needed: okay, Alison Chelsea! Do you have anything to add immediately or do you want me to dive right into a question? I think Kim covered most of it, yeah we're just at the very beginning of our process, so we will be, as Kim said, setting up a Community, Advisory Board, but right now you know we're starting from scratch. Here we don't have a design, you know. Obviously we have the double bus lane on Fifth, Avenue and buses. Are, you know very important portion of carrying people down Fifth Avenue, so you know we want to do everything we can to maintain that, but we also know that there are many needs for people trying to get around fifth and access streets adjacent. So we want to make sure to consider all of that. Okay, thanks. Can you talk at all about what the structure of the Community Advisory Board is going to be in this in the current climate? Will it will meet by zoom? What so? What's that going to look like I would say like we zoom as we start to move forward into the various phases of reopening, we can talk about potential site visits and things like that, but I think we'd probably be avoiding large-scale workshops, so primarily assume you have a sense of how many times it yeah do you have a sense of how many times it could potentially meet and how quickly you plan to iterate on the design if it needs to be implemented in July and then I guess also whatever gets implemented in July. Will that be temporary materials or will it be more permanent materials? Al some can maybe add a little bit of detail, but I think we will aim to meet at least several times. Maybe weekly or bi-weekly give that July is very soon and also just to make the point that this is certainly different than our typical process, and we would continue to me even after inflammation implementation starts, so we would continue to have conversations and have it our iterative design. All of our material is typically are fairly temporary. I, don't know if Allison you can add to like any specific last night. I think we would be using I mean science art the best way. It's really the signs that make the biggest change right, because that's what changes service, the regulations and the restrictions for through vehicles or for curved bands and those are always changeable, so yeah, and this was announced as a one-year pilot. So it is something that we see. You know that we want to obviously get something in fairly quickly as the city's starting to recover. You know to provide options for people as they are going back to work and just traveling more, but it is something that we do see as iterative and as Kim said like that, the main piece right of a bus way that distinguishes it from a bus lane or from some other treatment, is the limitation of traffic traveling through on Fifth Avenue. But the you know, kind of the basic structure I think we would start from is obviously maintaining buses along 4th Avenue truck traffic having a transit truck priority street, like what we have on 14th Street. Maintaining local access in the area, and a lot of that is done initially, can be done with signage and then, as we kind of see how the traffic pattern adjusts and as people are, you know starting to travel more. We have kind of a sense of how the area is behaving and then we have, you know more capacity on Fifth Avenue to do other things as well. Okay, thank you, I'm, just taking a look at our calendar, there would likely not be an opportunity after you, because our community board doesn't meet next month. I believe there would probably not be an opportunity after your design, but before implementation to come back to us. Is that correct not as a board, but we would want you to be part of the advisory board that makes sense, and then we could come back in September or I guess. The end of August is what near September meeting is and talk through, what's been done, and what we're looking to adjust or hear feedback and that okay, the other thing I'll add off the bat. Is you know, even as it's framed as a one-year pilot project, I think what we've learned from past experience, and also now from the 14th Street being made permanent? Our probably default position is just going to assume that this you know should be considered as though it's going to be again an iterative and constantly changing, but potentially a long term situation, not necessarily something that is in our minds temporary. Certainly, if we see success with increasing bus speeds and reliability and ridership, we would move in that direction. I think that's just us. Our committee learning from experience at this point I'll throw this to members of the committee at this point. Are there other questions on what we've heard so far? I'll just say for myself that, given the calendar, given the time that we're in and given how quickly it sounds like this process is going to move, we would certainly appreciate being involved in the community advisory council, since there isn't say a proposal for us to assess and vote on tonight and there wouldn't be that opportunity before it gets implemented. You know I'd be curious to hear from the rest, the committee whether they agree with my assessment on that as well. Jordan, yes, CJ thanks I do agree. I think what happened in 14th Street was concerning. Specifically, we had a lot of community input from some of our elderly neighbors, about not being able to, for example, get a taxi on 14th Street for medical appointments, and that wasn't really addressed just kind of like thanks for your input and we're gonna move forward. I understand that there are a lot of stakeholders and when you're running in interesting programs like this, not everyone saves taken to account. But my concern is a repeat of something like that: yep I, agree, I, think I think it's a good flag. I think we need to learn from during the design of what sounds like. It's definitely a moving forward of the something going into 5th Avenue I think we need to learn from what happened on 14th Street, most specifically, some of the some of the education issues and some of the situation's of, like you, said elderly residents not able to get a get a yellow cab, not able to get an uber or a ride share of any kind. Sam yeah thanks I, just wanted to add one of the things that's come up frequently is the location of bus, jumps and I know that they're in some movement of bus stops journey early days when the bus way was the old train shut down and then there's some construction occurring at various corners that are directly adjacent or next to the subway entrances and I. Think, as the bus way continues to progress, it would be good if there was some community input about where those bus stops are, but also keeping in mind that if we're gonna have a bus way having the bus stops adjacent or next to the subway entrances was a principle that had generally been regarded as an important one by elderly, but also people with mobility challenges thanks Sam Noah. This is this is a question via t, but are there plans to change the existing bus infrastructure in terms of I know when the 14th Street bus way was implemented both of the 14 a and the 14 D were converted to a select bus service? So are there any plans going into that because I know there are numerous bus lines that run along 4th Avenue yeah, so there? Actually, there are 39 routes between the locals and the Express routes that all converge on 5th on 5th Avenue. As far as we know, no, there are no plans to change any of the routes at this time. We are working closely with MTA. You know, as we always do and we'll you know, have them involved in this in the CA B and throughout this whole planning process. So if we do hear of any changes they will be making to routing, you know we'll definitely take that into consideration. You know they are obviously ramping up service as we're coming out of recovery, and so that is something we're trying to time with. This is that you know, as they are getting more service up and running and providing more availability for people to take the bus that the bus way you know would be available perfect thanks from other attendees. We've got a question from buzz. Oh yes, thank you very much, I'm pleased to be able to talk to the D-O-T people. My name is James Byron I'm, a member of community board five, but I am NOT here in that capacity I'm here in the capacity of the president of our small tenant occupied co-op on 15th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, when the 14th Street bus way was proposed. We of course had tremendous concerns about the increase of traffic on our street. We met with Commissioner trottenberg and we were promised that this was only temporary. The same words used with regard to 5th Avenue I might add, but this was only temporary during the l-train shutdown and that there would be a thorough review of the old 14th Street situation before it was made permanent and we would have a chance to make our input known based on the one-year or whatever it was at the time that the 14th Street bus way was, in effect due to the El train. I can't tell you how shocked we all were listening to wim s a couple of weeks ago to hear mayor de Blasio just simply announce that the bus way was being made permanent and we were never contacted we by D-O-T or by anyone. We don't know if traffic counts were done on our street. The traffic is tremendously increased. As far as we know, there was no input from the people in the neighborhood into the decision. If you go to the corner of 15th Street and Fifth Avenue, you can see, the car is simply lined up to make the right turn on to 15th Street. Our street, which we never had before so my question- that's my declaratory statement about where we are. My question is: was the transportation committee ever consulted, or was data given to you by the D-O-T or through any other agency of the of the of the city government regarding the transition to permanent status, who supplied it? If they did, we were never contacted about that. Where are their electeds involved? And what can we do now? We, in fact the one thing we were promised was a big know through truck sign which has never been erected. What can we do now about the tremendous increase in traffic on our one lane of traffic Street between Fifth and Sixth, Avenues and I- assume it goes over. You know continues down 15th Street as well. So it's a question for the community board and for the Transportation Committee of exactly what actions you will take to either remediate or reverse the situation. So, in terms of data that we received, we've got a report after implementation of 14th Street that included data theoretically around the increase in traffic and congestion on side streets. It's something that I think should continue to be looked at and that we should continue to get reports on, because the data that we that was read out to us by Sam Schwartz, which had been had been hired by D-O-T I, guess it's, the correct terminology. I indicated no or negligible uptick of traffic on side streets, which of course is not what we hear often anecdotally from actual residents of the side streets such as 15, so I think it's something I think that is something that we need to rectify. Both can't be true. So we, as a committee, got a report after 14th Street was implemented. We of course still thought at the time that it was a temporary pilot project and you know I would turn around and pose a question to do. T is data from 14th Street going to be an integral part of the planning process and the community council meetings that you will set up is that something is that data, something that can be reviewed in that venue for the community that sort of feels like they see a disconnect with the data. Their experience on side streets between their experience and the and the data that you kind of continue to see and collect relative to the side streets I. Let Allison speaks of looking at that data in the context of Fifth Avenue. Just note that we did have two quarterly reports that are still available on sensuousness website, so you are able to go and access data, and also that we did collect a lot of public feedback through business surveys and community surveys and to this regular interaction from folks I. We feel that a lot of calls and emails over the months and did get a good sense of what a lot of the issues were and can continue to be in some cases. Just add that but Allison I want you to speak to, but using that data for fifth avenue and how that works, yeah, so 14th Street data at least gives us. You know a kind of idea of the types of data that we're collecting and how will be monitoring the corridor, but every quarter is different and I. Think you know one role we see with the Community Advisory Board is that it will be ongoing not just through the planning, but also through the implementation and the pilot and we'll be monitoring. We've been talking with our signals, crews and our signage crews, about how will be monitoring the corridor and having people out there in person, but obviously having the eyes and ears of the community out. There, too, is very important and so I think the CA B will provide also a forum for us to hear from you and look for those inconsistencies. You know between what we might see in the data and on paper and isolated issues that people are seeing on the corridor, so I think the CA B will give us a good way for Fifth Avenue to address that. Our concern, of course, is not 5th Avenue. It's the impact of 14c, unless you want to make no right turn at 15th, Street I love that 1500 fifth on 215 came in right. Put a no right, turn sign there and you cure everything for us, but that's a little selfish. You never know both yeah, so I. You know to answer your very valid question: I think we're sort of at the mercy of the summer schedule at this point and we're of course sorta at the Murphy at the mercy of how accelerated the busway projects will continue, especially because 14th Street is being extended as well. That's my understanding. The mess away at south won't be extended. The bus lanes, which currently do not have the transit and check restrictions, priority restrictions, the bus may restrictions which only go from ninth to third. There are currently lanes from third to first those lanes that don't have the restrictions will be from 1st Avenue C. So it's not a longer stretch. That's play. Okay! Thank you yeah. So you know again dealing with dealing with the calendar. The way we are I think what we as a committee, you know again, we don't have a. We really don't have a proposal that we could debate and take a position on tonight. Others on the committee can, let me know if they, if they think otherwise, but to me, there's not there's not much specificity here yet with which to weigh in on so that leads me to think that we have two main avenues: one in terms of fifth Street, sorry, fifth avenue to participate as much as feasible in the community advisory board, as that goes forward to try to use what has been learned from 14th Street and to have a voice via that planning vehicle. Since our more traditional community board cycle is doesn't really line up with the except with the accelerated schedule here. Secondly, I you know I think we would just. We would love to continue to learn what you're learning about 14th Street so appreciate you pointing us back to the two quarterly reports. I think the last time Sam Schwartz came to our committee. It was after the first one, so we should definitely take the opportunity offline to dig into the second one, but we would also very much appreciate I think to Buzz's point, perhaps two months from now, when our committee is back in session, for whatever it is, the August cycle, maybe getting a readout on what you learned from the code from the progressive to quarterly reports, and maybe whether or not more data is helping to explain more of what residents are seeing on those side streets and then, certainly, if you want to put in the no right turn as Bosley just makes everyone happy. Yeah I can talk also about the updates that we do plan that are just not finalized it because of our imitation schedule, but some of the turn lanes and signal timing, changes and regulations updates and that sort of thing. Okay, thank you. So, anyway, you know I'll, throw it back to the to the committee one more time to see if there are any other thoughts at this at this point in time, I don't think, there's a logical board action for us to propose tonight and I'd like to get a sense of whether the committee thinks that as well, BJ yeah just a kind of a related question. You might not know this yet from the Department of Transportation, but based on the 14th Street weather, both the comments from the community as well as you know, people who are upset about it, but it's at the same tone. Are you also looking at 42nd Street quarter to do that for the m42 bus? Wait all right like, for example, are you planning any other bus ways? No, so we did do some improvements, some upgrades to the bus lanes of one 42nd Street last year, but we don't have plans to do a bus way type treatment there. Thank you any other comments from the committee or just overall thoughts on those two ways that I mentioned to try and stay engaged with each of these. With the developments of each of these bus ways or any other potential ways we could we could stay engaged as opposed the question. Okay. Well, not at this point, seeing any other hands from the committee I think, that's probably how we'll plan on moving forward. So thank you for thank you for fielding those questions. I'm sure we'll continue to be in touch as much as possible, as in particular that 5th Avenue plan develops and yes would very much appreciate the next time it's useable on the calendar for you folks to come back and continue to keep us read into 14th Street. Now that now that we know we have to think about in a different way, just EJ I, don't know if this is out of order, but they there have been some hands raised from the public I, don't know if you want to I'm sorry, I did not I do not see those I want to give them an opportunity to UM to speak as well, especially since I recognize some of the names Gail Fox. Please go ahead, okay, hi! Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay, Kimberly mentioned that you would still be looking at modifications regarding the 14th Street plus way so I'm asking for some detail on what the modifications might be and I'm asking who is on the Citizens Advisory Board and then. Lastly, you know you have all my letters on file and I will just say the busway doesn't work for me. So I would very much like the answers to those two questions and I. Thank you. So I think it makes sense for us to come back in September with those changes, because we are still tweaking things and I'm working through and I. Think I'd have to be able to give you better answers when we have like a full agenda item with maybe a presentation and some folks from our 14 suite team. But the second piece was the we don't have a Advisory Board planned for 14th Street. We have it for Fifth Avenue, so you've got nothing. Okay! Well, we've been engaging with the community for a while on 14th Street, so we it's in a different place than 5th Avenue, which we're just kicking off and looking for ways to engage over the accelerated timeframe and during the summer when we don't have our standard or more standard that community Ford process. Please contact me Kimberly. Do you? Do you suspect that you would be able to come back to us in two months time with those proposed changes to 14th Street before they get implemented like what's your time? What's your timetable on those changes that we're talking about 14th Street, a really good question and I: don't have the answers yet and it's? It may be a mix of things. There are some changes. For example, we've talked with folks at site, visits and other times about potentially making changes to University Place, which might include like a reversal of a block or something like that and that would have to go to the community board, would C be to other things like parking regulation. Changes is something that sorry come back later. Please sorry, children that we might, that really are responsive to things that we have been hearing that maybe it might make sense for us to do before community board okay and to the other question at least as far as fifth avenue is concerned. What can you tell us right now about what the structure of the Community Advisory Board will be? Who do you who do plan on, certainly and I, said officials, our community board and stakeholders from on the corridor, be it property owners or others and like to get some representation from West writers as well? We're also open to recommendations, even if there are folks that you think should be involved, we're always happy to have suggestions from the board, since you guys have sometimes more detailed knowledge of who has interesting area. We should just a reader I think I said this, but just in case we should be hearing from us like in over the next few days, or at least this week about like a pulmonary discussion this next week. Okay, we will. We will look forward to hearing from you on that. There's another comment from Joseph Bauman. Just up just press unmute got it. Can you hear me now? Yes, good yeah I'm, the president of the olympic tower condominium association, which is, as weeny of you know, is at the corner of 51st and 5th avenue. So obviously we have an interest in the proposals concerning the busway for fifth avenue and I take it. Yeah I came prepared with a number of specific questions. It sounds like this is still in the formative stages. Our concerns are pretty obvious, but the in a broader sense. It has to do with the fact that we're now considering a north-south corridor rather than an east-west corridor. I presume that traffic would be diverted, since it's coming downtown, it's something like 57th Street, that's a pretty heavily trafficked corner as anybody who has been on that corner during a parade knows that ends in that strip. Also concerned has been mentioned about the fact that the nearest through streets going south would be to Park Avenue or seventh Avenue. It's not like walking one block to get to a another downtown street, but I guess what I'm hearing most significantly is with this creation of a Citizens Advisory Board that could include stakeholders who do I contact to express an interest in potentially joining that that's for me, Kimberly, okay, I could find your contact info. I can type it in great yeah. If you could just chat it, yeah I think I could leave it at that at this point, because, obviously a lot of these issues are to be burned to be discussed and resolved. Okay, Thank You Joseph. There was another hand from a from a phone number I believe it was a phone ending in three to two and doesn't seem to still be there. But was there a question owned number ending in three two - you've been unmuted, so feel free to go ahead. If you do that, I apologize I must have press the button in error. Okay, no worries: I'm gonna, go to committee member Nancy I'm very concerned about the answer that D-O-T gave to Gayle Fox regarding the 14th Street bus way. I know we've passed that topic, but the fact that he doesn't know what's going on and has not been spoken to is really troubling to me, because Gayle has come before our committee and before the full board many times to be heard by D-O-T, so I'm asking is there a way that we can get a list of the community members that do T is reaching out to regarding the 14th Street bus way? Do we have that and can we get it I think I'd? Add to that question and again I'm sorry to flip-flop back and forth between the 5th Avenue project and the 14th Street project, but yeah would be good. It would be good to have more detail on what if any, ongoing community engagement looks like on the 14th Street bus way. Is there? Is there any sort of community advisory board that is or will continue to meet and incorporate community voices gaile, as the tweaks that you talked about get assessed as the data continues to be looked at outside of say just coming back to UM community board five sure it's a fair question. I think you know our plan was to have more quarterly reports and that involved probably more discussion with folks at the community board some more opportunities to give feedback. Of course, the reports may have not continued them, because the data collection during the pandemic doesn't make any sense, as we can't compare it to any meaningful data from the past and the traffic conditions are so different. So we don't, at this point, have a sweatshirt way of receiving feedback around 14th Street, but that we can certainly think about that. Yeah I think as I think as Gail and Nancy and others have said. I, particularly because there'll be a gap with even the community board being able to hold a meeting. That's on some sort of return to engagement around 14th Street as its status continues to be updated and be in consistent. Development with community members like Gail, would I think be more than appropriate. So I think we would strongly recommend regular engagement with those community members who are trying to speak out and get in touch with you. Thank you just looking at raised hands here, we've got a Jerome Barth during Rome. You should be able to unmute hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Thank you. Sorry I'm not used to resume formats on my phone. Thank you to duty for presenting and thanks to keyboard, for picking up the issue of the best one to Avenue, representing the Fifth Avenue Association I just wanted to let everyone know it just a really fair amount of concern and excitement also about the potential best way and in particular, reminding people that care access, particularly taxis and ubers, and others are a critical way to get shoppers to all the stores on Fifth Avenue, which represents a significant economic agent in this. In this district and there's a great deal of concern about how any proposed changes which right now or not very well defined, it seems, will impact a halt before commercial corridor between let's say the lower 60s and 42nd Street, so just something where we're looking forward to discussing with the community board and UT, but that that's very much on everybody's minds. Thank You Jerome on to that point. Do T folks can really do. Are there any details that you know already there like, for example, is it can you say guarantee at this point that taxis and cars will theoretically be able to turn on for one block to make pickups and drop-offs similar to 14th Street, or is everything more or less up in the air pending the planning process that you talked about as far as I know, there's no intention of removing local access. We've learned how critical that is and I assumed it would be maintained. I, don't think there was a version in which it's not, but Allison can maybe add to that yeah. That's right! Yeah we'd want to make sure that we are maintaining access to every block on Fifth Avenue, even for vehicles. They can't continue down the corridor and you know we want to make sure that we also consider pickup drop-off areas on both sides of the street. So you know, as we get further into the process, I think that's something we want to look carefully at block by block kind of acknowledging that every block is a little different and just making sure you know that we are meeting the needs of where people need to be where they need to access where they need to pick up drop-off. Okay, thank you. I think I think we're learning that the that the fifth avenue stakeholders and residents will be. You know quite interested in the process around that advisory board. I'm gonna go to Vincent Potrero and then we'll go back to Joseph Baumann Vincent, hi, I've spoken to Kimberly and Thank You Kimberly for the information you've given me, I represent the Metropolitan Park Association and we have members with parking garages on many of the side, streets or Fifth Avenue along this stretch and I think especially now, with businesses still trying to recover just beginning phase two that this is not the time to stop whatever to prevent automobiles from getting to garages, so they can think so. People can park, spend money, go into offices, etc. Now is the time to want cars to come in and drive. You know, there's no traffic right now. You know it's not the time to be limiting things, and even though we hear that you know, car axis is going to be allowed, I mean to allow a car to go one block or one and a half blocks is really not the answer along Fifth Avenue, it's you know, I think it bad enough on 14th Street, but this is much different than 14th Street. It's a wider one-way street, so I just want to. You know, throw that out as you as you proceed, and also just remind everyone that the parking were is an essential business even under the under the governor's guidance, because parking garages have now been parking essential employees for all these months: doctors, nurses, law enforcement and other people that work in the essential businesses that are open and now that other businesses, starting to slowly reopen. We just need a place for these people to park. A lot of people are still afraid of mass transit, which I know and I hope it's going to subside soon. So people can go back to mass transit, but I just want to throw that out and also be a part of the Advisory Council. Thank you. Okay, Thank You, Vincent Joseph. He put his hand down well, okay, feel free to raise it again. If you do have a question. Joseph Nancy gotcha, with regard to the question by the public on access to stores along Fifth Avenue, keep in mind that a fourteenth Street near a model for this type of program. It's almost impossible in a taxi, a ubirr, an uber or anything picked up anywhere along the 14th Street bus way. So in terms of access to the sidewalk, 14th Street bus way has been complete. Familiar I think the D-O-T needs to keep that in mind and figure out a way to fix that thanks. Nancy I'll. Add on to that something that I suppose I just realized, which is that I know that a door-to-door survey of businesses on 14th Street was a key part of collecting data before implementing that bus way and I. Don't know if you have an answer to this right now, but I'm wondering what the equivalent will be for soliciting testimonials from the businesses on Fifth Avenue, if you can't currently or if the desire is not to show up in person, while we're say, maintaining, reduce capacity and social distancing does do you folks at DoD have a have a plan for targeting those businesses in person. I, don't know what we do just yet, but I do think. We will like that's a great topic for discussion at the early advisory board meetings and some more depth on how to how to approach that, because I would say it's important. Okay. Thank you. Okay, I! Don't at this time see any other hands raised, as I mentioned, I think there's a lot of different paths forward on both projects that we that we've asked for continued engagement on, but I like I, said I, don't think, there's a board action to take tonight, and so, if there aren't any other questions or comments, I believe we can wrap that topic and move on to the next one. I also just want to point out and say thank you to the committee members and D-O-T for being here for what has been a little bit of a lengthy and but substantive committee meeting. So thanks everybody for your patience as we go through a number of different topics: we've one more topic on the on the agenda on the website and then, as the committee members know, we want to discuss potential principles to hand off to one of our peer committees, but right now we'll let D-O-T talk about pedestrian hands, myths around Central, Park, South and Grand Army Plaza. So we have books from our pedestrian unit. Almost everyone from duty tonight who are gonna talk about our proposal to make some changes in the area and such a Park South and Grand Army, Plaza building and some other previous work that was done in the area, so I believe it's me, I was gonna. Give the presentation she's here, hi I, hope everyone can see my screen I just shared it. Let me know: I still see a loading indicator, then now I can see your screen great hi. My name is MIA Moffat and I am a senior project manager in the pedestrian unit at the near City, Department of Transportation and I'm gonna be talking you through our proposal for Central Park South, Grand, Army, Plaza and 5th Avenue I'm gonna go over some background and updates to other work that we've done in the area for us. So in February 2000 and nineteen, there was a city hall, a Department of Health led rule change, which we located where the hack stands pick up and drop off. They used to be around granary Pazza and on Central Park, South and New York City dota, helped hope to this project by installing signage and some temporary markings in Central Park to help relocate these hack stands, we installed temporary markings and no paint was installed in a pedestrian spaces at these locations. Since then, we've been monitoring these operations and we've been working with the carriage operators, New York City Parks and the Central Park Conservancy. In order to understand how they're operating and make sure everything was going well and now we are ready to finalize these markings based on these working operations. This presentation is going to involve updates to these 2019 temporary hack stands, but I'm also going to go over a pedestrian safety project on Central Park South 59th Street around Grand Army Plaza. This just shows the two areas and how close they are to each other. So, looking at these temporary hack stands that we installed in 2019 on the East Drive. We installed a pedestrian boarding area in the center of the roadway and observations and talks, but the operators really realized that it's not functioning the way it was designed and the customers and the operators generally load and unload in where we designed the moving lane to be and not they're, not using a pedestrian boarding area at the 6th, Avenue hack stand, all of the markings were removed and only signs were installed in order to relocate the hack stand. I'm looking at 7th the 7th Avenue entrance hack stand, we installed the markings for the hack stand to be on the east side of the roadway by discussions with the hacks and operators was shown that it was a better location to move it to the west side of the roadway. So now we need to update the markings in order to reflect this. So looking at our the markings that we're going to be putting in on the East Drive hack, stand, we're gonna be moving the pedestrian boarding area to be adjacent to that center median there, which is how its operating now and we're also going to be installing a curb extension on the southwest corner of 60th, Street and 5th Avenue at sixth Avenue. We're gonna be installing the edge line for the hack stand and we're also be putting in a green bike lane leading into the park we'll also be installing a large pedestrian, curb extension in order to create a gateway entrance to Central Park. Here at sixth Avenue moving to seventh Avenue, we're gonna be installing pedestrian space along the Central Park Drive, and this is because a lot of the horse carriages are cueing back into this crosswalk and blocking pedestrians, but I'll also help to shorten pedestrian crossing distance. This year we will also be formalizing this pedestrian space on the east side of the roadway, and this will help pedestrians to have an entrance to the park away from where the Hawks stand is now located on the west side, because the Hawks stand is really using up that crosswalk that sidewalk there on the west side, and we will be installing curb extensions on Central Park South at 7th Avenue in order to create a gateway entrance here to the park as well, now I'm going to go over the existing conditions for our pedestrian safety project area. Looking at this area, it is on the southeast corner of Central Park. It is really high tourist destination, with a lot of high-end shopping like Bergdorf Goodman and the flagship Apple Store. Looking at the crash, there were five killed or severely injured persons from 2013 to 2017. Here and in 2014, two pedestrians were struck by vehicles and severely injured on 59th Street between Fifth Avenue and grand I mean closet and two separate incidents. So that would be right here. This section of the roadway looking at the existing conditions here, Fifth Avenue, Central Park South- is one way east of Fifth Avenue, but it functions as a thule roadway west of Fifth Avenue and the right-hand turn here. This is this red arrow is redundant as most traffic that is coming southbound on Fifth Avenue is routed around Grand Army Plaza at 60th Street, and this was this is shown with our traffic counts. We about three hundred and forty vehicles an hour, make this right-hand turn off of Fifth Avenue, and only about twenty. To thirty make this right-hand turn here. Looking at the curb space on 59th Street relocating the Hawks dance created an underutilized curb here on the North Avenue of 59th Street in between Grand Army, Plaza and Fifth Avenue, and all pedestrians crossing here have a significantly long crossing. It's about sixty six feet here across the road looking west on to Central Park South here last year, as part of the hack stand implementation. We also installed a horse only lane on the North curb of Central Park south and the curb regulation here is no standing any time, but it is frequently blocked by cars and buses, as you can see in this photo looking south to 58th Street, the city bike station across the street, from the Plaza Hotel constricts pedestrian movement here, and there is often illegal standing on the along the edge of the space looking at 50th, Street anger and are in Gaza. We have a missing crosswalk here on the east side of this intersection, and we also have an underutilized, no standing in time space on the north, curb of 58th Street between Grand Army, Plaza and Fifth Avenue. Here as well, now I'm going to go through our proposal for this area. Our proposal is to convert 59 from 5th Avenue to Grand Army Plaza one way eastbound. This will allow us to install a 24 foot wide, curb extension, taking this underutilized space and the moving Lane and the Central Park Conservancy is partnering with us to maintain this space will also be expanding. The horse only Lane on the north, curb of Central Park South between Grand Army, Plaza and 6th Avenue. This will allow us to harden the edge here with flexible posts, which we cannot do unless we allow space for streets for street sweeping which we need 11 feet. In order to allow that looking at 58th Street, we will be expanding. The our proposal is to expand the pedestrian space over city by station. Here we're also looking to install this missing crosswalk here on the east side of the intersection and install curb extensions on Central Park South here at Grand, Army Plaza, and also expand this curb to install another full, curb extension on 58th Street in between Grand Army, Plaza and 5th Avenue, and the central Parker's Conservancy is also partnering to obtain those spaces. There's the summary of all of the of our proposal, and let me know if you have any questions. Thank you. Thank you. There's anyone on the committee have questions Joel, sorry, I couldn't find the Avenue a couple of specific questions on the 58th Street. If you could show that there's there are two traffic lights, one where you have the number two and then the next one at Fifth Avenue, the one at Fifth Avenue, is to back up and cause additional backups at number two, because those lights are not timed. Is there any plan to time them not currently, but I can definitely look into that and get back to you about it. Second, just specific question: where you have the number one in front of the Plaza Hotel, usually double and sometimes triple and quadruple parking there is this sidewalk intended to help eliminate that? Yes, this is intended to not only provide pedestrian space, but to also stop the rampant double parking here same question. You don't show it here, but on the south side of Central Park South, going in front of the entire length of the Plaza Hotel tell puts out their own class date bollards and they take up two times. Three lanes of traffic makes it really difficult to bike there, but it also makes it difficult to drive it's dangerous. Is there any plan to work with the hotel or do anything so that their loading zone can be more formalized and narrowed so that bikes and cars can get by and I can speak to I've already, we really shouts of a Plaza Hotel and we plan to meet with them and discuss the proposal and talk through issues in the area, but we usually come to the committee boards first with our proposal and then meet with stakeholders like that. Okay, thank you all right, thanks, Joe Leila, Thank, You EJ and thank you deal TT for you, the representation. The initial our implementation of this plan was actually done with little engagement with your carriage industry. Can you actually detail the level of involvement you've had with this proposal? So for this proposal we did several walkers with the carriage operators and got their feedback and spoke to them, and I made a lot of adjustments based on feedback that I got from them personally on these walkers, and are they satisfied with the this proposal, or is there still seven Oh questions or concerns on their end? Believe that we have responded to everything that is feasible for us to do from like a traffic circulation perspective, there were some things that they wanted, like making 6th Avenue to way, and things like that we're just not possible from like a geometric perspective. Okay, thank you, hello and I'm Julio, Claire I'm, with the ped unit as well, and yo T and just three -. What me was just saying. We also are continuing to discuss since the rule change we've been having ongoing conversations with the carriage operators and we will end CPC and the parks department and we'll make more modifications as needed within the park to make the carriage and Haque stands operate effectively and efficiently with the new hub rule from last year. Okay, thanks very much not seeing any hands currently are they are there any other questions follow up question each age you would allow it yeah go for it. Thank you. So much I mean the initial plan was done without any consultation with the Elan Max Preservation Commission, and certainly with no consultation with the landmarks committee of this board. From what I can see. None of the work that you're proposing is inside the park for everybody's edification. Central Park is a scenic landmark and therefore anything that happens in the park should undergo review by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, and certainly for the sake of transparency. You know she should be presented. Can you confirm that indeed, none of the work that is being proposed is done adjacent or in connection or in you know like would be under the preview of LPC? So it is the work that we are doing around Grand Army out around Grand Army Plaza is in the purview of LPC, and we have already started discussions with them and have presented this to them. We're waiting for feedback, we're hoping to get it before this presentation, but we should have it tomorrow and are you planning to present this to the unlocks committee of CB, 5 next Tuesday, June, 30th and 6 p.m. fantastic perfect? Thank you. So much appreciate that. Oh, is that something we've talked about. I think I, think that's sorry, I did I did not hear if there was an answer from DoD. I was sort of just clarifying when landmarks, when our when we were two fives landmarks committee meets next, is presenting two landmarks, something that you're considering since this does affect the landmark I. Don't I, don't think that we had been planning to. But if that's something that you guys are interested in having us do, then we can certainly discuss that we would yeah well. We would certainly urge you to come and present to the Arlen Hawks committee. Okay, we can follow up with Wally and lip. Thank you so much. So let me know what you think clear. The any position that T&E would take today should be should be, you know, say limited to the to the pedestrian enhancements and the effect on pedestrians and should not be construed as validation of the whole plan as it pertains to other domains such as the landmark itself. Is that Leila? Do you think the correct way to approach this, to assess the plan from the two different perspectives separately with separate resolutions, or is there a better? Is there a better way of assessing this I think that if a TNA committee wanted to support a motion to request that do team versus project to the landmarks committee of cd5, so that we have a chance to weigh in on the historic appropriateness of what is being proposed? That would be great. We would certainly appreciate the support from TNA and I'm speaking. My capacity as chair of the landmarks committee right yeah I should have specified that yeah I'm curious to get the perspective of the rest of T&E as well. For the most part, pedestrian enhancements are good and more pedestrian. Space is good. If it's, if it's well thought out, so you know I, think potentially teenie could write a resolution taking a position on the benefit to pedestrians and then also referring the effects on the landmark - to our own landmarks committee or perhaps, if it's Vicky might be able to tell us as well whether a resolution is appropriate for that or a letter or something else Jordan. Do you have a question or comment on that issue and that's what I was going to say if we like what he's proposing and I for one do especially getting rid of that right term: southbound on Fifth Avenue over fifty nine shootings, redundant and dangerous. If we like what they proposed, you know, thankfully it was on the call here we can say that's great subject to approval by landmarks for those changes that are there. I think that's probably the way to go because I'm, not sure they're bringing it get another opportunity for setting like this for these changes. I agree that sounds pretty appropriate to me and just to reiterate what you just said, we would craft a resolution saying that we like the pedestrian enhancements for reasons XYZ and subject to landmarks. Likewise, approval of the effect of the plan on the on the landmark be resolved that we approved this proposal. I think I think that's the direction that I would go in as well. If I may just add very quickly. The initial proposal did not come to the other landmarks committee, although we made the request that deokee comes in presents, so I would greatly appreciate if it's you know something that is agreeable to be your tne committee, that there is an explicit request for deity to appear and present rly on. You know what materials are being used. How is it good? Look like you know, those are very important areas that are visited by thousands of people and tourists and residents and workers alike, so I think it's really important that we pay attention to this intersection on all respects. I think that's totally appropriate and our resolution can certainly be contingent. Our approval can be contingent on the plan. Also coming before the landmarks committee as well awesome, are there any other thoughts or points from members of T&E? It looks like we have a question from a member of the public. I haven't really been good about separating these two sections, so we will feel that Joseph, you can make your comment yeah thanks again for I hope, you're taking. My question is just listening to this: I wasn't planning on it as a nearby resident of this Plaza I'm, all in favor of expanding the pedestrian space there. So don't take this wrong, but combining a and B of what's been discussed tonight. You've got a project that has a direct adjacency to this project. Ie the bus way and I just ask is a reminder to those who are considering this that you could you take account of the fact that you're probably going to be looking for ways of diverting traffic down Fifth Avenue? If you go, hey I'll go ahead with the bus way and would make sure that this plan doesn't take away any options from that I think that's an excellent point and matches a theme where we always prefer a holistic and comprehensive look about how any changes affect the options and the overall traffic network of streets in the entire district. So that is also something that I think would be extremely appropriate to put in our resolution and condition our approval on. So seeing no other comments from folks who aren't on the committee will kind of move explicitly into our committee business session right now. Regarding this topic and I, you know folks, who have spoken up so far, seem to generally be supportive of these pedestrian enhancements with say some stipulations like Joel mentioned, examining whether or not time to lights are appropriate, suggesting that do t move forward with plans to talk to stakeholders like by the hotel that our pool will be conditioned on going to landmarks as well and considering network effect. Anyone on the committee have any other thoughts or want to make a motion looks like Joel. This is Henry's Joel go ahead. It just had a comment me if you could go back to the where the sixth Avenue entrance was reconfigured on the park side on the north side of Center Parcs hell, yes, so at number one, that's is that your new carriage parking area on the north side of that Drive? Yes, this is where the haxed and horse carriages are the number one in a ruinous. So could you go it's kind of narrow there, unlike the other X's, which are a little wider and there's plenty of room for people to get around for all the different users to get around at this entrance. There's a bike lane that comes well will be coming up: sixth Avenue, but there's a lot of bike traffic that goes in there's a huge city bike station there, but there's also a lot of bike traffic going the other way which that road is not designed to accommodate it's just it's too narrow and there's a sidewalk, that's kind of separated. So some of the pedestrians go on the sidewalk, but many of them just go in the roadway. Is there a way to I mean I, don't really know what to do cuz, it just seems too tight, but is there something that can be done to kind of mitigate the two-way traffic and pedestrians and hacks? Installing the bike lane here, putting in the curb extension should reinforce the one-way direction? Okay, so hopefully, these markings will help enforce that everything should be moving in one direction: the bike lane and everything. So, okay, that's! That is our plan to help enforce that. Okay, I didn't see the markings there. Okay, thank you and hey. This is Julio again and we did look. We did spend a lot of time looking at this. We do understand that this desire for this to a bike facility, but we just there's just not enough space for emergency vehicle access. The required hack stand part of the rule, change and minimally the one direction of bike lane. So this was well. We were just tethered to thanks Scalia, any other comments from members of the committee, any explicit agreement on what we generally have lined up as a proposed resolution. At this point, or maybe a motion, I think someone's got to make a motion. We can vote I'll make a motion. Second, thank you. There's been a motion in a second, so, barring any other comments, I suggest we take this to a vote of an approval resolution with all the stipulations that I just listed voting yes or no levy, yes, Dave or yes, Clark yeah Dale. Yes, thank you. Goldman, yes, go Chou Hartman, yes, Lucic lager! Yes, parson, yes ray bar, yes, yeah I'm! Sorry goes to janet gray bar yes, Stern, yes, PJ soon. Yes, cue, Schinkel, yes, web, yes, waylynn, yes, McAlister yeah, log, a Seco layman; yes ax men, yes and I'm, a yes, okay! Thank you. Everyone for that vote and the resolution with that I think we've seen all the D-O-T presentations that were brought to us tonight. The committee has one more item to discuss that I emailed about this afternoon, but do t I think anything that we could possibly have questions for. You on has probably been covered. Okay, thanks for having us. Thank you all for your patience and for answering our questions tonight. Okay, so three members, our final topic of the evening and I, want to say thank you again. Obviously, we had a had a light couple of months and now, obviously a lot of stuff all happened at once, so just thanks for rolling with it. So as we emailed about this afternoon, we thought it would be a good idea for our committee to get something down on paper regarding our thoughts around transportation enforcement that can inform our peers in the becks committee, as it has its own discussion, its own comprehensive discussion around the future, at least what our position, what our board's position will be regarding the future of NYPD funding and its general enforcement policies going forward in light of what has become a very large discussion about appropriate enforcement and whether or not the resources of NYPD are better allocated for different enforcement models. There are a couple of things that I want that I want to say in regards to this specific statement of principles that we could generate as a as a committee. I. Think that, as you as the draft that you saw, that was that was started by Jessie layman and kind of iterated on by myself and Sam. Just to give us a starting point for this discussion, you know, as you can see, I think it kind of has two parts number one. It expresses a sense of why we're talking about this now, but number two talks about what a positive vision of what transportation enforcement in our district should look like, and the principles that it should be underpinned by, but without leaping to a specific solution and, as I think would be most probably productive. Here is for us to talk about those principles. What you can see in the draft as three principles of what an enforcement official and what enforcement would look like could look like, should look like, but again without diving into say, a specific solution, and the reason for that being that it's going to be a very big discussion. It's going to be based on context. We don't we don't, as a committee, have right now different units as their structured right now inside of NYPD and how that gets. Transitioned to whatever comes next and what funding options are available for, say, enforcement models, as those are suggested in the draft that don't live inside of NYPD. We don't know what that eventually will look like or what is feasible, but I think we can say that whatever solution ends up getting adopted, that we think it should meet these criteria, these principles of what good enforce good, safe enforcement. That makes sure that the rules of the road are implemented and that it's done in a safe way that does not disproportionately target certain neighborhoods or certain demographics in an unfair way. So that's what I see is the potential scope of this statement that it should be more or less solution agnostic, but that it should define our principles and just to be clear at this point. This statement is more or less being handed from our committee to the backs committee, who can take it into account as they come up with a as they propose a position for our board around the NYPD's budget, which is which is really what we're what we're working up to here. The other thing I want to say is that I do that. I do believe that this statement should talk about enforcement of current law and not necessarily rely on, say proposing different laws than we have now. I, don't think, that's the scope of this funding and enforcement discussion right now either. We obviously are not shy about saying what we think should be changed legislatively very often in terms of what should what should be the law and what shouldn't be, but I don't, but I also, don't believe. That's this discussion. So with all of that have and said, you know, I see this as a as a as a scoped statement about what we think what we think the principle is, a good enforcement would look like and why we think that again, without getting into solutions and without getting into saying that the laws should actually be different than they are now so I'm, sorry that this long-winded I wanted to tee it up in that way. I you know, after having spoken with Rene & Godding assent, gotten a sense of what Beck's will be talking about tomorrow. I think that's how we can you know without stuffing out of our lane as a Transportation Committee have the most positive help the Becks committee the most without stepping into their turf, as they have that discussion tomorrow. With that you know, I want to open it up. Hopefully you got a chance to look at look at the draft, but you know this can be. This can be a wide-ranging discussion and that is not set in stone, and we certainly want to hear what whatever one thinks. Matt hi I had a question about it. So in general, this I think this is a directionally makes sense. I had a specific question about the second bullet point around automatic enforcement and just what was sort of the people who drafted this kind of intended to mean by that. Does that mean putting up more cameras? Does that and how kind of that relates to privacy? Generally yeah drafted go for it, Jesse yeah I mean I. Don't know that I think automatic enforcement is a term that gets used as sort of a catch-all of ways to take the biased human enforcement as much as possible. Out of the application of the laws and have them be, or even certainly in the context of traffic laws, red-light cameras and speed cameras are both examples of automatic enforcement right, and it's certainly something that I know that a lot of you know a lot of there's. Naturally, in a New York there, a lot of civil rights focused organizations that think that police officers should not be pulling people over, but that those sorts of things whenever possible should not be handled by biased individuals. So that's that of the catch-all term that gets used for that. That's been proposed by some other entities as well. I hope that yeah did I. Just add to that as well, that automatic enforcement I think in a lot of discussion. That's you know, of course, fast moving right now, but you know just in general speed cameras, don't discriminate, and so they're there one potential Avenue to much fairer enforcement of our traffic laws. I guess I would just think as somebody who is definitely not as well-versed in this and maybe the audience this will be. Encourage us to be kind of specific I. Would imagine we're automatic enforcement happens, impacts the demographics of people who wear that enforcement happens also right if there are certain and my understanding with the conversation was that it was about what entities is it the police department that is doing the regulating at all of, for example, of things like traffic violations and some of these other things versus it being, in addition to be yep and I. Think part of part of the uniqueness of the position that we're in now is that the city and the City Council and the mayor are at a very early stage of talking about what their budget does and what changes they make and prior to that is when Beck's will try to. You know craft some kind of position for our board. You know that we don't even know necessarily what that will look like or what we're suggesting as being fed into that conversation and we're at an even earlier stage of that. You know which is I, which is I, think why this is crafted much more as a statement of principles than then a lot of specifics. So certainly we can. We can tinker with what we're what options we're presenting and what tools were saying can and should be part of that toolkit reorganization officials, enforcement moving out of NYPD to some degree and also other mechanisms of enforcement like automatic enforcement. If indeed we want to leave that into a statement like this as one potential option or tool one potential tool. Thank you for working through that. That's for the question. Let's go to Ryan Whelan, so just a couple things. First of all, I like the idea of statement of principles, I think in situations like this. It's a really it's an artful way to talk about what we care about, but not maybe get into prescribing things that we don't have all of the puts and takes on all the possible policy solutions and, frankly, may not even know all the good ones that are out there. So I just want to say I, like the approach that we're taking here and I. Think it's a good one for us to have to use as often makes as makes sense and then just a it's. Perhaps a point of some nuance, but I think. Another reason for us to be asking for a reimagine, so approach to enforcement is that this the demands on our streets and our streets are fundamentally changing and we're seeing it in such rapid speed by so much of what we consider here at this committee is so I think getting that point in about the way that our sidewalk is the demand on the curb. The demands on the street are changing, and not only has the prior enforcement regime not worked just in general, but it's even further dealt fit for what's coming forward, so I think there's a prospective look ahead that should get in here. That reflects the change that we're seeing got it. Okay, thanks for the comment, Chris Clark! Yes, can you hear me? Yes, I? My video so I agree that this is I, think a very good statement. I also think it's a great ideas that we are putting it out in this fashion. I think it's very appropriate for us to weigh in to the VEX committee with our particular transportation environment concerns. My question is about the first bullet point regarding the use of force. The level of force I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiment as we're expressing it, which is that the level of force should be appropriate to the violation and to thinking through various transportation. Related violations that are possible. I have not thought of a single violation that I think would warrant the use of force and the use of deadly force, and so I wonder if there would be an appetite here for us making that point as well, that you know considering the range of levels of force available to an enforcement officer that lethal force should never be on the table. Yeah. Your point is taken and just for just for additional context. Some of these principles are very much in line with positions that this committee and the board have adopted. In the past, we, for example, bicycle enforcement has been very in uneven and you know very often they ticket everybody for a weekend and then don't do anything for the next six months and we have in a resolution called in the past. For, admittedly, we called for NYPD to create a new unit, a two-wheeled unit, we're calling for something different here, which is to say that, regardless of where it ends up living- and we suggest that it could be outside of NYPD entirely- that number three is essentially like- they should be on an appropriate vehicle or safely ticketing- a bicyclist. You know instead of running them down in a squad. Car number two is about those technologies having the right equipment and protection, and then yeah number one referring to what would be an appropriate level of force. There are different levels inside of NYPD right now, for example, there are certain units that are only allowed to give parking citations and it's a different type of officer who is allowed to give a moving violation and they are likely armed differently currently. So there is precedent for making sure that the right enforcement is equipped for them for the right situation that they're going to go into I. Guess: I'd open it up to the committee as to whether or not we want to draw any harder, fast lines in this say--just statement of principles right now, but certainly we're that it should be a continuum of well thought out. You levels of force, as opposed to say one blanket type of officer way. The way we have now and EJ I appreciate that clarification. Would you mind if I jump in with a specific purpose proposed addition that people can react to or for work? It would be to take that last phrase set without the risk of introducing deadly force into more benign interactions. It's possible to read the into more benign interactions as sort of a qualifier I. Think having a full stop after without the risk of introducing deadly force, would send the message that I that I'm Arjun killing I would be supportive of that and be interested to hear from others in the committee, but I think that I think that makes it makes our ask stronger without necessarily cutting off all of our options. Joel right, my comment that I was gonna make was not in response. To that everything hand before that came up, okay, sorry well, yeah. They know then I'll we'll come back. We'll come back to you, okay, see if anyone else. If anyone else has thoughts on that on that edit, that was just proposed, I think that's a friendly amendment. I agree. Okay, yeah I think it sounds like it sounds like everyone's okay. With that edit Joel go ahead. What I was going to say was about had to do with what you mentioned EJ before about different. You know that we used to talk about enforcement to NYPD, because that's where Quixote sent us that's how enforcement's been working. You know for as long as I can remember, and we I've had conversations with people north police officer, manorath, who talked about alternate modes of enforcement, who talked about how in a police car, they can't chase a bike who's with braking who's riding illegally. They can't do it because they're gonna kill people and they've, at least in Midtown. North have tried to get a bike unit and they haven't had fun in court. I. Think there's a bike unit in the Central Park precinct, I'm, not positive, if they're still there any more of it, but so alternative methods, I, agree, 100%, you know if it's not added in ypd it's out of wherever it is my one point that I want to make it at college. I actually have a nine o'clock meeting, so I have to jump off in a minute, but is whatever wherever this ends up. I hope where it doesn't end up, is that enforcement goes away. I hope enforcement is still something that's done about. However, it's done and what whatever methodology I agree with you, we shouldn't. We shouldn't try to figure out what the methodology is. We don't know if it's D-O-T or the agency, who does it but I- think enforcement is really important of all our traffic laws of all the movement in a heavy pedestrian city. We can't you know. I saw a Revell scooter, not the little kid off a bike in Central Park and the bike lane. There was no enforcement because there's no enforcement going on right. Now we need enforcement, we need. You know sanity in the streets and I support what this is. What this letter is about, but I want I hope it makes clear that we're not looking to do away with enforcement, we're just looking to do it in a better way, yep and I. Think that's certainly consistent with what we've said many times. As a committee and, like you said, we called on NYPD to enforce things better. More fairer consist more consistently because they were the game. They were the only game in town. You know essentially and I think that I think that yeah. The point of a statement like this is to call for the same thing and to and to explain how we think it works successfully and makes everyone's safe. That makes everyone play by the same rules again agnostic of whether it's NYPD or something new or something better. So I. You know I wholeheartedly agree if you think there's a way to clarify it better. In this statement you can, let me know, but that was certainly the intended effect, a reason you can look here and get back to you. Thank you. Sorry I'm sorry I have to jump okay, no thanks for their comment, ill and so I just want to clarify I. Don't think that I don't think that there's a need to say, save vote on this, it's not becoming a board resolution. It's not even a letter from us to some of our electives. It's a letter from us to ourselves at this point. It's a statement that we're making and putting onto the world and that we want to. We want to see, help, inform the discussion that Becks will have tomorrow, literally about the NYPD's budget and getting into more substantive questions about numbers and execution and methodology and solutions. So I, don't think we're I, don't think we're moving towards a towards a vote here, but certainly if there are other thoughts or requested edits to this statement, you know feel free to feel free to speak up now. But otherwise- and you know Sam Jesse other folks can- let me know what you think, but otherwise I think we I think we take this. We present it female to Renee and the Becks committee folks, who want to the way that we had a lot of visitors tonight can certainly tune into the backs committee tomorrow and see how that discussion goes and participate. But you know I think that's I, think that's the next step here at surely stage J my hand raised functions, not working but yo. If I can just add a final thought. If that's alright yeah we got a couple, we got a couple, other hands raised too, and so and you can yes, it's not showing on my screen. So, okay, Matt! This is a quick request. I know this isn't sort of an official document. Yet, but would people be open? There's in that second bullet point: instead of saying utilizing automatic enforcement technology, because there's so much automatic enforced technology that can be have bias built-in. Could we replace the word automatic with unbiased to say, unbiased enforcement technology? Good I got to make it I would agree that seems appropriate to me. Okay, not hearing anyone else, object, I, think I, think that's the answer. Propria thanks Matt, Simon, yeah I, understand the need or the desire for this letter. There's something which I've been grappling with. It just seems overly politically correct and political in nature. There's terminology in here which I think if we're getting to the point of what this letter is, which is a statement of basic principles which points one two and three I'm fine with I agree, but there's I think quite honestly, if we're going to make this more effective and have perhaps a little bit just streamline it I think there's a lot of language which could be taken out and not be so just it's a state. If it's a statement, principles then reiterate our principles. That's a something I've been grappling with and I see those 1 2 3 is being perfectly fine standing alone, as I think, there's I think there's value in at least framing and introduction about why we're talking about this now kind of, as I said earlier, but I particularly interested to hear from other folks about what they think is well about streamlining and simplifying. Perhaps those introductory say three paragraphs curious to get any other thoughts on that one way or another J am I, am I up yet you'll have to tell me, since no one else has their hands raised Jesse. So you can. You can definitely speak now. Cool thanks, yeah I know. I just wanted to share my reasons for wanting us to go down this path and, to some extent, actually I have a theme somewhat differently, but along a similar in a similar moment as where Simon is, which is that I do think that we have to think about where we are in the context of the world and what's going on right now, and that's part of what made me think that this is something we had to talk about this week. I actually really feel strongly that we should be very clear about our disappointment and unhappiness and disease with the status quo that it's not good enough to say how we'd like transportation enforcement to be, but that I think we should be pretty clear and explicit about how bad it is now and how unacceptable and actively harmful it is now, and that's actually really where I came to this from I. Had a discussion with EJ a few days back that the starting to work on this- and you know my sentiment to EJ- was that I felt that we as a community board, like most community boards, had some complicity in the way in which the NYPD has treated people of color in our city. We have for many years since, before any of us were community board letters. Members constantly called on the NYPD to engage in ever more enforcement of low-level quality of life issues in our communities, and it has been those constant community calls for the NYPD to aggressively enforce. Even the you know, lowest level of offenses that the NYPD, often sitive, leans on as their justification for engaging in very aggressive and sometimes violent police. Saying and I think that we as community or community board members, have some complicity in that and that we should take a step back and recognize that we either have to say what we want to do differently or we have to go forward. Knowing that we are somewhat to blame and you know I told eji, I will never vote YES again on any amendment. Any resolution that calls on the NYPD to engage in enforcement of low-level quality-of-life issues I don't think that they are a responsible entity that can do that in a non biased way and so I think it then be who's. Someone like me, who's not willing to vote YES on that to say what how do I think enforcement should happen otherwise and then to Joel's point. We can't just say there should be no enforcement at all of so this is an attempt to say how it could be done in a less biased way. But that's you know my reason for thinking that we do need to be pretty clear and pretty bold and if I recognize and appreciate and understand that is gonna be somewhat uncomfortable for some people and that's okay. People who are in different places on this and I get it but I think there's a time to just sort of like put a marker down and say things have to change and we don't accept the status quo. Thanks yeah so I'll just add that Simon I have sort of gone back and forth on that same thing. In my rereading of this statement, you know there are times when I'm thinking that it could be. You know a much tighter introduction and just and just the principles and I guess what tips mean back to the side of thinking that it is appropriate to talk about the. Why is not just I mean the current moment is obviously incredibly meaningful and important, but not just the current moment is how much that our framing here reflects. What this committee has been saying are the problems for years when there is a bicycle enforcement, blitz or surge for one weekend, that indiscriminately tickets every bicyclist and then doesn't touch them for another six months that doesn't I think to anyone's mind, make the streets like measurably safer for bicyclists or for the pedestrians or cars or anybody. You know examples like that: the lack of enforcement in all the other domains that we talked about where we're begging, where we're adding a boilerplate paragraph in every resolution, saying please for the love of God somebody. You know right now, it's the NYPD, but it could be. It could be someone else. Please enforce these laws. That's I fall down on the side of being comfortable, including language like this, because it's because it does represent what we've been saying and framing our positions around for so many years, and it's not just reflective of the current political situation, just my two cents on that one anyway, I don't know whatever up. Others have thoughts or there's a or there's a more of a consensus. Certainly it's certainly a point. Simon is taken, but you know I I'd like to get a I'd like to get a sense of where the majority of the committee is, and certainly at this point it does sound like most folks are behind the basic, the basic goal of this and the principles you know the meat and potatoes of what we would be handing to backs. So you know I'm just trying to steer us toward a consensus a little bit and to find out, if, generally speaking, everyone's on board, which is what it sounds like right now, or whether there are kind of remaining, very serious concerns, otherwise I think we I think we would be well positioned to hand this to Beck's and again it's whatever Beck's does. Will you know whether it's a resolution or whether it's a discussion or whether it's the beginning of a longer discussion, we'll certainly still end up taking positions on it as a board? Hey EJ, one point, sir I'm, not sure if you saw my hand, sorry I didn't but go ahead. My point is structure. One is that I think you made this point when we first started discussing this issue. Is that it's so early in the process? And we can. We can write a letter to Beck's to you, our fellow committee members, but we don't know what the mayor is gonna. Do we don't really know what the council's gonna do? We don't know what the NYPD's response is going to be. Maybe they come up with a response. You know they would like to change x, y&z and council goes back. Maybe the governor has a point. My point saying a letter is great sure, but I think it's the first in a series of discussions. I would hope, no matter where you are on this issue politically I. Think I, just you know where we it's unfortunate, that you know we're now in late June and just with our this committee schedule and how this is gonna play out over the next couple months, but maybe a line in there. You know talking about you know, first, thoughts, first principles where we are today and calling for further discussion on the issue, no matter where you are, and that may assuage some of Simon's concerns. If there's inherently a political letter, I don't know I don't want to be for Simon or anyone else, but that's what I was thinking when I first read the letter and yep I mean I, certainly think about it as a as a very beginning of that whole pipeline, as I've said, and that's a first principles, sort of thing, and besides just feeling good about ourselves for having written a letter, I think it's valuable to define those principles that when there is something more specific to look at a month from now or a year from now, when actual changes are being proposed, we should be able to go back to our own principles and say is what is what's finally being proposed meet our criteria? Does it actually enforce the rules of the road since we're not talking about abandoning enforcement, doesn't enforce the rules or Road? Does it do it fairly? Does it do it safely and does it do it you know evenly, you know, I, think I think we want to be able to have these types of criteria to go back to much later in the process as well. I thought I just hand, but I put my hand in weapons over. You can see it D, no okay, girlfriend where the letter live. Is it just go? Is it sort of ephemeral and it goes to Bex, and then they will make a resolution or do something or does this live somewhere, long-term I? Think right now, it's the former! It's ephemeral! It's because we don't I, don't even know if say, Bex will arrive at a resolution tomorrow night or whether it's just going to be a starting discussion for them to, but all obviously more holistically, because they're going to tackle the whole nine billion dollar budget of NYPD or whatever it is so I think that right now this is a you know, one day like it's, like literally a 24-hour sorta. This is what this is. What teenie talked about last night and we're informing you of kind of where we're at in terms of first principles, longer term I, think this statement could hang around and we could find ourselves say incorporating these principles into a final resolution or adopting them in a more formal if we're like. If we adopt this statement and we decide that we still like it down the road at later, more substantive parts of the process, we could decide that this or a form of this belongs in a letter or belongs in a resolution thanks. That's the reason ask is that the right now there's like five paragraphs of interim conclusion and three bullet points and I think if the goal is to communicate the principles, then focusing on the principles, probably matters, but if it's something that's going to lost for a while this, isn't it's not a coincidence that this is coming at this time and I could imagine five years from now somebody looking back. This would be a different list of principles. It's not it's. We want to make sure that it was clear that it was tied to this moment in time, and that's that is a real catalyst for why it's happening so I wonder if that sort of a filter to apply to how much kind of priam rulers yeah. You know others might have different thoughts, but III do see it as a product. I see you know and that's the sort of the was sort of how I think were justified in the principles that were adopting. They reflect this moment of time this moment in time, and the introduction makes that valid, but also they reflect what our values have been as a committee for four years at this point, as we call for as we've called for better enforcement, not necessarily more enforcement, but better enforcement, so I mean it's also my way of saying I think it's I think it's a product at this moment in time, but also we're not adopting it as a final resolution right now. We're not sending it off to the mayor in an official capacity like this I think it's the beginning of a discussion, at least just within our board right now, so I think it I think it kind of reflects where at in time, but also we're not marrying ourselves to it forever. So you know in that, in that context and understanding is getting late and we're obviously not going to solve enforcement in New York City tonight. It's part of this discussion. You know I'd like to move us towards again I, don't think we're gonna vote, but if there aren't any hard and fast objections or if there aren't any other proposed edits at this point- and you know in the absence of any sort of countervailing proposals, perhaps just move towards thinking that you know, even if this statement isn't perfect, that it that the principles and the reasoning behind it reflect what we are thinking as a committee right now, and that it's useful enough to hand it to Beck's as part of whatever they want to discuss from a budgetary perspective of tomorrow. And then you know, wherever that discussion goes, we may have to reassess our own, our own framing as early as Wednesday, but at least we're in communication with our with kind of our pure committees. So I guess that's how I that's how I present it to everyone at this point, Jan I, see Janet's hand raised and feel free to speak up. Janet you can uncanny yeah, hi okay can be heard next, yes, you can, would you have any objection to eliminating the reference to deadly force from I? Don't think it particularly adds anything and I find it uncomfortable reference, particularly in consideration of larger scope. We're talking about transportation issues, deadly force shouldn't even enter into the picture. In my opinion, you're talking about the reference to it in principle, number one- yes I believe so I, don't have it in front of me, cuz I in computer world, but I think I. Think Janet's gonna get the same thing. Christopher was getting at then I think I thought Chris is at. It did a good job of being clear on that. We're not saying that we shouldn't be suggesting that there are interactions where there should be deadly force used as a chair, I think Chris is at. It did a good job of verifying that okay, so Janet I would suggest yeah. Maybe if you get a chance, take a look at it without the into more benign interactions clause which were which we're going to delete and I think. Maybe now it more reflects what you're thinking actually is appropriate. I apologize, I, probably missed that I had a tooth up with a client right, Schumann's, okay, all right! So obviously, if there any other thoughts, people should feel free to raise their hand and speak up. Otherwise it sounds and anyone correct me if that, although there were kind of different thoughts on what would what might make this perfect, that generally there's a lot of consensus around the value in stating these principles and framing it not just in the context of our current debate as a society, but also in terms of what we've asked for years and years. So you know others should speak up, but you know at this point I think I. Think it largely does reflect what we think as a committee and what we would simply say to Beck's to consider as our transportation priorities as they talk budget. If anyone has any other thoughts as well feel free to send them by email, I, don't think this is the end of a discussion and we're not quote-unquote adopting anything tonight. So I think this deserves to be an ongoing discussion as a committee as a board as a city whatever anyway. If there's, if there are no other comments and if I'm not missing anyone's hand raised then I'll, let the committee go. I really do appreciate your patience tonight and the fact that we were able to have even just this discussion at a very early stage. I think it I think I think it is good to start talking about and be able to show Becks, even as they as they talk budget. What we have been considering, but again we're not we're not adopting anything tonight and we're, certainly at the very beginning of a longer term development of actual solutions. That'll take a long time. So if there are any other comments by anyone in the committee, I will let you all go very much everybody. Thank you very good meeting and for your patience, have a good night.
