Signal, appreciate that so I want to start out by pointing out that the space that TD bank will be occupying is the tenant space at the far right end of the building shown within the dashed green line here and a quick representation of the bracket sign in relation to that space.
It's centered above the front doors on an existing pilaster of the building, we're proposing a bracket sign primarily to address the pedestrian on the sidewalk who's, walking up or down the sidewalk to announce the TD bank to the pedestrian at a further a more distant scale.
You know that location on the pilaster would allow more of the terracotta of the building and the structure of the landmark to be viewed from the street and would not impede the brass sign band, which is not historic, but is a you know.
We think it is an appropriate size and an appropriate application for a bracket type sign in this neighborhood in this on this particular building.
This is the paramount building which is a few blocks south, and we only show it here because it's another individually designated landmark that has approved bracket signs.
Let's open up two questions from members of the committee: Please use the raise hand function.
Okay, so I'll shoot the first question: Can you actually speak to the way the bracket is going to be attached to the facade.
What we would do is we would have that connection engineered to make sure that it both had a minimal impact on the building, but also was you know, provided the necessary safety for for wind and seismic loading on the sign.
I think that you know in the event that TD bank vacates the space, because it's an approved master plan, the owner of the building, could later add it back on.
The requirement for Community Board comment is the bracket sign, but I think that the you know the custom here is that you know you're entitled to and should comment on anything about the proposal that you know that occurs to you.
It's more of a door handle, but you know because it's attached to the outside of the building.
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter, and this is the time where we make comments and then, where we formulate our position on this application.
I agree with renee I, actually think it minimizes the impact of the signage on the building, so I do not have any problem with the sign.
I would suggest that they look at ways to minimize the number of penetrations into the building by the sign, because should that be removed, you know you're left with the holes.
And, it's actually fine, but you know by all means committee members.
Looking from you, know, I have not been on the Landmarks Committee long enough to have been part of the discussions about times square and that the master plan etc.
You know that row of signage that is flat along the building, not a bracket sign, am I wrong, that there was a different kind of bracket.
What's going to happen when this location of TD ends up closing and the next applicant, for that particular space does want to go back to this general broad sign that was originally approved.
You know here in Times, Square I, think, like you have brought up.
And I would really urge the applicant to look into a way to actually attach the bracket sign through the joints between the terracotta tiles, rather than going in the historic fabric.
What I have an issue with is actually adding signage when a master plan is in place, and although the applicant here today is telling us that they're not interested in sign h, that has been approved, nonetheless, sign h remains as being an approved signage that can be installed at any time by anyone by the way.
So you know, maybe in two years time, TD will decide that it is actually a good way to go.
And I think that the proper approach for this particular application would be instead of approving a sign as an additional signage that is not part of the master.
I would really encourage the applicant to alter the master plan so that we know what the predictability is.
You put your bracket sign, but we know that we have a zero net sum of added signage going forward.
This particular sign, provided that it is folded into an alteration to the master plan, and you know with the comments that you know about the attachment of the bracket to to the facade.
Well with all that I guess, I'm changing my comments, a little bit, but one of the things I was going to suggest is that we do put in some sort of language about the door, pulls saying that, since we know that they're going to keep the original door pools that they have.
The applicant has said they're going to keep the door pools for the building.
It does not mean it's going to be the case for all these other signs around the building, so, potentially a lot more of these bracket signs could be added, so leila I think that's fantastic.
You would have another opportunity to review that in you know any future case which is I, think responsive to your point generally about our application now with regard to precedent or future applications for bracket signs that might replace other signs that have already been approved in the master.
So I think you're safe on that point, but you know we can respond after the without, for the whole board.
You know sign H not being installed, because signage can not be installed.
So I will make the motion to deny the application unless the proposed bracket sign is incorporated as an alteration to the master plan and is seen as a replacement to the previously approved sign h, with the specific recommendation that the bracket sign be installed in a way to be, as least intrusive as possible to the historic fabric, puncturing, the avoiding any puncture to the other terracotta and as much as possible in sewing the penetration points into the joints between the the terracotta tiles and with the comment that the the door pulls are not contextual and we urge the applicant and the building owner to actually save the existing hardware.
