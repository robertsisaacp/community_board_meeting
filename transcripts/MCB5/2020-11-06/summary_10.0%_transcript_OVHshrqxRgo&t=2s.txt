So I want to start out by pointing out that the space that Td Bank will be occupying is the tenant space at the far right end of the building shown within the dashed green line here and a quick representation of the bracket sign in relation to that space.
It's centered above the front doors on an existing pile aster of the building, we're proposing a bracket sign primarily to address the pedestrian on the sidewalk who's, walking up or down the sidewalk to announce the Td Bank to the pedestrian at a further a more distant scale.
You know that location on the pileaster would allow more of the terracotta of the building and the structure of the landmark to be viewed from the street and would not impede the brass sign band, which is not historic, but is a you know.
We think it is an appropriate size and an appropriate application for a bracket type sign in this neighborhood in this on this particular building.
This is the paramount building which is a few blocks south, and we only show it here because it's another individually designated landmark that has approved bracket signs.
The first question: Can you actually speak to the way the bracket is going to be attached to the facade.
I think that you know in the event that Td bank vacates the space, because it's an approved master plan, the owner of the building, could later add it back on pursuant to the 2015 approval.
It's more of a door handle, but you know because it's attached to the outside of the building, it's certainly within the commission's jurisdiction.
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter, and this is the time where we make comments and then, where we formulate our position on this application, so use the raised hand.
I actually think it minimizes the impact of the signage on the building, so I do not have any problem with the sign.
And, it's actually fine, but you know by all means committee members.
You know that row of signage that is flat along the building, not a bracket sign.
I struggle with the amount of penetration into the terracotta, and I would really urge the applicant to look into a way to actually attach the bracket sign through the joints between the terracotta tiles, rather than going in the historic fabric.
What I have an issue with is actually adding signage when a master plan is in place, and although the applicant here today is telling us that they're, not interested in sign h that has been approved, nonetheless, sign h remains as being an approved signage that can be installed at any time by anyone by the way.
And I think that the proper approach for this particular application would be instead of approving a sign as an additional signage.
The applicant, has said they're going to keep the door pools for the building.
We should recommend that you know it is an alteration to the master plan rather than an additional signage.
You would have another opportunity to review that in you know any future case, which is, I think, responsive to your point generally about our application now with regard to precedent or future applications for bracket signs that might replace other signs that have already been approved in the master.
Okay, so I will make the motion to deny the application unless the proposed bracket sign is incorporated as an alteration to the master plan and is seen as a replacement to the previously approved sign h, with the specific recommendation that the bracket sign be installed in a way to be, as least intrusive as possible to the historic fabric, puncturing, the avoiding any puncture to the other terracotta and as much as possible in sewing the penetration points into the joints between the the terracotta tiles and with the comment that the the door pulls are not contextual and we urge the applicant and the building owner to actually save the existing hardware.
