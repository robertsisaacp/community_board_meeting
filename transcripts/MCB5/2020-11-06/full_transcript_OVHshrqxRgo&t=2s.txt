Okay, so it looks like Paul just joined us, okay, you're going into screen sharing mode. So let me give the introduction to the meeting and then we can start so good evening. Everyone thank you for being with us. This is the landmarks committee of Manhattan Community board. Five. My name is Leila Logisique. I'm the chair. Few words about how the meeting is going to proceed. We have one application tonight for our review. The applicant will be given an opportunity to give a full and uninterrupted presentation once this presentation concludes. Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions once this question period concludes. I will open up the floor to members of the public. Members of the public will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments to the application. The applicant will be given the opportunity to respond once this response period concludes. We will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter. We will make comments and then we will make a motion for a resolution on the application. This motion will be taken to a vote. The vote of the committee will be presented next week, Thursday to the full board of Community Board five Thursday November, the 12th. This vote of the committee will be discussed by the full board and a vote by the Full board of Community Board five will be taken. The vote of the full membership of the board becomes our official position and they com will be forwarded to the landmarks Preservation Commission, as our official recommendation. So with all that being said, I will read you as usual. Please put yourselves on mute when you're, not speaking, unmute yourself, when it's your turn to speak, and if you have any questions during the question period and comments during the coming period, use the raised hand function and for those who are participating as attendees Luke Sabados who's, our community liaison will allow you to to speak. So, with all of that being said, I will turn it to the applicant so that they can start their presentation and the applicant please make it full screen yeah. If the applicant could enter screen mode. Maybe that would be fantastic. Where do you see that I'm sorry, I'm looking for full screen and I'm not seeing it program- is this well here? Let me see if I can is this powerpoint? No, this is a pdf viewer. Let's see is that any button, sometimes you can press Command, F or Command L to make something full screen for control, Sorry, Control F, that's better! Is that better? Okay! Is that better for you guys if you could maybe enlarge it a little bit. I do not know if you can do that, go up to view. That's good! That's good! That's good! I do not know, who's might be on a phone, but I'm on my phone and you actually, when you're on a phone or a tablet, you can actually pinch and zoom the screen share to you. Can you can go into it that way on a laptop I? Do not think you can, but anyone on a tablet or an iphone could actually take what you're seeing and zoom into it. Okay, that's what I did that's, why I can see it. We should be good like that. Let's, let's do it excellent? Thank you very much good evening. My name is Paul Prue and I'm land use counsel to TD bank the applicant. In this case I'm joined by Scott Rasman from Bergman architecture. Who is the designer on this proposal, which is a proposal for the brill building, which is the individually designated landmark at the corner of 49Th and broadway, so we're going in the other. This is the different order here Scott. So this is a signed proposal for the brill building and the brill building is the 11 story, brick and terracotta, building that was developed by Abraham Leftcourt in 1930 and was known famously to host the music industry of New York from the Tin Pan Alley era through to the 1950s and the early days of rock and roll. The offices above the first two floors were recording studios musicians had spaces there for practicing and for just doing business. This was the place for music in New York for decades and decades. So it played an important cultural role, but it's also known for its art, deco facade, which is brick in terracotta, and it's it's very fancy sort of gold relief at the at the doorways and in some of the new facades or new storefront storefronts. The building was designated in 2010, which was an action that you supported by resolutions which I've sent over to your staff and in 2010 and then later in 2014. There were several proposals to both restore the facade with new terra, terracotta and signage, with a brass sign band that extended around above the first floor stores and with new signs that were approved but never installed in 2010 and then in 2014. They were sort of rearranged to better reflect the honky-tonk nature of Times Square and the ad hoc nature of signs there with lower levels that what primarily with signage at the lower levels that were led advertising signs and these signs were approved as part of a master plan. So all of these signs have, for the most part, been installed, and the exception to that is what you're looking at here in the bottom right hand corner sign h and that's what we're here to talk to you about today. It started out on the left as a much bigger sign and then in 2014 it was approved as a seven and a half by 29 foot sign that would hang over the northerly edge of the or northerly portion of the facade on Broadway. So what you're, seeing here in 2014, was proposed and approved by landmarks and if you'll page the this is what it would look like as a rendering and for the most part again, these were installed the if you go to the also that sign that you see there marked in red, is installed as far as the brackets go, which you see in red there. The sign has not been installed and though again, it's approved as part of the master plan, and we are proposing now, instead of a sign conforming to the master plan, we're proposing a sign that would identify the location of TD bank below this approved sign, which is an action that is non not in conformance with the approved master plan, and it also exceeds three areas of the landmark's rules and therefore, because it exceeds those three areas which I'll tell you about. We have to seek a certificate of appropriateness from the Landmarks Commission, as opposed to a staff level approval, and so that's why we're here tonight to discuss primarily those three things and those are the following. Pursuant to section 2-13 of the landmark's laws relating to bracket signs, these bracket signs may not be internally illuminated. They must not exceed 18 inches by 24 inches and they may not extend beyond 18 inches from the building facade in a district that was historically commercial, as is here and if you'll page. The next sign I will turn this over to Scott. Who will discuss the sign you see in front of you here, which is a small bracket sign that we have proposed to replace that giant. Led advertising signal, appreciate that so I want to start out by pointing out that the space that TD bank will be occupying is the tenant space at the far right end of the building shown within the dashed green line here and a quick representation of the bracket sign in relation to that space. It's centered above the front doors on an existing pilaster of the building, we're proposing a bracket sign primarily to address the pedestrian on the sidewalk who's, walking up or down the sidewalk to announce the TD bank to the pedestrian at a further a more distant scale. We propose a size of sign, a bracket sign of 16 feet tall by two foot nine wide and that set off the building by eight inch mounts sign mounts. We wanted to do this in respect to it being a a solid image sign which is different in character than the other advertising signs on the building that have the moving image. So we feel that it's proportionate in size and scale to its location on the building. It's also internally illuminated I wanted to talk a little bit about the internal illumination, in that it's it's a very subtle subdued lighting type, there's no exposed lighting it. It's a subtle glow and it's really much more subdued than the moving images around it and there's no without any exposed light fixtures. It there's no lighting either on to the building or onto the sidewalk. So the purpose of the sign, as I explained it captures the view from up and down the block, but then inside the store we have a more traditional TD shield down at pedestrian level that addresses the customer. That's right there in front of the store at that point, so that's within 18 or 18 inches within the glass. So that's completely in Interior. I want to move on for a second too, to point out. You know that location on the pilaster would allow more of the terracotta of the building and the structure of the landmark to be viewed from the street and would not impede the brass sign band, which is not historic, but is a you know, a beautiful aspect of the renovation that was completed a couple of years ago right exactly Paul. Thank you. That really was part of our decision, too, is to really not touch that that bronze louver band that's a more delicate feature of the architecture of the building and limit the attachment to the solid pilaster and, as a result, not have the the the visual advertising signs in front of the glass of that second story. So, while this is times square and we do want to speak to the neighborhood and the you know, the excitement and light- and you know craziness of times square, this really is you know, sort of a subtle, a more subtle treatment that would allow the landmark to shine through. So I'm going to continue on to just a couple other renderings that show the sign in relation to the building and the surroundings. We think it is an appropriate size and an appropriate application for a bracket type sign in this neighborhood in this on this particular building. Just for reference, I'm showing a floor plan of the space that TD banks going to occupy and if there's any interest, I can talk through that, although it's separate from the signs on the exterior and then some other details, including a TD door pole that we're proposing for the front doors of the of the space, this is the paramount building which is a few blocks south, and we only show it here because it's another individually designated landmark that has approved bracket signs. So you know if this were in a landmark district we'd, be looking for other examples from the neighborhood to set a precedent, but it's not the brill building, like the paramount, is an individually designated landmark. So we just mentioned this as an aside really to show you know that racket signs are not. You know a crazy stretch for a landmark structure. This one obviously has quite a few of them and we're only proposing one so I think that's really it Scott. Unless there's something else, you'd like to add no, that was it, Paul I was going to see. If you had any other comments and if not I think maybe we can open up two questions great. Thank you very much yeah. Let's do that. Let's! Oh I'm! Sorry things are falling around me. Sorry about that. Let's open up two questions from members of the committee: please use the raise hand function. If you have a question: no hands up. Okay, so I'll shoot the first question: can you actually speak to the way the bracket is going to be attached to the facade? Yes, we would. We would bolt into the existing terracotta finish, so there would be there's four connection points and I think there would probably be four bolts a piece and what we would do is we would have that connection engineered to make sure that it both had a minimal impact on the building, but also was you know, provided the necessary safety for for wind and seismic loading on the sign. Okay. Thank you. Still. No questions from members of the committee. Oh yeah Barbara has a question. Barbara go ahead. I was just curious, you know, given how much light there is in the whole area. Do you think that illuminating the sign is strictly necessary? I mean it's. You know it's so bright in that area or maybe that's I do not want to put words in your mouth, but you know it's so bright in the air. You could probably read a book. You know in the middle of the night, on the sidewalk, so understood and I. Think it's a it's a matter of visibility. You know we really at the same time that there is the the light around we want us. We do want to stand out as well. You know it. It is a sign that that points out our tenancy there, the bank's tenancy, so I, do think an internal illumination is important to stand out and then one more question. So the armature for the sign that was supposed to that was a part of the master plan that is in place that exists and is it's going to stay in place? Actually, no that armature has been removed. This is it has okay yeah. This is a fairly recent photo and you can see that it's no longer there, okay, all right great thanks! Thank you. Next question from Suzanne go ahead, I'm just going to say that I had that question that Barbara literally just asked about what was going on with where they were going to place. The advertising and I'll just assume. Since it's been taken down, then you're never going to utilize that, because you've decided to do this bracket, correct well, I think from a legal perspective. I think that you know in the event that TD bank vacates the space, because it's an approved master plan, the owner of the building, could later add it back on pursuant to the 2015 approval. But you know as far as TD is concerned, which has a deal with the landlord. You know we do not want it and they've agreed not to put it not to use it there in favor of our proposed advertiser, our proposed accessory sign and there will be only one bracket, yes correct and the on the door when you have the TD lettering. Is that something that falls under our discussion or only the bracket leila is that we can certainly choose to comment on anything. We feel relevant. I am unsure who has jurisdiction on that? Whether it is the staff of LPC because it falls under the existing rules or whether it is a commission action and as such it has to be reviewed by the Community board, but maybe the applicant can yeah. Can you comment? Thank you. Certainly. We can certainly clarify that they're. The only item that has triggered a commission review and therefore community the requirement for Community Board comment is the bracket sign, but I think that the you know the custom here is that you know you're entitled to and should comment on anything about the proposal that you know that occurs to you. So as such the the shield in the window, which is 18 inches behind the glass and therefore compliant with the landmarks rules and not requiring an approval, you know, is shown in the plans, but just you know, as for illustrative purposes right. No, I'm sorry I was not having my question really had to do with the whirlpool. The door pull that's going to be yeah that too same thing with that. No, and that is I do not know. I love the brill building and I live very close by, and I've actually recorded in this build building. So it's near and dear I do not know if there's any other door that has this or not so I just wanted to ask about it because I just wondered: can you just quickly speak to the to the other door handles and the other retail tenants of the building different tenants will sometimes have customized door pulls I. Think the the typical installation is more of a traditional door, pull it. That will be in the bronze finish to match the doors, but TD does prefer to have the custom door, poles that are unique to their locations. Right, no and I think you guys always do very capable facades, but this being a historic building. I question the placement, so thank you for clarifying yeah I would just quickly add that you know it does not trigger a specific signage rule. But you know it's not technically signage, it's more of a door handle, but you know because it's attached to the outside of the building, it's certainly within the commission's jurisdiction. But you know this is our standard poll for all the yeah. It's an advertisement. Okay, let let's move on I, think we're like slowly sliding on the comment slide. Let's go back to questions, I, think that shock had his hand up at some point, but you got your hand down. Do you have a question chuck? Thank you. My question was the relationship between the master plan and this particular aspect. Our approval of this would be in addition to the master plan. Is that correct yeah, but it would not modify the master plan. This is a proposed approval for signage, not in conformance with the master plan, and so it so it runs with TD bank and it would not permit it to be used by any other user. Correct. Okay, thank you. Renee. You have a question: go ahead, yeah just real, quick about the door pool. So what are they doing with the door pool that was there before like? If there's original to the brass structure to the frame, if they're just going to remove it, if that was not part of the landmark, so it does not really matter and what they're going to be doing with you know in order to replace it with the TD bank logo. Typically, what will happen in that scenario is we'll once we take off the existing polls, we'll give those to the landlord of the building that they can maintain, so that, after the period of the lease, if TD decides to move out, they have the original door pulls to reinstall in their place. Yeah, it's not completely clear to me, and we can certainly come back to you with an answer this. Whether the door in this location is actually historic, fabric I think it's just a nicely designed brass door. That is intended to complement. You know the other brass or gold leaf. You know elements of the building like the main entrance, which is 50 feet further north or further south. Rather, you know the main entrance. Is this big art deco? You know entrance to the lobby of the building. These are just you know, recently installed doors to my to my knowledge that are intended to match the louvering above and you know, complement the building. Okay. The thing, though, is that those doors were installed with Lpc's approval and have been reviewed. So, although they're not original they're, still deemed contextual with the with the history building, let's move on to further questions. Are there any more questions from members of the of the committee? Okay, so seeing none I will open up the floor to members of the public. Do we have any questions from members of the public? Okay? So no questions from our members of the public I just want to make sure that members of the committee have had a chance to ask all their questions before we move into business session. Any more questions for members of the committee, okay, so seeing none, we will move to a business session during business session. As I said, only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter, and this is the time where we make comments and then, where we formulate our position on this application, so use the raised hand function. If you wish to make a comment and by the way it's not if you wish to make comment, please make comments so that we can formulate our position. If you do not use the race hand, function, I will call on you all right, renee, I'm calling on you any comments. Yeah trying to figure out how to do the raised hand function so yeah we're just for comments. I mean I, do not have any questions. So I guess my at the answer. My question, but my comment would guess, would be that I'm actually happier with this I mean I know. I was still on the committee when we did the 2015 I, guess: application for braille building and I voted yes on it, but I remember being just a little saddened by the plan they had being covering so much of the building, but it's time square. So this actually is great. Where it's like. It's lit up. It's one of the few places we allow a lot of signage, but you actually get to see more of the building. So I'm totally fine with this, but I'd be interested to hear what other people have to say. Yeah. Actually it's you you're making a good point. So this project came to us in 2014. I. Think that overall we supported the signage master plan. We felt that it was a little bit overwhelming, but we also appreciate that you know this is time square and it is important to keep the context in mind for zoning purposes, not for landmarks purposes, but for zoning purposes there is actually a lighting requirement in the the Times Square area. So you know this is also something that is important to to keep in mind when we make a recommendation so more comments, Barbara go ahead. I agree with renee I, actually think it minimizes the impact of the signage on the building, so I do not have any problem with the sign. I would suggest that they look at ways to minimize the number of penetrations into the building by the sign, because should that be removed, you know you're left with the holes. So if there's I think this the drawing showed before penetrations, if that can be reduced or they should be as small as possible, just so that the fabric of the building remains intact, should the should the sign be removed in the future? I'm not wild about the door pulls, but you know I do not know. If that's really a part of what you know we are, it seems to be I mean it's small. You know, may not be that big a deal, but you know the sign I think is fine. Well, we are rarely given the opportunity to comment and when we are given this opportunity, I think that we should take it and if we have something meaningful and important to say, I think that you know we should not be shy. So I will absolutely- and you know the committee may decide that you know in the end it's not offensive and it's actually fine, but you know by all means committee members. If you feel that this is important, you know feel free to to comment on it. I guess to me it's a little more jarring on the door, because it's somehow the signage just fits in, but it's a part of sort of like architectural hardware- I'm not really offended by it, but it seems it sort of takes away from the overall look of this individual landmark. You know again, I think it's a minor point, but it's not something. I'm not wild about it. I can't say that, whereas I think the sign is actually an improvement, I do not think the door pulls are yeah. Thank you. Richard. You have a comment. Go ahead, Richard I'm mute! Okay. Looking from you know, I have not been on the Landmarks Committee long enough to have been part of the discussions about times square and that the master plan etc. So I hear what people are saying, but my concern is it's a new. It's not just another sign at the same along the band. It's a new element. If we prove this, there might be more signs of that, and so clearly it's to me it's going to diminish the view of the true of the historical elements of the building. So I'm not happy with it, but if the general approach has been look, we put we like signs or we understand the need for signs, and therefore this is just more scientific. Clearly, other buildings have lots of signs I get that, but it is diminishing the historical look of the building, so I'm I would not say I'm not exactly. I'm torn I'm sort of not happy with it, but if there's precedent and reason to say yeah, this is what we do in this district, and this is just you know the we allow these things sort of on principle, and it's therefore, and that's not a bad sign, etc. I get it, but it certainly seems to me it diminishes the building one more piece, I'm not sure I fully understand are you? Are you saying that it diminishes the the view of the building, because it is a net gain of a sign or that it is a sign that is less desirable than the sign that has been approved in the master plan? Okay, I thought that the signs that had been approved were the horizontal. You know that row of signage that is flat along the building, not a bracket sign, am I wrong, that there was a different kind of bracket. Sign that was approved. No bracket sign was approved a flat sign that it's on the facade was approved as part of the master plan. It's signed age and it is 29 feet by seven and a half feet right. The applicant is proposing a bracket sign that is 16 foot tall and 2.9 feet wide smaller size sign, I, understood that. But the applicant also said: there's nothing preventing some someone later saying: yeah I, wanna I want that flat, sign okay. So what you're objecting to is that we're getting a net gain of one sign? And this is what you find problematic right, a net gain of one sign, but a sign of. In other words, let's say they put that other sign back. There's this row of signage along the building. So adding one more piece like that does not change. To my mind, does not change the basic pattern of the flat big signs along the whole length of the building. This is a different type of sign and changes says: okay, not only do we allow these horizontal big body, but in this time square, that's fine body, science. Now we've said you can add another kind of sign and there's nothing, then that would prevent more of those as well. Okay, thank you for the clarification suzanne. You have your hand up go ahead. Suzanne, I, I think Richard actually raises a really interesting point. I was listening to Barbara and renee and I think that is. These are great comments to the precedent that's been set in the area and all the signage, that's on the paramount and as well as this building, because it's times Square does hide the building and it is just times square, but it is unfortunate and I'm just, but I'm not actually quite intrigued with what Richard said, because it does set the precedent. I think TD bank was smart to I. Do not know what came first here, but with all of the barrage of advertising, that's up on that building and their need to drive people to this location. It was smart to choose something that did not compete with the constancy and the mo the constant motion of these signs and to do something that was actually contrary to that aesthetically and it's in their favor to do that, and it's a smart thing to do from an advertising standpoint from a signage standpoint, but moving on from that, and so I applaud that and I think that they're very tasteful and I think it is tasteful, but I. Think Richard does raise a point for us all to consider it's nice to see that the building will be more revealed, but moving forward. What precedents to be set is: does the brill building do they now offer? This? Was this something that TD bank that they came up with or on their own as a resolution to something that met their objectives and then moving forward? This is these are brackets that are going to come onto this building as an as an option, and that would be unfortunate to have started that. That's I'm not really answering anything and I do not really know if that means saying anything but I think because I want to give credence to what renee barber said. I think it's nice to see the building, but I understand what Richard was saying and it's a very good point. Yeah. Thank you. Tony. You have a comment. Go ahead thanks, Barbara brought up a good point that I was thinking of as well. Is you know the puncture wounds in the building? You know what's going to happen when this location of TD ends up closing and the next applicant, for that particular space does want to go back to this general broad sign that was originally approved. Now we've got these wounds in the building, which may or may not come back at a later tenants place too. So you know that is one of my concerns. It's just the fact that they are doing this. The brackets, although huge and massive the originally approved ones. It looks like from reading the earlier resolution from 14 from that plan. They're not super intrusive to the building. So anyway, that's just a concern of mine. You know here in Times, Square I, think, like you have brought up already it's time square, we're supposed to have lights, we're supposed to have advertising we kind of step back a little bit from our normal. You know this is a landmark. Let's, you know kind of kind of go crazy on it. I you know grudgingly go along with that. You know I hate to see these buildings covered up in this way. I remember this application. This was my first year on the board and on the committee, and I was just completely amazed at how much advertising was getting thrown up on this building. There already was some, but this is time square right. This is what we're doing here. We allow for it here. In my opinion, the taller narrower bracket sign that they're proposing is exposing more of the building which I'm all for I, think that's huge I can't imagine a future tenant saying I'm good with this, I'm going to keep it instead of going back to the already approved nine foot wide sign, I. Imagine at some point once this tenant is gone, we're going to go back to having the front of this facade covered up again in that little opening. So, overall, you know it's time square, so I'm kind of relaxing myself a little bit. I think this is a pretty decent option, mostly because we get to see the building more yeah. Thank you, tony I will jump in and share. My comments, I think that all the comments that have been made are really well taken. I struggle with the amount of penetration into the terracotta and I would really urge the applicant to look into a way to actually attach the bracket sign through the joints between the terracotta tiles rather than going in the historic fabric. I think it would be a much less intrusive way and if you need to actually have more points of juncture that are smaller and less intrusive, I think it's an appropriate way to to address it rather than having less but having them bigger and having them through the terracotta, which I think is really problematic, so that that's one aspect I would say that the size of the sign is something that I, I'm fine with I. Think it's a good proportion for the building. It's you know it. It's not it's not too big. It's not too wide. I do not have an issue with the internal elimination. I, certainly understand and appreciate that the rules prohibit internal elimination, but it is more in the context of other types of individual landmarks or in historic districts. Where you know, certainly in the ladies mile, it is absolutely inappropriate to have an internal eliminated sign on a building. Once again, this is vastly different times. Square is not a historic district, but nonetheless you know we can not ignore the context. What I have an issue with is actually adding signage when a master plan is in place, and although the applicant here today is telling us that they're not interested in sign h, that has been approved nonetheless, sign h remains as being an approved signage that can be installed at any time by anyone by the way. So you know, maybe in two years time, TD will decide that it is actually a good way to go about and they want to put it. Maybe they want to rent it to somebody else. Maybe TD will nolan will be the tenant at some point and another tenant will come by and then we end up with a net gain of one sign, and this is where I'm starting to have real issues, because we work really hard on master plans. For that very reason, it is a master plan. You know exactly what you get. It is very predictable. This is it and I think that the proper approach for this particular application would be instead of approving a sign as an additional signage that is not part of the master plan. I would really encourage the applicant to alter the master plan so that we know what the predictability is. We know that it's a quick pro quo. You no longer want sign age, you're getting a bracket and that I would be fine. That I think would be actually a good outcome. It would be preferable and it would also not set a precedent, meaning that if anybody else wants to give up their flat sign, you know, let's say that you know sign D is no longer interested in this and would like a bracket sign. We know what the mechanism is for that. It's a trade-off. It's you know you take off Sine D and you put your bracket sign, but we know that we have a zero net sum of added signage going forward if there's any any alteration that is desired by a specific tenant. So so, basically those are my comments. You know I'm in favor of supporting this. This particular sign provided that it is folded into an alteration to the master plan, and you know with the comments that you know about the attachment of the bracket to to the facade. I am not a fan of the other, the door pole I think that it's not very elegant and does not complement the the beautiful brass doors. I also appreciate that you know it is a fairly temporary. You know solution for them and it's a very easy fix, but I think that you know it's certainly not a deal breaker, but I think we should note it in our resolution. Once again, you know our resolution is acts actually as our minutes. So you know this is the time to write it down that you know we're not enamored with with those door pulls if you know if it happens, to be the consensus. So so those are my comments. Renee cafero, you have your hand up, go ahead, renee, okay! Well with all that I guess, I'm changing my comments a little bit, but one of the things I was going to suggest is that we do put in some sort of language about the door, pulls saying that, since we know that they're going to keep the original door pools that they have. You know some sort of language to that effect that that those be kept in a safe place for like the next tenants, and that can be rectified. So you know something to codify that agreement that they were going to keep those. You know, I see your point now about you know the master plan stuff so I still kind of like this better than the original thing, but I now from a technical standpoint, understand what the point you're saying that it needs to be not just a net gain of one but and done piecemeal, but needs to be folded in as an alteration to the master plan which is sort of a technical thing which I would agree with so I mean if that's something that we can put in the resolution to I would agree with that. But I just wanted to mention that we should put something in about that. The applicant has said they're going to keep the door pools for the building, so then it can be. That can be reversed if we want to yeah and the applicant actually just dropped a message in the the Chat box saying that the approved sign H overlaps, the pilaster that the proposed bracket sign is mounted to so physically. You could not have both at the same time, which is great but nonetheless does not address the precedent issue. So I want to see if there are any other comments or if we're getting closer to you know a consensus on this application. Barbara. You have your hand up go ahead, but they could have a smaller signage right. I mean no. The sign would have to the sign would have to be built as per as approved. I see. Okay, all right! That's interesting! Yeah! The thing, though, is you know I do not. We have to keep in mind that the staff today has you know a lot more leeway than they did in the past and with this staff be able to amend the master plan, because the proposed sign age would be smaller than originally approved. It is a possibility. I do not know. I really do not know. You know I just feel that, for the for the sake of you know, making sure we're not setting a precedent, we should recommend that you know it is an alteration to the master plan rather than an additional signage. You know separate of of the other, the master plan that we reviewed Tony go ahead, yeah just quickly, I think it's a brilliant idea. It really keeps tabs on. You know what you're able to do it's either this or that period. Just because sign h in this particular instance does block the power steering they have to remove. It does not mean it's going to be the case for all these other signs around the building, so, potentially a lot more of these bracket signs could be added, so leila I think that's fantastic. I'd totally be on board with that with making sure that it's either. You know, if you're going with this option, then we're removing this other option that was previously approved. It's this or that for this particular tenant yeah and you know, I think it's fair. It's you know to me not getting in the way of what the where the applicant, in that instance, TD is trying to accomplish we're supporting the signage that they're proposing, and you know, I'm really hoping that the building ownership also agrees that you know it's a fair trade-off that you know is basically keeping the amount of signage in a pretty consistent way on the building. Barbara. You have your hand up again. Do you wish to add a comment? No sorry, I just did not lower my hand. Okay, all right so unless I want I, just want to make sure that all those who wish to comment have had the opportunity. It seems that you know we have consensus on the recommendation. We're going to make just want to make sure that everybody is on board. I, do not see any more raised hands here, so what I would like to do is actually get out of order for a second and engage with the applicant again to seek their feedback on such recommendation. I think that if they are in support of this position, you know to the extent that they can, because you know obviously ownership of the building is you know more of the relevant stakeholder here, but you know I just want to to see their comment on the the discussion that we just had. So you know I would ask Scott and Paul if you would agree to actually request that the master plan be altered, so that sign h is no longer part of the master plan, but sign h becomes an internally eliminated bracket. Sign yeah, so I'll speak to that. Certainly, an interesting proposition, I think I would start by kind of explaining it from a legal procedural perspective, and then you know tell you that it kind of depends, which is the typical lawyer answer: I apologize, but you know, because the proposed sign H would overlap the proposed bracket sign. You can not do sine h anymore. Any change to sign h that is not 29 foot by seven and a half foot, as shown on the screen in front of you, would be another non-conforming sign, contrary to the approved master plan. So therefore, it would be subject to additional LPC certificate of appropriateness as either a modification to the master plan or the same sort of application that we're proposing now, which is subject to a cfa. So you would have another opportunity to review that in you know any future case which is I, think responsive to your point generally about our application now with regard to precedent or future applications for bracket signs that might replace other signs that have already been approved in the master plan. You know that may not always be the case. In this case it just happens that it would be impossible to have both. So you know I, you know with that explanation. I do not know that you're. You know that your thought here is as relevant as it might be in another context and then, but then putting that aside separately. We, you know we can look into it and talk to TD about exactly what their arrangement is. You know whether they have something in writing from the landlord that they, you know, forego the opportunity to do. You know an advertising sign here in future. You know, I'm pretty sure, that's part of our lease arrangement with them is that we take the space and we get to do it an accessory sign on the pilaster instead of their advertising sign. So you know we could certainly you know kind of put their feet to the fire, and you know you know explore that drill down on it, but I do not have a I can't commit to it at the moment, and we do not have a firm answer about. You know that arrangement either so I think you're safe on that point, but you know we can respond after the without for the whole board meeting. Perhaps you know with a an email that addresses the point. Okay, yeah and I certainly appreciate that you know that there are basically two parties here and you know: building ownership and the tenant you know are each you know doing their job and you can only comment for the tenant. While you know, building ownership may have different views, so you know I certainly appreciate that, but you know it is helpful to to hear that you know in essence, you acknowledge that you know sign H as proposed can not be constructed and therefore you do not have any objection to. You know sign H not being installed, because signage can not be installed if the bracket sign goes up. So you know, I will just say that LPC rules have been in flux over the past five years and although today, it's probably fair to say that if any alterations to the master plan were to be made, it would come back to us for comment, but we can not take it for granted and therefore I think it's really important to you know, ask what would really make us feel comfortable so that you know going forward the integrity of the building is preserved as much as possible. So let's move back to business session and wrap up this. This discussion so I think we are ready to make a motion. I'm happy to make it, or maybe someone else wants to to jump in and make a motion on this application. Okay, so I will make the motion to deny the application unless the proposed bracket sign is incorporated as an alteration to the master plan and is seen as a replacement to the previously approved sign h, with the specific recommendation that the bracket sign be installed in a way to be, as least intrusive as possible to the historic fabric, puncturing, the avoiding any puncture to the other terracotta and as much as possible in sewing the penetration points into the joints between the the terracotta tiles and with the comment that the the door pulls are not contextual and we urge the applicant and the building owner to actually save the existing hardware, although not original it has been deemed appropriate and keep it in a safe place and agrees to replace it upon the the departure of TD. If that were to happen and I think that's about all the points that we covered did I forget anything okay, so I need a second all right. So we are taking this to a vote and chuck. You have your hand up chuck, go ahead. I! Do I'm having a little difficulty reconciling the applicant's position on the master plan with the com with the motion to deny? Unless because what I heard the applicant say was they would try to do that, but they but- and they would report back to us at the board meeting so I guess I'm wondering whether it's necessary for us to deny this. Unless, since that's not what the applicant said well, the applicant said that they do not have the power to make this determination. In the end, the I think that the entity that has the power to make this determination, whether they agree or not, is LPC, and we want to be as clear as possible and I mean you've been on the committee for long enough to know that our way of expressing conditions is actually to express a denial unless those conditions were met. This is a more clear message that we're sending to LPC, but in essence and in substance, it is a conditional approval. We have found that conditional approvals phrased as approvals with conditions end up reading as straight approvals, and it is more desirable that our message is clearly spelled out. So, although we are spelling it out as a denial unless conditions are met, it is a conditional approval. I have been on the committee for I certainly understand that that's been the process, I wonder if it has the effect of diluting our message in that everyone expects us to deny. Unless- and so, I'm just raising the issue of whether the committee would have more persuasiveness with the commission. If we were a little more direct in stating our concern, I mean we can, you know, certainly discuss the motion. I mean we have a motion and we have a second. If a majority of the committee feels that you know it should be phrased differently, we can certainly entertain it, but you know like technically we have a motion and we have a second. So you know I mean unless I see a gizzy enhance being raised. You know I would certainly you know, entertain discussing the motion, some more, but otherwise I think we're going to have to take it to a vote. Okay, all right. So this is a vote to deny unless the master plan is altered and with all the specifications that I mentioned first and final vote of the evening buzz yes, renee, yes, James, yes, Laura, yes, John! Yes! Thank you! Everybody! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good night.
