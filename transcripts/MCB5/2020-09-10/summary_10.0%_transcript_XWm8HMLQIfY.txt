The first thing, I noticed is: it looks like almost everybody's gotten , I'm, just going to wait until 605 make sure we can get as many people as possible to start If you're joining from a phone during our public session.
The district manager's report and committee reports, which include resolutions, questions comments, and we go into a vote on the actions that are before the full board comments and questions from either applicants or the public or if additional information is needed, that's allowed only if you are recognized by the chair, so I will start.
There's, this very disturbing action that the city is trying to take by throwing out the 300 people living at the Harmonia Family adult family, shelter on West, 31St Street.
Now they were told that they're going to have to all leave that building and not clear where those people would be sent or under what circumstances or whether anyone will even do an evaluation of all of their special needs and whether they could be met in other facilities, and this is being done for no justifiable reason regarding the harmonia, but rather because the mayor decided he was going to remove the men currently living in the Lucerne hotel on West 79Th Street, because some in the community were upset about that men's shelter.
I just want to highlight that we have a successful functioning shelter for a special needs population on West 31st, while people are always nervous about new services when they come in, our community worked with them.
No reason to destroy two separate programs in two different locations with no community notice unless they contacted community board 5 within the last 24 hours, but they had not even contacted the provider of the services So we're working hard to try to get press attention and to convince city hall that they have made a major error here and that they may have issues that they need to deal with at the Lucerne.
Yes, all right, today, Congresswoman Maloney held a hearing on the importance of ensuring that the Census Bureau has enough time to ensure the complete count at the end of July, the president shortened the response window by 30 days, meaning that we only have until September 30th to for everyone to fill out their census.
We were going to have a hundred men six days a week with phenomenal outdoor and indoor activities and 20 jobs, paid full, time, There's, a potential you'll know more than I will perhaps tomorrow lawsuit from legal aid to state that the residents of the harmonia can not be moved.
So look forward to that, and that takes us now into our committee reports and we start with budget education and city services, and that is renee consulate.
You all heard in the public session, there's an issue that has arisen- We at CB5 only learned of this yesterday afternoon via the borough president's Tweet, and this is regarding the location of the 280 adult male clients, from the Lucerne hotel to one of our permanent shelters in the district.
We have not received any direct confirmation from DHS of the city that the people who worked in the harmonia may be in danger of losing their positions over the transition, and it's unclear who will be the provider if sus is not there once the current clients are removed.
This number does not even include our permanent shelters like the harmonia, so we do recognize the importance of providing care for the most vulnerable and we really work to ensure the smooth transition of the homeless clients into the neighborhood.
We have continuously asked the city and DHS for transparency, open communication and collaboration and really clear plans for managing issues, particularly given that we have such a clustering within the district.
So we're only going to cause a larger problem down the road by you know displacing these families, so we offering up solutions or just sort of like shaking our fist at them and asking for more transparency in the future, and I guess.
The mayor heard about that- And I was really they should be ashamed of themselves- for how you know how we treated the homeless issue in the northern part of our district, I'm, a big supporter of that perks of having the shelter, there, and I would think that could be an option.
What I think is a political move to you: Appease big donor nimbys in the upper West side and these nicer areas or billionaires row, and you see it time and again and just thinking you just kick the can to a different neighborhood, and You know it's really unfair for folks to not take their fair share in New York City.
I have concerns about getting into a conversation about which sites and possible solutions, because I do not know that we can have the capacity or the information have not done the due diligence to be able to fairly and comprehensively have that conversation, not that we should not have it, but I think that for the outset of this fight, which is only beginning most likely, what this resolution might be most effective is for it to be a All about it to say all the problems that renee kinsella, you outlined, the transparency, the accountability, the community, involvement, data, driven decisions, rationale.
I do not believe that this is a decision about public health, And I think that our focus needs to be about what's happening in our district and with the programs renee kinsella that you did such a good job of explaining have attract real track record, and that should be our primary concern of this resolution is protecting those families.
Just I wanted to say that I do think I'd like to see something in a resolution, kind of calling out the sort of non, cohesive, whack, a- That makes sense, and that does that in a coherent manner and is not just a matter of sort of passing around political footballs because it just feels like that's what they've been doing before during and probably after the pandemic.
But if the vote has been taken and the information that we want to put in the resolution is gone over at this meeting, I think time is of the essence.
Clayton again, I do have a question to the point about solutions that we can offer simply as far as process renee is there is there something that you would recommend that we could say about the ways in which we would want community involvement and transparency?
If renee confront the two Renais will work on putting together a resolution, but in order to do that, we need input the way we just got from Clayton information.
I, we have 600 members, it's important that the neighborhood association, like the Community board, knows what's going on in their own neighborhoods, I'm all for that, and I do not know if there's any room in a resolution for involving the real estate industry that has been given tax abatements for the last 40 years to build whatever they want and not one thought is put into shelters of the homeless situation.
I mean you can not move people like that at You know the mayor's whim, because it is convenient because he needs to get rid of a problem somewhere, else.
We need to get involved, but certainly whatever the situation is over there, it should not be at the expense of residents of our district and a provider in our district that have been doing a good job, and you know I think we really should make that point as strong as possible and as Renee Faro said.
But that seems like the the to me in a resolution that was going to be strongly worded talking about how the how the people who are being affected are treated as the most is the most important part, or it sounds like The. I dropped a link to the political article about it that came out a couple of hours ago, where De Blasio.
Think it's the larger policy issue that you're, referring to one thing that I will say is that when you think about the people in the Harmonia right, one of the things that clients need are is the stability and the routine.
That is merely a screen first for something else frequently when it comes to the issue of homelessness, communities will say that their objection is that they were not informed beforehand when their objection is really more that they do not want a homeless shelter cited in their area, and so I think.
In addition to the strong language, about the need for community involvement in these decisions, I think it's appropriate to specify that our objection here is not that homeless people are being proposed to be moved into our district.
But, you know, when there's so many stresses on the homeless services system, to direct a provider to suddenly shuffle around their clients all over the city, to let go staff to dismantle all of their administrative systems that supported this shelter.
I mean it's probably a huge burden on the administration of Sus, so that takes away from their ability to serve clients all over the city at their other shelters as well, I think this is happening writ large with all of these unexpected moves and how they affect the staff and the administration at all of these homeless services providers, including the one that I work, at.
There are two things: I think the first thing is Yes, it's kind of awful that there was no plan for these people, right, No plan to bring them to any other shelter, and it's really unfortunate that the actual shelters that could potentially serve them are completely closed, especially the ones near me like the one on 51st street and park.
The second thing is you know, so I'm sympathetic for both communities right because I think the hotel, community.
I, think one thing that I just do not want people to miss out here is that hotels are closing their doors because they just have no income right.
Now, and I know that that's not understandable, because the homeless population is very vulnerable and, having worked in one myself, I completely see where this sentiment is coming from, but I just feel like.
We need to understand both sides where people might not have enough money to support the homeless at this time.
I. Think that our best credibility as a board here will be to focus on in this resolution, to focus on the things that we feel most passionately and that we know.
I fully support this I just want to mention that in the chat we've had some questions regarding other hotels and other problems, and rather than get into that this evening, because we are working on something very specific and trying to do that so that we can get to our regular agenda, which is rather lengthy, as well.
It's, a good question, thank you, okay, renee and renee how about recapping so that the board has an idea of what will be going into this resolution and we can take a vote on it.
I mean I guess this is being the resolution is going to be sent to the mayor and Cc everybody and under God. You know in our purview to look at as an application, but we proactively saw, and so it would be like a strongly adv opposes.
I do think calling upon them to reverse their decision, needs to be in there someplace, but practically I mean people are getting moved out of there as we speak.
I. Do not think that we'll be able to possibly reverse this, because now you've moved people out of the Lucerne and they need somewhere to go, and so we can put that in there.
But I do not think it's really in like legally in our purview to tell them to stop anything, but we should definitely put in, and I will write that clause as well about how we would like them to reverse their decision and find other suitable places for the folks at Lucerne if they can't go back to the Lucerne, so that Clayton made an important point that the resolution should also address after the fact that if this is de facto happening- But if we want to include that you said you know, we may not be able to halt that.
The first was the committee's consideration of the NYPD budget and the role of the police department, and the second was support of exempting small businesses from the commercial tax rent, tax.
We wanted to respond to the physical year 2021 executive budget, just to speak to the distribution of cuts among agencies that directly serve some of the communities disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 and by the New York City Police Department, and we decided that we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into the boar's physical year, 2022 budget request, so that can sort of guide and be used as a template when we make those requests later on.
A lot of people were calling for at least a billion dollars to be removed from the NYPD funding and the f21 budget, and when all was said and done, what actually passed was that the NYPD ended up being allocated 5.222 billion dollars and that equaled a four 414 million dollars reduction.
Another issue that we saw was that the budget yep counts on partial hiring freezes and agreements with the city's municipal, labor unions and all but 62 million of the reduction to the NYPD, comprised either fringe benefits, unenforceable, overtime and future commitments that were not really included in the signed.
We were concerned that there was a shift of school crossing guards to the department of education, because that just really moves the money from the NYPD to the DOE, but according to the New York City's independent budget office.
I also want to say that I appreciate that the resolution commits to, as you mentioned, rene, a reconsideration later on of the role of the police in New, York, City.
I'm, not sure if the name of the resolution actually matters, but it currently says NYPD budget and alternative public safety.
Yet I- do not want to give the impression that this resolution contains our full thinking on alternate public safety strategies.
Maybe you know core principles for NYPD budget allocations, or something like that.
I was saying: Saddled has a certain connotation to it, and my request would be that we changed that to tasked with or charged with, Saddle sort of implies, a passive role in the NYPD in this process of taking on new responsibilities, which I think is historically inaccurate in certain areas.
You know it may not be friendly You accept that the mission of the NYPD I mean we're looking to move some of the other aspects of the Nypd's work, meaning the Nypd's collective mission currently, which includes many of the things that you may not believe, are part of public order, which includes school safety and crossing guards and all those wonderful things, which is why we use the word mission collectively of what they do.
And if they're soldiers, then you know what does that make the citizens of New, York, and I think that it would be appropriate to ask that, in addition to this information being shared with us, we also ask that they come up with a plan to stop the acquisitions within the next year, which again, I believe, is a relatively mainstream request and then also come up with a plan to sell that equipment back to the United States government, which itself would raise a substantial amount of money for the city.
When I read number four in the core principles where the mission should line up, it seems like that would be positive, because you're there, what they were saying, is they're moving this thing that they believe lines up with the mission yoe more than an NYPD.
I brought this up at some point, but I can't remember when, but when you guys were looking at the budget numbers, you know And again, I support this resolution.
Think what we're talking about when we talk about the police, budget- We had people come in to try and help us understand what the appropriations are for, and we, you know there are.
But we need to get that information, and this is our first cut at this Well, that makes sense and for the Department of Education sort of budget shift we're not advocating in any way by that resolution that, like or that portion of the resolution, that we would condone privatization of that correct.
Like okay, no You know social workers might be able not to take the place of police officers in keeping public order or addressing crime.
So, we will have that opportunity and we will hear from the NYPD Then I do not know that we ever get any response specifically about budget issues.
And I do not think anybody on the Bex Committee or anyone in support of this resolution is saying that they do not want the NYPD to do their job or that we feel that we should be asleep at the switch and rest on our laurels and be of our safety.
We are not reinventing the wheel, there's an entire hundreds of people that work for the New York City comptroller, who June, I think, was fourth released.
I will absolutely support this resolution, because I know from those stats from people that are much smarter and do this for a living that I have run the traps on all of these things.
There's, a general sense of disengagement among the police officers have had two separate conversations with various police officers on duty on the street, both for extended conversations between 20 and 30 minutes, and they have, at two separate occasions, told me that they are receiving very little respect from the citizens of New York City It is a separate matter from the budget cut that the remaining police officers that we have, who are on duty need to respond according to their assigned responsibilities and according to the values of the NYPD.
We've got three more comments and then we're going to take this to a vote, Matthew Nancy That's, the one that you were working on correct If we, rather than in line in line 42, it says the mayor's claimed that Nypd's budget was reduced by a total of a billion DOT instead of having the sort of the where the section in 48 what?
You know I've heard various things on this call, but I think the rise in crime rates over the last six months has been well documented, And, if not actual crime, mates, I can tell you how people feel just being on the streets, and I, hear Fellow Board members saying that the stats do not do that and that there have only been say: 200 murders in the city.
There's a line in the resolution that discusses the budget cuts as a matter of fairness, and I understand that, but you know for a lot of people.
I guess just to the conversation really went off in a direction of a bigger picture view of what's happening in our city and what causes crime and how do we deal with people feeling safe, And, I, think renee and Clayton like referenced the data, not really backing up feelings, and in many cases I guess I would challenge you, know.
I do not think this resolution says that, but I would challenge those who disagree to actually provide data, that more police officers and a higher budget for police department actually reduces the violent crime rate, because that's not the data that I've been looking at.
I do not want to pretend that I know that the police officers can do their job with the equipment, So So I will not support the resolution.
The issue of military equipment used by police is a complex one and without the input of the NYPD and people who are expert on that subject, it's I think inappropriate for us.
We need to remember that a large portion of what thwarts the terrorism attacks in New York City is actually funded through federal money, which obviously this community board has absolutely no ability to touch and will not be going.
You know things that the NYPD has how much of their budget does it comprise.
I know time is valuable for most people, but when something super important comes, up, try and be a part of it at that.
Yes, I think I have to vote present, but Any questions to the resolution.
We also look forward to working with the Bex Committee and with land use to increase the number of spaces where we have this conversation when it comes to what we advocate for in the city's budget and how it would impact zoning issues before our land.
This is just an update to let you know that youth programs are returning to play in the parks, given safety protocols and the size of the groups, and I think there was something like nine, almost 9,000 people who signed a petition to advocate for the administration to reverse its policy about this, and so it was a good news night for the community to hear that was being reversed and almost immediately questions camp about like how about adults, So that conversation is ongoing and the parks and public Spaces committee will be the place for you to here and have that conversation.
