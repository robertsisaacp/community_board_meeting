The first thing, I noticed is: it looks like almost everybody's gotten , I'm, just going to wait until 605 make sure we can get as many people as possible to start If you're joining from a phone during our public session.
The district manager's report and committee reports, which include resolutions, questions, comments and we go into a vote on the actions that are before the full board comments and questions from either applicants or the public or if additional information is needed, that's allowed only if you are recognized by the chair, so I will start this evening's meetings calling on our electeds.
There's, this very disturbing action that the city is trying to take by throwing out the 300 people living at the harmonia family, adult family, shelter on west 31st, street.
Now they were told that they're going to have to all leave that building and not clear where those people would be sent or under what circumstances or whether anyone will even do an evaluation of all of their special needs and whether they could be met in other facilities, and this is being done for no justifiable reason regarding the harmonia, but rather because the mayor decided, he was going to remove the men currently living in the lucerne hotel on west 79th street, because some in the community were upset about that men's shelter.
I just want to highlight that we have a successful functioning shelter for a special needs population on west 31st, while people are always nervous about new services when they come in, our community worked with them.
No reason to destroy two separate programs in two different locations with no community notice unless they contacted community board 5 within the last 24 hours, but they hadn't even contacted the provider of the services and so we're working hard to try to get press attention and to convince city hall that they have made a major error here and that they may have issues that they need to deal with at the lucerne.
I. Think our two main focuses like many folks across the city are one of course school reopening and also what's going on with small businesses So, on the small business front, we released a save mainstream initiative, which is really our plan to hopefully ensure that small businesses across the city will be able to survive the pandemic and also be able to thrive on the other side of it.
This is kind of a big issue right now, so it's september, 23rd from five to seven, we'll have a virtual free training on safe and effective methods for rat prevention in your building, and your neighborhood, and I can send that flyer to luke Next abigail, hello, everyone, I, don't know how I can beat the rad academy lori, but I actually, I did want to start by talking a little bit just about the situation.
You very much, and I want to thank board five, because that the worst of the pandemic we're still meeting coming up with ideas, I, don't see other any others in terms of the representatives, so I think we will move into our public session hearing from the public for two minutes: each craig.
They could wear to school, so they got leggings, hoodies, sweatshirts and, of course, sashes and vests, all with ample pockets, and I also just want to let you know that an fit alum illustrated lebron james's new york times, best-selling children's book.
So, look forward to that, and that takes us now into our committee reports and we start with budget education and city services, and that is renee consulate.
You all heard in the public session, there's an issue that has arisen- We at cb5 only learned of this yesterday afternoon via the borough president's tweet, and this is regarding the location of the 280 adult male clients, from the lucerne hotel to one of our permanent shelters in the district.
This number doesn't even include our permanent shelters like the harmonia, so we do recognize the importance of providing care for the most vulnerable and we really work to ensure the smooth transition of the homeless clients into the neighborhood.
We have continuously asked the city and dhs for transparency, open communication and collaboration and really clear plans for managing issues, particularly given that we have such a clustering within the district.
The mayor heard about that- And I was really they should be ashamed of themselves- for how you know how we treated the homeless issue in the northern part of our district, I'm, a big supporter of that perks of having the shelter, there, and I would think that could be an option.
I have concerns about getting into a conversation about which sites and possible solutions, because I don't know that we can have the capacity or the information have not done the due diligence to be able to fairly and comprehensively have that conversation, not that we shouldn't have it, but I think that for the outset of this fight, which is only beginning most likely, what this resolution might be most effective is for it to be a All about it to say all the problems that renee kinsella, you outlined, the transparency, the accountability, the community, involvement, data-driven, decisions, rationale.
Don't believe that this is a decision about public health, And I think that our focus needs to be about what's happening in our district and with the programs renee kinsella that you did such a good job of explaining have attract real track record, and that should be our primary concern of this resolution is protecting those families.
Okay, in that case, I I'm not to go around circles, but I agree with renee and clayton that this is a politically motivated move, having nothing to do with the needs of either the men at the lucerne or the people at the harmonia, and we should call out the administration on this, because this is a joke.
I, just I wanted to say that I do think I'd like to see something in a resolution, kind of calling out the sort of non-cohesive, whack-a-mole nature of the administration's approach to homelessness.
But if the vote has been taken and the information that we want to put in the resolution is gone over at this meeting, I think time is of the essence.
Right now, it sounds to me, is if renee confront the two renais will work on putting together a resolution, but in order to do that, we need input the way we just got from clayton information.
We have 600 members, it's important that the neighborhood association, like the community board, knows what's going on in their own neighborhoods.
Don't know if there's any room in a resolution for involving the real estate industry that has been given tax abatements for the last 40 years to build whatever they want and not one thought is put into shelters of the homeless situation.
I mean you cannot move people like that at You know the mayor's whim, because it is convenient because he needs to get rid of a problem somewhere, else.
But that seems like the the to me in a resolution that was going to be strongly worded talking about how the how the people who are being affected are treated as the most is the most important part, or it sounds like The. I dropped a link to the political article about it that came out a couple of hours, ago, where de Blasio.
Think it's the larger policy issue that you're, referring to one thing that I will say is that when you think about the people in the harmonia right, one of the things that clients need are is the stability and the routine.
That is merely a screen first for something else frequently when it comes to the issue of homelessness, communities will say that their objection is that they were not informed beforehand when their objection is really more, that they don't want a homeless shelter cited in their area, and so I think.
In addition to the strong language, about the need for community involvement in these decisions, I think it's appropriate to specify that our objection here is not that homeless people are being proposed to be moved into our district.
But, you know, when there's so many stresses on the homeless services system, to direct a provider to suddenly shuffle around their clients all over the city, to let go staff to dismantle all of their administrative systems that supported this shelter.
I think this is happening writ large with all of these unexpected moves and how they affect the staff and the administration at all of these homeless services providers, including the one that I work at okay.
There are two things I think the first thing is Yes, it's kind of awful that there was no plan for these people, right, No plan to bring them to any other shelter, and it's really unfortunate that the actual shelters that could potentially serve them are completely closed, especially the ones near me like the one on 51st street and park.
The second thing is you know, so I'm sympathetic for both communities right because I think the hotel, community.
I, think one thing that I just don't want people to miss out here is that hotels are closing their doors because they just have no income right.
Now, and I know that that's not understandable, because the homeless population is very vulnerable and, having worked in one myself, I completely see where this sentiment is coming from, but I just feel like.
We need to understand both sides where people might not have enough money to support the homeless at this time.
Thus far in terms of what's going into the resolution, But I think what would be more powerful is the state, the backup plans So. One of the reasons that people have been moved into.
I think that our best credibility as a board here will be to focus on in this resolution, to focus on the things that we feel most passionately and that we know.
I fully support this I just want to mention that in the chat we've had some questions regarding other hotels and other problems, and rather than get into that this evening, because we are working on something very specific and trying to do that so that we can get to our regular agenda, which is rather lengthy, as well.
It's, a good question, thank you, okay, renee and renee how about recapping so that the board has an idea of what will be going into this resolution and we can take a vote on it.
I do think calling upon them to reverse their decision needs to be in there someplace, but practically I mean people are getting moved out of there as we speak.
I. Don't think that we'll be able to possibly reverse this, because now you've moved people out of the lucerne and they need somewhere to go, and so we can put that in there.
Clayton made an important point that the resolution should also address after the fact that if this is de facto happening- But if we want to include that you said you know, we may not be able to halt that.
The first was the committee's consideration of the NYPD budget and the role of the police department, and the second was support of exempting small businesses from the commercial tax rent, tax.
There was a lot of committee and community input and what we did was we used a template that I think the transportation committee had developed as a way of organizing all the information, and we put it into the facts, our core principles and then the recommendations that we wanted to make.
We wanted to respond to the physical year 2021 executive budget, just to speak to the distribution of cuts among agencies that directly serve some of the communities disproportionately impacted by kovid and by the new york city police department, and we decided that we wanted a statement of principles to be incorporated into the boar's physical year, 2022 budget request, so that can sort of guide and be used as a template.
A lot of people were calling for at least a billion dollars to be removed from the NYPD funding and the f21 budget, and when all was said and done.
But according to the new york city's independent budget office, all that really meant was that the DOE would operate a program that it already had, but under funding because they underwriting rather because they were sending this 307 million to the NYPD for school safety programs.
I also want to say that I appreciate that the resolution commits to, as you mentioned, rene, a reconsideration later on of the role of the police in new york.
I'm, not sure if the name of the resolution actually matters, but it currently says NYPD budget and alternative public safety.
Yet I- don't want to give the impression that this resolution contains our full thinking on alternate public safety strategies.
If you want that in we're going to have to vote on it, would it be possible to move on to my last note, since I don't want to waste our time on this, which is not necessarily my main point sure, moving on to what I had in as line 324, the discussion of the military-grade equipment, which is the third to last resolved In addition to this sort of itemized information about military-grade, equipment, I think it is important to actually ask for a plan to both cease the acquisition of new equipment and actually reduce the equipment that they have.
I brought this up at some point, but I can't remember when, but when you guys were looking at the budget numbers, you know And again, I support this resolution.
When we talk about the police, budget- We had people come in to try and help us understand what the appropriations are for, and we, you know there are.
Here's this little piece of budget Community, policing, We, get these big watches of budget But we need to get that information, and this is our first cut at this That makes sense and for the department of education sort of budget shift we're not advocating in any way by that resolution that, like or that portion of the resolution, that we would condone privatization of that correct.
Like okay, no You know social workers might be able not to take the place of police officers in keeping public order or addressing crime.
Kind of feels right, now, especially if you're out of town We, need some sort of protective measures and I just wanted to see that those stats, because I feel, like the number of police, have been increasing year over year, the same with the population, and we also have to keep in mind that the majority of the people employed at NYPD are ethnic minorities and the very population of people that we're really trying to protect.
Don't think anybody on the bex committee or anyone in support of this resolution is saying that they don't want the NYPD to do their job or that we feel that we should be asleep at the switch and rest on our laurels and be of our safety.
We are not reinventing the wheel, there's an entire hundreds of people that work for the new york city comptroller, who June, I think, was fourth released.
I will absolutely support this resolution, because I know from those stats from people that are much smarter and do this for a living.
Don't really need the NYPD to vouch for their own budget, Cut, obviously they're not going to ever agree with us, but that doesn't mean they're not gonna, be able to do their job.
I mean it makes it easier to read Aside from the budget cuts budget, deficits, I , don't know if we want to consider adding in just the general police officer's response.
We've got three more comments and then we're going to take this to a vote, matthew, nancy That's, the one that you were working on, correct, My question is what,: if we, rather than in line in line 42, it says the mayor's claimed that nypd's budget was reduced by a total of a billion DOT instead of having the sort of the where the section in 48 what if we incorporated the idea of what they were doing into line 42 so that it read.
I guess just to the conversation really went off in a direction of a bigger picture view of what's happening in our city and what causes crime and how do we deal with people feeling safe, And, I, think renee and clayton like referenced the data, not really backing up feelings and in many cases I guess I would challenge you, know.
I. Don't think this resolution says that, but I would challenge those who disagree to actually provide data, that more police officers and a higher budget for police department actually reduces the violent crime rate, because that's not the data that I've been looking at.
I. Don't want to pretend that I know that the police officers can do their job with the equipment, so So I will not support the resolution.
The issue of military equipment used by police is a complex one and without the input of the NYPD and people who are expert on that subject, it's I think inappropriate for us, as a community board to make a decision.
We need to remember that a large portion of what thwarts the terrorism attacks in new york city is actually funded through federal money, which obviously this community board has absolutely no ability to touch and will not be going.
You know things that the NYPD has how much of their budget does.
I know time is valuable for most people, but when something super important comes, up, try and be a part of it at that.
We also look forward to working with the bex committee and with land use to increase the number of spaces where we have this conversation when it comes to what we advocate for in the city's budget and how it would impact zoning issues before our land use.
This is just an update to let you know that youth programs are returning to play in the parks, given safety protocols and the size of the groups, and I think there was something like nine, almost 9 000 people who signed a petition to advocate for the administration to reverse its policy about this, and so it was a good news night for the community to hear that was being reversed and almost immediately questions camp about like how about adults, And, so that conversation is ongoing and the parks and public spaces committee will be the place for you to here and have that conversation.
