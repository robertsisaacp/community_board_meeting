The first thing, I noticed is: it looks like almost everybody's gotten I'm just going to wait until 605 make sure we can get as many people as possible to start If you're joining from a phone during our public session, This is community board, fives full board, meeting I hope you have been safe and healthy and enjoyed the summer.
The chairs report, the district manager's report and committee reports, which include resolutions, questions comments and we go into a vote on the actions that are before the full board comments and questions from either applicants or the public or if additional information is needed, that's allowed only if you are recognized by the chair, so I will start this evening's meetings calling on our electeds I believe we have senator kruger on board.
Now they were told that they're going to have to all leave that building and not clear where those people would be sent or under what circumstances or whether anyone will even do an evaluation of all of their special needs and whether they could be met in other facilities, and this is being done for no justifiable reason regarding the harmonia, but rather because the mayor decided, he was going to remove the men currently living in the lucerne hotel on west 79th street, because some in the community were upset about that men's shelter.
No reason to destroy two separate programs in two different locations with no community notice unless they contacted community board 5 within the last 24 hours, but they hadn't even contacted the provider of the services and so we're working hard to try to get press attention and to convince city hall that they have made a major error here and that they may have issues that they need to deal with at the lucerne That is not a justification to destroy another very successful, well-established community supported shelter in community board.
We know that school buses are still a question mark , so we want to give high school students the opportunity to bike to school by making sure they all have access to a city bike membership and also develop bike infrastructure around schools to make sure they can do that safely, all soon boy, right down to the last second great, so indoor dining last week, the speaker issued a statement calling for indoor dining We were happy to see that, after calls from the speaker's office and other local stakeholders, governor Cuomo announced that indoor dining in new york city can resume on september 30th, albeit at 25 capacity, and with strict restrictions.
Actually I did want to start by talking a little bit just about the situation and it's already been addressed, but tomorrow keith is actually going to be hosting a press conference with a number of other electeds on this call, as well as advocates and potentially some residents of the shelter at harmonia We will keep you updated on that, but obviously an unacceptable situation and he's also a co-prime sponsor on a bill to ban housing.
and I want to thank the local officials because they jumped right in those You know individuals who have adult children who have challenges, and maybe the parent has challenges, and there are 150 of them and I think it was a lot of work to make people comfortable with that group of individuals.
So over on the west side, it's a situation where the city pushed I have to say a very excellent organization project renewal and they to their credit, have stepped up meeting with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds on zooms and in person, community board involvement, very heavily, certainly local, nonprofits and so on, say all those men are perfect, there's 283 of them It wasn't an executive order by law they could only be 200 of them and some people think only a hundred should be in any one building.
So the lawsuit threat, I think scared the mayor, but right now, they're still at the lucerne hotel, The sad part is we have got a riverside to their everlasting credit, as a nonprofit has managed to get a donor to write a very large check and we were going to have a hundred men six days a week with phenomenal outdoor and indoor activities and 20 jobs paid full-time That's on hold.
There are the other ones that have been around that take a little bit longer, but all the other sites are going to be used for the board of education, so you won't find them as readily as you had in the past and I want to thank board five, because that the worst of the pandemic we're still meeting coming up with ideas, I, don't see other any others in terms of the representatives , so I think we will move into our public session hearing from the public for two minutes, each craig Do, you have a list of people to be called on?
This number doesn't even include our permanent shelters like the harmonia, so we do recognize the importance of providing care for the most vulnerable and we really work to ensure the smooth transition of the homeless clients into the neighborhood We have continuously asked the city and dhs for transparency, open communication and collaboration, and really clear plans for managing issues, particularly given that we have such a clustering within the district.
It's been cited in our district for about two years and the increasing support that they've given to their clients is that they've seen real movement That incremental trust and get people to be really stabilized is tough work and so to just arbitrarily give very little notice if at all and just kick them out to who knows where we don't know , I, don't think that that's something we should support, plus there will be losses of jobs, Yes I, think that was in senator krueger's You know, start the conversation renee cafaro, You know: Are we just sending a letter that we don't like you know the mayor's plan to move these folks or are we offering up a solution?
The mayor heard about that- They should be ashamed of themselves- for how you know how we treated the homeless issue in the northern part of our district I'm, a big supporter of that perks of having the shelter there You know that someone wouldn't mind writing in the resolution and that could be the home Instead of kicking all these people out of the shelter they need.
I have concerns about getting into a conversation about which sites and possible solutions, because I don't know that we can have the capacity or the information have not done the due diligence to be able to fairly and comprehensively have that conversation, not that we shouldn't have it, but I think that for the outset of this fight, which is only beginning most likely, what this resolution might be most effective is for it to be a To say all the problems that renee kinsella, you outlined: the transparency, the accountability, the community involvement, data-driven decisions, rationale all of that stuff, We need to call them out about when he, when de Blasio first was defending publicly his decision to move these men into lucerne, He had no concern about public sentiment or lawsuits and said this is the best decision out of public health Where is that mayor?
Don't believe that this is a decision about public health and I think that our focus needs to be about what's happening in our district and with the programs renee kinsella that you did such a good job of explaining have attract real track record, and that should be our primary concern of this resolution is protecting those families, I think the stability of the providers that they have and the programs that they are part of should be the number one most important thing in this committee's deliberation: right: now, okay, jordan, We, understand that people have received notices, but I don't know specifically, but we've heard that it's happening soon.
All of that, we need to give them a feeling of and an understanding of how community board five feels about this, and then I would love to hear from all of you any of you as many as possible of you in terms of how you want this resolution to sound and to read: that's really important It looks like someone just put in the chat that all people that were at the shelter at the harmonia shelter on 31st street were moved out.
I mean you cannot move people like that at you know the mayor's whim, because it is convenient because he needs to get rid of a problem somewhere else and I'm, hoping that the language of our resolution will convey that I would hope that we would really focus on this.
It seems not humane to tell people that they're going to move out of a place and need to be gone in two days which, regardless of the overall the overarching policy and that's, gets my second question, but that seems like the the to me in a resolution that was going to be strongly worded talking about how the how the people who are being affected are treated as the most is the most important part or it sounds like The second part is a communication of a larger plan.
I once had a chat with the chef at the at the harmonia, and he said you know the people come to rely on him and it that is, that is important to develop that stability and I , don't just think in the harmonia, but any shelter It takes a long time to build up that trust and to get people stable when they may have and there's not many family hotels, the adult family, hotels and we were told that there was going to be a move of the the men at the lucerne We asked the question as to where they would be moved, and we were told that was information that could not be divulged, however, and they weren't sure, but they were pretty sure that it was going to move somewhere in the area of where they had come from and within three hours.
The only points that I wanted to add was that I think we should highlight the hypocrisy of the administration and how they're handling this when the administration, you know, started shuffling people willy-nilly into hotels without informing anybody in the city.
That's going to directly harm individuals, health, Your doctors is horrible for mental health , It's, actually terrible for physical health during a pandemic, and so clearly we need to stick up for the residents of this shelter The last point that I would suggest adding is that you know sus, but you know when there's so many stresses on the homeless services system, to direct a provider to suddenly shuffle around their clients all over the city, to let go staff to dismantle all of their administrative systems that supported this shelter and I.
Think this is happening writ large with all of these unexpected moves and how they affect the staff and the administration at all of these homeless services providers, including the one that I work at okay The sake of time, I just wanted to say that I fully support what everyone else has said and would fully support writing resolution on this matter and I also advocate using very strong language to describe how we feel about the situation and for advocating for the residents of our district Is there a financial reason, because one the reason I say that is because I know few people who work in the hotel industry right now and there are a lot of hotels in this area that are closing because there's there are no people right now.
What's going on in terms of context, you know because my understanding is that the hotel there's an association of hotels and I guess they make financial considerations or business considerations and offer themselves into this program so there's a local homeless, shelter near me on 51st They have a woman's shelter, but they have They, know shelter anymore because of Covid-19, and what I'm thinking is that you know as much as these peop There are two things, I think the first thing is yes, it's kind of awful that there was no plan for these people right, no plan to bring them to any other shelter, and it's really unfortunate that the actual shelters that could potentially serve them are completely closed, especially the ones near me like the one on 51st street and park , So I.
We start opening up the local shelters in Manhattan that used to house these people The second thing is, you know so I'm sympathetic for both communities right because I think the hotel community I think one thing that I just don't want people to miss out here is that hotels are closing their doors because they just have no income right now and I know that that's not understandable, because the homeless population is very vulnerable and having worked in one myself We need to understand both sides where people might not have enough money to support the homeless at this time, I, for whatever reason and people will go on with their reasons, but and as a result, what can we do as solutions that are actionable to fix that this situation?
Also in the chat that there are a number of people on the board that are in full agreement, like james someone else, wrote to laura garcia sam levy, I think that our best credibility as a board here will be to focus on in this resolution, to focus on the things that we feel most passionately and that we know.
I was just going to say the same thing that charles just mentioned, which is that I support the language I fully support this I just want to mention that in the chat we've had some questions regarding other hotels and other problems, and rather than get into that this evening, because we are working on something very specific and trying to do that so that we can get to our regular agenda, which is rather lengthy as well Please understand that is being worked on by the bex committee and that I encourage anyone.
That's open we're, subject to being asked at some point: , It's a good question, thank you, okay, renee and renee how about recapping so that the board has an idea of what will be going into this resolution and we can take a vote on it.
Other additional point should be that we also say they should that the mayor and his administration should reconsider the move and give timely notice to the community board and the other community stakeholders to respond and give to give I do think calling upon them to reverse their decision needs to be in there someplace, but practically I mean people are getting moved out of there.
Clayton made an important point that the resolution should also address after the fact that if this is de facto happening- But if we want to include that you said you know, we may not be able to halt that.
The first was the committee's consideration of the NYPD budget and the role of the police department, and the second was support of exempting small businesses from the commercial tax rent tax The first reso took two meetings to put together I want to thank joseph fuhrer because he really did trojan's work and taking all the conversations we had a very robust conversation about the NYPD budget and the role of the NYPD There was a lot of committee and community input and what we did was we used a template that I think the transportation committee had developed as a way of organizing all the information, and we put it into the facts, our core principles and then the recommendations that we wanted to make it's a lot to take in I.
I also want to say that I appreciate that the resolution commits to, as you mentioned, rene a reconsideration later on of the role of the police in new york city , I'm very excited for that conversation and sort of to that effect.
I would propose that we say in addition to the fiscal crisis the fiscal year 2021 executive budget coincides with and then continue on with broad and sustained activism It's, a very minor change, but I want to sort of make clear that this conversation is not only a response to a fiscal crunch, but also concerns about public safety that exists separately from that chris Moving on to an incorrect line.
Okay the courts ensure justice, not the police If you want that in we're going to have to vote on it, would it be possible to move on to my last note, since I don't want to waste our time on this, which is not necessarily my main point sure, moving on to what I had in as line 324, the discussion of the military-grade equipment, which is the third to last resolved I, believe that, in addition to this sort of itemized information about military-grade equipment, I think it is important to actually ask for a plan to both cease the acquisition of new equipment and actually reduce the equipment that they have.
You talked about how the DOE already funds the school safety program, and so really this is moving from the NYPD or pd over DOE When I read number four in the core principles, where the mission should line up, it seems like that would be positive because you're there, what they were saying, is they're moving this thing that they believe lines up with the mission yoe more than an NYPD Just I was curious for the committee's thinking on that So in the former we're talking about the budget It's in the NYPD budget, but it's coming in through the DOE.
I was just curious if you had any background on that larger issue sort of less about, and when we talk about police with military-grade equipment, you know again, pre-covered When we talk about the police, budget- We had people come in to try and help us understand what the appropriations are for That sounds terrible to say we don't know where it goes in each budget line right I, can't speak to whether this has resulted in lack of police officers on the street.
We, need some sort of protective measures and I just wanted to see that those stats, because I feel, like the number of police, have been increasing year over year, the same with the population, and we also have to keep in mind that the majority of the people employed at NYPD are ethnic minorities and the very population of people that we're really trying to protect They are updated very frequently and if just from you know cursory, look at them, which I've done several times having this debate with many people in the past few months that we are currently like, if just looking at shootings and murders, because that's usually what people really focus on and comstats does the most egregious Obviously people are focusing on the violent crimes.
Don't think anybody on the bex committee or anyone in support of this resolution is saying that they don't want the NYPD to do their job or that we feel that we should be asleep at the switch and rest on our laurels and be of our safety I.
My question is what, if we rather than in line in line 42, it says the mayor's claimed that nypd's budget was reduced by a total of a billion DOT, instead of having the sort of the where the section in 48 what if we incorporated the idea of what they were doing into line 42 so that it read, the mayor has claimed that NYPD budget was reduced by a total of 1 billion when all when all 43, but 62 million comprises either fringe benefits, unenforceable, overtime, reductions and then we add, in their comma shifts to other departments which were presented as cuts, because I think that that's actually the core of what you I'm, going to stop at joe fruit, but we'll hire So I've spoken with a lot of my neighbors and colleagues, all of whom are constituents in this community in our community zone about this topic, and we feel that one of the core roles of the city government is to provide law enforcement.
You know as a mechanism to support public safety for all residents and all visitors right You know I've heard various things on this call, but I think the rise in crime rates over the last six months has been well documented and, if not actual crime mates I can tell you how people feel just being on the streets and I.
I definitely agree with the not using militarized equipment as much as possible, but I don't want to sort of tie the hands of a city like new york city based on kind of other cities, primarily overusing the equipment they shouldn't be using Yes. The issue of military equipment used by police is a complex one and without the input of the NYPD and people who are expert on that subject, it's I think inappropriate for us, as a community board, to make a decision.
More than anything we are like renee said slightly aspirational in this that clearly what we say tonight is not going to be the be all and end all of what the budget's going to be for the NYPD, but rather that we are trying to express our views and my view , I guess what I meant by aspirational is that we don't have the information on the military-grade equipment, and so this is a first step and I think the conversations and the points that you're making are important but we're not even there You know things that the NYPD has how much of their budget does and then maybe this conversation could go beyond that, but right now we're just even trying to get that information and that's why it's in the resolution?
Permit freeze was a thing of the past by the time that we had our committee meeting This is just an update to let you know that youth programs are returning to play in the parks, given safety protocols and the size of the groups and I think there was something like nine, almost 9 000 people who signed a petition to advocate for the administration to reverse its policy about this, and so it was a good news night for the community to hear that was being reversed and almost immediately questions camp about like how about adults, and so that conversation is ongoing and the parks and public spaces committee will be the place for you to here and have that conversation if you ever want to join us great thanks, clayton, okay, that moves us to our last committee, which is landmarks leila, there's a typo, it should read.
