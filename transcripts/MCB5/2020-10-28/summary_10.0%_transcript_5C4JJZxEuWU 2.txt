We have non-action items where we're going to hear about changes to the election law that the state legislature has sort of made in the last two years and some current voting related legislative priorities.
Justin Flag is here from Senator Krueger's office, Kate Theobald from the council member Powers, Office Laurie's, here from Speaker Johnson's office, The district needs statement and the budget, expense and capital budget priorities for fiscal year.
State legislature has taken in the last two years, some of which the loop needs to be closed on and As. You know, the high priorities for for next steps on election reform.
We created early voting, which we're all experiencing now for better or worse, with our, with our current board of elections, consolidated the federal and state primaries in June, which saves a lot of money and reduces the number of elections.
We pass a law to allow local boards to process absentee ballots prior to 30 days before the election.
You know people who are not able to do the job It is an increasingly complex job to run a modern election and there are a couple of places where change can be executed and it has to be at the city and the state.
You know this is going to require an interaction, I think between the city and the state determining what's the best way forward in terms of how to professionalize the board.
All of those things come down to the board of elections and how they, you know, complete their mission, and so we need to look at how to improve and professionalize them.
So, to that end, councilman powers is introducing a new resolution on Thursday at the City Council's full stated meeting in support of the state bills that authorize the board of elections in New York state to establish absentee ballot drop-Now. You know for these drop-off boxes for this current election that we're we are experiencing right.
The city Board of elections reported that they mailed out over 775,000 absentee ballots to voters in June and that's roughly 12 times the amount in 2016 presidential primary, and you know.
We all know that you know a part of the equation is the United States postal service and that's beyond New York state's operations, It was found in a recent inspector general investigation that this summer, the newly appointed Master General, implemented a policy change that you know was purported to reduce costs and inefficiencies, but actually removed hundreds of high-speed, mail, sorting machines and cut overtime, so also in July, the usps.
They sent a letter to all the states warning them that if they did not require voters to request mail-in ballots at least 15 days before the election, there could be a risk that the usps would not be able to deliver the ballot in time for the votes to be counted.
So, the councilman's resolution, like I said, he's going to introduce on Thursday the City Council, is the support of the Albany bills that we want to see past they're sponsored by your Senator Brad Hoyleman and Assembly member Dick, Godfrey, and so Not. It's a pre, considered, resolution.
I want to just go over two important items from the city: Council: the Voting Rights Advancement act in July , the New York City Council passed Resolution 1371 that was sponsored by a council member Council, Majority leader, actually, lori Cumbo.
It has passed in the house and then the second item is in regard to an oversight hearing that took place on September 25th by the committee on governmental operations chaired by council member Fernando Cabrera was entitled election administration during Covid-19 pandemic after governor Cuomo issued a series of executive orders to ensure all new yorkers could vote by absentee ballot.
These voters were unable to vote by mail, since state law generally requires absentee balance to be mailed by election day in order to be counted as Justin mentioned.
Two about the boe's plans for implementation of ranked choice, voting in 2021, and the committee also solicited input on these topics from the mayor's democracy, NYC office, the New York City, campaign, Finance Board from advocates and members of the public.
Think to all of these points as the election wraps up and work is done with both the city and the state.
The three most pressing items have been identified as economic development and recovery homelessness and the issues surrounding homelessness in our district, the needs of the homeless and quality of life issues, and that includes Noise Graffiti Petty crime.
I know we talk about the importance of lightner and green space in our survey, but it's important just to add that again in the district needs statement, if everyone's okay with it, so I'm, going to turn it over to you for comments for changes for suggestions to that.
Okay, any more comments, questions, changes, okay, so moving forward just to wrap up we're going to add the light and air language and also language regarding the support of Broadway and the need to revitalize Broadway and its importance to the district on the district needs.
You see that these the requests sort of are in line and aligned with the three top issues that we've seen, which are homelessness and the needs of the homeless in the district and noise complaints.
The director of the public realm, keep it at number, 12, put 13 and 14 at the end and move the DOE request for funding a mental health professional in every middle and high school.
I think they might have said this is already funded, or this is not a budget request and the fact that I do not see anything changed.
We can request for additional funding subsidies to be provided for people who need continuation of their medical coverage if they've lost the job due to Covid-19 as an example or people who need just assistance to get coverage because they can not afford it and I think that's important during pandemic.
I think that people who need medical, coverage-I do not understand, I'm, not understanding what the funding is around that I as an issue to add it at this stage.
I just do not know in doing this process right now tonight at this stage that we should add that as an expense item without understanding more about it, perhaps may I suggest adding a sentence or two about that in our district needs.
I think what you're saying is important edit and it goes to the issue of the homeless issues and the needs of the homeless in our district.
I think we would need to do it that way, rather than adding them into number two, because it's just different agencies involved unless I'm understanding, Mary's point wrong or kind of what Mary had said, Mary, yeah ,, I guess I was not limited to either HPD or department of mental health.
I think we're going to take off the comment that Mary had and leave it as is, and then we're going to clarify on number six with coalition for the homeless, what they mean by project base, we're going to keep number five, as is number seven to July's point We're, going to determine whether SBS or EDC is the proper agency for that we're going to move 13 and 14 to the bottom And we're going to bump up number 25, which is the funding of mental health professional in every middle high school in our district and we're going to identify those Very specifically Thank you so much for moving up that really important mental health professional for every school.
His comments about the 100,000 jobs and four billion dollars to the district, I think it's probably important that we specifically call out broadway as part of some of the small businesses.
Think that has just as much it And it's a way of getting at the need for enforcement, joe, that we can't really get at a budget through a budget request.
You know new construction term sheet program, so it funds supportive housing.
I, think in our on the survey of our most important items, and I did think it was here, but maybe not, but I will take that and I will add that onto the capital budget, Restoring the capital budget cut to the special funds for supportive housing under HPD And, we'll bump that up to number one and sanitation.
Joseph's language bump that up to number one in the capital budget, we're also going to add Joe Mafia's request regarding funding conversion for air conditionings in the broadway theaters and then Chuck's edition of sanitation, restoring trash cans and additional counts to the district.
