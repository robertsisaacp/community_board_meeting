It's a hotel chain, I, think it's a Best Western and Todd Simon and a previous member of the committee , I think, might have done a site visit and it looked like a slam dunk, but they have an outdoor space in the backyard.
And, there's really not many residential buildings in the area, But there's one next door We asked the applicant to reach out to the their neighbors and we received about 40 letters, 40 emails, saying that they don't want a an outdoor space serving alcohol and the facing their building.
So Todd's trying to organize a meeting with the applicant and the and the adjacent building, as well as the rectory, to coordinate and see if they can share their method of operation and resolve and come to some resolution.
It was a slam dunk, but I'm, hoping that once we get these people together in the same virtual room and possibly if the applicant explains what they're doing and modifies it or agrees to do sound studies or limits their hours of operation or reassures the residents that maybe they can agree to some reasonable stipulations and get this done without a public.
You know we don't want any new applicants coming in and flooding the space with lots of the foot.
In that context we should get let the SLA know we're working on this I mean people have been on pause for a couple of months, so just circle back and make sure that they're still proceeding keep in touch with them.
It is in The, Times, Square area They have asked for 3 a.m. closing inside the building, which includes room service and a lot of dining rooms and bar areas, which is not generally a concern to us.
They have asked for 2 a.m. closing for two outdoor spaces and that may or may not be of concern to us, but pointed out to the group that the Knickerbocker Hotel, which is literally in Times Square.
The bottom line, is that there is a site visit plan for July 15th and the team of intrepid explorers will look at these outdoor spaces and see if they can see any residential, buildings.
This is a shared workspace and these folks applied for a rather complex liquor, license for internal service and for a outdoor space and for a second bar on upper floors.
So it's a 12 story, co-working space and for two of the floors they want to have liquor a liquor, license.
There is another application, I think it was 893 Broadway, it's a loft space and they were looking to firm up their lease details and had kind of said.
