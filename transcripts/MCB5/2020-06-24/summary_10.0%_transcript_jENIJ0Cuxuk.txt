I'll start with July Craig and Joseph thanks But I can go through the first couple Just, what everybody knows: the application that this committee, just for the newer members, the application that this committee generally looks at our liquor, license applications or an Physical Culture establishment, applications, physical culture, establishments, our spas and gyms, and massage parlors and parlors, and nail salons and that kind of stuff.
They wanted to be able to have like a three class tournament turn around every evening, so they wanted to potentially operate from 5:00 p.m. I think to 2:00 a.m., The street there's a condo building, acrosss the street, and they were concerned about late night, noise, later hours of operation and also there's a place of worship, diagonally acrosss, the street.
Second, application is on the same block further down towards six seven, eight 110, West, 30Th, Street and they're doing business us They're, just doing business as 112 West, Inc. For, the time being so as far as I can see, the business motto is going to be bar food.
It's a hotel chain, I, think it's a Best Western and Todd Simon and a previous member of the committee , I think, might have done a site visit and it looked like a slam dunk, but they have an outdoor space in the backyard.
We asked the applicant to reach out to the their neighbors and we received about 40 letters, 40 emails saying that they do not want a an outdoor space serving alcohol and the facing their building.
So Todd's, trying to organize a meeting with the applicant and the and the adjacent building, as well as the rectory, to coordinate and see if they can share their method of operation and resolve and come to some resolution.
It was a slam dunk, but I'm, hoping that once we get these people together in the same virtual room and possibly if the applicant explains what they're doing and modifies it or agrees to do sound studies or limits their hours of operation or reassures the residents that maybe they can agree to some reasonable stipulations and get this done without a public.
We did have the meeting with the applicant and our team, a virtual meeting, I guess about five weeks ago, and we did look at it on Google Maps and we identified the church and the residential building.
You know we do not want any new applicants coming in and flooding the space with lots of the foot.
They have asked for 3 a.m. closing inside the building, which includes room service and a lot of dining rooms and bar areas, which is not generally a concern to us.
The bottom line is that there is a site visit plan for July 15th and the team of intrepid explorers will look at these outdoor spaces and see if they can see any residential, buildings.
July 16th, This is a shared workspace and these folks applied for a rather complex liquor, license for internal service and for a outdoor space and for a second bar on upper floors.
There is another application, I think it was 893 Broadway, it's a loft space and they were looking to firm up their lease details and had kind of said.
Is there anything else from the committee anything else the committee wants to address, Mr. Koo, yes, I was wondering, I know we're still in pandemic state, so I was hoping that we could still do something, whether it's even if I zoom do in the summer, And we're going to throw out a few dates, I'm trying to get a feel from the committee, whether we should get together over the summer or if people are still away.
