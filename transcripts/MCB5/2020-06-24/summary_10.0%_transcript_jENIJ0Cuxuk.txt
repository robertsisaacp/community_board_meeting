If anyone from the public is here for any other reason and wants to be recognized, But I can go through the first couple, so we have four pending applications assigned to us as a reminder: Just what everybody knows: the application that this committee just for the newer members, the application that this committee generally looks at our liquor, license applications or an Physical Culture establishment, applications, physical culture establishments, our spas and gyms and massage parlors and parlors and nail salons, and that kind of stuff I should rather say the first one which I'll start off with that.
They wanted to be able to have like a three class tournament turn around every evening, so they wanted to potentially operate from 5:00 pm, I think to 2:00 am, and we pushed back on behalf of the residents across the street , there's a condo building across the street and they were concerned about late night noise later hours of operation and also there's a place of worship diagonally across the street Second, application is on the same block further down towards six seven, eight 110 West, 30th, Street and they're doing business us they're just doing business as 112 West Inc for the time being So. As far as I can see, the business motto is going to be bar food Actually, the menu items are have meaningful food items even including fried snail, which I'm curious to try when they open up It's about 4,000 square feet, two floors on the application We don't see a second floor, so I follow up with the applicants attorney Regarding the second floor.
Am closing time is not appropriate for the block, because it's mixed between residential and commercial, we, the next step, would be to schedule a set visit and I Think Joseph will try to join me to have a chat with the applicant in the attorney The first item on our list is a 30th Street hold on a second It's a hotel chain , I think it's a Best Western and Todd Simon and a previous member of the committee I think, might have done a site visit and it looked like a slam dunk, but they have an outdoor space in the backyard.
We asked the applicant to reach out to the their neighbors and we received about 40 letters, 40 emails saying that they don't want a an outdoor space serving alcohol and the facing their building.
It was a slam dunk, but I'm, hoping that once we get these people together in the same virtual room and possibly if the applicant explains what they're doing and modifies it or agrees to do sound studies or limits their hours of operation or reassures the residents that maybe they can agree to some reasonable stipulations and get this done without a public.
Do I recall they modified their application Jessica, yes , so it's a 12 story, co-working space and for two of the floors they want to have liquor a liquor license and then I think, a few months ago they put the application on hold Okay, based on this visit on the 15th, we may be able to come back to you and simply say no objection to this entire application.
You send me an email and we'll touch, base and connect with you about this and see what museum I'm sure there are other people who you guys can potentially hope, help and Thank you, son, okay, Andrew, you've, something to adjust the committee You know but forced to work from home, and you know I think, has frankly some mental health issues You know it's a getting to the point where it's highly disruptive to you know, trying to focus on work and deal with conference calls.
