I'm Nick ethanol, your chair, we don't have any action items on the agenda tonight. We will be going through committee assignments and team updates if anyone from the public is here for any other reason and wants to be recognized. Please click the raise hand button and we will recognize you before we begin the meeting. Okay, I, don't see any raised hands. So why don't we begin with team reports and in no particular order? I'll start with July Craig and Joseph thanks Nick I'll start off and then I'll pass over to my on a couple of the answers. But I can go through the first couple, so we have four pending applications assigned to us as a reminder. Just what everybody knows: the application that this committee, just for the newer members, the application that this committee generally looks at our liquor, license applications or an Physical Culture establishment, applications, physical culture establishments, our spas and gyms and massage parlors and parlors and nail salons and that kind of stuff. We don't have any PCEs in our in our in our for I. Don't think they're actually I mean any pcs right now on any of these, we, as I mentioned, we have four, although one of them is gonna, go away. One of the I should rather say the first one, which I'll start off with that one is 45 East 33rd Street, that's Ainsworth, 33 Ainsworth is a sports bar type place. This application actually came in almost exactly a year ago. There was this is a they said. It's a restaurant, slash bar without door space. The outdoor space does abut a residential building. There were a couple of residents from that building who expressed a significant emphasis, significant concerns. We did at the time about and nine months ago, 810 months ago, I have a community meeting. We did discuss what the issues were with the operator. At that point, the operator came to came to agreement on certain issues in terms of time, the time the amount of noise in terms of like music and stuff like that and then agreed to enter into an affidavit. What that means again for the benefit of the new folks is that they agreed to with certain stipulations. You know they're going to close at a certain time: they're not going to have live music or in some case might be. They have live music with stops for a certain time and they agree to this in writing and they feel that they signed an affidavit and that gets sent to the State Liquor Authority and become part of their license. They agree to all of that. Then, when radio-silent, they didn't sign anything. They just agreed to everything. Ever it's a rhythmic radio, silent quite a while. Now that could mean a lot of things. White people go radio silent. They could go radio silent because they are still deciding what they want to do. They really want to go for those stipulations. They can also go radio silent because they're still negotiating with their landlord, and they don't want to enter into an agreement if they don't know that they're actually going to be there today they actually came back to us. They signed the affidavit and they're done so this application is it's concluded from our perspective. We had spoken to the residents next door. They were happy with what we came up with in terms of hours of operation, method of operation, the hours and the music. So I think this was so far. This should be pretty sick. We think this will be a successful outcome. That's okay, that as I said, that will come off of the list, because our say our port of that part of this is concluded. There's no need for a public hearing, given that we did come up with agreements that were amenable to both the operator, the community port and the residence okay. Next, the next one I'll talk about is one is 17 West 20th, which is Bay blue hospitality. This is in, what's called a restricted licensing area, and there were we have two: what are two areas within the district that have these that are restricted license areas one is in Flatiron. This is, this is the one which is 19th, 20th and 21st Street within a few blocks, and then there's a second one that we that we put together a couple years about a year ago, the BCR LA, which is Broadway between 26th and I, think 29th or 30th Street. Just on this area. If you go back to the Mets of the 90s and the 2000s this area, the Flatiron area, was saturated with clubs. A lot of them were not very good operators, and what happened back then, is that the residents along with interested or attea, the community board, got together and they put together a whole list of. We want this to dismiss an application and they were very reasonable. It weren't on read. They were very reasonable request and we came up with a policy for this area, which we call as I said, the restrictive licensing area that we want. We will not approve anything we most likely not approve anything unless it is 4,000 square feet or less, and it has very specific hours which I think 1:00 a.m. is the latest closed or maybe 130. Something like that. You know basically designed to make the area a little bit more livable. We have a similar one that, as I said, we came up with about a year ago in the Broadway card or area. This one is 17, West, 20th Street, it's a very small operation. It's just basically a sushi restaurant, that's going to be I, think three thousand and two thousand square feet. The hours are tolling 11 o'clock at night with a very reasonable hours. There were no issues brought up by the flat iron allowance, Alliance, which is a base which is a group of neighborhood associations. In that area, they've agreed. We did if I did a site visit there, while a while back they agreed on ours. They everything was fine, so they're going to be entering into an affidavit as well we're just waiting for them to sign off, but that's within a couple you sent it to them about two weeks ago. Close. It's not uncommon that you don't take a couple of weeks. I don't see this having to go to a public hearing because they are adhering to everything that we basically asked them to do. So that's the story on that. One great you've got one more thing. Two more. Do you want to do that July because they think you've been running through these sure? We cannot provide the historical background so well that you could create, but I can talk about the applications in the applicants, so the first one we received out of the two remaining in our team is 133 West, 30th Street and that's called that's doing businesses. Forty three point: three they're also going to name it as the Jim Academy. So essentially the business model is going to be a bar on the ground level and I think two or three classrooms on the upper level offering people an experience show you know I guess an experience to make their own gin. So we went back and forth the hours of operations the applicant wanted to be able to. You know sighting. Each class takes approximately two hours and another additional hour to reset the classrooms. They wanted to be able to have like a three class tournament turn around every evening, so they wanted to potentially operate from 5:00 p.m. I think to 2:00 a.m. and we pushed back on behalf of the residents across the street, there's a condo building across the street and they were concerned about late night noise, later hours of operation and also there's a place of worship diagonally across the street. So we were able to get them to agree on the closing of 12:00 a.m. on weekdays and 1:00 a.m. on weekends. The affidavit has been drafted. They are, however, the applicant has decided to put things on hold for the time being. Potentially you know having more time we're going to negotiate with their landlord on the lease. So that's once I consider that done once they come back to us, but we'll see. The second application is on the same block further down towards six seven, eight 110, West, 30th, Street and they're doing business us I know. Second, they don't really have a name yet they're, just doing business as 112 West Inc for the time being. So, as far as I can see, the business motto is going to be bar food. They actually the menu items are have meaningful food items even including fried snail which I'm curious to try when they open up and they're going to have eight pool tables this plate throughout the establishment. It's about 4,000 square feet, two floors on the application. However, we don't see a second floor, so I follow up with the applicants attorney. Regarding the second floor, what are that's going to be usable or accessible to patrons? They are asking out right to operate between 12:00 noon and 4:00 a.m. every day, so Craig and I. We think they're just asking that, because why not we've found back to them and said this is not appropriate at 4:00 a.m. closing time is not appropriate for the block, because it's mixed between residential and commercial. If they are agreeable to a 12:00, 1:00 a.m. closing time, then we don't have other major concerns. They are planning to install sound proofing and there are at the corner of 30th West 30th and 6th Avenue, offering meaningful food items on the menu. That's it we, the next step, would be to schedule a set visit and I. Think Joseph will try to join me to have a chat with the applicant in the attorney. That's great anything else for your team all right. Let's move to Todd Joe, Simon and Jamie I'll start it off Todd and I'll. Let you finish it them. The first item on our list is a 30th Street hold on a second. Let me just pull up my list. It's 16 East 30th Street, which we recently received and it looked like it was relatively easy. It's a hotel chain, I think it's a Best Western and Todd Simon and a previous member of the committee, I think, might have done a site visit and it looked like a slam dunk, but they have an outdoor space in the backyard. They were going to serve alcohol and there's really not many residential buildings in the area, but there's one next door and then there's a church rectory in the in the backyard. So we asked the applicant to reach out to the their neighbors and we received about 40 letters, 40 emails saying that they don't want a an outdoor space serving alcohol and the facing their building, so Todd's trying to organize a meeting with the applicant and the and the adjacent building, as well as the rectory, to coordinate and see if they can share their method of operation and resolve and come to some resolution. I, don't know if Todd, if there's a date for that meeting, yet I thought I was on Todd. You muted, you hear me yep, so I sent out an email last week to all of the key parties, we're trying to as Miss Jo said, coordinate that meeting until we got this big pushback from the residential building. It was a slam dunk, but I'm, hoping that once we get these people together in the same virtual room and possibly if the applicant explains what they're doing and modifies it or agrees to do sound studies or limits their hours of operation or reassures the residents that maybe they can agree to some reasonable stipulations and get this done without a public. Here, so that's pretty much where that stands. None of us have had a chance to go see it. We did have the meeting with the applicant and our team a virtual meeting, I guess about five weeks ago, and we did look at it on Google Maps and we identified the church and the residential building. But at that time nobody we weren't. We didn't have any feedback for anybody that was really pushing back and we were very clear with them to the applicant the applicant that they had a lot of get in touch with them and give them a chance to comment and they their credit. They didn't do that no Nick and they were in the discussion thread. There were some strong statements from that, but you know why did it take so long? And you know why you know now that we're it's three months, it's several weeks later, but you know we're gonna, go through our regular procedures and see if we can come up with something reasonable. So that's what that's! What's going on with that great todd you mentioned, you know physical inspections. At this point this is the question. Has come up before so I'll say it now, I think unless Vickie corrects me I think at this point we can do physical inspections, provided that you comply every comply with the safety protocols. You have to wear masks stay six feet apart from everyone else. You know and if you're comfortable doing that, if the operator is comfortable, if the residents are comfortable, we can we can resume physical inspections. If not zoom is it's. A great resource feel free to use that as well, but for those people who want to do physical inspections as long as they can be done safely. That is possible now the next one on the list, I think it's that Joe and Jane me and Simon. If he's, there is a little bit more challenging it's one in the Broadway Carter licensing area where we have where which is brand new, and we have these new procedures in place. It's a really big place where it's a big footprint and it's in direct contradiction of nor recommended procedures and limitations as the size and an activity. So for that one we are going. We have to do a site tour and we really want to talk the applicant and yeah get a sense of what their method of operation is and then brief them on and show them what our new policy statements are for that area. That's this is the Broadway card, so you know we're gonna. Do that, hopefully we'll do it virtually visit and we'll get a meeting Don and we'll get deep key partners involved and I. Think it's important in that one. We do our best to try to enforce order. New policy I was on that I was on that committee and the whole idea there was. We don't want with the hotels and the concentration of activity in the Broadway quarter. You know we don't want any new applicants coming in and flooding the space with lots of the foot. Traffic now seems sort of crazy with the pandemic. Everything's been deserted, but again and of course we have the situation where the city and state or letting everybody use the outdoor space in a way that is independent of this, but nevertheless, we'll have we'll have our discussions with this applicant and see. If we can it make it clear that, depending upon what their method of operation is, it's either got to be kept smaller or maybe there's space there's got to be broken up in the smaller units, we'll just have to see what happens with walk. So we don't really know much more than that. Based on the information. Great you've got another one. Let's see I think guys. The 129 was 29th, Street I mean we've been waiting about for a long time as any lucozade. We've heard anything from that, so no, we Simon you had worked on that affidavit and I think we proposed the attorney said something to the effect of oh. You know those aren't what we agreed to and then we said, okay. Well, what did we agree to? Can you revise this affidavit and we followed up several times and it's just been radio silence. So don't know really what's going on there, they have. They made any effort to apply to the SLA. Now we can't really tell I mean it's sometimes difficult to tell, because there's been a backlog at the SLA just in pre Co good times so I can I can look into that. Actually right now, unless you know, if you know we could always just let the SLA know that, even if they have received an application, we can request that they not take any action on the application until we've had the chance to comment, and we can explain that we're waiting for the applicant to get back to us so that'll at least put a you know a bookmark in the application. The SLA usually respects that and they'll. Let us know you know that our time for commenting is running out or you know they'll check in with us periodically. So we can do that might be worth noting that this is a method of operation change to extend the hours and some of the things live music. So it's not something that we would see a 500-foot rule hearing on, but definitely something we can. Let him know about yeah. In that context we should get let the SLA know we're working on this and then the ys1 Joe 11 West, 19th Street. Wasn't that one where they were supposed to get the affidavit back to us I mean that that's just been on our list forever. Beebe it just never got completed right. Had we ever gotten anything from them so just check in with them I mean people have been on pause for a couple of months, so just circle back and make sure that they're still proceeding keep in touch with them all right. Let's move to buzz Jessica, Sarah and BJ. Let me speak just about where we are and Sarah has been in charge of the looking at the list here. Margarita Margaritaville, right and Jessica I think you've been doing the assemblage. I was doing it at one point we'll come back to both of these. Let me just speak in general about these and then ask Sarah and Jessica. We had a meeting today. A telephone conference call on the Margaritaville. The Margaritaville is part of an operation he new hotel under construction. They have asked for a license for the entire hotel, as is customary, it is in The, Times, Square area and that's an interesting question of whether it is actually in Times Square for the following reason. They have asked for 3 a.m. closing inside the building, which includes room service and a lot of dining rooms and bar areas, which is not generally a concern to us. They have asked for 2 a.m. closing for two outdoor spaces and that may or may not be of concern to us but pointed out to the group that the Knickerbocker Hotel, which is literally in Times Square. They asked for 4 a.m. rooftop closing and we gave it to them because there is no nothing else around. The bottom line is that there is a site visit plan for July 15th and the team of intrepid explorers will look at these outdoor spaces and see if they can see any residential buildings. Posting was done in February and I, don't believe Luke we did receive any comments. Did we correct? No comments we were saying so the point is if this is in. If we decide this really is in The Times Square, really in Times Square, even though it's kind of a block removed, we would we might consider just granting this as it is with no objection. Sarab want to add anything. I can't think of anything. I did speak with Frank today and I sent the team and Frank an email. He had. We had some questions Frank well, do they have a seat at all? No Frank said were under construction, we'll get one later -. Can you firm up the occupancy numbers for the six venues? He said? Yes, he would and three could we visit any of the outdoor venues? There is six or seven venues and Frank was not sure because of this you didn't know how advanced the construction would be so for now, DJ and I will definitely be there, July 16th, and that's it right. So we'll get back to you Nick on this one great. This is rather complicated. This is quite old. This is a shared workspace and these folks applied for a rather complex liquor, license for internal service and for a outdoor space and for a second bar on upper floors. Do I recall they modified their application. Jessica, yes, so it's a 12 story, co-working space and for two of the floors they want to have liquor a liquor license. So, yes, it was. They had applied, I, think prior, like five or six years before, and then they were reading. They rescinded that and then they were reapplying recently. But so there was a lot of a lot of the neighbors we're not happy with and then I think, a few months ago they put the application on hold. So that's where we are with that memory incorrect did they reduce the upper floor, one to just beer and wine, or was it always just beer? It was always it was so it's kind of on hold now right yeah. So we really ought to check according to what Nick said is just to make sure that the SLA knows that it's on hold. Can we do that? Look! Yes, we can I'll, send him a message. I'm making notes and sending them a message tomorrow and any other comments from you know: I think I'm, Sarah and I'm max I was kind enough, walk me through the process, so we met last week and we were only able to see the exterior, but we hope to see more on July 15 and at today's call the team was kind enough to kind of walk me through the process. So perfect, so I think we're square, although not making rapid progress. That's a common story right now, right, okay, based on this visit on the 15th, we may be able to come back to you and simply say no objection to this entire application as it's written. Okay, all right, thanks guys, let's hear from Daniel Rob and Jordan I think Rob you're the point person for these tonight. Yes, that's what I'm told hi? How are you all right hold on one sec? Sorry, so we have I think four on the docket, the Ritz 1185 Broadway I. Believe it's the address. I! Don't have it in front of me. He writes moment they came back with some pretty wide-ranging hours and we asked if they had considered the guidelines. They are LA guidelines at all in putting that together and the lawyers response was discussing that with my client and we'll be back in touch, and that was the last we heard from them. So some follow-up is required there to give them a nudge on that front, which we will we will take care of. There is another application, I think it was 893 Broadway, it's a loft space and they were looking to firm up their lease details and had kind of said. Oh we're, gonna postpone, Luke and I exchanged some emails about that today. They never actually sent in the request for a postponement, so we need to follow up with them on that and see what their story is, which we will do and then the last one is 11:41 Broadway, two spaces, butchers daughter and a TBD space downstairs that had submitted and then we're waiting. Some follow-up information from them have not received anything since the kovat really took hold of the world, so we I think exchanged one or two emails at the beginning of it all in March and then kind of died off. So we need to follow up on that as well. So yeah lots of follow up required, but that's kind of where things stand. Yeah I mean I. Think that's one of the reasons we're having this meeting, because things have sort of just fallen off the falling out of mind over the past couple of months, and you know, hopefully the other things are starting to open up again. The reason we're doing this is to get back on board yeah for sure it was a good excuse for us to go back to our email and try to remember where the hell we left things. Okay, let's hear from Mike, Matt and Kelly sure. So ours are all pretty simple the easiest as Belmonte we did the posting back, I guess in January or maybe February. We received no comments from the community and we have not yet gotten a questionnaire from back from the applicant. We reached out this week to remind them to send that in, and we haven't heard back yet so that was pretty easy. La esquina seems to they seem to have put the brakes on it. There was a little bit of an issue with a with an egress through the building. There was a lot of resistance from the residents in the neighboring building, but at this point the applicant themselves seems to be going very slowly. They I guess basically put a stop to it before Covid-19 dinner right as Kovac was hitting. We were reached back out to them this week and have not yet heard back either and then the last one is hoots Holly, which was basically we were. We were more or less over the finish line with it. We did a posting, we received no comments from the community. Matt and I did a site visit way back in January. The operation looks really nice really clean, they do have a little outdoor space, and so we think probably an affidavit is an order, but we never got that far with them and we haven't heard anything from them. So we've reached back out and we will we're going to reach back out. We need we need to definitively decide first of all, find out if they are going forward and then, second of all, if we indeed want to want to do the affidavit or not, but that one I think also is well on track. Great, that's it for you, that's it for us. Okay, before I go to the public. Is there anything else from the committee anything else the committee wants to address mr. Koo, yes, yep go ahead, DJ! Thank you. I just wanted to inquire about. I know there was some email about some orientation for new board members. I was wondering I know we're still in pandemic state, so I was hoping that we could still do something, whether it's even if I zoom do in the summer. Yeah Craig, Luke and I were talking about that and we're gonna throw out a few dates, I'm trying to get a feel from the committee whether we should get together over the summer or if people are still away. I quick show of hands. Let me know: are you in the city over the summer and you would attend a meeting if we have it? Okay, so not everybody, it's better to have as much attendance as possible at these things. So if we find that you know people are not going to be in town, we should probably do it virtually and then get together more casually. Maybe after the summer when people are back and things are safer, that's a question Nick sure the package that was given out last year, who's that available in software yeah. This is all what yeah we've got a PDF of that I can send it to you not to me, but in higher package, to send to new people we're talking with PJ about that this morning, in our telephone conference, well, I sent it to PJ thanks Sara yeah, and we will update that every year, but that's sort of like our Bible. We do. We do use that every year Sara did you have something else to say. No I was just gonna remind DJ if she forgot, but she didn't. She was on okay, I'm gonna recognize the public. Now, on top of my list is Sean. We can hear you so Sean. You can just press the unmute button and, let us know I saw a new registration link. Yes, we can hear you. Okay. Thank you guys for allowing me to be here is my first community learned a lot just listening and understanding how the process work. I'm missin' joined today, because there's a lot of late night construction, my city, councilman and I've filed four different complaints with 3-1-1 and they basically gone I haven't heard back from in over two weeks now via email or voice mail, and basically it's on the border. Viewer community board district and mine I live on 46 in Lexington, on the east side of the street, I believe community board and on the west side of the street on Lexington Avenue, but there's been a lot of late night construction and jackhammering, and the 3-1-1 process from my understanding requires them to contact the Environmental Committee or something. But everyone in my case has been closed because no one, actually, that department is supposed to investigate this, doesn't have it doesn't work at those hours, and so basically nothing is happening here and jackhammering having across the street from me. Yeah your complaint is not isolated. Look. Do you have any advice for Sean yeah, so in the board office we process constituent services and complaints and requests like this. If you want I would recommend following up with me over email and what we would do is I'd take down. If you have those three one service request numbers you can send those to me- and we can figure out you know- is it is the jackhammering happening in the street or is it in a building and then happening on the street a little bit more difficult because the department transportation they allow street work to be done. Emergency work overnight so as not to disrupt traffic during the day, so we have less agency there, but we can always reach out to these. You know whether it's Con Ed and get some details and information and see if there's a kana it's Department of Transportation has allowed replacing some rubber I have two concerns based on this pay as a taxpayer. We're paying we're clearly, as we all know, in a disastrous state with our budget and I've, been here throughout, the entire prices have been in New, York, City resident for 22 years, and it's just beyond irresponsible to be doing this frankly, I, don't really care so I think the best Avenue to go forward because psql, as you kind of learn from being on this call, primarily deals with liquor licenses and the board office deals with constituent services. So, if you can see in the chat, I've left my email address and also the phone number for our office and reach, you send me an email and we'll touch, base and connect with you about this and see what museum. Thank you guys. I won't take any more of your time. I'm sure there are other people who you guys can potentially hope, help and I'll take a I'll reach out to you all fine. Thank you look. Thank you, son, okay, Andrew, you've, something to adjust the committee hi everyone. My name is Andrew Gottlieb I'm on a minion building at East, 22nd Street near the Flatiron Building, and calling to discuss an issue which has been happening really over the last. You know that I've been noticing significantly since the whole Cove endemic, started and I. You know but forced to work from home, but there's a gentleman who comes basically, you know anywhere from five to seven days a week depending on the weather and plays drums or you know. Basically, you place pots and pans and buckets outside. You know directly outside the apartment, or you know anywhere from two to four plus hours a day and it's quite loud. You know I've tried noise, cancelling headphones and earplugs, and you know that doesn't drown out the sound, because it's a deep sort of bass, sound. You know it's clearly a you know a gentleman who's down on his luck. A bit- and you know I, think, has frankly some mental health issues. I've tried to talk to him and ask if you know he might mind sort of circulating around the city. A little bit more I get that you know this is how he earns his living. But you know it's a getting to the point where it's highly disruptive to you know, trying to focus on work and deal with conference calls. You know many hours a day while I work from home. You know I've filed several 3-1-1 complaints posted on you know, community forum in the area, and you know it's not I'm, not the only person who is frustrated by this. You know my building is aware: they've contacted the local Business Improvement District in flat iron and who's tried to reach out to the police. You know, I, don't think what he's doing is legal based on placed on the bid. I've read online, but I'm kind of at my wit's, and you know: I've tried calling the police community affairs office and haven't done the you know a message: returner I haven't been able to reach anyone. You know if I've submitted two or three 3-1-1 complaints- and you know they're immediately closed out almost instantly, with no action taken and so I'm. You know I'll pause happy to give more details. If there are questions, but some advice on what my options are, so this is kind of a challenging one, because if drummers don't use amplified, you know ant amps. This is actually covered under the First Amendment. So we've had issues like this in Union Square Park in Central Park, and it's pretty difficult to actually create any kind of real change. What we can do is connect you with the neighborhood coordinating officers from the NYPD who often have relationships with some of the people. But again it's if he's not using an amp and it has to be an electronic amplifier. Yeah I mean a drum is considered a First Amendment if they're in public space. You know, if they're in your backyard or something that's different, but yeah it's challenging and the bids know it. It's really tough, but we can connect offline. If you saw you can reach out to me via email and I'll email, you, the links or the email addresses and connect with the your local NCOs. Okay, I appreciate that I do and ask one question: I mean so just want to understand. You know completely someone you know wanted to come play the bagpipes outside my apartment, for you know 12 hours a day that there's basically nothing that can I mean like I saw as far as I know. That's what we've been told you know the NYPD is, you know, can interact with people and ask them to move, but as it as the law stands right now, you're not getting very much luck unless they have an amplifier. So acoustic instruments are legal on the street and it causes a lot of frustration. Okay, thanks, Andrew, okay, anything else from the committee before we before we end. Oh yeah thanks everyone for joining enjoy the rest of your evening and we'll be in touch Thank, You, Nick,.
