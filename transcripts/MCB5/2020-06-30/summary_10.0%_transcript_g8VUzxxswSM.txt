We have done some storefront replacements and things like that over the years go to the next page, user, Several photographs that are landmarks representative provided to us of the designation of the building, as well as a close-up of the windows.
Take over the space they'll replace windows during their renovation, but we want to have this master plan in place, so it provides a streamlined approval process with landmarks moving forward, one last sheet of photographs.
Do, we have any questions or comments from members of the public or in attendance with us tonight for this particular application?
You know the windows that open up on the vertical axis and that pivot and open up as a big pain, we've lost a number of those and I would love for the applicant to be able to salvage them, maybe there's a way to remove them and reduce them on the building at a location where they would become harmonious with each other that this building has an interesting facade articulation where you know at the top of the building.
We would also approve in and the master plan, so I'm actually going to turn back to the applicant and ask them if they would be agreeable to our to that idea, and then the committee can discuss that thought.
Keeping this historic fabric on site would be much better than you know, seeing them on some random building because they were purchased on eBay I am some connoisseur, so we're gonna turn back to a business.
Now, I will personally probably vote no on this, knowing that it's not the majority, but Are. Any objections to this path that we just felt that by members of the committee?
So I'm, going to make a motion to approve this master plan for window replacement with, in addition that the 13 or like that, all the existing Campbell steel windows that are original, be reused and repurposed and relocated on a facade of the building where they would be organized in a harmonious fashion as permitted by the condition of the window?
Existing windows, install new building, canopy and restoration at entry, doors and new building, signs, light well, infill modification and extension of window openings, relocate relocation of floor area to construct a real rooftop edition and replace fire escapes with new balconies.
You can see when you look at the base, the bottom two floors of the building, that it had an area way And it had those large studio windows and then the smaller standard residential windows for two stories that changed in the 1920s on both buildings as you'll see in the next slide.
You have to look a little bit hard, but you'll see that there are those 1920s, typical, 1920s, large storefront openings on the ground floor and then the grouped residential scale, windows.
We are proposing to paint them a darker color, so that they, both the cornice and the windows, are moniece with the darker color of the existing 130 building next door, and also more in the in the tonality.
We are actually planning on changing that design so that it stops right where lakyn is showing with bronze stanchions, so that it does not go any deeper inside the opening and doesn't interrupt or conceal any of the of the ornamental stone or of the of the transom.
They, also all conform to staff level requirements, but the balconies do not the windows that are to the right of the balconies, though that's the area where we're proposing to push out that light well, so that it has a wall that is , that is coplanar with the existing wall, that, although again not visible from the street and not affecting any original or ornamental.
You can keep the application, So we're gonna start with questions from members of the committee.
Could, it would still rain potentially on you, which canopies you know, protect you from the elements a little bit, but you do have an overhang The designation report mentions it was terracotta originally Yes, the material of the cornice, because we haven't been able to do a lot of site inspection for kind of obvious worldwide reasons, but my recollection I may be wrong, but my recollection is that what the what the designation report I think says, is metal, but our plan is to is to match materials I'm, pretty sure that is a that is a metal cornice, although parts of it might be wood.
You say that the 13th floor is slightly recessed from the parapet: wall, yes, recess, space, use, usable, I, a human being or not accessible, It's only about a foot so that we don't change the inherent size of the predominant facade, no way for a person to come out and get trapped in this area.
Are there any other questions by members of the committee on this application?
We have any members of the public who would like to ask questions or make comments?
We can slice it off in you, know, looking at those different areas, I think that we can start with the facade.
You know it's a little bit hard to say, since we don't exactly what the canopy, where they're landing with the canopy, but I think that they're doing this So overall I'm in favor of the application I would also hate to have any penetration in via the stone in the masonry of the building and I.
The questions and comments raised by members of the public or valid it will diminish the amount of light that gets into the building.
But, you know we just want to make sure and mentioning that we have been presented with enough evidence that the secondary facades that are going to be altered contain really no architectural element or historic elements, and that this is why we can consider and support this alteration.
The project that I'm going to discuss today is the fall of building the interior lobby, we're looking to replace a door for this project.
Again, we're looking to swing the door, the other way, if, where the hardware has to change, but we're gonna, reuse, all the hardware that we can, there would be two side.
Ada compliance is a little bit heavier, so we do need to install a new ad, a actually button that once fast, obviously the door will swing.
We've looked at this a couple ways we looked at possibly putting in the marble we looked at I mean possibly like a stand, but we went away from all that just so that we can leave the architecture in its place and not do anything and really try to do as minimal as a mammal at work as we can again, with the height of the doors.
So, just to kind of give you guys a map of what the interior of the lobby looks today, so the doors that enter the building on the 57th street side, we will match it in every way.
I, think I, believe they're 42 inches in width and they swing out and again one of the reasons why we are actually changing it from a double door.
Yes, sorry, I, wouldn't ask a question, so these are eveness doors or will be people be accessing the space from the lobby as well.
Just gonna ask it anyway the actuator button to go into the tenants area, although it this is an egress door which is located next to the to the handle or close to the handle.
I mean horizontal bars, is part of the architecture and, if part of the bill existing doors in the space has that So, whether what side you're on you're gonna, see that door, those handlebars, and we want to maintain that down.
Look, whether it's on the push or the pull side view so and obviously because of the door swing, it changes its location.
We thought about I think we definitely thought of the use of the handle more than the aesthetics, because it has both functions within the lobby that end, you know within the other locations of the door.
You know small scope of work, types of applications that have actually much broader implications, so I think we're having the right conversation any other comments and thoughts that have maybe not yet been expressed on this on this application.
Yes, but the existing door is narrower and would there still be an interference I'm just asking what the question of the applicant the narrowness is, the issue, the narrowness meets.
So did we want to just pull the group to see how much of the neutral folks are out are on the committee If there's, if there's more of a concern about some of the historical fabric being altered, the design elements that you mentioned, then we will move to the move to the proposed resolution of deny and less okay, but that would make sense so Barbara, you have your hand up, tell us what your thoughts are.
You know we saw some further study on the on the part of the applicant to because I think your point is well-taken or very few interior landmarks in the city of New York, and we The committee John go ahead.
You want to tell us sort of like where you would fall on a sort of denial, unless the applicant, you know, brings a more sympathetic design or another position, I'm gonna, be on to deny the less side of this.
Would that be something acceptable for the committee, think I'm kind of changing my position a little bit too and leaning more towards like come back with a better application that respects the interior designation of this building.
And you know it's not our place to tell them what to change or how to do it, but basically, there's, probably other opportunities to have an application that does respect , I think they tried to do as little alteration as possible, but ice, but I still wouldn't completely reject the idea of saying hey.
You know, I think it's also important, Given that LTC may you know very well consider this alteration, it's important that we tell them how we feel about it, so that you know this is on record I'm, going to make a motion to deny this application, while also making a specific comments about the proposed design and why we believe this design is not sympathetic, including the removal of the horizontal bar in the interior.
That's the motion that I'm making and we need a second okay, So Sam Jake I, just want to say that if the motion is a denial with the further discussion, I am comfortable voting in favor with that resolution and we're taking the opportunity to specifically comment on what was presented on the design, and we have a second on that.
Looking at 58th Street and Grand Army Plaza, we are going to be to expand the pedestrian space here around the city by station in order to help provide some more pedestrian space in the area and stop the illegal parking.
Okay, so the second I actually have a question in terms of the applications that we see for Central, Park.
Think safety I'm in this area , It's just such an integral area You know, along the lines of restating a little bit of the history, thanking beauty for coming to us tonight and urging them to work with the Conservancy and the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a more refined final design of this proposal?
We understand it is not an application, but Which is taking the opportunity of this presentation to pass a resolution that will be sent to do t2 their landmark resolution, the Commission and to Central Park Conservancy, stating your position on the proposed work and we're gonna start with buzz.
