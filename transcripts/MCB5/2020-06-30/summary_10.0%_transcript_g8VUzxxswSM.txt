This was assigned to one of our committee members for due diligence, buzz baikman just for the sake of expediency, We're gonna go directly into presentation by the applicant, but bus looked into this and may have some additional insight he's the project architect on this job.
You can see the quantity there's eight hundred and sixty six windows as part of this project, It's- probably going to be something that comes up as tenants take over the space they'll replace windows during their renovation, but we want to have this master plan in place, so it provides a streamlined approval process with landmarks moving forward, one last sheet of photographs: From the second floor from the third floor up basically, fourth floor up , I'm We've done: we've identified specific locations for louvers, but we've decided to leave that to a future tenant to determine and deal with landmarks.
Most people would be in favor of a more proactive plan, a window replacement and it would be less expensive, To do this and a typical office might take a week or two Okay any more questions by members of the committee It does reduce the amount of light and visibility and we met with landmarks and skyline and ABS about three times with landmarks.
Believe any other questions by members of the committee So, seeing none we're going to move to opening up the floor to members of the public Do , we have any questions or comments from members of the public or in attendance with us tonight for this particular application?
It seems to be very straightforward and completely in line with the committee's desire for master plans Looking a lot at a three over threes on that 21st Street facade, you know, I'm, not a big fan of, even if it were 13, What, then what this application has For. You know the history contextuality of the district I do share Toni's concern.
You, know the windows that open up on the vertical axis and that pivot and open up as a big pain, we've lost a number of those and Maybe there's a way to remove them and reduce them on the building at a location where they would become harmonious with each other that this building has an interesting facade articulation where you know at the top of the building We would also approve in and the master plan, so And then the committee can discuss that thought.
, so I'm going to make a motion to approve this master plan for window replacement with, in addition that the 13 or like that all the existing Campbell steel windows that are original, be reused and repurposed and relocated on a facade of the building where they would be organized in a harmonious fashion as permitted by the condition of the window?
Existing windows install new building, canopy and restoration at entry, doors and new building signs, light well, infill modification and extension of window openings, relocate relocation of floor area to construct a real rooftop edition and replace fire escapes with new balconies Quite a lot of parts in this application Just for the sake of moving the meeting along we're gonna go directly to the your presentation, but to me we want to hear from Karen and her insights because she looked at this application closely, but I will invite the applicants to share their screen and share their presentation with us.
But we think the whole installation was from the 1920s on the right Keep that in mind when you see the installation we're proposing for the new doors next, , the staff level work again being the painting and the cleaning and the Commission level work being the new bronze signage and the door changes door and entry changes We are removing that one step putting in new wood doors and the doors just need to get adjust that six inches are so taller in order to fill the opening down to grade and provide in a very simple and sort of semi, restorative fashion, and certainly harmonious with the building providing at grade access.
So here is something like the proposed installation This installation is probably going to meet the staff level rules, although the installation that you show here that we have here shows the framing of the canopy going all the way back to the door, and so it partly covers the ornamental in intrados of the arch We are actually planning on changing that design so that it stops right where lakyn is showing with bronze stanchions, so that it does not go any deeper inside the opening and doesn't interrupt or conceal any of the of the ornamental stone or of the of the transom We're putting it on here, because it may need to go at Commission level, partly because this is an individual landmark.
But there won't be anything visible that we're raising it of the masonry, because it's all just to support the cornice and details So that finishes what we are proposing for the facade It's the lower floor of a typical two-story interior space, so existing on the left and proposed on the right and, as you can see at the top with the oriole windows, that's the 57th Street facade, a that area that is in that is shaded in blue Well is an existing fire escape which we are planning to remove, but the green area there is a fire escape like terrace or balcony that we are proposing for each floor upper levels of a of a typical two-story same situation.
Well, so that it has a wall that is, that is coplanar with the existing wall, that, although again not visible from the street and not affecting any original or ornamental fabric, nonetheless goes beyond staff level guidelines, and so it's going to the Commission next Here's a rendering of the way the interior office spaces would be if those light wells were left in place.
The twin next door, which is visible from the street The whole point of this, is that none of this is visible from the street, including from that plaza in front of the of the modern glass building Thank, you very much so very thorough presentation, a fairly large proposal with many different parts, just four members of the committee I want to just you know, reframe what it is that we are looking at You can keep the application if you can continue to share the screen.
It may provide I was thinking, I Could, it would still rain potentially on you, which canopies you know, protect you from the elements a little bit, but you do have an overhang The designation report mentions it was terracotta originally Yes the material of the cornice, because we haven't been able to do a lot of site inspection for kind of obvious worldwide reasons, but my recollection I may be wrong, but my recollection is that what the what the designation report I think says, is metal, but our plan is to is to match materials I'm, pretty sure that is a that is a metal cornice.
Maybe, that's what you have proposed, but it looks like on the underside of these balconies at the pitch black we're concerned about there, and we do appreciate your comments about how it affects the interior space Thank you any other questions by members of the public on this application.
You know it's a little bit hard to say since we don't exactly what the canopy, where they're landing with the canopy, but I think that they're doing this So overall I'm in favor of the application I would also hate to have any penetration in via the stone in the masonry of the building and I Think anchoring into the sidewalk would be a more sensible way to do it not less something the most elegant, but certainly not offensive either, but I would love to hear our thoughts.
That being you know, standing as a pair, the windows of course have changed from its neighbor, but the bringing back the cornice is going to be huge reading through the initial application Before this the canopy did concern me, you know, and on canopy, just you know , for you know the rest of the committee I would like to say that when we treat canopies in this particular area and in this particular neighborhood differently than we would in, let's say the ladies man, historic district estoy, be the ladies man.
Second I would like to suggest that the language of our resolution specifically mentions that we favor a anchoring into the sidewalk for a canopy that, although the cornice is technically not in front of us, because it's going to be a staff approval that who really insists that the cornice is replaced in kind, which is the only thing that the staff would be allowed to approve anyway You know we just want to make sure and mentioning that we have been presented with enough evidence that the secondary facades that are going to be altered contain really no architectural element or historic elements, and that this is why we can consider and support this alteration That could be the motion to approve, and we will take this to a vote.
The existing doors are bronze and the replacement door is going to be metal painted to match, and you explain it a little more I Sorry I wouldn't ask a question, so these are eveness doors or will be people be accessing the space from the lobby as well.
We're not really privy through most of the information of the new tenant, that's moving in there, but they are going to build a new corridor right in front of it, so that they're not looking to do any We still want to make every door, because particularly it is a public space in the event that you know somebody does need to it.
I mean horizontal bars, is part of the architecture and, if part of the bill existing doors in the space has that so whether what side you're on you're gonna see that door, those handlebars, and we want to maintain that down, Look, whether it's on the push or the pull side view so and obviously because of the door swing, it changes its location.
If, you take a view of the existing window, the existing door, I'm I , don't think there is a way to align it aesthetically, where it's more appealing and to center at the door How do you have you given any consideration to maybe widening the door or you know, keeping some sort of alignment with these vertical lines so that we did think about if we did something aligned and here at the door, if you notice is the entire opening is only five feet, so the door is three feet and then each satellite is only a foot So to do what you're asking to do this door Any more questions from members of the committee Okay, seeing none I will move to members of the public Let's move to a business session.
You know small scope of work, types of applications that have actually much broader implications, so I think we're having the right conversation any other comments and thoughts that have maybe not yet been expressed on this on this application, So seeing none, you know a few things that I would like to say the first one is: we have very few interior landmarks, Don't alter it, avoid it at all cost We understand that you know commercial retail space needs to have some flexibility, but does the space that has operated as one large space can continue to operate as such?
, They, stand and I'm going to vote no on principle, We, taking away my feeling about the out looking for themselves and where they use their money or what they stand for I You. Is there a general feeling that we need to be providing a commercial tenant in a landmark building in a landmark interior, the ability to subdivide their spaces for one tenant rather than three tenants, but for one tenant with no further ability to know what the other two tenants if they will ever be two tenants in those phases and I feel like it's hard because, as everyone has pointed out, this gets done once it doesn't get done again.
I think that we also want to be mindful of our business community and we want to support our business community, so maybe there's a way to craft a resolution that would be basically saying both at a really We would much prefer that this space is not subdivided and there is no need for this application to even come to us.
Think it's also important, given that LTC may you know very well consider this alteration, it's important that we tell them how we feel about it, so that you know this is on record I'm, going to make a motion to deny this application, while also making a specific comments about the proposed design and why we believe this design is not sympathetic, including the removal of the horizontal bar in the interior ma, be the lack of symmetry and the lack of details on a number of elements, including the opening mechanism and I, think that and also exploring the ability to rework the operation of the door force that may actually swing in a way that is compatible with the code.
Looking at 58th Street and Grand Army Plaza, we are going to be to expand the pedestrian space here around the city by station in order to help provide some more pedestrian space in the area and stop the illegal parking.
We're going to install this curb extension here in Central, Park, south and Grand Army Plaza, and install a full curb extension here on the north, curb of 50th Street and between Graner Plaza on Fifth Avenue and Existing materials in the area will remain we're not doing any removals or changing any of the existing materials Do. We have any questions from members of the committee.
Okay, so the second I actually have a question in terms of the applications that we see for Central, Park but I, think in general, for safety and for helping to people to sort of really understand how streets work here at the city.
