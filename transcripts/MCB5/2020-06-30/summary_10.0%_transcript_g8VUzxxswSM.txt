We have done some storefront replacements and things like that over the years go to the next page, user, Several photographs that are landmarks representative provided to us of the designation of the building, as well as a close- up of the windows.
Photographs of the building, as it is today and over the over the past 20 years, I'd say: there's been a rampant renovation and replacement of windows as new tenants came in So, presently, there's an application at landmarks to replace several of the windows for one of the offices and that's what prompted this master This goes back about two years now that we've been working with landmarks and with skyline windows.
Take over the space they'll replace windows during their renovation, but we want to have this master plan in place, so it provides a streamlined approval process with landmarks moving forward, one last sheet of photographs.
Quite, a large real estate entity in New, York City I've done master plan replacements on 200 Park Avenue South, which is just a few blocks up from this, which is their headquarters as well as 210 11Th Avenue, and the approach that they've taken on both of those building To do this and a typical office might take a week or two.
We have any questions or comments from members of the public or in attendance with us tonight for this particular application?
You, know, windows in the lady's Mouth historic district are actually a very strong feature of these buildings.
We would also approve in and the master plan, so I'm actually going to turn back to the applicant and ask them if they would be agreeable to our to that idea, and then the committee can discuss that thought.
Keeping this historic fabric on site would be much better than you know, seeing them on some random building because they were purchased on eBay I am some connoisseur, so we're going to turn back to a business.
Then the applicant would be asked by LPC and it would become you know, part of the master plan and replacement process that these windows would have to be repurposed.
Are there any objections to this path that we just felt that by members of the committee, okay, so seeing no hands raised So I'm going to make a motion to approve this master plan for window replacement with, in addition that the 13 or like that, all the existing Campbell steel windows that are original, be reused and repurposed and relocated on a facade of the building where they would be organized in a harmonious fashion as permitted by the condition of the window?
Existing windows, install new building, canopy and restoration at entry, doors and new building, signs, light well, infill modification and extension of window openings, relocate relocation of floor area to construct a real rooftop edition and replace fire escapes with new balconies.
The bottom two floors of the building that it had an area way And it had those large studio windows and then the smaller standard residential windows for two stories that changed in the 1920s on both buildings as you'll, see in the so on the left Is the tax photo circa, 1940 You have to look a little bit hard, but you'll see that there are those 1920s, typical, 1920s, large storefront openings on the ground floor and then the grouped residential scale, windows.
The left is the existing building and on the right is a photo montage of what we are proposing and please will give us a little detail on what we are proposing and the levels of review as you'll see from the labels on the, on the right- hand, rendered elevation, we are proposing to put the cornice back matching materials, details, dimensions, etc.
We are proposing to paint them a darker color, so that they, both the cornice and the windows, are moniece with the darker color of the existing 130 building next door, and also more in the in the tonality that is shown in the historic photographs.
As far as we can tell, are also not original doors, 1920s doors from the time that the that the entry was changed, there's a possibility that maybe the transom above might be earlier, but we think the whole installation was from the 1920s on the right.
This installation is probably going to meet the staff level rules, although the installation that you show here that we have here shows the framing of the canopy going all the way back to the door, and so it partly covers the ornamental in Intrados of the arch.
We are actually planning on changing that design so that it stops right where Lakyn is showing with bronze stanchions, so that it does not go any deeper inside the opening and does not interrupt or conceal any of the of the ornamental stone or of the of the transom.
It's the lower floor of a typical two, story, interior space, So existing on the left and proposed on the right and.
But the balconies do not the windows that are to the right of the balconies, though that's the area where we're proposing to push out that light well, so that it has a wall that is , that is coplanar with the existing wall, that, although again not visible from the street and not affecting any original or ornamental.
You can keep the application, So we're going to start with questions from members of the committee.
You say that the 13th floor is slightly recessed from the parapet: wall, yes, recess, space, use, usable, I, a human being, or not accessible It's only about a foot so that we do not change the inherent size of the predominant facade, no way for a person to come out and get trapped in this area.
We can not increase the level of non- compliance, so if all of this complies with current zoom zoning, no grandfather in Ellen's Only interesting great The canopy, in the line of questions that Karen had I'm, not sure I, actually totally understand the two possible installations of this canopy in the instance that you would go with the insulation that is not rendered on this drawing.
Are there any other questions by members of the committee on this application?
We have any members of the public who would like to ask questions or make comments?
Yes, overall I'm in favor of the application, I think they're doing a lot of wonderful things to the building.
You know it's a little bit hard to say, since we do not exactly what the canopy, where they're landing with the canopy, but I think that they're doing this They're going in the direction of the most sensitive to respect the ornate stone, So overall I'm in favor of the application, The canopy I will stake.
The questions and comments raised by members of the public or valid it will diminish the amount of light that gets into the building.
Any comments by members of the committee, Much will be seen from the street there to do obviously they're taking out a lot of the historic you know, windows and so forth.
You know on a building where an applicant would propose to remove so much fabric that you know we do not want to be caught in the situation where we would have approved and supported removal of historic fabric, and we do not want that to come in contest.
We have been convinced by the applicant that there is really no significant architectural or historic elements to these facades, and this is why we can consider the alteration other comments by members of the committee raised: hands.
You know we just want to make sure and mentioning that we have been presented with enough evidence that the secondary facades that are going to be altered contain really no architectural element or historic elements, and that this is why we can consider and support this alteration.
That I'm going to discuss today is the fall of building the interior lobby, we're looking to replace a door for this project.
Again, we're looking to swing the door, the other way, if, where the hardware has to change, but we're going to reuse all the hardware that we can, there would be two side.
Ada compliance is a little bit heavier, so we do need to install a new ad, a actually button that once fast, obviously the door will swing.
We looked at I mean possibly like a stand, but we went away from all that just so that we can leave the architecture in its place and not do anything and really try to do as minimal as a mammal at work as we can again, with the height of the doors.
The existing doors are bronze and the replacement door is going to be metal painted to match, and you explain it a little more Sorry I would not ask a question, so these are eveness doors or will be people be accessing the space from the lobby as well.
I know this is sort of off topic, but it would seem that it's the retail space on the far right might also have a egress issue, but I guess that's not what we're reviewing today.
My question is actually similar to Barbara's, but I'm just going to ask it anyway, the actuator button to go into the tenants area, although it this is an egress door which is located next to the to the handle or close to the handle.
Look whether it's on the push or the pull side view so and obviously because of the door swing, it changes its location.
We thought about I think we definitely thought of the use of the handle more than the aesthetics, because it has both functions within the lobby that end, you know within the other locations of the door.
Think that, like to your point, thanks for clarifying lela, because I do kind of respect that they tried to be, as least intrusive as possible , I respect that they tried to incorporate some of the existing hardware and materials that they're going to continue to use frons material and not just paint some of the updates.
You know small scope of work, types of applications that have actually much broader implications, so I think we're having the right conversation any other comments and thoughts that have maybe not yet been expressed on this on this application.
Yes, but the existing door is narrower and would there still be an interference I'm just asking what the question of the applicant the narrowness is , the issue the narrowness meets it non- Yes, but both of them open that would be compliant with code.
So did we want to just pull the group to see how much of the neutral folks are out are on the committee If there's, if there's more of a concern about some of the historical fabric being altered, the design elements that you mentioned, then we will move to the move to the proposed resolution of deny and less okay, but that would make sense so Barbara, you have your hand up, tell us what your thoughts are.
You know we saw some further study on the on the part of the applicant to because I think your point is well- taken or very few interior landmarks in the city of New York, and we The committee John go ahead.
You want to tell us sort of like where you would fall on a sort of denial, unless the applicant, you know, brings a more sympathetic design or another position, I'm going to be on to deny the less side of this.
However, I would liken that deny unless an inclusion of some reference to the issues that Buzz and Karen rates, because I think if we are going to deny, unless you know we would like for the applicant to come back, you know with some creative ways, Okay, other members of the committee.
I, you is there a general feeling that we need to be providing a commercial tenant in a landmark building in a landmark interior, the ability to subdivide their spaces for one tenant rather than three tenants, but for one tenant with no further ability to know what the other two tenants, if they will ever be two tenants in those phases and I feel like it's hard because.
Would that be something acceptable for the committee , think I'm kind of changing my position a little bit too and leaning more towards like come back with a better application that respects the interior designation of this building.
And you know it's not our place to tell them what to change or how to do it, but basically, there's, probably other opportunities to have an application that does respect Buildings do have to change the time, A DA with environmental regulations with anything, and the question is going to be: How much did they alter like?
You know, I think it's also important, Given that LTC may you know very well consider this alteration, it's important that we tell them how we feel about it, so that you know this is on record Hopefully your LPC will take it into account, so I'm going to make a motion to deny this application, while also making a specific comments about the proposed design and why we believe this design is not sympathetic, including the removal of the horizontal bar in the Interior Ma, be the lack of symmetry and the lack of details on a number of elements, including the opening mechanism.
That's the motion that I'm making and we need a second okay, So Sam Jake I, just want to say that if the motion is a denial with the further discussion, I am comfortable voting in favor with that resolution and we're taking the opportunity to specifically comment on what was presented on the design, and we have a second on that.
So I'm going to ask that activity and to all committee members to really stick to landmark specific questions, It's.
They are, they do exist in Settle park, all over, so it is on a new element, but you know that they're going to be introduced in specific locations to address the relocation of the haxed Nothing, really I.
Okay, so the second I actually have a question in terms of the applications that we see for Central, Park.
Obviously, when we're in the park, and we do review our plans with them, And then I think you know.
Think safety I'm in this area, Every single day, I understand a lot of what they're proposing Just such an integral area You know, along the lines of restating a little bit of the history, thanking beauty for coming to us tonight and urging them to work with the Conservancy and the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a more refined final design of this proposal?
We understand it is not an application, but Which is taking the opportunity of this presentation to pass a resolution that will be sent to do t2 their landmark resolution, the Commission and to Central Park Conservancy, stating your position on the proposed work and we're going to start with buzz.
