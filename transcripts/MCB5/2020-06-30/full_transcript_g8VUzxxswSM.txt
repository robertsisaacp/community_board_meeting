You, okay, it looks like most of our members are in attendance with us tonight so good evening. Everyone, this is the Yellin Marx committee of Manhattan Community Board, five. Thank you for being with us tonight. My name is Leila Loki's. If I'm in the chair, he worries about how the meeting is going to proceed. We have four items tonight on the agenda. The applicants will have an opportunity to give a full and uninterrupted presentation of their proposal after this presentation concludes. Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions once this question session ends. Members of the public will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments. Once this question comment. Period concludes by members of the public. We will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are authorized to discuss the matter. We will make comments and then a motion will be made and a vote will be taken on this motion. This vote will then be forwarded as our recommendation to the full Board of Community Board 5, the full board, meets on Thursday July. The 9th I believe please double check on the website, and the vote of the full board becomes the official position of Community Board five. So we have four applications tonight. Some of them are fairly short presentations. Others are more robust, so, for the sake of expediency, I will ask applicants to give us a as concise. Yet you know full and complete presentation as possible and we will try to move this process along so that we do not and too much time together. I mean I love being with you, but I'm sure you all want also to enjoy some of your evening. So the first application that we are going to review is actually a 9:15 Broadway, and this is an application for window master plan. This is in the ladies mile historic district. This was assigned to one of our committee members for due Diligence Buzz Baikman, just for the sake of expediency, we're going to go directly into presentation by the applicant, but bus looked into this and may have some additional insight. So will be your attune to his comments when that time comes so, do we have the applicant for 9:15 Broadway and are you ready to present? Yes, my name is Mike Rosani I'm with Michaels an Irish architects and Joshua. Unger is also with me he's the project architect on this job. So he can, you know, add any additional insight that I might not have the specific answer for so let me go ahead and share my screen and pull up presentation. Thank you and I would add very quickly that please mute your microphones and if you have any technical issues, we have Serratos, who is our community associate with Community Board 5, who is also our tech wizard and who can help get people connected and muted unmuted to speak and for those who are joining us by phone lugol's? So Kiddin' provide guidance on how to join, ask questions and all that stuff? Ok, so you should be able to see my screen at this point, so we're proposing a new window master plan for 9:15 Broadway. The windows that are being proposed to be replaced are from the third floor to the 21st floor. There is a penthouse on top of building as well next page so on this sheet, you can see the historic tax photo from the 1940s as well as a current photograph of building. You can see that the lower two floors of the building have very decorative large pane, storefront windows. So that's not part of this presentation. Although my office has worked in the past over the past 15 years on this building, we have done some storefront replacements and things like that over the years go to the next page user, several photographs that are landmarks representative provided to us of the designation of the building, as well as a close- up of the windows. It's not very clear in the close- up photograph, we tried to sharpen the image as much as we could, but that's as clear as we could get it. These are some existing condition. Photographs of the building as it is today and over the over the past 20 years, I'd say: there's been a rampant renovation and replacement of windows as new tenants came in and there's never any order to the whole process. So presently there's an application at landmarks to replace several of the windows for one of the offices and that's what prompted this master plan- and this goes back about two years now that we've been working with landmarks and with skyline windows. Who is our rep on this project and they've? Provided a lot of insight and specifications of the proposed windows that they're you know providing to us to replace and we've worked with them on several other large buildings like this for the same owner to provide a master plan. But here we have some additional photographs of the building. You can see the quantity there's eight hundred and sixty six windows as part of this project. As you see some of the drawings coming up, there's a lot of screen setbacks and small little roof areas that have some windows and mechanical areas. So we do have quite a bit of Windows, and at this point it's not the intention of ownership to replace all eight hundred and sixty six windows at one time. It's probably going to be something that comes up as tenants take over the space they'll replace windows during their renovation, but we want to have this master plan in place, so it provides a streamlined approval process with landmarks moving forward, one last sheet of photographs. So here we have some existing photographs of some of the existing Windows Skyline has identified that the existing windows of this building were a Campbell steel window and there's a few of them that still exist within the building. Not many! That's the other there's a handful here. We some existing elevations of the building, showing the configuration and different window types that are present in the building. We are indicating about four different types of windows in the building. You can see in the elevation that there are some that appear to have an arch head. These are actually squared off windows that were installed behind the arch head and going back originally that's how the windows were originally installed. According to our research, they were never a true arched window, additional Exterior elevations, showing all the windows and the different. You know setbacks and elevations of the building, and yet more so you can see some of the some of the stranger facades and areas that we have once we get above the you know the 18th floor. We have some of these bigger windows, so the proposed you know it's if we're trying to unify the building and we're showing a one over one window throughout the entire building. From the second floor from the third floor up basically, fourth floor up, I'm. Sorry, these continue just to show the repetition of the pattern at this time we're not proposing any louver patterns on several other master plans. We've done, we've identified specific locations for louvers, but we've decided to leave that to a future tenant to determine and deal with landmarks. So we would install the same frames that we would install for the windows and put a loser in its place, but that's not part of this process today, we're really just showing you know. The new window is replacing the existing with middle over modifications. Here we have some drawings of the existing versus the proposed and elevation and in plan so based on you know, skylines expertise in this field and they've developed a window called the D H 100i, which is something that they developed to be in close comparison to the Campbell steel windows, although it is an aluminum frame. So, as you can see, it's very close to the same type of proportions and profiles of what the existing Kamel windows was so additional details. You know these things can be looked at closer I, believe everybody should have the PDF if you're interested- and this is just a schedule of all the different types of windows that were sharing so I. You know I'd like to open it up to any questions and go from there all right. Thank you very much. We are going to use the raised hand functions that you will find I think at the bottom of your screen. Luke. You know correct this if it's not accurate and then members of the committee you're going to go first with yourself with questions, are there any questions by members of the committee on this proposal and I? See Janet has a question janet, go ahead, unmute yourself and go ahead with your question Janek. We can not hear you. It's fully commercial yep yeah. It's all office tenants there used to be an Ethan Allen. On the first floor, we're presently working on you know. A new tenant is taking over that space on the corner and there's a couple other commercial entities on the ground floor. But you know everything above the ground floors. Is an office tenant, hi Leila. Thank you. I was just wondering. Do you have a count on how many original three over three windows are still existing on the building? Josh? Do you have that number? Yes hi, so the original three over three windows that still exist are what we've defined as the existing type F windows, and there are 13 of those that are existing and to be replaced, and so none of those are slated to be saved you're, proposing replace everything with the new the new version. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions by members of the committee. Okay, I have Oh Karen go ahead, Karen yourself, you're, muted. Okay, often we see if the master plan is great. We love that, but often in residential buildings, we see the approach where each tenant or union owner would elect to replace the windows themselves, I'm, not so familiar with it in a commercial application and I'm a little bit curious. Why that's the approach just because it seems like it'll, take a very long period of time for commercial lease tenants to flip, and you know to get a consistency of Windows and yeah like maybe you can talk a little bit about? What is the timeline that you think that might happen, and you know even an order of magnitude, cost savings to buy nine hundred windows versus you know one floor or half a floor out of time. I mean I. Think most people would be in favor of a more proactive plan, a window replacement and it would be less expensive. So you know I've personally worked with the owners of this building is ABS partners if you're familiar with them, they're. Quite a large real estate entity in New, York City I've done master plan replacements on 200 Park Avenue South, which is just a few blocks up from this, which is their headquarters as well as 210 11Th Avenue, and the approach that they've taken on both of those building is that they place the order from the full lot of windows and they put them in storage. So it does not provide you know in 20 years. If they have not replaced Windows, they can't get them. So you know what they've done is they've purchased in this case, 866 windows they'll, put it in a storage facility somewhere and then as they need them for renovations. They go and pick out the windows and install them. I know at 200, Park Avenue South. They took a more direct approach and they installed everything within a year or two, as you know, they had a crew and they went about. Did all the render the replacements as they could at 210 11th Avenue. They tried to take a similar approach, but they ran into some issues with the tenants and they did not want to be disturbed because it is a rather just disturbing type of thing to replace windows. It's not a one- day operation to do this and a typical office might take a week or two. So it's not that easy to do when you have an occupied tenant, but I know that they are in favor of moving this along. They constantly ask me: you know: how quickly can we get this done? They're in favor of doing this, and a lot of the windows are in very poor disrepair that they're going to have to do a substantial amount of the replacements relatively quickly. I can't say for sure that they'll do all of them with one- pass, but you know it is something that they're actively pursuing and they want to. They want to obtain approval of this master plan, so they can move forward here at the windows order and then start the replacements, as they can. Okay, any more questions by members of the committee. Okay, seeing none I have a couple of questions. Can you speak to the loss of glazing for the proposed windows as compared to the original or, like the type F? Well, I? Think we're improving the amount of glazing by removing the dividing bars of the windows, and that was one of the big points that abs was very fond of is that they wanted to provide as much natural light as possible and by having three over three. Although you know the mullions are relatively small, it does reduce the amount of light and visibility and we met with landmarks and skyline and ABS about three times with landmarks. At their headquarters. Downtown- and you know, landmarks gave us a choice. They said we could get an approval at staff level if we went with the three over three windows and abs was firmly against that approach. They wanted to know the one over one for the aesthetic of you know providing more light, and you know visibility to their tenants, even though it cost them. You know having to go through a public hearing process, so we believe we have support the staff in this, but it was just a matter of principle that they could not approve something like this at staff level, which is why we're going through the full Board hearing? Okay, and can you speak to the other types of Windows, so the original Witter Campbell steel windows? What are the materials currently existing for the other types of Windows, primarily they're aluminum, clad windows? Some are anodized bronze. Some are black, I believe, there's a couple of wood windows that have you know calamine windows with wire glass in them. There's you know, there's a wide array of different types, but I think the majority you will find are aluminum windows, ok, Prob about 90% of them any other questions by members of the committee. Okay, so seeing none we're going to move to opening up the floor to members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments from members of the public or in attendance with us tonight for this particular application? If you want to raise your hand from a member of the public, just find the raised hands button in the middle of the screen, any questions comments from members of the public. You can use the raise hand button seeing none. We will move back to business session so during business session as I preface in my intro. Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss this matter. Mmm I am seeking comments from members of the committee comments on this application. You can use the raise hand button or, if you feel, like speaking given that I feel that people may be a little shy for the moment. Maybe we need a little warm- up so feel free to make your comments and eat yourselves. If you are going to make a comment, preferably use the raise hand button, we need comments otherwise, I'm going to call upon people Karen, please make a comment. I joined a few minutes late, but it looks like a very straightforward application. It is a big undertaking. I have no objections to the plan I'm in favor. Thank you. Let's see buzz. What are your comments for this application? It seems to be very straightforward and completely in line with the committee's desire for master plans. Hi Tony, okay, I'm, happy to comment so we saw them before they came to us. I think there was some illegal window replacement without LPC approval. If he goes maybe 2017 there are original windows on here. I was counting more than 13 just by using Google Street View. Looking a lot at a three over threes on that 21St Street facade, you know, I'm, not a big fan of, even if it were 13 I. Think it's more but I'm, not a big fan of having any amount of original material pulled out of the building, I think there's more than then. What then, what this application has. A master plan is always good. I do have concerns about the loss of that meant the original windows yeah. Thank you. Suzanne has her hand up Susan go ahead. Yeah I am worried about that, but I feel like I do like the master plan, approach and I have actually worked with skyline before and so I like the notion of more light. I think it might be aesthetically pleasing to it and I okay. Thank you any other comments that would be different or you know, with anyone who wants to reiterate a comment that we been made. Okay, so seen on if I hear correctly. Overall, we feel that the master plan is a good idea, but we struggle with the loss of at least 13 original steel windows and, possibly maybe more so. Basically, we have to find this. You know like wrestle with this idea and find you know a balance that would be acceptable. For you know the history contextuality of the district I do share Toni's concern. You know, windows in the lady's Mouth historic district are actually a very strong feature of these buildings. You know we always had these conversations about the pivot windows. You know the windows that open up on the vertical axis and that pivot and open up as a big pain, we've lost a number of those and we've lamented that it's a little difficult to totally. You know ignore the fact that we're going to lose. You know historic steel windows. I would love for the applicant to be able to salvage them. Maybe there's a way to remove them and reduce them on the building at a location where they would become harmonious with each other that this building has an interesting facade articulation where you know at the top of the building. There are because it's an angle building it has sort of like sub facades that are recessed. So you know that would be a salt rather than you know, putting them on eBay. Maybe they can be repurposed on the building at a location that you know they would be appropriate. Well, we would also approve in and the master plan, so I'm actually going to turn back to the applicant and ask them if they would be agreeable to our to that idea, and then the committee can discuss that thought so I think it's an interesting idea. You know, given what we've looked at, though I do not really think that these windows are I, think they're beyond repair. At this point, yeah a lot of them are rusted and damaged. Some of them have been, you know, welded shut, even you know, they're not operable, I, think the process of removing a window and trying to repurpose it and putting it in a new opening, because I doubt any of the windows that we do have would fit into the openings. That would be in a harmonious context. It's a it's a thought. We would have to definitely study and see if it's feasible or not, and how many of the actual existing windows are still in the condition that could be salvaged so I do not have a you know, a direct answer, if that's even an option at this point it would take a lot of research and some more studying to do. Okay, yeah, you know. Obviously the existing condition of the window is something that has to be your considered. I mean if they're beyond, you know being salvaged. That's a whole different conversation. In our experience we have often- or let's say it has happened- that windows replace from some of our existing historic buildings would be found on eBay not soon after the demolition had happened. So, although it was probably not by the owner of the building, you know it looks like the demolition companies have found a way to you know capitalize on these historic elements. There she go for quite a bit of money. The instance that I can recall was a she a brass window, and you know so it is something that you know, I think should be explored. As you know, keeping this historic fabric on site would be much better than you know, seeing them on some random building because they were purchased on eBay I am some connoisseur, so we're going to turn back to a business session. I would like to hear some thoughts from members of the committee on this idea of salvaging and using repurposing. These windows Tony has his hand up Tony. Go ahead, hey well, thank you for that suggestion. I think that that's a great idea to have them somewhere, if they, if they want to avoid having a look on uniform. As you said, there are plenty of setbacks and different sections to this building where this could be done, you know I would love to get more of a commitment from the applicant as of right now, I will personally probably vote no on this, knowing that it's not the majority, but you know I think with it with a better commitment. That's something that I could definitely be on board with. So thank you for bringing that up. Even we make a recommendation to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. We could hope that you know if we make this a strong recommendation. If L can see were to be in agreement with this recommendation, then the applicant would be asked by LPC and it would become you know, part of the master plan and replacement process that these windows would have to be repurposed. Would you feel comfortable with that? Yes, okay, are there any objections to this path that we just felt that by members of the committee, okay, so seeing no hands raised so I'm going to make a motion to approve this master plan for window replacement with, in addition that the 13 or like that, all the existing Campbell steel windows that are original, be reused and repurposed and relocated on a facade of the building where they would be organized in a harmonious fashion as permitted by the condition of the window? Second, all right. So this is our first vote of the evening. Are there any comments or discussions on the motion before we take this to a vote? Okay, so seeing none we're going to vote on that? This is a motion to approve with conditions, and this is 915, so buzz. Renee, Cafaro I know Renee is not with us. I'm. Sorry James! Yes, Sarah! Yes, Laura! Yes, John! Yes, Nick! Yes, Suzanne! Yes, Richard! Yes, Mike! Yes, Renee Kinsella, yes, Sam Lucas, yes, Chuck, yes, Janet, okay, I'll come back to Janet Karen, yes, Barbara I! Think Barbara is not yet with us and I'll go back to Janet. I know you're here! Yes, thank you, I'm! Sorry! Thank you! Okay! Tony! Yes, sorry about that and Tony! Yes, okay and I am a yes. So the motion passes unanimously. Here we are moving on to our next application and it is 140 West 57th Street. This is the Beaufort studio building and this is an application to restore a cornice paint. Existing windows, install new building, canopy and restoration at entry, doors and new building signs, light well, infill modification and extension of window openings, relocate relocation of floor area to construct a real rooftop edition and replace fire escapes with new balconies. So quite a lot of parts in this application. This was assigned to Karen and Renee. Just for the sake of moving the meeting along we're going to go directly to the your presentation, but to me we want to hear from Karen and her insights because she looked at this application closely, but I will invite the applicants to share their screen and share their presentation with us. Well we're getting ready for screen sharing I'm Bill Higgins of Higgins quays Barth. We are the historic preservation, consultants for the project, Dan Shannon and his colleagues from MDAs. Architects are here and although, as Leyla mentioned, there are quite a few parts to this application, many of them are being included for your information, because many of them meet the qualifications for staff level approval. But we wanted to just show you the entirety of the project, so you'd have a well-, rounded view of what it is that we're proposing thanks, lakin Colm, my associate is up he's doing what I can not do, which is which is screen share and talk at the same time. Are we good? Okay? Thank you again. I'll, try I'll, try to be efficient, so you'll explain to you just briefly what the name is when why it's called the office town house when the when this, when the proper slide comes next, are we changing lakyn? Yes, are you able to see my screen? No, it's. What I'm seeing is still is still the title. Sheet title slide: are you sharing a specific window, Lincoln I'm, sharing my adobe okay, just a moment, I'll come out, you try it again, I think. Sometimes what happens is when you go into full screen there. You go okay, so just locating the building on the south side of 57th Street between 6th and 7th, it's in red and there's a photograph on the right next, the office townhouse part just FYI. The building was designed as a studio building, and so it has a number of interesting two- story, spaces and those two storage spaces, although obviously are not part of direct landmarks regulation, are being maintained. The ownership and architects correctly think that they give a particular character to the to the to the spaces and so are planning to keep them for that purpose. Next, this will be entirely office use, however, no residential. So here are two photographs of the buildings from 1910 buildings, both built in nineteen seven one. Forty is the westernmost of a pair that includes 130 same-, same architects, Pollard and Steinem, and, as you can see, they were clearly meant to be a pair of a building of buildings with those dominant, continuous cornices, the cornice on 140. Our building is missing and we are proposing to put it back in kind. It's a metal cornice and we are proposing to use metal but you'll, see more I'm, just a quick historical thing. Just FYI you can see when you look at the base, the bottom two floors of the building that it had an area way and it had those large studio windows and then the smaller standard residential windows for two stories that changed in the 1920s on both buildings as you'll, see in the so on the left is the tax photo circa 1940 and you have to look a little bit hard, but you'll see that there are those 1920s, typical, 1920s, large storefront openings on the ground floor and then the grouped residential scale windows. On the second floor in 1940, the cornice was still there on the right from the 1990s. Is the designation photograph and you'll see that the cornice at this point is conspicuously absent as it is now next, so on? The left is the existing building and on the right is a photo montage of what we are proposing and please will give us a little detail on what we are proposing and the levels of review as you'll see from the labels on the, on the right- hand, rendered elevation, we are proposing to put the cornice back matching materials, details, dimensions, etc. So that is a staff level review item. We are proposing to repair the existing windows. That is the level of repair that fits staff level requirements. There's not window replacement proposed here. There is repair of weather, stripping and reglazing as necessary, but we are not replacing any of the windows we are proposing to paint them a darker color so that they, both the cornice and the windows, are moniece with the darker color of the existing 130 building next door, and also more in the in the tonality that is shown in the historic photographs we're planning on the ground floor on the on the base of the building. That's where the elements that require a staff level approval occur. We are proposing changes to the entrance in order to provide at grade barrier free access, as you will see, and we are proposing some very minor changes to the to the metal plaques that flank the entrance. Otherwise, at the base of the building, we are proposing cleaning the limestone and the same repair and painting of the windows and storefronts that will make it harmonious, as with the windows above next. So here is a photograph of the existing condition, concentrate please on the on the entry, the entry was changed in the 1920s, but the existing one is from is from the 20s. You'll see some changes. However, you can see that there's a very slight but certainly visible ramp to get that one step up from grade we're planning on removing the ramp and lowering the door as you'll, see and also we are planning on moving the two flak plaques, which flank the entrance arch off of the rusticated masonry and onto the flat surfaces of the pilasters. The existing flag, poles and flags are planning to be kept and just new Flags installed next, so here's a photo montage of what we are proposing. As you can see, the ramp and the step are removed, new wood doors with glazed panels above and opaque wood panels below are proposed and a and a glazed wood framed transom above and we're proposing on, as you can see, moving those plaques to the flanking pilasters next, just a little historical background, slightly intricate, but not too bad on the left are, is a photograph from the 1970s. These are the wood entry doors that are on 130, not our building but the twin building to the east. You can see it's not our building, because it's with the with the change in grade. There are many more steps leading up to the to the entry doors in the center. That's those are the doors that previously were on 140. They, as far as we can tell, are also not original doors, 1920s doors from the time that the that the entry was changed, there's a possibility that maybe the transom above might be earlier, but we think the whole installation was from the 1920s on the right is: what is there now? Those are her cue light doors that supplanted the 1920s doors and they are the existing condition. As you can see, the soffit or the intrados of the arch has. These has stone panels with stone, rosettes and I. Think you can see when you look at the Hercules doors that their current position is just behind the paneled elements. We think that was the same place that the previous doors were in the 1920s. But if you look at the hand that Lakyn is about to put up to that dental cornice above the projecting cornice projects a few inches on to that stone style. If you will that in frames the inside of those of those rosette panels. So keep that in mind when you see the installation we're proposing for the new doors next, okay, so here's a summary again of what we're proposing at the at the base of the building, the staff level work again being the painting and the cleaning and the Commission level work being the new bronze signage and the door changes door and entry changes. So we are removing that one step putting in new wood doors and the doors just need to get adjust that six inches are so taller in order to fill the opening down to grade and provide in a very simple and sort of semi restorative fashion, and certainly harmonious with the building providing at grade access. We are also proposing you can't really see it here, but we are proposing a stanchion for barrier free operation of the doors, and that will be a dark color too, to blend with the installation of the of the doors themselves. Next, so details showing the existing condition next and details showing the proposed condition. The installation of the doors is at the at the same depth and just as the previous doors had been, the door frames themselves are installed, just behind that stone, arch, soffit or Intrados, and though, and the little crown molding Saima molding transom bar projects slightly on to that stone style, just as it as it did previous. The next and here's the same detailing shown in perspective, rendering in Axon and again the infill is all wood. The doors and the transom entrainment are all wood next, so the these are. These are the proposed statuary bronze panels, just FYI the installation would be would be with adhesive into the into the stone pilaster surfaces. Next, and so here is we are. We are proposing, as you will see, to install a metal framed fabric canopy that is very similar to the one which probably went probably went in the 1920s and is shown extent but dilapidated in the 1940 tax photo next, and so here's what we are proposing, supported on I on a metal frame that matches the bronze medal, we're proposing elsewhere, with a dark in frame with a dark fabric covering and next, and so here is something like the proposed installation. So without getting too detailed here's the story, this installation is probably going to meet the staff level rules, although the installation that you show here that we have here shows the framing of the canopy going all the way back to the door, and so it partly covers the ornamental in Intrados of the arch. We are actually planning on changing that design so that it stops right where Lakyn is showing with bronze stanchions, so that it does not go any deeper inside the opening and does not interrupt or conceal any of the of the ornamental stone or of the of the transom. So we're putting it on here because it may need to go at Commission level, partly because this is an individual landmark, but it may go at staff level as well, but the installation in any case is less intrusive than what you're seeing here. Next here's the cornice we've got perfect evidence for materials for profiles, for dimensions, etc in the excellent twin to the east, and we are planning on duplicating that. We need to raise the parapet a little bit because it was apparently cut down when they took the cornice off, but there won't be anything visible that we're raising it of the masonry, because it's all just to support the cornice and details. So that finishes what we are proposing for the facade. The second and final portion is what we are proposing for the rear and there are a few elements to it again, some of them most of them being approvable at staff level, but a few of them requiring a Commission level approval. So these are typical floor plans. It says lower floor again. Remember that the individual studios are two storeys high, and so we say lower floor. It's the it's the typical floor plan lower level, it's the it's the lower floor of a typical two- story, interior space, so existing on the left and proposed on the right and, as you can see at the top with the oriole windows, that's the 57th Street facade. What we're really talking about now is the rear portion. So what's you can see if you compare the windows in the in the rear and the side portions, you might want to point to those Lakyn yep there and there we are proposing changes to the windows as you'll see they meet the staff level requirements you'll see on the on the on the right- hand, drawing a left- hand, drawing sorry the right- hand side of it there's a that area that is in that is shaded in blue. That is a very obscured light well and we are proposing to infill that light. Well, you'll see more of that with the with the next drawings it'll be made more clear and then also next to that light. Well is an existing fire escape which we are planning to remove, but the green area there is a fire escape like terrace or balcony that we are proposing for each floor. So those are the changes, but let's show them in more detail and that's the same thing happening at a at one of the upper floor. Upper levels of a of a typical two- story, same situation, okay, so here's what we the, what the existing conditions are a little complicated back there. But if you look down at the I hope that it's on my screen, that little Axon is being concealed by everybody's thumbnail picture. I hope you guys can see them because they locate where those photos are the basic story. If you look at the one on the left, the typical condition of that of that rear facade is that at either end of the facade, there are paired windows and then there are three individual windows: three rows of individual windows in the in the center and then on the on the side. You can see that there are existing windows next to the fire escape there, their previous openings original openings that have been closed in and we're planning on opening those up. As you will see the next like you, so this is a rendered view of what we are proposing. Essentially, what we're proposing to do is to is to link together the windows, except for that the window that one line of them in the center in the center we are. We are proposing to not to enlarge the overall width of the linked openings. We are proposing to make the openings a bit taller by lowering them and all the changes that you see here conform to staff level, staff level guidelines, but you'll see that on the top two stories we're doing some proposing a little bit different, which you'll see in more detail- and you can see those proposed balconies projecting out, they are essentially in the locations of the existing fire escapes, except we're pushing them for wishing them back. Absolutely. None of this just FYI is visible from the street next, and this is a view of typical floors of the of those balconies. So the window, the openings that open on to the balconies, are the in the existing areas where we are proposing to change the dimensions of the openings. They also all conform to staff level requirements, but the balconies do not the windows that are to the right of the balconies, though that's the area where we're proposing to push out that light well, so that it has a wall that is, that is coplanar with the existing wall, that, although again not visible from the street and not affecting any original or ornamental fabric, nonetheless goes beyond staff level guidelines, and so it's going to the Commission next. There's that same thing that you just saw in elevation next and just to give you a sense of why we're proposing to infill that light. Well, here's a rendering of the way the interior office spaces would be if those light wells were left in place. The lady there in the in the dark clothing is looking out one of those existing windows. Next lakyn. That's what happens if you, if you make that change, and so that's the reason why we are proposing it it's as a very significant effect on the character and usability of the space from the inside next, so here in elevation. This allows you to compare the existing windows on the South elevations to the left and the proposed windows to the right again, everything that you see except the top two floors, yep those all conform, but those do not, and that's because we are proposing to sort of swap some bulk that is existing on top of the building. And if you go to the, we can show you how we're proposing that so on. The left is an existing side. Elevation that is, that is looking to the west and you'll, see those top two floors. Those are the 13th and the 14th floors and what and then on the right is what we are proposing. Essentially we're proposing to take that bulk, that is, on the front part of the 14th floor. Take it off and move it down to the 13th floor so that we get a slightly setback, condition where the 13th floor has the space that is now distributed between the 13th and 14th, and the 14th floor has a has a terrace. This does not increase the overall a floor area of the building. It does not increase the height of the building, it's not visible from the street and it does not affect any. You know ornament fabric ornamental fabric. Next, that's that same thing, I just described except looking to the east. Next here it is in floor plan on the left is the is the 13th. Is the 13th floor? That's or would be relocating that area from the 14th floor, so we get that larger space there on the 13th floor, and then this is the 14th floor in red. That's the portion we're proposing to take off and relocate down to the 13th floor and then that what Lincoln is pointing to is the is the terrace space that is provided. So we are proposing to create a new exterior walls, then, at both the 13th and the 14th floors, and they are they and the fenestration on them is what requires Commission level approval next and just aggressor. You can show so you can understand, perhaps better so in the photograph on the left. It's that there's that there's the two- story, the 13th and the 14th floors. We would be taking that bulk off there on the 14th floor and moving it down to where all of those guys are standing and it would stop just short of the existing parapet wall, so it will be recessed from the exist out of this shows it would be recessed from the existing rear wall next, and that is what it would look like in elevation, it's those top two floors. And finally, this is just so everyone knows it's there. This is a view from 56th Street and the arrow there points to a little portion of not our building but the building next door, the twin next door, which is visible from the street. The whole point of this is that none of this is visible from the street, including from that plaza in front of the of the modern glass building. Our building is concealed completely by them by the modern glass building next. So this is just the proposed materials palette. It's the dark, grey paint that we're proposing for all of the windows and for the for the new entry doors. That's the statuary bronze that we are proposing for the excuse me for both the plaques and for the metal framing of the new fabric canopy and then existing brick. We're really not talking about doing substantial, brick rebuilding here and that's just ending on probably the largest intervention, which is, which is the new barrier free entry doors. So that's it. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much, so very thorough presentation, a fairly large proposal with many different parts, just four members of the committee I, want to just you know, reframe what it is that we are looking at. Actually the applicants. If you can keep the application, if you can continue to share the screen, that's wonderful, so that if we have any questions, we can refer to specific slides. Thank you so much so we're going to start with questions from members of the committee. I want get a sense of where we all are. If I see that the questions are a little scattered, then maybe we will, you know section off. You know maybe starting with Yo the front facade then moving to the rear and then finally, the redistribution of the bulk on the top. But for the moment I'm going to ask you to raise your hands and shoot your questions and I see that Sarah has a question: Sarah go ahead! Hi! My question is really about the rear, so you wanted to do the front questions. First, okay, two or three slides in at the rear. It just seemed to me that the proposed balconies were sitting on top of Windows so that if you looked out of the window, you would be shaded by an enormous balcony. Let's see yeah you got it is that good I do not know. It looks crowded to me you have do you have a question we're in questions. Why is the balcony so close to the window? Well, I would I would mention that I showed you that there are existing fire escapes that are in the same position. They do not go as far to the south, but they that that's where they are yeah there they are, and so in fact they cross some of the windows actually, so it's really we're proposing those balconies at the place where they are, because that's the that's the floor level of the of the building. It's also looking acrosss to a sort of mirror image condition on the on the other side. Thank you. Thank you. At the front entry with the removal of the existing round, will the entry door still be a DA excessive, and is that manual like you, pull the door yep great questions? The whole reason we're doing this is to enhance ABA and barrier free accessibility instead of needing to go up that ramp, small as it is. This will allow the doors to be right at grade and we are also providing a automatic operator. Stanchion operation of the doors so that a disabled person or person needs to use that will be able to use it. So the whole purpose is in fact to enhance the A.Da accessibility. The doors would swing out onto the street. With this in they would swing, they would swing out. If you look at the floor plan there, where Lincoln is showing that's the outward swing of the doors and then that little that little area there, that little square area is the stanchion any questions, let's go to me, I, do not regarding the canopy yep that you're proposing and forgive me if I missed it, but the sister building. Let me just ask you first: is that the same owner or a different owner different odor, different owner? Okay, because that building does have a canopy that comes out to very unique canopy? How old is their existing? That's quite recent! That's the 90s Plus! You know the only documentation we have of a historic canopy of probably 1920s is that one that I showed you that looks like the one we're proposing. Thank you. Yeah I have a few questions, should I just run through them all and let you answer okay, so I'm curious about the current use of the building we know. Originally, they were these like artists, lofts and is a commercial office. Now are you converting from some type of residential to office? It's office no office, now, okay and then, in regard to the canopy I, you commented that you may hold it back, so we can see more of the ornate stone detail, yeah if, in fact you do that, would that introduce two more columns. You know slender posts, so there'll be a total of four brass posts. Yes, that's what we're planning! Okay and then okay I mean just as you can see as it would be here. The whole thing would need to be attached directly to the to the transom bar and the transom bar would probably have to be beefed up a little bit to do it and it would have it would obstruct the view of the transom bar and the transom above. It's just a lot cleaner to hold it back. Yeah it may not. It may provide I was thinking I. Could it would still rain potentially on you, which canopies you know, protect you from the elements a little bit, but you do have an overhang yeah and it would go in to go right like him. Would you just point where it where it would go yeah, so it's in there, so it actually would engage that portion that undecorated portion of the stonework, but it would leave the panels and the rosettes unobstructed okay, so you are mechanically fastening to the sides of the limestone there. You know we have not decided how we would do. It would be either a mechanical fastening to the stone which we keep as minimal as possible and hopefully be able to do it in the in the deeper parts of the rusticated joints, or we would. We would just have a. We would just have post on either side, okay, and is there any illumination in the canopy Dan? Do you yeah? Thank you bill. Yes, there would be down lighting in the canopy interior, okay. My next question is about finishes. If you could talk a little bit about the brick I assume you're just going to match the existing I mean if they do not have attics doc. Is it an easy enough brick to source that the new would look like the original and the other is about the finish of the cornice? The designation report mentions it was terracotta originally and I know you say to match in color and shape and size. But could you talk a little bit about the material of that cornice? Yes, the material of the cornice, because we have not been able to do a lot of site inspection for kind of obvious worldwide reasons, but my recollection I may be wrong, but my recollection is that what the what the designation report I think says, is metal, but our plan is to is to match materials I'm, pretty sure that is a that is a metal cornice, although parts of it might be wood, but I do not think it's a terra, cotta corners yeah now I have an open page guide since Terra Cotta. Oh, it's not referring to the lower floor, can't cornice verses to refined, cornice I'll. Take a closer read: okay, but you know the intent is to match. What's you know you had a perfect example: okay, the antennas match, so if it was terracotta, you would plan to match terracotta, that's and then my last question has to do with roof top equipment. That's correct, okay, and they can only approve that's correct. So if you were to use any different material, then you would have to go through. We would have to go back to the Commission. Okay go ahead, Karen! Okay, last question is about the I noticed quite a few window, AC units and in the front and the back, and is the intent to go to some type of chiller plant or common cooling tower to get rid of the through window. Ac units- that's right, and if so, is it visible on the roof at all any other window units there will be no central plant. We are putting unit by unit condensers in the adjacent light. Well that are obscured, so they do not yeah. Should we let's go to one of the plans that shows that I'm, sorry, that I forgot to mention that so you're going to solve it with a new mechanical room on a floor-, by- floor basis, there's no additional top equipment, but they can do it. You just point to it. Yet no the light well to the left that one yeah that we're planning we're planning on using that Franek. That is not an enclosed room that is on done inch. You know a grating and it's just the condenser unit place there on each floor. Yes, it is okay, clever! That's it members of the committee, any questions any hands raised. Okay, so seeing none I have a couple of questions at the top in the area where you reconfiguring the bulk. You say that the 13th floor is slightly recessed from the parapet: wall, yes, recess, space, use, usable, I, a human being, or not accessible and I'm going to ask you to answer that bacon. I can't see if the transition from the 12th to the 13th floor is just a coping stone. It's only about a foot so that we do not change the inherent size of the predominant facade, no way for a person to come out and get trapped in this area. It's just the parapet itself. Yes, that's correct! Okay! Thank you. My other question regarding this same area is this to code for as to us for the zoning resolution, can you eliminate a light? Well, yes, so, on two counts, one is. The proposal needs all laugh line, height and setback requirements for zoning. In addition, we are not increasing the zoning area of the building. We are transferring area from inside. We are creating an additional two storey space at the lobby in it and within so that we do not add any zoning area so from height and setback and from the zoning area in combined in bulk. These comply with the zoning regulation and it's combined with the 1961 with the 19 I mean the building was built in 1907 yeah, so we it has to comply. We can not increase the level of compliance with the current zoning code, so all zoning you have to unlike Department of Building Codes. This is the building code, is 1968 other than energy. The zoning code has to comply with the changes with the current zoning code. We can not increase the level of non- compliance, so if all of this complies with current zoom zoning, no grandfather in Ellen's only interesting great okay. Thank you. Going back to the to the base of the building, I want to touch again on the year. The canopy, in the line of questions that Karen had I'm, not sure I, actually totally understand the two possible installations of this canopy in the instance that you would go with the insulation that is not rendered on this drawing, but that would basically he visibility on those rosettes and this stonework. Then there would be a penetration of two poles in the sidewalk, or would those poles be attached to the building itself? The simplest, the simplest manner to support the canopy would be to add two additional post as they are at the street line as they break inside the building. The other way to do it as bill said, is one that we would do if it were not an individual landmark which would be to secure the top of the canopy to the adjacent architecture to the stone. But, given that this is an individual landmark, we have to consider the doing the two additional posts right. Yes, that's correct and the fabric would be a dark, green or so like hunter Green, it's good. It's great, yeah, dark, Grey, green, okay and the twin has a canopy. Yes, it's a glass! It's a glass and metal lattice construction. I do not know if we have a picture still in the deck and as bill said it was introduced in the 80s or 90s yeah, it's a yeah. It is it's not historic or based on anything historic. Okay, all right! Thank you! So much are there any other questions by members of the committee on this application? Yes, it done go ahead, yeah so I'm, just a quick question, so this dark gray color that you're working in is there. Is there any significance to the selection of this dark gray? We the we? What one of the things that we really wanted to do was to harmonize a bit more with the building next door at 1:30. We really, we did not want- exactly duplicate it, we're not certain that's a historic color or not, but we really did not we wanted. We did not want it to be as much of a contrast as it is now with that sort of cream color. So the dark gray is something we've chosen that we think is a good sort of tonal harmony that allows the two buildings to be sort of read together once again, but without exactly duplicating the sort of greenish color of 130 next door, I see and then on the panels. The bronze panels that you're taking off and moving farther over yeah. They also sort of register like the dark, gray kind of a more of a modern or crisp, feel changing sort of the tone and manner of the building. What is the need to move those, or is that just a directional sign, and are there any other lighting that we need to know about that's happening on the site? Yeah? Well, first of all, the existing the existing plaques are not bronze, and so in changing it's not your right, we're actually that's actually I would say, and our intention is for it to be a bit more of a historic feeling, rather than a than a modern one. I could see. One is that is the location on the pilasters, as bill described earlier, the signs from the original building. Okay, if we miss rendered that's our fault, the intention is it to be raised on black the frame and the letters are raised. The background is back in a traditional manner. We, our intention, is not for it to strike a modern or contemporary tone. I see, okay, and is there any other lighting? That's going on? It type is as the answer it's good inside the canopy structure itself is down like right and that's it. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions. Members of the committee- okay, seeing none I will open up the floor to members of the public. Do we have any members of the public who would like to ask questions or make comments? I see that Daniel Van Doren has his hand raised and you're permitted to talk, go ahead. Daniel, okay, I'm one of the owners of, though I'm very interested in this job. You've done a very remarkable thing. Very nice, very nice changes I wanted to clarify that the cornice above this is limestone and the cornice at the top of the building is metal. Correct. The cornice that originally the front of the building between the two flags extended out onto the street right and the cornice that you see there was a change done by John, Mead Howells, the architect in 1920 early 1920s. To give it a sense of calm. Same thing was done at 1:30 in a smaller way. At 1:30 we do. We have a our canopy was constructed with installed in night in 2002, and we have a glass half moon shape, picture of our account of from our end of our canopy up to the to fill in that space, because we're worried about the rain, I guess I. The only other question I had was about the balcony seemed like about to be seemed like a great idea, except that it's not it's dark back there I mean it's not like it's a dark space back there happy yeah. What you do not see is that there's a another building right on the side, you're welcome to try it, but I had one other question about the. If I had one question about the elevation, if you show the elevation the rear elevation at the base, it seems like there was a you're drawing it seemed like there was a like. They were too serious on the left in this drawing. What is that staircase would love, because that does not exist. Yes, do you know that is the existing Oh head scare that we are renamed? That's there, because I put that there in the 1990s. That was the means to get the stare out the back stare out of the building and toward the front. No there. It goes the building and we're modifying that. So we'll be removing that obstruction. There is no bulk edge, so they would say the building is built. Two storeys high in the back complete hosing, yeah yard, yeah, there's a rear yard and on top of that rear. On top of that second floor, it's that stair construction, I see so you're, not yeah bottom two floors. You can see part of it right in the image, a that is the angle of that stair coming down, okay and that will be removed because we're changing the dressing in the building, simplifying it. Alright, if you have any questions about the two buildings I'm happy to have. Thank you any other questions by members of the public. I see that Adam Ben Doran has a question Adam. Yes, can you hear me I'm just trying to a neutral mute? Can you hear me? Yes, we can yes again, I'm also the same family of the owners of the building next door and also will reiterate the fact that it's very nice that you'll be doing that Corner's. The building has looked good there for many years and that will have a huge impact as well as the door. I think is very nice. I guess I was going, but also back to that question of the balconies. Oh, it's very dark. You had mentioned that the fire stairs were there before and I believe those are slats of metal, so light does come through it as it's not a tremendous amount of light, but it's sort of like a pergola when you do get Mike coming through slats, maybe there's a way. I do not have anything in general against such a balcony, but maybe there's a way to make the floor somehow a translucent material, so light can still comes through, because I think this will be very dark spaces right underneath the window and what is already a dark area. Maybe that's what you have proposed, but it looks like on the underside of these balconies at the pitch black. So I have seen that, of course, in buildings, where they're glass or something that you know obviously very hard material glass but I've given thought to that as an option, or it's simply to answer the question that that's a difficult assembly, we're concerned about there, and we do appreciate your comments about how it affects the Interior space. Okay, thank you any other questions by members of the public on this application. You want to raise your hands. Okay, so see any none. We're going to move back to our business session. I want to make sure that the applicant has addressed all the questions that were that was asked. If you want to give a quick, wrap- up sort of like closing statement, you can do that. Otherwise we can move to business session and formulate our recommendation. I. Think I think you can go right ahead unless someone has another question. Okay, great! Thank you! Okay, so we are in business session now, members of the committee we need comments. Maybe we can slice it off in you know, looking at those different areas, I think that we can start with the facade, so the facade. Basically, what is in front of us is the introduction of this that this canopy and the anchoring mechanism is something that you know. We've had a number of questions on the replacement of the door. The relocation of the plaques are basically what is in front of us there's a number of other elements that will be accomplished, but they were being dealt at staff level and not really under or approve you, although, if we feel that you know we should comment we soon, we can but I do not think that it really raises any or any particular concern. So facade of the lower portion is the door, the canopy and the plas. Do we have any comments on that? Do we like it? Do we not like it? Do we object any comments? Any comments, all right, I'll be calling on people Karen I'm, going to call on you. This was your application for due diligence. Do you have any comments? Yes, sorry, I did not get my hand up quick enough. Yes, overall I'm in favor of the application, I think they're doing a lot of wonderful things to the building. As far as restoration- and you know, bringing the original life back with the cornice is just a fantastic thing that we do not always see. Building owners do so. I really appreciate that making the entry accessible is one of the things we really advocate. For so that's fantastic I live in the neighborhood. This is my grocery store and I have walked into that handrail and hurt myself before it's a horrible tripping hazard. So that's a great improvement to make it accessible, provide double doors versus a single door and have the power assist operator some very in favor of that you know it's a little bit hard to say, since we do not exactly what the canopy, where they're landing with the canopy, but I think that they're doing this they're going in the direction of the most sensitive to respect the ornate stone so I'm in favor of that as well yeah. So overall I'm in favor of the application I think it's a very good presentation. We have an opportunity to actually comment on what we would see as a preferred method of anchoring. The canopy I will stake. My position I think that going with four poles- and you know letting those was that really you know he enjoyed and not being obstructed. I think is really the way to go. I would also hate to have any penetration in via the stone in the masonry of the building and I. Think anchoring into the sidewalk would be a more sensible way to do it not less something the most elegant, but certainly not offensive either, but I would love to hear our thoughts. Karen D. Do you have any preference on anchoring methods? Yeah I agree with you, I think an independent freestanding four- post solution is the most respectful to the building. It also speaks of a different time. You know it was an original. The other thought I did not want to suggest a design is, would be, though, to raise it higher. Would you consider, following the curve on the arch and raising the height of the canopy, so you're above the rosettes? Just wonder you know I, guess we're not in questions or comments any longer, but that was my other thought. Lela, but I do think an independent freestanding unit. You know self- contained self- supporting is the most respectful to the entry. Entryway would slice it off, but it looks like have any objections to the other. No I do not, and I just wanted to make one more comment about the material I looked closer at the designation report. While we were chatting- and it appears that one page of the designation report is missing, so the Terracotta cornice is in fact the lower cornice and I got this from LBC website. Maybe you have a more current version, but it would be interesting to know what the just for our edification, what the top cornice was and page 6 seems to be missing from the reports so anyway. My understanding is that the cornice had already been removed at the time of designation and therefore would not necessarily see material is 1:30. The owners of 130 represented to us tonight that it is actually a metal, ordinance, I think there's still plenty of historic material. Then they can work with so that they actually do you a match. Other comments by members of the committee, the Tony had his hand up at some points. Oh sure I was I was just going to say a lot of what Karen did too I. Think overall, everything from the from the street level from the facade itself looks great and we're so fortunate to have a mirror image of this building next door. I think they're doing a great job, bringing it back to being competitive. With that, being, you know, standing as a pair, the windows, of course, have changed from its neighbor, but the bringing back the cornice is going to be huge reading through the initial application. Before this, the canopy did concern me. Your suggestions of having the four post I think is probably the best way to go. You know, usually, we have a little more discussion when it comes to canopies, but in this neighborhood these are very common up here. So I, you know I think aesthetically. What they're doing is really quite wonderful, yeah, you know, and on canopy just you know, for you know the rest of the committee I would like to say that when we treat canopies in this particular area and in this particular neighborhood differently than we would in, let's say the ladies man, Historic district Estoy, be the ladies man. Historic district was a manufacturing district. Canopies were not historic; they were not installed there because there was no need for them when 57th Street was always very residential. There was, you know, a big artist, studio presence. This one was when trying example, this era and the canopies are contextual to LA to 57th Street. So this is why historically, I think it's so key appropriate, and you know why I do not feel that we should object on principle because it is historically be sexual. Other comments. Are there any diverging views? Maybe on other elements, do we have any issues with the work being proposed to the rear of the building? The remapping of the Yo 13 and 14-story is not something that we feel is appropriate. Contextual. What about the balconies? The questions and comments raised by members of the public or valid it will diminish the amount of light that gets into the building. This is something that should we be concerned with this I'm. Just you know, raising those points. You know I'm not professing a particular position, but I want to see if any of those areas- or you know areas of concern or for the committee anyways the hands. Any comments by members of the committee, yeah Suzanna go ahead. I do not I do not necessarily have I mean I, find it overwhelming and I know that the they addressed. How much will be seen from the street there to do obviously they're taking out a lot of the historic you know, windows and so forth. That are you know where their fire escapes and things like that. The traditional look of the area on certainly with an improvement, but it's a it is it is quite massive and as a resident in the area, I always wonder. You know I'm pleased that you're not going to be able to see that, but it is I do question those changes in terms of the but I'm sure they've thought through how to make sure that there's adequate lighting and at the back of the building with the brickwork and everything will not really look at all what it was, and it's never I suppose looked that much like it did on the facade of the building, which is so revered. I also live in this neighborhood I walked by here a million times I'm so happy not running to that Handrail myself, Karen I've done that many times at that grocery store and I'm so thrilled with the cornice I love. All these things, I will go back to the color on a huge dark grey fan, but I do feel like West 57Th Street has become like the dark gray, building, color of choice and the Viceroy there's so much dark and black and crispness to West 57, so I would say: that's the only thing that I do not love, but I do love dark gray, but I just feel like it's kind of being overdone in the area. Just a note does not matter I'm just saying, but the back is, that is pretty daunting. I'd have to say and I'm just pleased that we do not really see it from the neighborhood, because some of the joy of looking out of some of these buildings and walking by them is to see the back of them. Yeah I mean it is an extensive alteration to the to a secondary facade that is not seen from you know any thoroughfare, but nonetheless, you know the whole building is historic and the whole building is designated. You know it's one of those areas where you know I, think that we will all agree that there's no, you know particularly significant architectural element on this, these secondary facades. We just want to make sure that we're not setting a precedent when you know maybe there would be a little more significance on an applicant. You know on a building where an applicant would propose to remove so much fabric that you know we do not want to be caught in the situation where we would have approved and supported removal of historic fabric, and we do not want that to come in contest. So you know maybe there's some language that we can introduce in the resolution. Saying that you know we have. We are convinced we have been convinced by the applicant that there is really no significant architectural or historic elements to these facades, and this is why we can consider the alteration other comments by members of the committee raised: hands. Okay, seeing none. We need a motion Karen. That was your application. You want to make a motion. Yes motion to pass. We needed seconds: okay, I, second, okay, great second I! Would like to suggest that the language of our resolution specifically mentions that we favor a anchoring into the sidewalk for a canopy that, although the cornice is technically not in front of us, because it's going to be a staff approval that who really insists that the cornice is replaced in kind, which is the only thing that the staff would be allowed to approve anyway. But you know we just want to make sure and mentioning that we have been presented with enough evidence that the secondary facades that are going to be altered contain really no architectural element or historic elements, and that this is why we can consider and support this alteration. So that could be the motion to approve, and we will take this to a vote. Let's start with Tony, yes, Barbara I did not hear that so I can't okay, I Karen. Yes, thank you! Chuck! Yes, Lucas! Yes, damn yes! Renee! Today! Yes, Mike! Yes, Richard! Yes, Oh Suzanne! Yes, even in dark gray! Yes, Nick! Yes, John! Yes, Laura! Yes, Sarah! Yes, James! Yes, buzz- Buzz, Leila, Emma! Yes buzz! Are you still with us, looks like Sam? You come here me: hello, yeah, okay, sorry, yes, okay, Thank, You, buzz! The motion passes unanimously. One abstention. Thank you very much to the applicant and we're moving on to 595 building. This is an application for ground floor into your Lobby and door project. This was assigned to Nick Germer, as I said, for the other applications we're going to go directly into presentation, but we will certainly reach out to Nick for any insights. As he looked at this proposal closely. Do we have the applicant for 595 Madison with us, and are you ready to share your presentation with us all right? Yes, can you guys hear me absolutely okay? So let me try to get this on screen so bear with me one second, thank you. Okay and everyone and everyone see yeah. We can. We can see your screen can't see my screen. Yes, we can I'm. Sorry, but I said you guys, see the presentation front with the full of building, because sometimes I do not see it on my screen and I apologize for that. Oh all, right! Thank you! So, just a quick introduction: my name is Simon from Spectre group on behalf of the landlord we're not a Realty Trust. The project that I'm going to discuss today is the fall of building the interior lobby, we're looking to replace a door for this project. The building is located here on 595 Madison, it's on 37th in Madison, I. Think it's between even 57 here are some historical photos of the building back in 1929. I. Do not think much has changed to the building since then, but we are not doing absolutely no work to the exterior facade of the building at all on the main focus on this will be. The interior of existing Lobby. Here are some photos of the building, as it is today again. It's the main entrance I think is on the 57th street side, all right, so just to kind of give you guys an understanding ease the scope of work on what we're looking to do is. If you look at the plan, tag number one there's an existing Dumbledore that swings into a retail space as it is today. What we're looking to do is to swing the doors out into the lobby. I'm. Sorry, can you point with your cursor the area that you're referring to right here, where it's circled right here? This is the door that will we're looking to replace at this moment again the existing doors swing into our existing retail space. What we're looking to do is to swing the doors out and also replace the double doors into a single. Why are we doing this? If you can look at the plan, if you notice that there is a metal tenant in the space, the previous tenant, that used to occupy the space occupied the entire right side of that building so being used to occupy the previous tenant occupied, a B and C, and since then the landlord has currently divided the space into three space with the second or the middle space, already kind of leased out to a future tenant they're, actually looking to start construction in the near future. So with that, based on the building code, the now the Egress B has become an issue for this particular space. Before when was one large space, there were four means of egress out the door and they were spaced properly, where it would not require any additional egress. With that new subdivided space, it requires a second means of egress and the two existing doors that you see here do not meet the egress requirement. So therefore, the door in the back will serve as a second means of egress and again one before when there was one full space. That second means was not required. So that's the reason for that with that also foot. So the reason why we're looking to change the double doors into a single door mainly is because we see an issue with the with the swing of the door, with the what we'll call Stairwell B, so the stair will be doors swing out and at this current position, if there were a double door, it would actually inflict with the double door swing. So what we're looking to do is only have one swing and look to avoid that event, that these two doors would eventually clash with the other door that we're looking to swing out. So what does a lot lobby look like today? So this is just you know, existing images of the lobby. Nothing has ever changed, I think my understanding within the lobby, the marble of the brass, finish old, landmark and original to the data that the landlord had purchased it. That's this view here. The second view is the you know, a closer of view of those double doors with you know the beautiful transom, big boss, acrosss the glass and then on the right side. This is an image of the doors from the retail side, so you can see that there's different Hardware and how it functions just kind of ghosts. Go back really quick, so you're, looking at it from this view here, looking out here, the doors on the inside of the retail space- and here are just some shots of some of the features of that existing door in place. So what are we looking to do here again, the existing double doors, five feet and width as it stands today they swing out. The hardware is a whole hope, all I'm. Sorry, a push bar and they're both currently two foot, six because it exists, opening is only five feet now. What we're looking to do is we're trying to leave as much of the existing architecture of it in place without and do its minimal amount of work as possible. So what we're looking to do again, we're looking to swing the door, the other way, if, where the hardware has to change, but we're going to reuse all the hardware that we can, there would be two side lights. It would be two new bronze on side lights, but the existing frame and the transom above will remain you're, not going to touch that, and you know as long as we as long as I'm. You do not need to the other part of this now to make it more ad to make it a be a compliant the door. What was used to be two foot six doors. Two of them is now a three foot door to meet. Ada compliance is a little bit heavier, so we do need to install a new ad, a actually button that once fast, obviously the door will swing out. We've looked at this a couple ways we looked at possibly putting in the marble we looked at I mean possibly like a stand, but we went away from all that just so that we can leave the architecture in its place and not do anything and really try to do as minimal as a mammal at work as we can again, with the height of the doors. All remain the same, oh and I know, maybe you guys have asked. Maybe we are thinking if we could reuse the doors. Unfortunately, when we're thinking about that, we would love to do that, but they're only two foot, six doors. Now you have three foot this one is a new 3/4, so a little more detail of the new door. Again, the it's going to be new glass, new metal frame with the swinging out and we're going to match the brass and every possible way we're going to use existing closer. So we're going to try to use that back of the original hardware again deep, transoms stays in place. This detail here, along the doors of the frame, we're going to maintain that we're going to use as much as we can if we can, but again, the width of it is not the same width as the current door, so we're going to match it as best as possible and we're going to use whatever pieces we can from this. Where possible, the hinges we're going to look to reuse the hinges the door pulls from this door, pull which now is on the other side facing the lobby side we're going to reuse all the door handles here. Unfortunately, on the other side, we can't reuse these all hardware, because the door is six inches bigger. We want to maintain that same elegance of the of the style, so that way, we're not making it any fatter. The glass will get a little bit wider, approximately 16, just because we're going to maintain that same width all around and now this is the inside view of the door. Now that we actually see the door swings differently. Therefore, this hardware will be ever so slightly larger, but it's going to match in every single detail that we can. So you know there was a question of you know: how does that impact the overall aesthetic of the space? So just to kind of give you guys a map of what the interior of the lobby looks today, so the doors that enter the building on the 57th street side, we will match it in every way. Note that these doors are actually three foot doors: they're, not small, like you, the ones that are in that were that we're talking about this one is just a view of the lobby doors again and then, as far as the stairways, the other doors within the space of the you know, the stairway see which is located here. This is an existing door. We're not touching that. But again, all the finishes will match. There's an electric closet here over here. That will obviously we're not touching here. This is an existing elevator lobby door. So every single one of these here is this elevator lobby door. You're, not touching those as well, and this is Stairwell B door. This is the existing board they're a little bit larger I, think I, believe they're 42 inches in width and they swing out and again one of the reasons why we are actually changing it from a double door, to a single door to avoid that conflict, whatever that you're swinging into that other door. So someone details here, you know this is just you know, cat elevations of what we're proposing to do. This is the actuator push button. Very. It's very slim I wanted to be quarters inch thick for height and it's going to be able to fit within that frame so that we are avoiding touching anything else within the architecture of the building. It's going to be part of the new side, light that we're building into, and this is just another profile of what we're looking to do you there and that's it all right. Thank you very much. We will start with questions from members of the committee. Yeah Tony go ahead. Thank You Leila I had a question. I do not think I'm clear about the material. The existing doors are bronze and the replacement door is going to be metal painted to match, and you explain it a little more I do not know it's not metal painted. It is going to be bronze. It's going to be this Oz material. Great I just did not see it on your schematic seni. Where thank you very much. Yes, sorry I would not ask a question, so these are eveness doors or will be people be accessing the space from the lobby as well. These are meant as egress doors when the intention is that they're not to be used as entrance into the new retail space. What you do not see here is the new tenant. What they're looking to do, they're actually going to you, know, build obviously we're not really privy through most of the information of the new tenant, that's moving in there, but they are going to build a new corridor right in front of it, so that they're not looking to do any. You know they do not see this board visually as well, and so it's only meant for egress and not as a main answer into building. You mean answers yeah. If that's the case, then why do you mean an actuator on the lobby side? It's just in case. We still want to make every door because, particularly it is a public space in the event that you know somebody does need to it. I need to go in there. It will be handicap accessible, they can be handicapped accessible without an actuator, though oh the door is too heavy. So there is I see that okay I understand. Okay, yeah. You know that day you usually require a weight restriction and because of the weight of the door, and now that we're growing it and to me it just makes it even heavier. Okay, you know. I know this is sort of off topic, but it would seem that it's the retail space on the far right might also have a egress issue, but I guess that's not what we're reviewing today. Oh actually, you know what it just misses. The kind of look at that just misses the square footage requirement. Oh okay, all right, because this is it is bigger and it just misses and that's something we you know. As the you know, building architect we did look at before. We did that, yes of dividing the space so currently a and C are not occupied, but B has a future tenant with the least already signed. So this is really the reason why we're doing all this we're making a code compliant if it were up to us, we obviously would not do anything. Thank you. Thank you. Next question from Laura. My question is actually similar to Barbara's, but I'm just going to ask it anyway, the actuator button to go into the tenants area, although it this is an egress door which is located next to the to the handle or close to the handle when the door swings open. If you use it as an entrance, is there enough space for the wheelchair to move or will it hit when the door opens to the lobby? Will it hit via the wheelchair, or is there enough room to move the wheelchair so that it can go into the oh yeah? Absolutely there there's more than a five- foot turning radius there, so you should have no problems with that. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Next question from Sam go ahead. Thank you. I'm just curious. The existing double doors that do not have the weight problem. Are they a DEA compliant currently Richard horizontal bars are a major part of the design. He's thought about the effects of losing that and have you thought about any ways? Well, I mean if you notice, you know what we did think about is that those I guess vertical I mean horizontal bars, is part of the architecture and, if part of the bill existing doors in the space has that so whether what side you're on you're going to see that door, those handlebars and we want to maintain that down, look whether it's on the push or the pull side view so and obviously because of the door swing, it changes its location. Does that answer your question? Actually you got me confused. Can you clarify what you mean by whichever way the door swings is where you'll have the element? Oh, the reason why we had to put this crash that a horizontal bar on the other side is because it now swings sure it swings out. So you want to push so that's the motion you wanted to do before when it was on this side. You want to push the door, you want to grab the door and push in so now. That's on the other side. That's why it has to push out and that's why it's on the other side of the door and the handles are switched as well. Ask a follow- up question: all the Richard may also have some, but are you saying that these design elements exist only on the push side of those doors in the existing other doors of the building, or are they on both sides? No, it's only on the push line, if you notice here this view, this is when it swings out. So this is the view here when you walk out you're pushing this and then on the way into the spaces when you're looking here, you're pulling them the bar. Does that make sense? So currently there is no. This horizontal bar does not exist inside the retail space right I have a photo of that some of the existing. This is the existing space. So this as it is today on the lobby side, this is the vert Horizonte bar on the inside of the retail space. Is the vertical Richard. Do you have any follow- up questions yeah, I guess my question was not about the functional reason for changing it. My question was about the aesthetic effect within the main lobby. Was that change that you thought about that? We thought about I think we definitely thought of the use of the handle more than the aesthetics, because it has both functions within the lobby that end, you know within the other locations of the door. Thank you, Karen. You have a question: go ahead: you're, muted, Karen! You need to unmute yourself. Okay, thank you for all the technical detail and information. My question is: I understand the power actuator, which triggers the motor to open the door. My question is that motor concealed in the floor or overhead. Typically, you see a closer and I wonder where that mechanism lives, that the actuator button triggers. So our intention is that it's going to be overhead and be able to push the door. You know as needed and the motor will be within the side light of the frame here. So the frame of it will be thick enough to house this a unit and it's only going to be less than two inches and it's going to wire and next to the closer okay. Those can get pretty chunky, they're like the size of a brick, if not a little bigger, I I'm, not questioning that you've technically worked it out. I just wanted to see. You know that you did think it through, because as long as it's not visible, you know concealed is ideal and they the door is thicker or the Jamb and Frame is all thicker to house it and keep it concealed. That's great. What we do not want to see is like something that looks retrofit. No okay, this element, this elevation shows you know we're showing you the it's. You know, although the picture looks like it's a little bit chunky, but it's only an inch and a half I'm sorry ancient 3/4 wide and it's for 3/4, yes, ma'am I'm, talking about the push- button, actuator I'm talking the motor that opens that operates the door. It's usually either a recessed floor closer or an overhead concealed closer or that's what I do not see. I'm, okay, I'm perfectly fine with the push one yeah we're looking to do an over overhead and it's going to be concealed. Can you actually elaborate where exactly a thing to be concealed up here in that fixed header? So it's above the I guess it's in the frame I'm just wondering like. If you have to thicken that up in order to house it, or is it wide enough that you can, you know open it up, install the motor and then encase it again in the brass or bronze panel like we're looking to conceal it? Can you actually put your cursor on the area where it would be? Okay, you could you can see a little bit. Leila I think that small horizontal line is probably often the arm which is flat and then the rest of the mechanism is in the header. Got it okay, great! Thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, I have a couple of questions. The first one is who was the previous tenant that had the entire space be honest? I do not know that space has been vacant for a while, my understanding, okay and who is the new tenant I'm, not sure if I can share that information to be honest, but there's a retail tenant. That's she I take in the middle space, okay, and is there a tenant lined up for the other retail spaces, not that I'm, aware of I'm sure that they are looking, but with you know, with the economy the way it is I'm sure it's a little bit of a hard sell right now then, have you given any consideration to the vertical lines and how their line where the transom the vertical lines you mean these. So you see the Indian. If you take a view of the existing window, the existing door I'm. Sorry, you see that the existing lines, the vertical lines on the transom, basically line up with the perimeter of the glazing, to be honest, know what we were looking to do. Obviously, I'll do the most the least amount of work. I do not think there is a way to align it aesthetically, where it's more appealing and to center at the door. We're not looking to do any work on the transom above. But how do you have you given any consideration to maybe widening the door or you know, keeping some sort of alignment with these vertical lines so that we did think about if we did something aligned and here at the door, if you notice is the entire opening is only five feet, so the door is three feet and then each satellite is only a foot. So to do what you're asking to do this door would grow significantly more heavier and that the Sai light would almost disappear and go away from that. So we would want to allow the most I guess, like last as much as possible. Okay, all right! Now any more questions from members of the committee. Okay, seeing none I will move to members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments from members of the okay? So seeing none? Let's move to a business session. We need comments from members of the committee. How do we feel about this application? Raise your hands so I know you want to speak yeah I'm sure that this is a be terribly helpful, but I'm going to say it anyway. The only reason that the applicant is actually here and the story's being changed to the ABA compliance, because the applicant wants to subdivide commercial spaces. So the only real beneficiary of the benefit to this application is for the applicant in order to maximize revenue, which obviously contributes to the company's problems. Given the company I'm aware that this applicants work for the president and his donations have all been about financial considerations, potentially rather than support from personal profit or the policies, but after four years, I kind of get the feeling that this can't be separated. We have a track record and we have track record from both the company, who makes an enormous number of donations to this administration and to its party. We have had to go through racism, science, denial, corruption and an attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act to midst of a pandemic, leaving millions of people without health care. So all of that is to say that, given that the sole purposes of this application is to increase the company's profits and those profits are being used publicly and directly to support this administration and the party I'm going to vote no and I'm going to vote no on principle, if there was a public benefit within this application, I would consider holding my nose, but, given that I can't see any I have to vote it. Okay, thank you for this comments and explaining the rationale. I see that Richard has his hand up Richard go ahead. The two things trouble me about those horizontal to me: I found find that main hallway stunning, as it and I think it loses a lot not just in changing the shape of the dimensions but also losing that horizontal bars and you know, to sort of drill down a little bit almost following Sam's comments, which are not about the global picture which I feel like I can't take into account. But it troubles me very much the answer. When asked about the alignment to the question that Laila you raised about the alignment, the answer that said, we want to do as little work as possible, and it feels to me as though, unlike a lot of the other applications, we see this was an attempt to do the least work possible and I think if we would lose, especially with the losing those horizontal elements. I think this would lose a lot of the beauty of that of that field. Okay, thank you just to clarify, given that were in business session and that the applicant has an opportunity to speak at this. At this point, I just want to clarify that the meaning of the applicants comment when he said want to do the least work possible meant we want to do. We want to be as unintrusive as possible. I do not think it was meant to mean you know we want to be negligent and do you know a slacking job by you know redoing the bare minimum, but the other comments you know very seriously and I think you're raising very important questions. I want to go to Nick. This was his application. He was assigned the year the review so Nick go ahead: okay, hello and then I'm hearing, two things- I'm hearing, horizontal and vertical so I think Lela raised the question of the vertical bars on top and Richard talked about the horizontal bar, so those are two different things that were discussed right. That's correct, okay, we're not mixing okay, I mean I. Think that, like to your point thanks for clarifying lela, because I do kind of respect that they tried to be as least intrusive as possible, I respect that they tried to incorporate some of the existing hardware and materials that they're going to continue to use frons material and not just paint some of the updates. A different color I think that when I look at this Lobby I mean there is a certainly a visual impact, but I look at these other the elevator Bank doors. I, look at the electric doors like those are the stunning elements of this building, and this Lobby and so I think this is a basic application and I would not have an issue supporting it. Okay, Thank You, Nick Barbara has her hanna- Barbera go ahead. Hi I can't appreciate you need to ask the additional eat less and certainly for the ad, a compliance which you know a thirty inch door would never comply for a DA. There is something that is sort of awkward in terms of the you know the view that we're looking from the lobby, which certainly is not the case in the original and I'm wondering you know, part of it, is I, think maybe the side lights are so small and, of course, it's a new element that is being introduced and I. Almost wonder. You know if it was looked at with not doing you know just having bronze on either side and not doing the side lights since that's really kind of a new vocabulary, elements as it were I mean it definitely does not enhance the lobby and I and I would not even say that it's neutral, on the other hand, I'm not like extremely offended by this, but I feel maybe it could be a little better yeah Thank You Barbara other comments on this application. Okay, seeing none I will oh yeah, someone raised there and Susanna hats is that I anything I mean I am very interested in all the comments that everyone is making and it's bringing me to this thought around the aesthetic of it. Of course, this is such a stunning Lobby. So any changes contextually are, you know definite, you know and that if they, if you know anyone in a wheelchair or having to get into the building, I, do not know what other opportunities there are to address that in this building, and so it may just be necessary. But I was a little bit concerned about two things. One is when they were talking about. I, think they've done their due diligence and clearly or trying to maintain as much as the aesthetic and the contextual nature of all the decorative elements of the stores that make them so beautiful, but they were, but I only heard that they were going to try to hang on to, for example, the details they were going to try to mask. You know this mechanism, which I would like to have seen more details on I thought. Karen brought up a good point, you know I guess sometimes, when I hear from an applicant that they're going to try to do this and they're going to they're, they can conceal that. But I do not I'd like to know more of an assurance of that. That's all I want to say Richard. Has this Hannah Pritchard go ahead, yeah my I just wanted. My inclination is to vote. No, you know primarily realization and the thing that Barbara destroyed up I believe is Barbara around the trying to I would prefer to see them go back and try to address some of these issues and come back to us, but I'd like to hear from other folks with more experience if they think maybe I'm good walking up the wrong way. This kind of Jamesgu I had I guess Sam kind of made me at first I thought. You know it's relatively straightforward need 488, but if this is you know, is it is it necessary in as done as well as it could be done? Is there another path forward instead of like kind of taking away something that is a beautiful interior landmark? Is there another way to do this? For example, I think when people raise the issue again of the motor was there another way that the previous doors could have been motorized? Is there a way that this could have been done? That maybe is not the path of least resistance in terms of finances, but the way to do the best treatment of such a landmark? So I'm very conflicted. Do you honest with you yep and I'm, also kind of looking at the vertical bars and I still think, there's like symmetrical elements to it. I mean the two ones in the middle are striking down the center of the middle door and the two bars on the left and right hand. Side are striking down the middle I mean it's not like perfectly aligns of the edge of the door like in the original, but I still look at this as symmetrical and then I think with a Lobby that this that's this grand doing something as least intrusive as possible is would have more of a respects to the lobby then trying to play around with the statics. That would not make sense for a TA what it makes sense for a user who needs to operate the door yeah it is you know it's one of those really. You know small scope of work, types of applications that have actually much broader implications, so I think we're having the right conversation any other comments and thoughts that have maybe not yet been expressed on this on this application. Okay, so seeing none, you know a few things that I would like to say the first one is we have very few interior landmarks and we consider and treat them, as you know, with the absolute utmost care where basically are sort of default position and LPC's default position is, do not touch it. Just do not do anything to it, do not alter it, avoid it at all cost. This is the preferred path for dealing with any particular issue. If you have to, then you have to do it in the most mindful- and you know, precise and elegant and respectful way, so I also personally struggle with this I. Think that you know, we understand that you know commercial retail space needs to have some flexibility, but does the space that has operated as one large space can continue to operate as such? Is there an absolute imperative need to subdivide that then triggers this need for additional egress? It looks like it can be subdivided in two spaces rather than three, and if it were to remain true spaces, then the existing other means of egress on the outer perimeter would eliminate the need for this alteration, so I struggle with that I'm, not sure I have the right. You know answer and I really struggle. Also with you know the removal of so elements, the horizontal bar. Although I understand that you know it's, its function is preserved where it's meant to be, but its design element is removed from where it is hysterically important. You know to carry on this horizontal line that you know runs through the entire Lobby, so I struggle with that I would be inclined to go with denial with conditions underlying you know. Other proto concerns that we have with this particular application. Buzz has his hand up Buzz go ahead. Buzz you're, muted, perhaps is completely impractical, but with any thought given to making the existing two double doors open out. That would eliminate the blockage problem. This is not because code requires that the door swings are certain way and it needs to swing into the light so that the way into the lobby right now they right now they swing in and the new design swings out. Would there be any way to make the existing doors swing out? So you would not disturb the vertical lines. You would not change the symmetry of the lobby, which has not been mentioned, the doors at the other end of the lobby. No basically code requires that the door operate. The way the applicant is proposing the doors to operates, I'm, saying the same way to operate out just like the just like the modification. The modification has the door opening out right. What about reversing these doors to make them both open out into the lobby, and that way you preserve the verticality conflict with the adjacent double doors that need to I believe a fire command or a electrical panel? Yes, that, but these doors are narrower, they do not. They would not swing that far. They would not be as wide the door to the right. Yes, the proposed door. These are double doors and be swing into the lobby. Yes, but the existing door is narrower and would there still be an interference I'm just asking what the question of the applicant the narrowness is, the issue the narrowness meets it non- compliant with code, yes, but both of them open that would be compliant with code. You've seen you've seen the double you've seen automatic doors were both open yeah. That's what I was the right door. Would then conflict with the electrical panel door. Mana? Can I interject I think buzz brings up in it. I think brings up an interesting point. If both doors were to be on automatic operators and open together, it would be 88 compliant. That's what I'm saying and that would alleviate a lot of people's concerns, I'm hearing about poles and hardware and sidelights and original fabric, the conflict with the I guess, if that's the fire command station I do not know it might be worth drilling into, because that's a temporary use like that's, not a permanent passage or circulation. There's no occupancy in that room beyond it's just a piece of equipment behind that door correct! Well, it needs to be in case of an emergency. Everything has to be compliant. Okay. If there is a fire, the fire department needs to be able to sit in front of this electrical panel or fire control fire station whatever it is, that is behind these doors. That needs to be. You know, operable and accessible and therefore would get in the way of the swinging doors that would swing into the these doors in which the fire brigade would be sending yeah. No I appreciate that, but it looks like if you could zoom in on the plan, are those double doors to a stairwell I'm? Not it's not clear where the fire command station is to me from looking at the plan. I do not know that we get. We really need to get hung up too much on that. We are in comments not really in question anymore, like revisiting. This entire aspect is not something that is appropriate so far into discussing this proposal. My comment is: why can't my comment? Is it impossible to make the two doors swinging in the opposite direction? I just like to hear what the applicant is. I would say that this is a question, so we can in certainly phrase it as a comment such as we encourage the applicant to look at other ways to you know deal with this issue, but we are way too far in to assessing this matter, to really revisit you know at the granular level how we can make it better. So let's go back to comments. Do we have any more comments from members of the committee? Okay, so seeing none? We need to formulate your position if I hear correctly. We none of us are really enamored with this application, so some of us feel neutral and feel that you know it's not terribly offensive and they could live with it. Others have issues with lack of symmetry, removal of historic elements, normally the removal of history elements, but the design elements, and some have issues with the broader reasoning for this particular application. So we need to figure out how we express all these views into a you know, coherent position that will be the board's position. So I need to hear some thoughts, Sam, maybe Yo. Do you have some thoughts on how to approach that and Barbara? You had some interesting comments on how to express these concerns that we have Nick is raising here, said: Nick go ahead, hey yeah! So did we want to just pull the group to see how much of the neutral folks are out are on the committee and then, if there's, if there's more of a concern about some of the historical fabric being altered, the design elements that you mentioned, then we will move to the move to the proposed resolution of deny and less okay, but that would make sense so Barbara, you have your hand up, tell us what your thoughts are. I'm, not exactly you know not that will worst in terms of how it should be phrased in the resolution, but I would encourage the applicant to go back and to provide some further study. I mean we've done this before in terms of what other options that you know based on our comments, they could come back to you know with somewhat more sensitive treatment or even for us to understand that they've explored other options and I think also. Some other members of the committee are looking for a greater level of detail. You know in terms of the mechanism and exactly how things fit, so you know I would encourage you know this denying less. You know we, you know we saw some further study on the on the part of the applicant to because I think your point is well- taken or very few interior landmarks in the city of New York, and we and like I, said I fully appreciate the functional reasons for doing this, but I just think that it's you know once it's in place, that's it and you altered that interior landmark forever and so I just I think it's completely appropriate to ask for some further refinement. The committee John go ahead. If you want to tell us sort of like where you would fall on a sort of denial, unless the applicant, you know, brings a more sympathetic design or another position, I'm going to be on to deny the less side of this. For the many reasons that have already been stated. However, I would liken that deny unless an inclusion of some reference to the issues that Buzz and Karen rates, because I think if we are going to deny, unless you know we would like for the applicant to come back, you know with some creative ways and I think at least in my mind. They are curious about this double core concept to normally I'm very Pro ad a and that trumps, everything else no pun intended, but in this particular case in I laughs, but I would like to have some tip of the hat to what Karen and Buzzard Mansion. Okay, other members of the committee. Do we have anyone who objects to a denial unless a more sympathetic design is produced? Any objection to that I mean to me going back to my original comments and again I. They stand and I'm going to vote no on principle. I. Do wonder whether we're talking about a sympathetic deny unless a more sympathetic view of this is done versus? Why are we doing this? We taking away my feeling about the out looking for themselves and where they use their money or what they stand for. I, you is there a general feeling that we need to be providing a commercial tenant in a landmark building in a landmark interior, the ability to subdivide their spaces for one tenant rather than three tenants, but for one tenant with no further ability to know what the other two tenants, if they will ever be two tenants in those phases and I feel like it's hard because, as everyone has pointed out, this gets done once it does not get done again and I wonder whether it's a deny, unless they do a more sympathetic work on this or is it a deny, because we do not see the need for this to occur and that's a question? Okay, so let let's do a little pulling? Is there any strong objection to a straight denial of this application? Yeah I object to that I think it would be imposing a little bit of a hardship to say because your alum Mark Anterior, you do not have the right to commercially. You know. Retail commercial gets changed so much in Manhattan. All of the time we see so much of our storefronts lost, but to not be able to subdivide. You know it's your business, you own, a building to lease it out. You leased, retail, you lease the commercial office spaces I, think that would create a hardship to say, because you are a landmark, you can not subdivide to meet the market. I do not know I, think that's a little harsh little unfair. So could we formulate a position that would be we that this space would not be subdivided and therefore there would be no need for your any change, but we understand that you know it would be a hardship and we want a better design. Ok, can we imagine a resolution that would basically be saying those two things, because I think that you know both positions are very valid. If you take, you know the Four Seasons restaurant, would we consider making alterations to the Four Seasons restaurant so that they could use the you know the lower floor and the upper floor separately? I mean they have every right to do it, but it would be so offensive to the space, because the spaces is one space. So I think that in many instances we would actually have a very strong reaction to that. Once again, we have very few of these interior landmark spaces. They had to be deemed so exceptional and special to rise to the level of interior, landmarking. I think that we also want to be mindful of our business community and we want to support our business community, so maybe there's a way to craft a resolution that would be basically saying both at a really. We would much prefer that this space is not subdivided and there is no need for this application to even come to us, but given that you know we understand that it is a reality. These are the comments on substance that we want to make. We would that, would that be something acceptable for the committee Nick go ahead. Yeah I mean I, think I with the context of the rarity of interior designations, like I, think I'm kind of changing my position a little bit too and leaning more towards like come back with a better application that respects the interior designation of this building, and you know it's not our place to tell them what to change or how to do it, but basically, there's probably other opportunities to have an application that does respect I mean basically there's a line of you know. Okay, businesses have to change. Buildings do have to change the time, a DA with environmental regulations with anything, and the question is going to be: how much did they alter like? What's the level of effects and did they do that in an appropriate way? Was their intention appropriate and I? Think that, like if I'm looking at that line, I think they tried to do as little alteration as possible, but ice, but I still would not completely reject the idea of saying hey. Let's deny and come back with other ideas. Okay, I changed go ahead, I've definitely moved into the deny and come back with a better idea, because this is an interior landmark and if they wanted to subdivide it six more times, we can't always accommodate six more new entries or exits 488 compliance I just feel that they did not do enough and I think we have to preserve the interior landmarks that we have. Okay, all right, so it looks like we are leaning towards a. We do not like the subdivision that drives the rationale for this alteration, and if we have to comment on the substance, we would like a better design which is sort of saying you know like stating both positions. You know I think it's also important, given that LTC may you know very well consider this alteration, it's important that we tell them how we feel about it, so that you know this is on record and you know, hopefully your LPC will take it into account, so I'm going to make a motion to deny this application, while also making a specific comments about the proposed design and why we believe this design is not sympathetic, including the removal of the horizontal bar in the Interior Ma, be the lack of symmetry and the lack of details on a number of elements, including the opening mechanism. The vagueness on the replication of some of the other hardware, where the applicants stated that they intend to, but we would like a firm commitment and I think that and also exploring the ability to rework the operation of the door force that may actually swing in a way that is compatible with the code. So that could be the motion. So that's the motion that I'm making and we need a second okay and I- see that Sam has his hand up so Sam Jake I just want to say that if the motion is a denial with the further discussion, I am comfortable voting in favor with that resolution and we're taking the opportunity to specifically comment on what was presented on the design, and we have a second on that. So we're going to take a vote. Yes, Barbara. Yes, Karen, yes, Janet, yes, Rene canceled, yeah, yes, mice, yes, Richard! Yes, Suzanne! Yes, Nick, yes, Sara! Yes, James, yes, buzz! Yes and Laila I mean yes, okay. So the motion to deny carries. Thank you very much. Thank you to the applicant and thank you to members of the committee for a well thought discussion. It's always really important that you know we pay close attention to what is in front of us and that we give the your care and consideration to our landmarks. Thank you so much to the final applicant. It is the D- O- T, that is with us, or a presentation on proposal for safety enhancement at Central, Park, South and Grand Army Plaza. Thank you so much for your patience. I know it's a long meeting. We appreciate that we, that you're with us and for the opportunity to review your application this was assigned to Janet but like for the other applications, were going to go straight to presentation. I want to just preface that by saying that this was presented to the transportation Environment Committee last Monday, so they did look at it on the transportation angle, which is really the bulk and the core of what this proposal is about. But given that the Central Park is a scenic landmark and that Grand Army Plaza has some landmark elements, we felt it was important that the young walks committee also has an opportunity to weigh in so very much appreciate it. Thank you very much for responding to our invitation and go ahead. If you want to share your screen and walk us through the sure hey. So thanks for having us, this is kimberly. Rancourt from Manhattan borough, Commissioner's, Office, I'm joined by my colleagues, everyone hear me sorry, it's always very doing this. Yes yeah. We can hear you Colleen Cheddar goon from the borough office as well, and then by Tara. Is she whose structure of pedestrian unit and me and Muffet who's the project manager on this project and as Lela mentioned, we did present this last week to the Transportation Committee, as we typically do with all of our safety improvements and pedestrian improvements. We were asked to come tonight and give a overview of what we're planning to install in this area, so just to clarify, we see this as an application so on to the others, but we are happy to be here and to share our proposal and to hear your feedback. Thank you walk us through the presentation. Hi is Nia. Moffitt and I am a senior project manager and that pedestrian unit I do and I'm going to walk you guys through our proposal for Central Park, South granary, Plaza, Fifth, Avenue, sorry, okay, first I'm going to go through the existing conditions in the area. Looking at the pedestrian boarding area at the East Drive Haxed- and it was designed to go in the center of the roadway here- and the current operations are seeing that the carriage operators are really standing in the moving lane to load and unload from the carriages and last year when this was put in, we did not pana. We only markings were installed here. Sorry at the 6Th Avenue hexed and all of the markings were removed at 7Th Avenue. We installed the hex and on the east side of the roadway, but the operations required to be on the west side of the roadway which you can see here in the photo. The carriages are actually standing on the opposite side of the street and in 2012 D-, O- T remarked the drives in such a park and at all of the crossings installed. These you know painted pedestrian areas to help shorten the pedestrian crossing distances on the drives. Looking at Central, Park, South and Fifth Avenue, so 59th Street, Central, Park South is one way east of Fifth Avenue, but it operates in a two way: operation west of Fifth Avenue the right- hand turn here from Fifth Avenue on to 59th Street is redundant as traffic from 4Th Avenue is routed around Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue, one block ahead: the hack stand. Relocation happened in 2019, created some underutilized space on the north curve here of Grand Army Plaza in between Fifth Avenue and Angra, and Army Plaza, and looking at where the horse only land was installed. On the north, curb of Central Park South, there's frequently a cars and buses blocking this Lane and that Lane runs him all the way from Grand Army Plaza to 6th Avenue, bringing it down to 58th Street. There is a CitiBike station acrosss the street from the Plaza Hotel, and this really restricts pedestrian movement in the area and there's frequently double turbo parked cars. Here in the roadway, along the edge of this space, there is a missing crosswalk on the east side of the intersection here: 58th Street and Grand Army Plaza and there's also underutilized space here on the North turbot, a street in between Barnard Plaza and Fifth Avenue, which is signed to know cine anytime I'm, going to go through our proposal for these areas. This is an overview of our toolkit, which are the you know, the resources that we have at D- O- T. In order to quickly make safety changes on the streets in New, York City, we use striping, it's thermoplastic markings, we use flexible posts on the edge of our pedestrian spaces and we install this Ruby glass material. Hopefully you guys are familiar with these things. Is we have them all over the streets of New, York City and we also use granite blocks in order to protect these pedestrian spaces from vehicles. Looking at the East Drive hack stand, our proposal is to relocate the hack stand to be along this median here, which greatly you know, formalizes the way that this area is currently operating. We're also going to be of selling a curb extension on the southwest corner of 6Th Street and Grand Army Plaza at Fifth Avenue. Looking at the 6th Avenue Hawk stand we're going to be installing thermoplastic markings here to put in the edge line of the hawk stand and also going to be installing a bike lane here at the entrance to the park and a large pedestrian curb extension here in order to help create a gateway entrance to the park here on Central Park South at 6th Avenue at 7Th Avenue we're going to be installing some additional painted pedestrian space on the drive here adjacent to where there's already existing pedestrian spaces, and this is going to help stop the carriages from like backing up into this crosswalk, and it will also help to shorten the Pedestrian Crossing distance this year. We're going to formalize and paint this pedestrian space on the east side of the Drive, which will help give pedestrian access into the park here away from where the Hawks stand is now located on the west side of the drive and install curb extensions here at the 7th entrance on Central Park. South in order to create a gateway entrance to the park here and also certain pedestrian crossings in calm traffic. Looking at Central, Park, South and 59Th Street, our proposal is to convert 59th Street to a one- way bound operation from 5th Avenue to granary, Plaza, and this conversion really helps us to increase pedestrian safety in the area and also reclaim some of the roadway for pedestrians. Here we can install a 20 foot wide, curb extension. After doing this conversion and Central Park Conservancy will be partnering with us to maintain this space. Looking at Central Park South from Grand Army Plaza to 6th Avenue we're going to be widening the horse only Lane here on the North curb which currently it's eight foot configuration, does not allow us to put up flexible posts on edge to protect it from illegal parking, because we need to make it at least 11 feet wide in order to allow for street sweepers. So this widening of the space allows us to add the flexible posts that stop vehicles from driving and working on this thing. Looking at 58Th Street and Grand Army Plaza, we are going to be to expand the pedestrian space here around the city by station in order to help provide some more pedestrian space in the area and stop the illegal parking. Why we're going to install this missing crosswalk here at 58Th, Street and Grand Army Plaza we're going to install this curb extension here in Central, Park, south and Grand Army Plaza, and install a full curb extension here on the north, curb of 50th Street and between Graner Plaza on Fifth, Avenue and Central Park Conservancy is partnering to maintain all of these spaces here as well. Looking at the materials for what we are installing here, Grand Army Plaza is a designated scenic landmark. All existing materials in the area will remain we're not doing any removals or changing any of the existing materials. All of the we're just installing thermoplastics and Ruby glass- and these are the same as already used on the Central Park- drives here and are used on city streets all over. So that is the end of our presentation and it will take comments all right. Thank you very much. Do we have any questions from members of the committee any questions regarding this proposal? Okay, so I would say a few things. The first one is that the OT, because it is a city agency- is not subject to the same review process. So that's why it is not an application. Nonetheless, you know it is alteration to scenic landmark, so I thought it was important that we have a chance to look at it and you know make comments if we feel that it is, it is appropriate. I see that Suzanne has her hand up Suzanne. Do you have a question yeah she's on go ahead, you're, muted, you need to unmute yourself, yeah I. Did it's tricky so I, yes, I, you're, right, Leila I was not sure what we were able to vape on and not vote, and this is very interesting. This is this, is my neighborhood and I walked through this a lot I just wanted to ask them a little bit about the thermoplastic markings a little bit just to sort of where those are going in and I suppose. My may be elaborate on the those of us who live on the West side, and you know more and more, it's so difficult to be moving over if you live in the 50s to get over to the east side, and so with 55th blocked and with the parking issues that we have I'm just curious about the flow of traffic from people trying to get from the West side to the east side, with this it's exciting to see, but also with this taking the area and making it really a pedestrian zone. So Suzanne I'm being to interrupt you, we are going to look only at landmarks trick. Questions or intrinsic questions should have been asked at the at the time of the TNT meeting, which you know and I know that we can't attend all the yoga community meetings. Marsha yeah, but you know, for the sake of you know, meaningly focused. Do tea. Has already addressed number of those transportation and transit questions, so I'm going to ask that activity and to all committee members to really stick to landmark specific questions so I do not know if you have a question about. Do the thermoplastic so yeah, because is it's basically those big white markings that are very standard? Pretty much you know around the world they are, they do exist in Settle park all over, so it is on a new element, but you know that they're going to be introduced in specific locations to address the relocation of the haxed and so I do not know what exactly the? What is the specificity of your question on this material? Nothing really I, just the addition of those is just sort of thinking evident on an aesthetic standpoint, but I'll just stop I do not have any more questions now. Thank you any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, so the second I actually have a question in terms of the applications that we see for Central Park. They usually come from the Central Park Conservancy and they usually have you know this level of you know detail and you know specific historic materials that they bring to us. It looks like you you're, using your the tools that are in the D- O- T toolbox and I'm, just wondering if you have considered partnering with the Conservancy to actually give maybe a you know a more specific and you know Central Park, specific treatment to these areas that you're proposing to alter I do not know if Mia you want to add to that, but I think in general, for safety and for helping to people to sort of really understand how streets work here at the city, it's helpful to have these types of treatments be as consistent as possible. We do work with Lucy, obviously when we're in the park, and we do review our plans with them and then I think you know if there were to be sort of longer term changes that are not just standard markings, then we would work with them more closely and potentially like designs for that. I do not know if that helps sense. With a question or if Tara or yeah, you have anything to add yeah if any of these painted spaces are in the future built out, Central, Park Conservancy would obviously like take historic materials into consideration and I. Think like there's this there's like a corner here that it was kind of done like in some like historic materials like on the east corner. So if they wanted to like expand that out to here, you know they would probably come back to you with like a bigger proposal. So let me backtrack-. Is there going to be a Phase three, not currently? Okay? So basically, this is the what is going to be the more permanent treatment. Road side, walk, drive, treatment for this area, given the relocation of the Hat until the Central Park Conservancy comes back to these in a more permanent fashion, but the department transportation does not have plans currently to build these out any differently than how we're installing them is Colleen. Oh hi Lyla, its Colleen I, just wanted to say a typical project and like many projects that we do and work with stakeholders, we always have to follow with a manual and uniform traffic control devices for streets and highways. So that's like our Bible when it comes to looking and making safety projects on the streets. So I'll just add that just to add to what Mia said, any further changes here would be initiated by the Central Park Conservancy to do a permanent build- out of these locations. Okay, all right, any other questions from members of the committee. I have a couple more, but I want to make sure that I'm not ignoring members of the committee. If they have any more questions. Okay, seeing none have you consulted with the carriage drivers and have they expressed any views on these proposed changes. Oh yeah, we worked with them and we've been talking with them for the last year and a half and a lot of these changes were made because of discussions with them. Okay, all right! Thank you. I do not have any further questions. Members of the committee any more questions on your end. Okay, so seeing none I want to move to members of the public. Do we have any questions or comments from members of the public? Okay, I see none. Let's move back to business session, so members of the committee, if you're still with me, I, feel a little lonely. Are you still so we can basically do two things. We can take stock of the presentation that was given to us, but not make any recommendations or we can decide to make a recommendation. The recommendation can be a recommendation of support. We can express concerns if we have any and we can make suggestions. My inclination I, given the you, know the sort of like history. In the background of this project phase one was done without any consultation of the Community Board and no notification actually of what was being done so at the time in 2000 I believe it was in 2019. We actually sent a letter to duty expressing or concerned that work was being done without any consultations. So we're really pleased that you know for phase 2 DoD came to us. So the question now is: do we want to say something about this proposal? Do we want to say that we wish that our DoD had would team up with the Conservancy so that the treatment would be maybe a little more specific to Central Park, or do we consider that what is being proposed, as is fine and good enough, and we'll wait for the Conservancy to kick in whenever they feel like season I like what you suggested I'm, not as familiar with this. So this the presentation went very fast for me and was a little bit confusing and so I like what you just suggested very much well I would I would agree with that. Okay, so we would basically ask for the year the Conservancy to team up with the Central Park Conservancy, so that the treatment would be done in a more central park, specific and maybe more historically appropriate way. Yes, okay, I need other thoughts from other members of the committee right I'm going to be calling upon you buzz. Do you have any thoughts? I do not know. Buzz is still with us. Genet yeah Genet go ahead. Genet! Oh well, no Janet go ahead, no he's very concerned when you some of the background with me specifically that we expressed inquiries that were going to work and we were left out of the process. I think a statement needs to be made that that's not the way it's supposed to work and without ruffling, too many feathers, I think that's worth restating yeah. So we could draft a resolution that would summarize our initial interaction and encouraging for a more permanent and elegant design. For this face. To that you know, I think the Tne Committee expressed the support and I think that you know on a transportation standpoint. It is going to be a vast safety improvement. I think it is fair to say that it could be done in a more historic and you know, aesthetically pleasing fashion. Central Park is quite the year the gem of New York, and it would be great if the oh, the Conservancy, could you know team up with D- O- T for something a little more elegant, any other thoughts and comments. Susanna I am going to come back to you. I just want to see if any of the other members have some thoughts, any other thoughts. Guys I need to hear from you so that we can wrap up this meeting and we can all go back to our lives. Okay, Suzanne go ahead. I just was trying to also wrap this up and I really think that it is an excellent idea to engage the Conservancy on. This is a I'm in I. Think safety I'm in this area every single day, I understand a lot of what they're proposing but I think to integrate and bring in the Conservancy and bringing back would be. We would all just deeply appreciate it. It's just such an integral area and I feel like I need more information. Okay, all right! So Janet would you be? Do you want to make a motion that would be? You know, along the lines of restating a little bit of the history, thanking beauty for coming to us tonight and urging them to work with the Conservancy and the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a more refined final design of this proposal? Yes, with a little more information about the materials that are anticipated, yeah I mean they did show us what the materials are. It's basically the you know. The materials that or you know, do T approve do T does not have much ability. You know to go outside of the you know the elements that they can use so, which is why it is important that they team up with the Central Park Conservancy Mm-, hmm, that has the ability to and the resources to a you know, do the work and the research and the design and all that and be use materials that are different from you know. The set D ot materials that you t can use is everybody in agreement. Do I see any opposition to this position? Okay, so seeing none so that the motion we need a second on the motion, so we are taking this to a vote. So we understand it is not an application but which is taking the opportunity of this presentation to pass a resolution that will be sent to do t2 their landmark resolution, the Commission and to Central Park Conservancy, stating your position on the proposed work and we're going to start with buzz. Yes, thank you for being at my dinner table who's. Next James I did not hear you Thank You Sara, yes, Laura, yes, John, yes, Nick! Yes, Thank You, Suzanne, yes, Richard! Yes, Michael! Yes, Renee! Yes, Janet! Yes, Karen! Yes, Barbara, yes, Tony! Yes, all right! Lucas! I did not record your vote. Are you still with us? He is not with us. Okay, all right all right! Thank you very much to do T. We really hope that Central Park Conservancy can kick in promptly so that this proposal that this design can be a little bit enhanced, and on that note, thank you to all the video committee members and to all who stayed with us. So late apologies for a long meeting, but you know very much appreciated for all your work and on that the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. So much. Thank you later good night Kayla. Thank you. Everybody.
