My name is Leila Giziko I am the chair of the Landmarks committee of Manhattan community board five few words about how the meeting is going to proceed. We have two applications tonight. The applicant will be given an opportunity to give a full and uninterrupted presentation when this presentation concludes. Members of the committee will have an opportunity to ask questions once this question period concludes. I will move to a public session during the public session. I will open up the floor to members of the public, who will have an opportunity to ask questions and make comments. The applicant will be given the opportunity to respond to these questions and comments, and then we will move to business session during business session. Only members of the committee are allowed to speak and we will formulate our position. We will make comments and then we will make a motion. This motion will be taken to a vote and the vote by the committee will be forwarded to the full Board of Community Board 5 for their consideration and ratification. The full Board of Community Board 5 meets on December. The 9th and I see that Luke is shaking his head. Luke go ahead, say that again sorry, the 10th I think the 10th, so Thursday December the 10th. Please double check on the website for confirmation. The vote of the full board becomes the official position of community board five. Our decision is then forwarded to our recommendation is forwarded to the Landmarks, Preservation, Commission and other relevant agencies or elected officials. So tonight, as I said, we have two items on the agenda and we will start with no further delay with the first item, which is an application for a property at 18 east 50th street, and this is an application for a window replacement project. This is an individual, landmark and I think we have the applicants and you can go ahead and share your screen and go ahead with your presentation, introduce yourselves and go ahead. You have a floor for an uninterrupted presentation. Okay, good evening everybody. My name is Tom Feniman, I'm the architect for the owner on this project, and what we have here is a window replacement project for floors. Four through eleven. We have approval from landmarks. Just for your piece of information for a restorative project, on the facade which encompasses the entire street elevation and actually replicates some of the elements that are missing at the top in somewhat of a simplistic fashion, not as quite as decorative as it was originally, but there is a fair amount of restorative work happening on the facade, and this is a separate application before you. So I don't know if people are familiar. This is right, opposite on the south side from St Patrick's cathedral, a building done 1915 approximately in the gothic style. It currently has aluminum replacement windows that are pretty cheap windows. I mean you can see on the upper right hand. Side of this photo page. The existing windows that have a blanked out section at the top one here has the arch with again it's not really an arched window at all. It's kind of blanked off and the orientation of the false pain of the divisions are oriented horizontally, which is kind of contradictory to the gothic style and contradictory to what was there originally moving down just lower the rectangular formatted windows, which are the main bulk of the windows and the facade again, have that blanked out panel, where there's a drop ceiling behind there and the same orientation of those divided lights in a horizontal fashion. I guess we can move to the next page. So here we have the historic photograph which is fabulous. The elevation of the existing and I should add that the existing elevation that we're showing shows kind of what we're redoing at the top of the building. That's not how it exists now that the building was kind of truncated. Those two towers, even more so than what's shown on our drawing and I, should also add that the top floor. Those large ornamental windows at the top are not part of this application right now, they're a separate matter that we're still in the process of trying to sort out how to handle those best. So really what we're? Looking at the center windows from the 4th floor to the 11th floor, so the center drawing shows the existing condition that has those blanked out panels at the top and the horizontal orientation of the divided lights and the drawing on the far right is the proposed which tries to pick up on the language of what the original windows were, which again has them full height, divided lights, with a 12 over 12 configuration, which is what was matching the existing and we're also doing a arched top window in it's there's a blank out. If we go to the next page, I could show you the detail for the blanked out. This is the windows 4 through 10, which would have the square or the rectangular configuration again. What's on the left hand, side is what's existing and on the right-hand side is what's proposed and if we go to the next, drawing is at the top floor or sorry the 11th floor, where you have that arch top with kind of a rectangular window stuck into it. There is an area behind where we can actually put a rectangular window up taller behind the terracotta on the back side and then put a blanked out piece to mimic an arched window on the right-hand side and that's what we're proposing to give the effect of what was there originally the finish that we're looking for is going with a medium bronze which is similar to what was approved by landmarks through the storefront configuration that was done. A previous application that was approved where people were familiar with the New York Athletic Club, that was in there was kind of a rudimentary metal panel storefront, that's that has now been removed and that terra Cotta is being restored and there's a large monumental storefront going in there in a medium bronze finish and that the windows that we're putting in are proposing. Is that same finish, so with that I'll open it up for any questions or comments? Okay, thank you very much. Members of the committee. We have the floor for questions. Please use the raise hand function that should be at the bottom of your screen. If you have any questions for the applicant Renee, Cafaro Renee go ahead, yeah the other thing just said: bronze Finnish does he mean actual bronze or no that's, okay, yeah I just need to clarify that yes correct it's, a bronze painted or anodized bronze, okay, and can you actually clarify what is the material use? Is it it's aluminum? Okay, thank you. Barbara. You have your hand up go ahead, so you know looking at the image on the screen, which is the arched window. Opening but and I can see that you've dotted behind it. So it's going to be a rectangular window. How is that going to look on the inside I? Guess I. Don't quite understand it fully. So how would that look on the inside of the building I mean it's a blank. It's going to look like it'll, be a trimmed out. Rectangular opening and the little corner of that upper sash will have a blank piece of aluminum filling in to give the appearance of an arch on the inside correct yeah, yes, okay, this is I mean this is done actually even historically a lot of times. This is how it would have been done. You would not have had an arched sash necessarily at the top, but a lot of times. It is a rectangular sash with an arched piece built into it. Okay, I see. Thank you, hi Karen. You have a question. Go ahead, Karen, sorry, Barbara's question: do you know if the original windows were arched like is the mace and is the masonry opening in fact arch? So are you replacing it's just one floor that has this configuration if we go back to the main elevation I'll show you where that is it's the 11th floor is the only one that has this I see and the building just has one facade of Windows correct. Well, there's a rear facade, but that's not visible. We're not even touching those okay, so in front of us is just the street facing windows from floors 4 to 11. correct. Why? What's? What if you could explain a little bit about the floors that you're not touching like, is the 12th floor original or why aren't you replacing the floors below 4 as well? The 12th floor is an infill aluminum windows that are existing and we would like to do something better. That's there, but it's still undecided. As you can see, it used to be an open portico, and there is some discussion about possibly opening that up again, but it's to be determined and then the bottom floor, the ground floor, storefront that has been approved by landmarks already and right now. The fourth floor is not open for the owner to actually access it. Yet there's a tenant there that we can't address okay and a follow-up to that. Would this eventually be the new norm or the standard, or is it like a master plan? So when the fourth floor does become open, that would follow suit potentially, but right now this is I mean we're doing full scale. The fourth floor to the 11th floor. This is not going to be done piecemeal for this bulk that we're seeing okay. Thank you, Karen. Any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, seeing none I have one more sorry, I, just looking closer at the orig can I ask another follow-up. If you could zoom in a little bit above the ground floor arches, there seems to be more detail in the original photo. Were those lost like the vertical dividers? Were those lost in those windows on the third floor? Yeah those the windows don't exist anymore, there's no original fabric on the windows anywhere on the building right now, but it almost it's so thick. It looks like it's masonry, creating a cross in the center that that's all gone and it's all gone I believe it was all either wood or it's hard to tell in the photographs. To be honest. Okay, it's sadly missing. Okay, thank you. Yeah I agree we're not in comments but I'll. Thank the liberty, any other questions from members of the committee. Okay, so saying done, I will open up the fourth to members of the public. If you wish to make a comment or ask a question, please use the raise hand, function and Luke will give you a panelist status so that you can join the conversation, any questions or comments from members of the public on this application. Okay, so seeing now we will move back to a business session and we need comments from members of the committee. All right, I'm gonna call up on you. Renee go ahead. Oh Barbara, I see Barbara, has her hand up Barbara go ahead. Well, I mean it certainly is an improvement over what is existing. It's you know with those blank pieces of metal, and you know the horizontal divided lights. So you know it definitely is it's a step in the right direction? Yeah. Thank you. Any other comments. Rene Cafero, I'm calling on you. Okay, I mean I. Don't really have much of a problem with this I had more things, I was gonna, say but I guess. If there's no original material left in the windows anywhere on the building, then I kind of now have less to say about it. You know: I do tend to not be a fan of aluminum windows, even if they are made to look contextual, but if there's nothing that we're matching it to I. Understand that as well, so I can't say: I have too much of a problem. Otherwise, with this looking at it. Thank you. Any dissenting views on this application. Anyone feels differently has an objection, has a comment that would differ from what Barbara and Renee said already. Okay, so I see no outrageous raised hand left hand. You know I, think that it is a very light touch. It's a touch that is very much in keeping with the original aspect of the fenestration. It's an improvement. Currently, the windows, the existing windows are aluminum, so we're not losing really any. You know any historic material as much as I agree with Renee, I'm not a fan of aluminum windows, but in this current application, I think that you know we're not losing anything. It's not a trade-off. That is a loss and overall, the design is going to be much better. I hope that the applicant will come back to us for the top windows and I hope that those windows that are currently not under our preview, which, if I understand correctly, are windows on the third floor. I hope that you know this becomes part of a you know, window replacement program and that the rest that has been approved becomes a de facto master plan and that you know we don't have to reinvent anything and that you know when those remaining windows come up for a replacement that there's a clear map of how that is going to be done. So those are my comments and I think we're ready for a motion unless there's any objection from anyone on the committee, but I think we're ready for a motion Renee. That was your application. Do you want to make a motion yeah motion to approve second yeah I'll? Second, that all right, first vote of the evening buzz here on mute unmute, both okay I'll, keep calling I'll come back to him: Renee Kefar unmute, yes, Renee Cafaro, yes, James! Yes, Laura, yes, John! Yes, Suzanne I, don't know if Susanna's with us I think she is not Richard. Yes, Mike! Yes, Renee Kinsella, yes, Sam, yes, Chuck, yes, Janet you you're on mute, I, see her hand raised. Is that a yes Janet I? Think it's a yes? Okay, Karen? Yes, Barbara! Yes and Layla, yes, did I miss anyone, no okay, I call everybody and the motion passes unanimously. Thank you very much to the applicant for this swift presentation and good luck with your hearing at LPC and we're moving on to the next. Thank you everybody. It is for a property at 122 fifth Avenue. This is an application for storefront alterations, Rooftop edition a landscaped roof at an existing building and a new building at the adjacent parking lot located at 9, West 17th street, and all of this is located in the lady, small historic district, and we have the applicants and we're ready for your presentation. Thank you good evening. Everyone. My name is Nick Haynes, I'm the CEO of Bromley companies and here with a couple colleagues, consultants who will present the bulk of it. I just wanted to introduce it. 122 Fifth Avenue has been a building that we have owned for. Actually next year will be the 40th year of ownership and 7 West 17th street I think we've owned for 36 years. We have been obviously very active in this neighborhood we manage and own a number of properties. 105. Fifth, Avenue 33 17th street, so this is really our home as a company and I'm also a resident in the district. We've been very involved through the years in the 14th street bid, creating the bid and the partnership creating the lower Fifth Avenue Association and this application, which we're going to share, is an attempt to really modernize the building. Some of you may remember about a year ago, a little over a year ago, we were into this community board discussing a vertical expansion of the building, a 40,000 foot, rooftop expansion of the building, which we worked with you on the presentation tonight is frankly redistributing some of that bulk with a new I, think a very contextual urban infill building and a much more modest rooftop edition. So with that, as an introduction, I'm going to turn it over to Aaron Rooley who's, going to present some of the contextual aspects of the building. Thank you hi, good evening, Dave David. Do you have the control of the screen? Are you I? Do you do okay great good evening, thanks for taking the time I am seeing your screen. Thank you for taking the time to walk through this with us. I'm going to take you through a bit of the history and the context for the proposal and then David Burns of studios architecture is going to walk you through the specifics of the design. So David could we go to the site map I'm getting a little bit of lag on my side, okay, one? Second, oh by the way I'm Aaron Rooley of Higgins Quays bath and partners. If I didn't think I neglected to introduce myself we're the preservation consultants for the project, 122 fifth Avenue you'll, see it here highlighted in blue, is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue between 17th and 18th streets and, as you can see, it's a t-shaped building. So it has frontage wings that extend from 17th street to all the way through to 18th street and the development site. That Nick mentioned is hatched just to the west of that at 9, West, 17th street, and so the scope of the proposal includes the new annex building to be built on the parking lot site. A new small, non-visible rooftop edition that'll extend primarily along the wings of the building at 122 and then modifications to the storefronts at 17th, Street, 18th, Street and 5th Avenue, and then new flagpoles on Fifth Avenue. The proposal and its appropriateness are rooted in a few fundamental ideas. First, that the new annex draws on the extensive history of lateral expansions in the historic district and that the design interprets the historic building its design, its articulation and materiality and a modern vocabulary, and that it maintains the prevailing street wall and height, reinforcing the streetscape. And so here we've we can see the existing conditions. The three street facades, 122 Fifth Avenue, was constructed in 1899 and to 1900, designed by Robert Manicki, who is prolific in the historic district and it's a neo-renaissance style store and loft building 10 stories in height, the Fifth Avenue facade on the left is clad entirely in limestone and that's articulated as three monumental arches, with a rusted, very strong rusticated base capped by an attic story and a cornice and then on the side, streets, the wings at 17th and 18th streets. That vocabulary continues, but it transitions. It has a limestone base, but the upper stories are clad in a buff brick that you can see here. In the center view. We see the 17th Street Facade 17th street is slightly narrower than the 18th street wing and you can see that the bays are slightly compressed, so they almost look a little squished compared to 18th street and then there is that also that step in the facade where it sets back at the in the Westernmost bay. And here we can see the storefronts so on. The left is the existing storefront and building entry at fifth Avenue, the storefronts date from about the past 10 years, and the entry in Phil is about 20 years old. So none of it is historic fabric and then on the in the two right views. We see the storefronts at 17, the former storefronts at 17th Street and 18th street, where they have their original, projecting curved bay storefronts that have been clad over and infilled to accommodate mechanical and freight units there, and so this and you can also see in the adjacent phase where there is non-historic infill at the doorways and the freight entry, and all of that provides a tremendous opportunity for restoration as part of the proposal, and here we can see. The existing parking lot on. The left is a view looking slightly to the east, showing that projecting bay on 17th street and then the view on the right is looking directly north so that low structure that you're seeing in the distance actually fronts on to 18th street. So it's a three-story building that runs on to 18th and the existing wing of 122 is to the right. So 122 was originally constructed in 1900, and we can see that here. In this view, from 1908, where at the right we have 122 Fifth Avenue and to the left. You can see the 17th street wing and beyond that you see the buildings that formerly occupied the site of the parking lot and here 120, which is this corner building that we've masked out in white that was constructed in 1905 and it's an interesting story because they had there was some ownership, shifting that happened historically and when they developed 120 they, even though it was a separate building, they created a continuous base with 122. So what you read in terms of its overall composition is a continuous space from 120 to 120, and then it knits into the wing on 17th street. So it reads as a solitary structure, even though they were independent buildings and there's all subtle variation in terms of how the upper stories are treated and then oh, can we just go back? I'm sorry, David you'll, see in the detail on the right that at that time, in 1908, the storefront, the projecting storefront on 17th street did not have a display window. It actually had two separate entry. Bays that were would have extended all the way down to the sidewalk level through what is now a bulkhead okay, and so we can trace that history. That, of course, part of the history of the district. Is that reuse of the buildings and the commercial reinvention of the storefronts that we see in virtually every building in the district. But here in 1898 we have the original drawing from Maine from the Manicki set, and that shows the original display window and that's 1898. So by that 1908 photograph, we see that configuration has changed and we have the entries that I pointed out in the last sequence and then by 1921. It's reinstated as a display window, and so that's what we see on that bottom right view and then, of course, at the top right is the existing condition for the parking lot that was previously developed with a three-story building, which we see on the left. That was designed by Mckim, Mead and White for the Golett family and that was constructed in 1885 and then that little one-story extension shows up sometime between 1915 and 1930 and then all of and then those two buildings which we see in the map on the right from 1930 are demolished in 1952 to make way for the parking lot which we see here in the 1980s tax photo pretty similar to the condition we see today. And so here's how we experience the building today, compositionally we're reading 122 Fifth, Avenue, 125th Avenue, the wing on 17th street. We see the projecting bay and then the parking lot in the distance on the left, and so this composition and the history of lateral expansions in the district are very much a part of the history here where commercial buildings were expanded over time and their subtle variation in the design and articulation that we'll see. As we start to dig into the details of this proposal, the district has a long history of lateral expansions, both not just for the department stores but also for the mercantile buildings. I think we think about it. More generally, as something when the department stores expanded, but it also happened in the general commercial buildings along the avenues and side streets and those expansions came in the form of additional stories. Mansard roofs and other fanciful tops to buildings, but also in the form of annexes and lateral expansions. And here we have three examples that we thought were particularly relevant, primarily because they work within the vocabulary of the existing building and there's a clear relationship to the historic building or the original building, but there's also a somewhat independent identity that develops, and so here are 37 to 39 West, 21St street, and so the original building is on the right and we see the expansion on the left, which plays with the same vocabulary and materiality, but is very clearly a sister but not a twin to the building and then at 880 Broadway. There was a nine story, annex which we see on the left in the distance. You can see back there popping up and then at 140, one fifth Avenue another building by Robert Maynickey, and this is interesting. This was a an l-shaped building originally and then that corner section was added, so that really created the new identity for the building. In this composition, where the corner really took the role of identifying the building and then that context is overlaid by other similar approvals by the Landmarks Commission. So here we see a few examples of comparable sites. So these are these narrow sites within the district that maintain the street wall and relate to in a contextual way, and all of these are located on 17th or 18th street. So in the immediate context of our building and the center view is actually directly across the street from our site, and that is a building proposed and designed by buyer, blender, Bell and so we'll be getting into the details of the proposed design and you'll have a better sense of the strong contextual relationship between the historic building and the proposed new building. But here we're just going to share a couple of specific references for context, and here we look at those narrows those narrow historic buildings. The three-story bases, where you have the punched openings in the third story and this double height expression at the base of the building, with the first two stories, that's divided by the spandrel, typically and then mullions and fenestration- that further break down the scale within the openings. And so these are some of the things we were thinking about as the historic reference for what might be a modern interpretation for a comparable site. As you'll see, we have a proposal. Our proposal includes a an awning for at the location of the annex, and here we see a few examples of awnings that extend along the side street. So it's a corner building, which is the compositionally how ours is treated and at the far bays on the edge on the side. Street are our awnings, and so we see that at 162, fifth, historically and 125, West 18th street historically, and then a couple of existing examples, both at 149 fifth avenue on the side street at 21St, Street and 695 sixth avenue, which is the Burlington Coat Factory. Building on 22nd street. There are flagpoles proposed on Fifth Avenue, which we'll see in the design, and here you can see that there's a long history of flagpoles at the building and in the context so historically there it changed over time, but there was one located in every bay of the building on fifth avenue at some point and then finally, oh, this is going back to the awnings a bit or a little out of sequence, but those awnings occurred not just at single construction period buildings but on the left, 880 broadway, we see again. So this is one of the examples we talked about for the lateral expansion and we see that nine story, annex that was constructed on the left-hand side and at that location, is the new awning there. And so this is how it reads in the proposal compositionally. So we have 122 Fifth Avenue with the new storefronts and the corner building of 120, which marries the wings of 122 fifth Avenue, the projecting the restored projecting storefront at 17th street and then beyond that the new infill building, the annex as proposed, which David will describe in detail to you, along with that, the new canopy that's proposed there, which really identifies the building at the Side Street David. Can we just switch back to the really quickly to the 17th street lot, the little flemish revival building this one? This is I forgot to point this out, but this is the only view where we actually see the glazed storefront, projecting storefront at 17th street and so I think that that's a really magical shot, because so many of these have been clad over in the district and you don't have a sense of what they actually look like historically- and this is a particularly good shot of that, and so with that I think I'll just pass it over to David to get through get into the design of the building. Okay, thanks, Aaron. Sorry, I'm gonna keep my video off just to make sure the streaming stays clean and I'll go through the project in kind of three components. We'll talk about the primary kind of annex building. That Aaron has mentioned a couple of times and kind of completing that harsh portion of the lot and how it relates to the neighboring facade at 122 and ultimately 120 at the corner. We'll talk about the expansion at the top, which Nick alluded to in his introduction, is kind of a scaled back, drastically scaled back version of what was proposed a little over a year ago into a one-story pavilion and then we'll talk a little bit more about storefronts and the proposed storefront improvements on all three sides of the building. So with that, I'm going to go into the facade and we can start looking at and we'll have some diagrams that talk about this a little bit more but again to really reinforce the comments that Aaron had about the district and the immediately adjacent. You know our existing facade and the relationships we're trying to draw on. Obviously the Florida floors align, because this is a lateral expansion. It is also part of moving the elevator core of the building. So the canopy that was mentioned by Aaron is also kind of an important component as far as bringing people to this part of the building. But in the facade you can see the 51 foot or that three-story base a two-story expression with the one-story punch window over it at the very bottom, so that kind of referencing buildings in the neighborhood, as well as the two-story components to the 122 and 120 building. Then we have the kind of bulk of the building and floors four and up and then the attic story again mimicking what we're talking about at 122 but again we're reinterpreting. So it's not a direct cut and paste, but picking up on alignments but a contemporary take on the existing facade. So some of those elements kind of drawn out as a diagram of the double story expression at the base and that three stories of limestone that would carry through the vertical expression of the monumental bay is kind of organizing elements of the windows which is clearly illustrated in the existing building. We are aligning the facade with the setback portion of 122 again to pull that kind of make it as contextual as possible and then pulling those alignments across horizontally in the floor level. Alignment and then obviously the window expression picking up on the scale of the openings in 122, even to the arch top on the ninth floor and then back at the attic story going back to the rectangular openings at the very top of the house. So some of the existing materials that Aaron has already mentioned of the limestone base, the kind of buff colored iron spot, brick on these facades on both 18th and 17th street and then the Mel, the metal colors at the lower stories that are painted so they're kind of in a dark, bronze. Color we'll be picking up on all of these kind of palette elements as we move into the proposal. So you see the proposed base looking at a material that we can match the existing limestone, so we're actually looking at a cast stone to match that limestone to provide the most accurate, coloration and then brick above again, with an iron spot to match the existing we're in the process of cleaning the existing brick to get an accurate match and then in the detailing, so the metal work referencing back to the existing window, color and the colors at the base of the building in the coatings for the windows in that dark, bronze, color. So a view from the street. Looking up, you see that reference of bass, the detailing of the two-story expression again. The goal here is to provide depth in the facade. So you know the existing facades of these buildings provide so much depth and looking at ways to create that, in a modern facade, the two-story expression doing that by folding in referencing a little bit the stonework to the right at the tops of the window heads and then, as we get up higher in the building. We'll talk a little bit more about how that's relating to the windows, but the double story: opening the metal trim matching and even in the detailing of the canopy picking up on the radius of the curved bay projecting window that'll be restored. So some of those details of that depth so creating more depth in the facade at the base. So we're aligning with the existing 122 facade and then pulling in three feet to create depth at the entrance at that double height expression. And then you see that again repeat in the windows of the third floor, where we have that recess as it angles in to create more depth. So as we kind of move up the building you'll see, you know some of these details of not only the depth in the metal in the stone work, but also in the metal work around the windows. You'll see some of those trims. The six inch trim again intending to provide additional weight to the overall metal work in the facade and then the detailing of the canopy that will reach out that we have a little bit more information in a slide or two. So as we go up the building that depth is being introduced in a stepping of the brick in the jam and this and the head condition again on the arch top in the head condition and on the jam and then on the typical windows. It would be strictly in the jam condition. So we have again the stepping back of the brick before we hit our window treatments and then drawing a on a stone, cast, stone, sill and then a reveal on the brickwork. That then again relates back to the drawing of those alignments between the floors of the neighboring building. So some of those details, as we step up into the building and a reinterpretation of the cornice picking up on some of the depth in and height alignments, with the existing cornice, the marquee at the base showing a 10-foot projection with that curving detail again picking up on the and trying to celebrate again the some of these details of curving, the existing Bay Windows and how we can incorporate that into the vocabulary of the ex of the annex and then a view from the street at eye level showing it in context. So as we jump from 17th street, which was obviously the primary facade, we do have a glimpse of this of 18th street over that three-story structure. That Aaron pointed out at the back of the parking lot, because this is a relocation of our elevator core. The primary expression of this is masonry really the lot line, brick to match existing lot line, brick of the existing 122 building, and you will see that over the three-story building on 18th street so from here, I'm going to jump to the rooftop and then we'll end at the storefront. So, as mentioned before, the rooftop is drastically scaled back from a previous proposal on the left. We see the existing view from the southwest so 17th street, at the bottom of the page and fifth avenue to the right. You see the empty portion where the parking lot is where the annex takes over there and then the annex showing up so we walked through that and as we get to the top, you see the elevator overrun and the in the blue dashed line, and then the one-story pavilion to then gain access to some outdoor roof space and then a mechanical plant that is pushed a little bit to the east. All of these are well within the previously approved rooftop expansion and again drastically scaled back from what was previously shown we'll go through some of the visibility once we get past this so view from the northwest. Looking back so the overall roof plan, the core on the left 17th street is at the bottom of the page, 15th or 5th avenue is on the right of the page. The core you saw in the masonry is the highest element and then the pavilion sitting here in the mechanical plant up against the neighbor at the 120 building at the corner. The dashed line here indicates the previously proposed footprint, which is a two-story expansion, plus a rooftop on top of that, so it was Gener considerably more area than what we're proposing now. Obviously, the areas that are on the expo, the annex are outside of that boundary because there's there was no building in the parking lot. So a large majority of this is rethinking the massing of the building to utilize, the annex and less development at the roof level. So you'll see some references to the base of the building as well. Even though these are not visible from the street and we thought it was an important part of the building story, so that the pavilion itself has an expression that is referential to the Bay Windows at the street level and again calling back to the canopy that we talked about a little bit before and using then the lot line, brick and dark metals that are found throughout the rest of the project. These are elevations and sections for reference from 17th street, the elevator bulkhead the pavilion metal panels at the very top- and you see the mechanical plant behind here behind the 120 building, which has a quite tall cornice and an additional floor on this building. To note this says: 11 floors and 122 has 10 and then a section through that showing basically mechanical above pavilion and then access to the roof, and then the mechanical plant so section through that space, we'll move to Fifth Avenue, where we see the elevation of the mechanical plant. This is pushed back from the facade on Fifth Avenue and we'll show you in the views that it's not visible and then the pavilion is beyond as kind of the back part of the t of the building and then the overall elevations from 17th street, showing the pavilion with the annex in context and fifth Avenue again, the mechanical plant really in the foreground and the pavilion in the background and then 18th street with the pavilion and you see the elevator and the elevator core in the lot line, brick behind the three-story building along 18th street. So this is really just to clarify that a mock-up was produced and we've used it in our photographs because it's not visible. We wanted to include this to prove that it is. In fact this is what was built and it is in these locations a b and c. So we have locations that indicate the outermost limits of the proposed development and we'll walk you through some of the views so from 5th Avenue and 17th street. Looking northwest up toward the Fifth Avenue facade, nothing is visible from that location. That would be. The mechanical screening. Would be the closest element there, but it's not visible as it's pulled back from the street wall. The view coming down 17th street looking east you'll see the rigging here. This is actually the local law 11 work, that's currently being undertaken now. So that's what you're seeing here, but we're not seeing any of the pavilion which is actually much further back and then and obviously with the annex building. You know, even if it is further back, it's not visible once the annex building is filled in and then looking back at the Fifth Avenue first facade from 18th street, again testing that mechanical enclosure so you'll see the cornice of the 1:22 building. That is in green and copper here and the bulkhead of that elevator shaft for that building. That's the White box that you see here. The netting is for 114 across the street they're also doing some facade repairs, and the drops here that you see again are for the local law. 11 work. You can see the rig and they're working up on the corners now. So, with that I'll jump to the storefront master plan, we didn't touch on 18th street because it's only the new, the annex portion- that's visible from 18th street. So that's why it was included in the earlier section, so the storefront master plan. Obviously we have three frontages all slightly different, but share a common spirit, and the goal here is to really you know, bring back these historic bays as active parts of the building. You can see the orientation of the building and the use of the parking lot as the elevator core and the arrival point for the building, and so we'll talk through 17th street and then move around the building Aaron already touched on these, but obviously the detailing of the Bay Windows on 17th and again on 18th street. There is historic fabric at the very top. Some of it is needs more discovery to find what is behind these panels and how much of the louvers have changed any of the framing that might be behind here, but the bulkheads and the roof conditions do show some of that original detailing on 17th street. Even the bulkhead has been clad over. So you see the kind of plating with metal to cover it, but then you do see some moments where portions of mullions start to reveal themselves. So this will be part of more of an exploratory process to see what can be recovered in what needs to be replicated in our new storefront system. So we'll compare left on the right, existing and propose left on is existing proposed on the right of starting with 17th street. So there's the bay window. We, as Aaron mentioned earlier, the we are looking to add an entry point into this bay as part of the activation of the street and restoring the historic transom and then replacing where needed below that in order to match with the existing historic detail, there's some existing areas where doors were that will be replaced to match the historic door. There's also some panels that you'll see with these kind of ten panel doors that used to be pairs around the metal work of this cross and we'd be looking to restore that as well. In those panels, some of these will become inactive because they are. We have a vault program that will limit the amount of doors we can have accessing 17th street. So some of these details again matching in the profiles so where we can match the verticals as they go up and meet the historic fabric. These caps will be custom fabricated to then match those of the existing and so again, I think more exploration where things have been clad over and how much of the bulkhead needs to be rebuilt versus restored. So the view as we're backing up toward fifth Avenue and seeing the Bay wind that Bay projection and the canopy beyond for the annex, so we're gonna, move to 18th street and similar strategies here. So the projection has a similar program. There it's uncertain here because there's less visible, how much is existing, but it would be a similar strategy to 17th street here we are able to have more active door panels here. So the panels that I pointed out previously on 17th street, where we were looking to show the original intent, but maybe have them inactive here, we would be having two additional active doors that act as service entrances for the building and that view from 18th street and then Fifth Avenue, where there's zero historic fabric in the storefront itself. Currently, the lobby in the middle and gap occupying both sides, the restoration here is really a kind of interpretation in order to have it marry well with the rest of the building, so we're showing a couple of conditions as possibilities that a future tenant could then undertake kind of an idealized scenario, would be center doors and then storefront with no doors locations for potential signage. On a above, the transom point on a kind of in front of the glass and but also looking at strategies. If the tenancy changes and there's two tenants or three tenants, how might they access the space so looking at an offset door, condition, Center door condition and then a no door condition so in elevation and illustrating each of those independently. The no door condition again adding divided dividing the lights and the transom similar to the Bay Windows on 17th and 18th street, but keeping the flat, because these don't project into the sidewall keeping the current location of them, the side door, access in the middle and the opportunity, if needed, where glass might be replaced for louver and then the door in the center. The option on the right we're also illustrating that flagpole mounting, which Aaron pointed out in the historic photos, is where they were mounted typically between the double hungs on the second floor and then resting on that kind of spangled piece decorative piece at the sill. So as far as changes from what's there today. Obviously, we talked a little bit about the transom, increasing the kind of profiles around the storefront, a slightly larger bulkhead right now. The glass really goes all the way down to the floor. That bulkhead then matching up with a door detail at the foot of the door and then again the signage program of being able to use the space in front of the glass. So with that, that's the end of our graphic materials. All right, thank you very much for a very thorough and extensive presentation, let's jump in with questions from our members of the committee members of the committee. Do you have questions and if I may suggest that you keep the other presentation up in case, we have some specific questions. We can reference directly to the material and, oh, my god, so many hands up. Let's start with Karen go ahead, yes, hi. My question is about the storefront I think it was page 59. Can you what is the height of that storefront base on the bulkhead base? Let me find it and Dave feel free to jump in here. If I'm not finding it, it's 16 inches it's to align with the base of the existing pilasters of the facade, which was that which matches the historic condition. If you go back to the historic photos that they, it was a very low bulkhead that aligned with the base of the pie. Laster. Thank you. Do you have any other questions Karen, not at the moment, okay Barbara. So what is being done here is that you will no longer enter the building on Fifth Avenue, and so the entrance to the building is now on 17th street. Is that correct? That's correct, okay, and this is residential. No, this is commercial office. This is all commercial office, so the new windows are not operable. The new windows are not operable, they are right. Now they are fixed for the annex. The existing building has double hungs throughout right. Okay, thank you and just to clarify the new entrance to the entire building will now be located on 17th street. Is that what you said? That's correct, okay and what will be the use of the existing entrance that is currently the entrance to the office building on fifth Avenue. That will be retail. Okay. Thank you. We have more questions. Renee, Cafero! Well, there's a lot to unpack here so well. Let me start with I think I'm trying to do three quick questions, we'll start with the most recent thing that he said. So when we're talking about the three bays where the signage is, why is it that one of the transoms might have to be louvers? Usually louvers are not really something that you choose to do. It's either has to be there for an HVAC purpose, or it doesn't so that either or kind of struck me as odd, and what exactly would happen to make that decision for you? So let's start with that, as the first question I think, primarily if it was one large user and the ownership could work out with them how to supply their air, then we may be able to remove the louvers, not knowing, where the retail mark it's going. It's divided into three smaller users. There may be the need for a louvre to be added. So that's the reason for the ambiguity at this point is uncertainty in the market of leasing. Okay, so it could change depending on how big your tenant is. I see internally. Okay, next thing is about the cornice I mean I appreciate you did try to relate the annex as much as you could, while still making it quite modern I have some concerns, but I can leave those to comments about the annex, appearance. But one question for you is why, when you were attempting to reflect the cornice at the top, did you do it slightly shorter? Is that just a perspective issue that I'm looking at in the elevation, or is that actually shorter, because you know I would have liked to have seen you know a cornice that was done in that dental molding kind of cornice decorative cornice to match that it just kind of seems to break up the street while a little bit, because it's uneven so you're attempting it but then still falling a bit short? What was the reasoning behind doing it smaller I think so for the height? It's a it's really a zoning issue. We're allowed to go up to 150 feet and then we're allowed to parapet height beyond that, and then we're allowed to project based on what we can project past the building face. This is kind of the maximum height that we can go from a zoning standpoint. So that's the reason for the height disparity okay, so it just has slightly different zoning than the thing that's next to it. Well, just the yeah, the existing building predates the zoning, and so this allows us to go up to 150, but with our parapet max height. This is where we land up against the existing corners. Okay, I see- and just in my last for now that I say what I want to get to is the can you clarify on the flagpoles I know that at the beginning of all this, we were talking about how the building used to have flagpoles in all the bays and it's historical et cetera, but the flagpoles that you are proposing now. Are they going into a place where they used to be before or are you re-piercing the limestone? That's a good question: the two flanking bays they don't actually land on limestone you'll see the kind of the sill condition here in the right hand, most bay, so we're proposing the North Bay and the South Bay on Fifth Avenue, the Middle Bay, we're not proposing to put here. So in these cases it lives on the metal work as far as what is currently there and whether there is a an old seat that is still there. I, don't know the answer to that, but we can find out okay and I and Layla just real quick on the issue of flag poles. If you could remind myself and the committee at some point, I know that we have a policy against new flagpoles but I just I. Don't really know you might need a fresh memory on where this might land, because, if they're not going into an old piece of hardware or an old hole in the building, I don't know if we consider those new in our guidelines or not, but just wanted to flag that, for you, no pun intended yeah. So you know for members of the committee and for the applicant and attendees just a little background on flagpole and flags signage in New, York, City, so flat, poles. You know in at the beginning of the 20th century and even late 19th century they were not regulated. You know you could put a flagpole and you could put a flag and you know any signage was permitted. As a result, there was an absolute crazy, chaotic, proliferation of flagpoles and flags and it took actually the effort of you know a number of prominent preservationists in the early 20th century and mid 20th century to actually introduce legislation that would regulate, and you know clean up the streetscape that had become just so chaotic and there's you know, I will dig those photographs. There were some photographs of you know streets that were just I mean you couldn't see any flag for that matter, because there were just so many. So this big effort then resulted in the drastic reduction in the number of flagpoles and flags that were in place, and you know and a vast improvement and on the other, the streetscape move forward. You know those rules and regulations have changed over time, and today the zoning permits a flag and a you know flagpole and a flag attached to this flagpole, but because it is a landmark district, then LPC has jurisdiction. There is language in the rules of LPC that basically say that their flagpoles and flags are not permitted. Unless they are, you know, approved and deemed appropriate by the commission. So you can not install flagpole as of right. The signage that is permitted as a right is the bracket sign. It has to be over soon size and it can not be interior with interior elimination. So the applicant is in their total right to seek an approval, but LPC would be in their total right to say that the flagpole is not appropriate. Once again, you know the applicant is seeking a certificate of appropriateness, so LPC will have to determine and we have to opine on whether we find that this flagpole and you know the flag that would be attached to it- is appropriate. You know based on the history, and you know, based on you, know the fight of those preservationists. Who are you know there before us I think that it is fair to say that you know this question has been litigated. A proliferation of flagpoles is not appropriate for the ladies male history district, although historically they were flagpoles. So you know that gives a little bit of the context and the history behind this question, and it is particularly important to remember that Fifth Avenue is a visual corridor that has you know that has been noted both by LPC and by the design commission as being exceptional vista corridors that must be protected and preserved. So that gives a little bit of context on. You know how to look at the this particular application. So moving on to Renee Kinsella Renee go ahead. You have a question. Yes, thank you. Layla I have a couple my first one, and maybe I'm confused on the storefronts on the entrance on the doors. Are we being asked to approve both the middle, the side, door and no door at all, just in case the retail tenant wants that? Are we being asked to approve all three, it's structured as a master plan for the commission, so the commission would approve the concept of having that the combination of entries or windows, and so yes, you're opining on the appropriateness of the master plan, so just to follow up. So that means, if the center door is the center door that then it would become a master plan for center door all around or would some go to the side and some be in the center I David. You should take that out because I'm not sure a center door in the flanking bays works necessarily but yeah I think the intent was that the center bay would be the center door and that the offset would be on the side bays if there were if they were demised separately for separate retailers. But I do think it is. You know we're looking because we don't know what the retail leasing will be. We're looking to establish. You know a pallet that would work for any kind of demising strategy where we need to get multiple entries. Thank you. I have one more if I may layla. Yes, go ahead, it's about lighting both on the signage in front of the stores and on the canopy. Could you speak to that? Yes, so on the stores I think we are looking at either non-illuminated or some halo illuminated and Aaron. You can jump in as well as far as what we would be because again, the disadvantage for the storefronts is we're setting up a parameter that then a retailer could come in and work within and then for the canopy right now we are looking at a solid letter that is halo lit, so it would be have light behind on the surface of the canopy, but not direct illuminated. Thank you and not underneath it's not coming down from underneath the canopy. Let me go back to the image of that, because there is lighting below to get light levels properly on the entryway. So there is, there are down lights in that canopy surface that you can see here. Thank you. Does that address your questions, Renae, it does. Thank you Barbara. You have a follow-up question. I do I wanted to know what they used, how the rooftop edition will be used and also following up with Renee's questions about lighting. You know: will that be lit at night, so if you could address that sure the so the rooftop use is also office, so it will be leased office space as far as illumination there's interior illumination there is, there will be some potentially landscape illumination, but we're not at this point filing for an assembly permit there. So we haven't gotten to the point of the lumens required for an assembly, so other tenants won't have access to that again. I think it depends on the leasing if it could go to a single tenant or it could go as a common space for multiple dependents. Okay, thank you. Any other questions from members of the committee. I have a couple of my own. We did review this proposal I believe last year it was a very different massing. Can you just clarify the amount of far that you're using and whether there is any excess far that is still available after you construct the annex and this rooftop edition? Yes, so there is so because we have reduced the overall area and in filling the annex portion there is a small percentage of area that's available. We are kind of working on what we think is a built, a reasonable kind of pavilion for the top for constructability and cost reasons so, but Dave I think is searching for the total. So he has it for you as far as what this proposal represents as far as how much far is left and if you could speak to whether there are current plans for the use of any available far. That would be very helpful. No there's not I mean this is a this project is really a driver of the current economy and looking at the expense of upgrading a building to support a two-story plus rooftop penthouse and the cost to build that versus the benefits of infilling, a missing portion of the block, the Fl, the functionality of moving the elevator core into that location and offering a small much smaller, rooftop present presence. So the intent is that we're right-sizing this so that it is buildable in the current economic conditions. Okay, but you know just for the sake of predictability: the is there any intention to use this remaining available air rights at a later time, maybe building a rooftop on top of the annex or any other extension or maybe selling these air rights to another neighbor through a lot merger. The selling is something I'll have to have Nick or Peter jump in on, but the right now the project is, as shown, so we're not looking at we're, not like future proofing for a much bigger edition in the you know beyond this scale. We're looking at this addition- because this is what is we feel like- is going to suit what the market needs. Okay and in terms of number of square feet, do you have a number of square feet of far that is unused? Yeah he's looking for the totals right now and searching for it. I'll find it in a second sorry about that we can get back to that I mean we can come back to it. We do we don't need to hold the whole meeting. My other question was: can you actually give us the size of the canopy? It seems- and I'm gonna you know slide slowly into coming, but it seems to protrude really far in above the sidewalk, and it looks on one of the renderings that it is actually protruding all the way to the curbside right. So the illustration that's on the screen shows the beyond the property line and reminds you we're about three feet back from the property line, because we're aligning with the recess portion of the 122 historic facade beyond the property line, we're extending 10 feet, and that is two feet from the curb which is the requirement under a marquee designation. So it is a total of 13 feet. Yes, 10 feet from lot line correct and it's two feet from the curve. Okay, I see that Renee Kinsella has her hand up Renee go ahead. I just want to ask again the view from the over the little house on 18th. Is that just a brick wall? There's no window, there's no features at all that you're going to see from the annex right. Is it just a plain black brick wall right? That is in the plan? That is the back of our elevator core? That's being located there, I'm going to turn my video off, it's telling me I'm unstable and so at the elevator core, we're not proposing, obviously any windows. I'm sorry, I'm just looking for that view from here. So it is meant to be a just an extension of the existing lot line, brick from the historic facade on 18th, Street and David. How far back is that from 18th street approximately this is a 100 feet back, okay, real, quick! The zfa leftover is around 24,000. okay, and is there any known plans for the use of these far base specifically? Is there any intention or thought about selling those far left merger or other mechanism? Let me answer on behalf of the ownership. There's no plan to you can this is actually a good picture to have up. You can see the line windows on 122 here, protruding above the three-story building, so that's an incredibly important light protector that three-story building and those windows keeping them. So we have no intent to you know affect our ability to keep those windows, so the thought is and the building is designed. You can see with the mechanicals that this is the finished product and those would just be, you know, help protect our life. Okay. Thank you. I see that John Harris has his hand up John go ahead, John be sure to unmute John. We can not hear you, I'm sorry all right and, as you recall, we had the previous application and I believe the rooftop edition consisted of three stories, and this one is one story, and there was also some dialogue at some point that LPC in the previous iteration had put a limit of two stories. My question is in your discussions with LPC. Are you have your discussions been about stories about specific heights because that's an issue that we've been having a back and forth with LPC about you know? I could offer my thoughts on this. It's not it's actually not been about either it's been about visibility and the fact that it's not visible and it's a single story. If we were proposing multiple stories and they were not visible, I think it would be a different issue because they do tend to take a position of even if something's not visible. If you know, if you're proposing three or four stories of non-visible edition, it's not the same as a one-story non-visible edition, so it's just been about it simply being a single story and non-visible okay and then just could you just tell me, could confirm to me what the height difference is between your original proposal and this one for just the addition on the top. How high is this one story edition versus the three-story one in feet, so this is above the above. Our new roof line will be about 16 feet above to the top of the new metal cornice here. Okay, previously there were two floors, I believe Dave at 12 feet each so that made 24 feet, plus a overrun and a vestibule to get onto a roof beyond that, so there was an occupied roof at the upper level as well. What was ultimately approved by the commission was two stories, not the three stories, as you originally saw. Okay, thank you. Does that address your question John. Yes, it does just as a follow-up hours ago, minutes ago, like shocking you, before the meeting and I had the impression that it was visible but was I confused by the construction and the netting that is behind your property. Let me jump to that view. Were you on 17th street, no actually on Fifth Avenue, so from Fifth Avenue, the? What you're, seeing in the view on the upper right in 3C is and I can zoom in here just to show it a little better one, there's rigging on 122 facade for local law work. You see the cornice of 120 that wraps around and you see a white bulkhead there. That is in fact the elevator overruns for one- and here is the facade restoration work at 114 fifth, which is across 17th street to the south. Okay got it so I got confused. So it looks like that there is no visibility from any street right. Correct Layla was this the view that you were observing from this perspective? Okay makes sense. Okay, are there any more questions from members of the committee? Okay, so seeing none I'm going to perform two members of the public, any questions or comments from members of the public. If you do, please use the race hand, function and Luke will grant you the panelist status so that you can join the conversation. So let me go on to Peter Stanberg Peter. It looks like you lowered your hand, feel free to raise your hand again. If you'd like to be okay, yeah I can oh okay Peter. You can unmute yourself! Thank you, Luke! Thank you Layla. First, two quick thank yous and then two fairly quick questions. Thank yous, Nick I, don't know if the change is because of the financial world changing because of Covid-19 or if it's in response to community concern about the three-story edition, but if it isn't in response to the concern about the neighborhood. Thank you for that and design team Aaron Dave David. Thank you for a really thoughtful presentation and design. The two questions. One I just want to confirm that on the eastern portion of 122 that whole wing, the only construction that's going on there is mechanical equipment correct. So once we get beyond the t and we pull up the plan, it is mechanical equipment. Great. The other question is the 17th street elevation from looking at the elevations. It looks like there isn't a horizontal alignment of windows and I'm curious if I'm misreading that or if that was a reason for consciously moving them off alignment. Since the floors are aligned, our goal is to align the head condition. We are looking to drop the sills slightly for better light and air, but we're we are looking at an alignment at the head condition. Okay, thank you. Thanks again, all okay, any further questions, Peter, no okay! Thank you. Let's go to Michael Reef Michael go ahead. Okay, Michael! You can unmute okay. So, first of all, thank you very much for having me be able to speak. I'm at 17, West, 17th street, so just down the street on 17th street I just want to say, first of all that from the proposed new annex we're very supportive of the proposal in place of the parking lot. That's a great addition to the street and so we're very supportive I received a different. A slightly amended edited presentation, so it doesn't some of my items that are on my presentation just slightly different from what I've seen on this presentation. The one that was sent to me shows that, on pages one and pages three there was the parking signs that existed for the parking lot and on the new building on page three, which is the presentation that I receive. It still shows the parking sign still with the new building and I assume. Is that just a typographical error on the architectural drawings? Yes, thank you for speaking. Thank you for picking that up and we did as well and wanted to correct it. Oh yes, there's a new version. This is that this is the sign you're referencing Michael. Yes, that part sign. Yes, okay, good, okay! Thank you! It goes away yes, okay, good I was just a little confused when I saw that and then on. The cornice I think Renee Cafaro raised the issue of the cornice and I was just wondering. Was there any thought to try to replicate through some fiberglass design, a comparable design to match with the current cornice? That's on the adjacent building, yeah I mean I, think in general, we're hoping this building tells a bit of a story of referencing, the existing being contextual being respective of the existing, but clearly showing a more slightly more contemporary take. So, while we're trying to reference alignments, we're trying to reference materiality and architectural elements, we're avoiding the kind of direct duplication because oftentimes we find they're either not done if they're not done with exacting precision, you know they can fall flat, and this is not intended to be a replica building. This is intended to indicate a new chapter in the history, albeit you know, obviously very respectful of the existing. That's there yeah, I'm very supportive of the design. I just would hope, maybe something to be considered to integrate consistently in a bit more consistent pattern with what currently exists, as opposed to a very modern kind of approach. But it's just a comment and the last comment I have is I, do recognize, there's a lot of cabling under the street on 17th street and particularly around the sidewalks, but I didn't see anything related to the possibility of a street tree either in front of the new building or the current wing on 17th street. Has there been any consideration of any kind of street trees yeah? So there's a couple of things happening on the 17th street side, there will be a new electrical service, so we're limited in what we can do because of the vaults needed for Con Edisonison, and there are vaults on all three sides of the building. So there is a street tree program and paying into it for the city, but we're unable to put trees here because of the existing sidewalk vaults. Okay, understand. Thank you very much. Those are all my questions. Thank you and Alan. Bornstein is also has a question: go ahead: Alan, yes, I! I'm kind of concerned about the rooftop use of the rooftop Allen. Would you be able to identify yourself? Are you a resident of the area? I'm a resident at 126 fifth avenue at the 11th floor, which are butts. The rooftop pavilion I am in the South East corner of the building, which puts me on Fifth Avenue I, don't see a floor plan for it looks to me, like you, have your mechanicals on 122 and then somewhere in between the space. The pavilion starts. Can you put that shot that up I don't see a floor plan for it, but I'm concerned about the how far back from fifth Avenue this goes and I would be losing my windows, of course, on the lot line, which I don't really care too much about I. Do care about noise coming in from there? If I don't lose some of my windows I lose it's not clear. How far back you are set up for this pavilion and does it really abut the brickwork on 126, because that brickwork is semi-damaged as far as I can tell, and is there any plans for this, and will this be for just tenants of the building or tenants of that floor, and is there a separate access to it, elevator or whatever right? Those are a bunch of questions. I have I, still don't see a real floor plan for it from Fifth, Avenue, okay, the floor plan of the roof is on the screen. Now. Can you see that I see it, but it's not very clear. I see the mechanicals in the ground. Avenue is on the right hand, side and fifth Avenue I, believe is some feet away and I see two windows on the budding building right there before those dotted lines. Those would be my windows, I'm curious to know what plans you have for that area right now. That area is open. It's open all the way to Fifth Avenue. Now the pavilion that you were planning on, putting there that's, set back towards correct building I see so there's really no construction along that line. Just the mechanical, correct, mechanical and the mechanical is to the south, and that consists of HVAC and elevator, or am I wrong about this, and is there is there's the HVAC kind of plant that is against the 120 line at the building, which is on the south side, and is there some noise dampening yes going on? Is there a generator on the roof? There is a generator here, so we've got the cooling tower and the generator that are labeled here and there is a mechanical enclosure, acoustical enclosure around the exactly now it's a diesel powered generator. Let me ask I'm trying to remember what number fuel we're using for the generator you are using fuel, it's okay, it is just a fuel. Yes, I'm just curious I do work in that business, sometimes, okay. So I'm to understand, then that there is absolutely no obstruction of the lot line windows on 126 fifth, on Avenue on the South elevation, there's nothing! This is open. The pavilion doesn't start until we get to the through lot portion of the building back here. So the enclosure happens. You know well over 100 feet back from fifth Avenue. Very good is that are there? Is there a separate egress to that like separate elevator access, or is it just or is it open to only the tenant that is in 122 Fifth Avenue, it's tied to the tenancy of 122 Fifth Avenue? So it's an extension of the new elevator core that will service this floor. Okay, because my worry is that there will be food service bar service future restaurant availability, rooftop restaurants, are all over the neighborhood lately and it's terrible I would just remind everybody that we're actually not commenting on the use. This is the Landmarks Committee, so we're just commenting on the appropriateness of the massing and the design understood. I was just trying to get at the access to it, but thank you very much the work you did on the rooftop design and the building next door in the lot. It's a much a big improvement to the neighbor and I. Thank you very much. Thank you and I would really encourage the owner of 122 fifth to be in contact with their neighbors, and you know we can help. You know, put establish contact if need be, but I think it it's. It goes a long way to establish contact before work starts so that you know there's a better understanding of what's coming up all right. Thank you, Alan for your question and comments any more questions or comments from members of the public. Okay, so seeing none we're gonna move back. Two members of the Committee and Karen already alerted me that she has more questions and I will allow it so Karen go ahead. Yeah, sorry for the delay, I couldn't find the ray's hand earlier. My question is about 17th street and where you pulled back and recess the entry to the building approximately three feet, and you have two chamfered angles: I think they're, like about 45 degrees. You talk a little bit about why such a deep recess, you know giving up valuable real estate, why that was done and why the chamfered portal sure so I think that the double height portal is something that we thought was important in the neighborhood and the neighboring 122 facade does have the first and second floor is gang together in a single expression. In this case, we are trying to create additional depth in the facade, so we'd like to have a little bit more shadow on the facade, also picking up on, as you can see, the adjacent 122 facade, which has a lot of detail and a lot of shadow. So while our detailing may be a slightly more streamlined, we are picking up on horizontals of the rustication, but we do want to provide depth, and so the chamfering and kind of carving in of the facade is to provide that depth and shadow in the facade. As far as the dimension, it also allows us to have our door swings, not interrupt the sidewalk and the sidewalk is not tremendously wide at this location, so it does give us a little bit more arrival room for people coming in and out of the building. Thank you all right. Thank you. I will allow one more round of questions for members of the committee so that any interrogations that you may have can be addressed all right. So seeing none we're gonna move to business session. We are going to maybe take the different parts of this proposal separately so that we organize our line of commons. Let's start with the new proposed building on 17th street. So let's focus our comments on the new building. Any comments on the new building I see a hand yeah Renee, Cafero Renee go ahead. You know the new building I. Think yeah, it's a vast improvement from what I thought it would be, and all that my only disappointments in it. You know they do reflect a lot of the old build of the building. Next to it, I'm suddenly concerned of the size and the modern appeal of the canopy I think that the really shiny metal you know the lighting and all that it does seem a little bit more modern than some of the canopies that are, you know, braced to the building, with diagonally kind of like what we've seen in the old school canopies. It just doesn't look like yes, there's canopies in the area, but it just doesn't seem like one that is contextual. So that's the thing that sticks out most I also kind of wish they would have referenced the masonry and the cornice detailing a little bit better. They don't have to be exact, they're, not trying to make it look like an old building, but they could have done a little bit more around the window, casings with maybe some limestone or something to reflect the other building next to it. But you know it's a great effort, but those are just the things that stick out the most for me, yeah I, would you know, take the opportunity to jump in right here. I totally agree with you, I think that the a canopy altogether I think is problematic for this particular location. There are a few historic examples of canopies in the ladies mouth, but they're very few, and there are four very specific buildings. Usually there are very large buildings that had a very specific use. Historically, it's not the case, for you know, obviously, for this particular location, and it's also not the case for narrow. You know like quasi-sliver buildings, so it's really a problem, and you know if we need to really entertain the thought of a canopy. The protrusion of the proposed canopy is simply just staggering. Basically, it's a canopy that goes all the way to the maximum permittable depth, and it's really not appropriate for this particular building and for this particular street I think that it really greatly conflicts with the Bay Window, the existing Bay window that is going to be restored and the restorative work is going to be beautiful, so I think that it really conflicts with all these elements and I agree with you on the corners. You know, I think that it I agree that you know a pastiche is not necessarily the route, but I think that the dentition of the existing cornice of the neighboring building is a great cue and I would hope that you know this element the dentition could be introduced in and it in a modern fashion. So those are my comments for the building, otherwise, I feel that the design and the proportion and the massing are really good, and you know very elegant I, really like the use of the cast stone. Although you know if it was limestone, it would be better, but I think that you know cast stone would be appropriate. I think that the different material for the upper portion with the brick is also a very good treatment and I think the proportion is good, and you know I will say that you know compared to what we reviewed a year ago. This particular massing is such a vast improvement. So really you know gratitude to the applicant for that. You know whether it was in response to our comments or in adaptation to the market. Nonetheless, you know we're grateful that it's a much improved proposal. So those are my comments and now I want to hear more I think that Renee Kinsella, you had your hand up and I was going to say, although not as eloquently exactly what you said about the canopy and the non-contextuality also I was concerned about the unbroken glass. The double unbroken glass on the first floor also made it seem to me not as contextual as it could be, but otherwise I liked it not the canopy, not that double unbroken glass, but otherwise exactly I agree with you. Leela all right. Other comments on the building, the new building, any more comments, no okay. So moving on to the rooftop, that should be the easy part. Any comments on the rooftop comments, all right, I'll jump in it's not visible, and it's not visible already. So, if you wish to comment otherwise go ahead, all right, so I think that it's once again vast improvement compared to what we viewed last year. And although you know we do understand- and we do appreciate- that a version of last year's application was approved by LPC a little shorter than what was presented to us. You know we're really grateful that there's now a new proposal that we find to be a much more contextual, okay, so no issue on the rooftop and now, let's move on to the storefronts and I include with the storefronts the flagpole. What are your comments on the storefront I can't be doing all the talking. I need some comments. Karen go ahead, yeah, I'm a little indifferent, but there's something about the ground floor, storefront that we were just looking at the recess, that's three feet and the champ for that. I can't really pinpoint it that just doesn't blend as well. For me and I really think it's the chamfer. We see curves and a lot of like almost art, deco curves and in other elements and historic details, and that 45 degree chamfer is just really throwing me off. I appreciate, like the recess and trying to you know, give up some square footage to get a more of a rival space, but there's something just a little bit of miss I, don't know if it's strong enough to say I'd be against it and then the second part about the storefront is it's a two-story storefront, but it seems to be missing something that carries I'm sorry, I'm going to interrupt you. This is actually the entrance to what you're referring saying is the entrance to the new building yeah. This is the house to the annex yeah, so as I would actually along that with comments on the new building. The store fronts are really. You know the storefronts located on Fifth Avenue, where there's most of the alteration and also the storm. The fourth runs to the existing building on 17 and 18th street, which is mostly reservative. Yes, sorry, no I have no comments on them. We completely go back to the new building. I. Think that you know the bulk of our concern is really with the new building, but let's stay with comments on the storefront. So basically it is the proposed master plan on Fifth Avenue, and you know the possibility that there would be you know it would become asymmetrical because of tenancy, and let's start with that, and then we should also talk about the flagpole. But let's start with fifth Avenue and the proposed master plan, yeah I didn't have any comment on the store fronts. I think it's adaptable the way they've designed it- and you know I'm fine with the design. Okay and I- see that Barbara you have your head up, Barbra I, guess: I just felt that there wasn't a lot of detail in the master plan and I feel that it it's hard for me to react because I feel like there's so many different. Variations of you know that it could end up being in terms of the locations of the doors, but the most the least amount of detail, of course, is on the 17th and the 18th street side. So it's just a little hard to respond there. Just to me, I felt like there was a lot more detail in the other parts of the building and that just didn't quite resonate as much yeah doesn't feel as fleshed out as the other parts of building. That's what I'm trying to say, yeah well, I, think that it's also partly due to the fact that they're still doing some probing so they're, not quite sure the amount of historic fabric that is left, but you know overall I will share my comments on the storefront. I would say that 17 and 18 street I think are going to be restorative in nature, and it's going to be an improvement and it's going to be a you know, an appropriate improvement, not a halfway through, but you could have done better. Anything would be an improvement. You know compared to what is existing because of you know this hideous blocked out panel and those louvers, but I think what they're proposing is a good type of restoration that is going to be an enhancement to the neighborhood on Fifth Avenue I would say that, given that the existing storefronts are not historic and we're not losing any historic fabric, it is really important to keep in mind what climate we're in with a district that has gone through so much in the course of those past. You know nine months that is struggling tremendously in the end you know, storefronts are easy to fix easy to improve, they're constantly changing and it's kind of the nature of the beast, and we want once again, you know I've said it all the time these buildings need to remain good citizens, they need to be occupied, they need to fulfill the function that they fulfill retail office space. All of that good thing, that is, you, know the vibrancy of our city. They need the flexibility so that they can attract any potential tenant and I find that it is a you know, a trade-off that is acceptable, we're not losing anything and they really need this flexibility. So this is my interpretation of the storefronts. I have grave issues, as you could guess on the flagpole I think the flagpole is not appropriate and it is a very slippery slope because I can guarantee you that pretty much every single building on fifth Avenue and even more so on Broadway in the lady, small, historic district and probably in you know the rest of the city had a flagpole historically and you know, I will dig this article from the New York Times. You know featuring the fight of these preservationists of you know mid 20th century to actually rid the city of this clutter. We can not allow the clutter to come back. So those are my comments on the storefront and very eager to hear what others have to say. Any other comments on this on the storefronts. Any yeah Renee Cafero I, just want to like mimic what you said. I co-sign on the concern about the flagpoles, which is why I asked you to remind us all in the flagpole policy, though I tend to like them when they're already on a large building or if there was the hardware, some of the buildings have it and it's kind of an eyesore, so we're playing so putting a flagpole back is fine in that kind of instance. But with this where it's essentially kind of a new thing, they're going to put into the metal I'm slightly concerned that might set a bad precedent that that's going to be like a new version of signage. Yes, yeah, very much! So all right, other comments that would differ from Renee's and my comments. Okay, so seeing none! Let's move back to I want to go back to the new building, to add Karen's comments and see if there are any further comments on the new building, so Karen go ahead and pick up where you left it off, or so. Above about the second floor of that two-story entry, the building adjacent that it's contextual, that they were talking a lot in the beginning about lateral expansions. It seemed to miss the mark a little bit of an opportunity to bring another horizontal band over and you know I think the architecture is a good term when he said the details are more streamlined but like they're, very refined, like they're, very fine, like I wish, there was just a little bit more depth to things like the windowsills and you know, I mean I, think it's appropriate I, just and I think it's contextual. It's just reads a little bit flat to me. You know not really you know I, don't know hard to say I, don't know if it's enough to say I'm not in favor of it, but that's my opinion. Okay I want to hear from other members of the committee. If anybody else shares Karen's concerns, I see your handout hold on Richard, go ahead, I, basically I exactly share Karen's concerns in both directions, meaning I wish it was a little more richly textured as the way I would describe it rather than flat. But I just feel like it's not sufficient to say no, don't do that! The one thing I thought earlier, I think Karen. You said this issue of chamfering, and while there's more of that or it's broader I did see the reference to the I guess, it's called chamfering on the windows in the building adjacent. So that didn't bother me as much as it did the overall context of being a little more modern and a little less old style again and what Layla said is you know on a pastiche and I understood what they were saying: they're not trying to replicate it, but I thought even with the canopy, which is the separate question the canopy was. If we ended up having to have a canopy, it felt a little too modern. I would like to have seen something a little bit older, but that's a separate question whether you even support the canopy at all. Okay, you know it's. The use of words is just you know can be so powerful. If you want to. You know really distance yourself from the historic version. You say that you know you certainly don't want to. You know, do a pastiche because it has such a negative connotation. But, of course you can also phrase it as saying that you know it was not a pastiche, it's an homage and an homage sounds so much better. So you know I would hope that you know a more homage e design could be developed. That would bring a little bit more of the richness of the facade, and you know reintroduce I. Think denselation is an important element of any cornice and in this district I think you know 90 of the cornices in the lady's mouth or have this you know little dent design and I think it would be great if the applicant could introduce this these elements in the design. The applicant has made the request to address the comment on the canopy prior to us. Taking a vote I typically, you know we're in business sessions. So by now none of the applicant or the other attendees are allowed to speak I. Will I'm going to make an exception? I just want to hear what the applicant has to say on the canopy, but with the clear understanding that it's not a reiteration of what we already know, but you know an additional information that would, you know, be important for our deliberation. So if the applicant wants to comment on the canopy go ahead, I will allow it. Thank you so I think one thing that I think we haven't probably made stressed enough is the relationship to the canopy I. Think someone made a comment about the canopy feeling like it was large in relationship to the infill building and for us the canopy is really a function of the entire building, so this office building is a contiguous building that will be the largest one of the largest, if not the largest office, building on lower fifth avenue, and so the relationship of the canopy, in our estimation, should be considered in relationship to a 300,000 foot office, building versus in relationship to an infill building, and so that that's part of the scale for the canopy for us is to announce the largest office building on lower fifth avenue and have it commensurate with the scale of the offering, and so that's I think, a point that we didn't probably emphasize enough, which I just wanted to mention. Okay, your consideration I think someone made that so. Thank you, Madam chair, thank you. I will so we're back in business session from which will not move again. I will just reiterate that we don't comment on the use. We comment on the appropriateness, as you know, on a landmark and historic and streetscape viewpoint, and you know as much as it you know. The statement by the applicant is correct. The street streetscape alteration reads as a you know: narrow frontage building edition, and so you know this is what we're looking at. Renee has her hand up. Rene go ahead. Yeah I just wanted to quickly just comment again on this: it really doesn't matter what the intention is and the spirit of the building being the largest or whatever you know. The thing is that we're looking at the massing, we're looking at the buildings as is, and it from the outside, doesn't read as the largest building on fifth. No in that lower part, it reads as an enormous canopy on a smaller building, so what it might be internally, what it might be in their mind, I, don't think, should really affect how we feel about it, because the average person looking at this and also future buildings- and we don't know if they're in the future- this gets bought by two different companies and gets split up again or you have something else down the street. Who wrongfully thinks that that's one smaller building with that? We just get ourselves in a real pickle when it comes to you know, future applications, yeah I, think that you know the notion of precedent is really important here. There are I believe a couple of additional vacant lots in the ladies small historic district that have not gone through. You know with a development process, and you know we have to be mindful of that. I think that the majority of the recently built developments that occurred after the district was rezoned in 20, 2008 I believe most of them don't have a canopy I, think one of them got away with one and but the other buildings were not built with a canopy. So you know just for a little bit of context. Okay, so if I hear those of you who made comments, I think the issues that we have a role are, with the canopy, its existence altogether and its size and with the flagpoles the rest of the proposal, we feel is contextual, appropriate, actually, a positive improvement to the district. So we need to decide how bad we feel about this canopy its size and the flagpole Rene Cafaro, I'm picking on you again and you're picking on me and what we should do with the canopy I think we need to take the canopy issue like out like it needs to be Sep like if we can do like a deny unless they change the canopy or something like I, think enough. People talked about canopy being an issue that needs to be a stickler like that needs to be something that we need to focus on, because I know personally, I couldn't vote I like most of everything else that's going on, but especially the more people were talking about it. The more I'm a little concerned about that being a reason that if it was all bundled I, don't know if I could vote for it with the canopy and with the flagpoles. Those are my two sticking issues so and I know I'm not the only one with that, so I, don't know how you want to logistically. Do it well, you know, given that it is one application. We're gonna have to issue one resolution typically, when we have issues and concerns, and we want to basically you know, praise what we feel is really praise worthy and there's a lot with this particular application, but also flag for LPC. What is problematic the best you know, rhetoric and semantics to do. That is to issue a denial. Unless those aspects are altered- and you know, I could probably live with a smaller canopy. But you know the size of the proposed canopy is simply just absolutely yes, I agree, I'm fine, I'll clarify that like I, like any canopy I, don't know we can always talk about that, but, like this application that canopy that look, that messing, that's a problem, so yeah like a deny unless I think I, would support something like that. Just for what we're seeing in this right now, maybe not for like future canopies. So it looks like it would read like a denial unless the canopy is drastically reduced in its protrusion and the flagpoles are eliminated from the design. Those are I think those are the two sticking points that I have heard so far. There are some concerns that we can also add. The design of the cornice could be refined. The facade could be more textured. We can add those, but I didn't hear those as being like deal breakers. If that is not addressed, I can not support this proposal. Right I see some head shaking so okay, so it are there yeah Barbara go ahead, I think that's I mean I. Think you summed it up pretty well: I mean I, think that that's right, I, don't think those other things and I thought Karen did a good job of articulating that I, don't think they're deal breakers, but it would be nice to address it in the resolution. Okay, so the application will be. The motion will be an application emotion to deny unless the canopy is drastically reduced in its protrusion and the flagpoles are eliminated. It will also note a desire for more contextual and more richly detailed design for the facade. The windows and the cornice did I miss anything Barbara Karen. Any other comments that we want to add to this motion. I'm just curious, so I just want to ask a question to the group. So if the canopy is just simply cut back, but the design is the same, is that okay for the group or is it not just the size? I'm just curious, I, don't know if it's just because some people have said other things, I don't know. If anybody wants to address that I'll jump in I personally, don't have a problem with the design. I find that you know the curved sides of the canopy are actually a nice reference to the Bay window. That is adjacent and I think that it reads nicely because you know it espouses the same shape and the same material. So I don't have an issue with the design of the canopy. It's just that it really protrudes too much out. So that that's my comment, but I'm also very eager to hear what others have to say. Yeah I agree with you Laila and Barbara. You know, I wouldn't want to see it gone completely. I think it does have. There is a need for it, because it's hard to find the entrance to the building when you're that far off of the main avenue. So it does serve a purpose besides for a little bit of protection and shelter from the elements and a place to put the signage and some light at night when it's dark, so it is very functional. I do think it's oversized and if it was brought scaled back and the design was stayed relatively, the same I'd be fine with it. Okay, Richard yeah and in the context of that last discussion, I guess: there's two elements to the protrusion. One is just in general for canopies to be that far out, but the other is the discussion we had about the actual visual of what that building front is, as that it's inappropriate also just in terms of the scale of the building that it's fronting. Is that a fair way to describe the two pieces of the protrusion yeah? It is any other comments on any anything Barbara. You still have your hand up, no okay, all right, so the motion would be to deny unless the canopy is drastically reduced in its protrusion and the flat poles are eliminated comments on enriching the design of the facade, including the other cornice and praising the other aspects of the design, including the reduction and height of the rooftop edition, which is a vast improvement compared to the original proposal we reviewed last year. So that would be the motion and I need a second all right. Is everybody fine with the with emotion? Yes, now, let's take this to a vote? Buzz yes, Renee Cafaro, yes, James! Yes, Laura, yes, John, yes, Richard, yes, Mike, yes, Renee Kinsella, yes, Sam, yes, Chuck, yes, Janet, yes, Karen, yes, Barbara, yes, and the motion passes unanimously. Thank you very much to all for a great meeting and on that the meeting is adjourned. Thank you have a good evening. Everyone thank you.
