Just for your piece of information for a restorative project, on the facade which encompasses the entire street elevation and actually replicates some of the elements that are missing at the top in somewhat of a simplistic fashion, not as quite as decorative as it was originally.
I mean you can see on the upper right, hand, It's kind of blanked off and the orientation of the false pain of the divisions are oriented horizontally, which is kind of contradictory to the gothic style and contradictory to what was there originally moving down just lower the rectangular formatted windows, which are the main bulk of the windows and the facade again.
You know any historic material as much as I agree with Renee, I'm, not a fan of aluminum windows, but in this current application, I think that you know we're not losing anything.
This is an application for storefront alterations, Rooftop edition a landscaped roof at an existing building and a new building at the adjacent parking lot located at 9, West, 17th, street, and all of this is located in the lady, small, historic district, and we have the applicants and we're ready for your presentation.
We've been very involved through the years in the 14th street bid, creating the bid and the partnership creating the lower Fifth Avenue Association, and this application, which we're going to share, is an attempt to really modernize the building.
The presentation tonight is frankly redistributing some of that bulk with a new I, think, a very contextual urban infill building and a much more modest rooftop edition.
A new small, non-visible rooftop edition that'll, extend primarily along the wings of the building at 122 and then modifications to the storefronts at 17th, Street, 18th, Street and 5th Avenue, and then new flagpoles on Fifth Avenue.
First, that the new annex draws on the extensive history of lateral expansions in the historic district and that the design interprets the historic building its design, its articulation and materiality and a modern vocabulary, and that it maintains the prevailing street wall and height, reinforcing the streetscape.
Three street facades, 122 Fifth Avenue, was constructed in 1899 and to 1900, designed by Robert Manicki, who is prolific in the historic district.
It's a neo-renaissance style store and loft building 10 stories in height, the Fifth Avenue facade on the left is clad entirely in limestone and that's articulated as three monumental arches, with a rusted, very strong rusticated base capped by an attic story and a cornice, and then on the side, streets, the wings at 17th and 18th streets.
The left is the existing storefront and building entry at fifth Avenue, the storefronts date from about the past 10 years, and the entry in Phil is about 20 years old.
You, can see the 17th street wing and beyond that, you see the buildings that formerly occupied the site of the parking lot and here 120, which is this corner.
And then, of course, at the top right is the existing condition for the parking lot that was previously developed with a three-story building, which we see on the left.
That was designed by Mckim, Mead and White for the Golett family and that was constructed in 1885 and then that little one-story extension shows up sometime between 1915 and 1930 and then all of and then those two buildings which we see in the map on the right from 1930 are demolished in 1952 to make way for the parking lot which we see here in the 1980s tax photo pretty similar to the condition we see today.
More generally, as something when the department stores expanded, but it also happened in the general commercial buildings along the avenues and side streets and those expansions came in the form of additional stories.
In the immediate context of our building and the center view is actually directly across the street from our site, and that is a building proposed and designed by buyer, blender, Bell.
Here we're just going to share a couple of specific references for context, and here we look at those narrows those narrow, historic buildings, The three-story bases, where you have the punched openings in the third story and this double height expression at the base of the building, with the first two stories, that's divided by the spandrel, typically and then mullions and fenestration- that further break down the scale within the openings.
There, are flagpoles proposed on Fifth Avenue, which we'll see in the design, and here you can see that there's a long history of flagpoles at the building and in the context.
So historically there it changed over time, but there was one located in every bay of the building on fifth avenue at some point and.
And, so I think that that's a really magical shot, because so many of these have been clad over in the district and you don't have a sense of what they actually look like historically.
So, some of the existing materials that Aaron has already mentioned, of the limestone base, the kind of buff colored iron spot, brick on these facades on both 18th and 17th street.
You know the existing facades of these buildings provide so much depth and looking at ways to create that, in a modern facade, The two-story expression doing that by folding in referencing a little bit the stonework to the right at the tops of the window.
We'll talk a little bit more about how that's relating to the windows, but the double story: opening the metal trim matching and even in the detailing of the canopy picking up on the radius of the curved bay projecting window, that'll be restored.
So, as we kind of move up the building you'll see, You know some of these details of not only the depth in the metal in the stone work, but also in the metal work around the windows.
The six inch trim again intending to provide additional weight to the overall metal work in the facade and then the detailing of the canopy that will reach out that we have a little bit more information in a slide or two.
With that curving detail again picking up on the and trying to celebrate again the some of these details of curving, the existing Bay Windows and how we can incorporate that into the vocabulary of the ex of the annex and then a view from the street at eye level, showing it in context.
Line, brick of the existing 122 building, and you will see that over the three-story building on 18th street, so from here, I'm, going to jump to the rooftop.
We see the existing view from the southwest, so 17th street, at the bottom of the page and fifth avenue to the right.
Even, though these are not visible from the street, and we thought it was an important part of the building story, so that the pavilion itself has an expression that is referential to the Bay Windows at the street level and again calling back to the canopy that we talked about a little bit before and using then the lot line, brick and dark metals that are found throughout the rest of the project.
This is pushed back from the facade on Fifth Avenue and we'll show you in the views that it's not visible and then the pavilion is beyond as kind of the back part of the t of the building.
You see the elevator and the elevator core in the lot line, brick behind the three-story building along 18th street.
You know, even if it is further back, it's not visible once the annex building is filled in and then looking back at the Fifth Avenue first facade from 18th street, again testing that mechanical enclosure.
We have three frontages all slightly different, but share a common spirit, and the goal here is to really you know, bring back these historic bays as active parts of the building.
You can see the orientation of the building and the use of the parking lot as the elevator core and the arrival point for the building, and so we'll talk through 17th street and then move around the building Aaron already touched on these, but obviously the detailing of the Bay Windows on 17th and again on 18th street.
We, As Aaron mentioned, earlier, the we are looking to add an entry point into this bay as part of the activation of the street and restoring the historic transom and then replacing where needed below that in order to match with the existing historic detail, There's some existing areas where doors were that will be replaced to match the historic door.
So, the view as we're backing up toward fifth Avenue and seeing the Bay wind that Bay projection and the canopy beyond for the annex, So we're gonna, move to 18th street and similar strategies.
So the panels that I pointed out previously on 17th street, where we were looking to show the original intent, but maybe have them inactive here, We would be having two additional active doors that act as service entrances for the building and that view from 18th street and then Fifth Avenue, where there's zero historic fabric in the storefront itself.
Currently, the lobby in the middle and gap occupying both sides, The restoration here is really a kind of interpretation in order to have it marry well with the rest of the building, so we're showing a couple of conditions as possibilities that a future tenant could then undertake kind of an idealized scenario, would be center doors and then storefront with no doors locations for potential signage.
The, no door condition again, adding divided dividing the lights and the transom similar to the Bay Windows on 17th and 18th street, but keeping the flat, because these don't project into the sidewall keeping the current location of them, the side, door, access in the middle and the opportunity, if needed, where glass might be replaced for louver and then the door in the center.
Okay, Thank you and just to clarify the new entrance to the entire building will now be located on 17th street.
Let's start with that, as the first question: I think, primarily if it was one large user and the ownership could work out with them how to supply their air, then we may be able to remove the louvers, not knowing, where the retail mark it's going.
I know that at the beginning of all this, we were talking about how the building used to have flagpoles in all the bays.
You'll see the kind of the sill condition here in the right, hand, most bay, so we're proposing the North Bay and the South Bay on Fifth Avenue, the Middle Bay, we're not proposing to put here.
You know that gives a little bit of the context and the history behind this question, and it is particularly important to remember that Fifth Avenue is a visual corridor that has you know that has been noted both by LPC and by the design commission as being exceptional vista corridors.
I do I wanted to know what they used, how the rooftop edition will be used and also following up with Renee's questions about lighting.
I mean this is a this project is really a driver of the current economy and looking at the expense of upgrading a building to support a two-story plus rooftop penthouse and the cost to build that versus the benefits of infilling, a missing portion of the block, the Fl, the functionality of moving the elevator core into that location and offering a small much smaller, Rooftop present presence.
And I'm gonna, you know slide slowly into coming, but it seems to protrude really far in above the sidewalk, and it looks on one of the renderings that it is actually protruding all the way to the curbside right.
And here is the facade restoration work at 114 fifth, which is across 17th street to the south.
It looks like that there is no visibility from any street right.
I mean I, Think in general, we're hoping this building tells a bit of a story of referencing, the existing being contextual being respective of the existing, but clearly showing a more slightly more contemporary take.
The rooftop pavilion I am in the South East corner of the building, which puts me on Fifth Avenue.
The work you did on the rooftop design and the building next door in the lot.
Let's start with the new proposed building on 17th street.
I think that the really shiny metal you know the lighting and all that it does seem a little bit more modern than some of the canopies that are, you know, braced to the building, with diagonally kind of like what we've seen in the old school canopies.
You know like quasi-sliver buildings, So it's really a problem, and you know if we need to really entertain the thought of a canopy.
Those are my comments for the building, otherwise, I feel that the design and the proportion and the massing are really good, and you know very elegant I, really like the use of the cast stone.
I. Think that you know the bulk of our concern is really with the new building, But let's stay with comments on the storefront.
Basically it is the proposed master plan on Fifth Avenue, and you know the possibility that there would be.
You know compared to what is existing because of you know this hideous blocked out panel and those louvers, but I think what they're proposing is a good type of restoration that is going to be an enhancement to the neighborhood on Fifth, Avenue, I would say that, given that the existing storefronts are not historic and we're not losing any historic fabric, It is really important to keep in mind what climate we're in with a district that has gone through so much in the course of those past.
I just want to hear what the applicant has to say on the canopy, but with the clear understanding that it's not a reiteration of what we already know.
The street streetscape alteration reads as a you: know: narrow frontage building edition, and.
Okay, So if I hear those of you who made comments, I think the issues that we have a role are, with the canopy, its existence altogether and its size and with the flagpoles the rest of the proposal, we feel is contextual, appropriate, actually, a positive improvement to the district.
The, more I'm, a little concerned about that, being a reason that if it was all bundled I, don't know if I could vote for it with the canopy and with the flagpoles.
I, don't know we can always talk about that, but, like this application that canopy that look, that messing, that's a problem.
