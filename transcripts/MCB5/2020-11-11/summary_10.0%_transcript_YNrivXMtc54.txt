If it was important enough to share it on the website as well, for each of the individual committees or what we've done, you know as a board as a whole, so any thoughts or changes or additions that you may have will be really.
I think for for what'll come out of bex, but the two DOT presentations were two topics, and we kind of received interim reports on both and no board action was required or would frankly do anything at this time.
The Tne meeting that will happen in two weeks is potentially assigning the topic to two to four members of the committee sort of along the lines of what we did with the bike sharing issue in the past, to give them kind of ample time to research, contact, elected official offices and sort of figure out what it makes sense to essentially adopt as a as a dedicated position of CB5, as opposed to just like sticking in calls for enforcement to every other resolution that we pass so I sort of wanted to flag it as something that we're thinking about doing, get people's thoughts as to whether or not there would be any complications or problems with that.
I can certainly respond to dave if we decide to move forward in this way, and let him know that that we are going to do that kind of thing.
You know I, think there are specific people on T E who are very vocal about the issue joel, who he cc'd when he emailed us one of them.
It was John Rayburn in the past yep, but we also think that you know we have not had a lot of agenda items.
And you know, I was thinking aj that it would come to committee for discussion, with.
No, you know just to keep it, get the ball rolling on what we're going to do, or were you thinking of having some sort of a resolution or position.
Think we've, you know, I, have you know sort of come to the realization that yelling at D.O.T to do more really does not accomplish anything, because they do not feel like they have any enforcement authority and as far as I can tell they do not yelling at NYPD.
You know I do not want to say for sure that we would come up with a specific board.
Lane resolutions come to us we're going to start getting pushback on every single one, where we just deny for no without having a position.
I did not know if people had known about it or not, but I thought it was interesting that the city has agreed not to send the police on mental health calls, but instead they're going to send mental health professionals along with the.
Okay, so I have a report, but I do not know that you need to a few people came to the to the committee.
If you go through the list, you'll see you know, in the capital, side, purchasing ipads, making sure that Wi-fi is available and accessible to every student in the district, making sure that there's a mental health professional, which is something that we have supported with resolutions in each of our schools, I'm, not going to go through each one.
Okay going down the list like I, see expense, requests.
Unless you want me to go through the a report about the voting issues that we heard about a lot of it had to do.
There are two issues that are two bills that are constitutional amendments at the state level that we need to keep our eye on that are going to be voted on by referendum, but they have to pass to successive legislatures.
You know very easily, reversible interventions to to a landmark building and we issued a denial unless the master plan would be altered to replace the previously approved h sign with the proposed blade sign, and it was a unanimous vote.
I. Just one little pla thing that I wanted to add one of the committee members yet again objected to the wording of the the resolve and felt that a conditional approval would be preferable to deny unless so, once again.
Could you please either agree to this or come back without you know the way you always talk about it and that it really works that you do get applicants that come back after we've given a full denial and that even a deny unless gets what we want faster or better than a conditional.
I mean I think we have to keep emphasizing the fact that we are advisory and by you know, being advisory for us to take the strongest road and the strongest position and try and get the most out of it by negotiating or cajoling.
You know, I, think that the there's also a DOB issue, here.
We touched on it very briefly at the at the committee meeting, but I would be really inclined to actually reach out to the department of buildings, and you know flag.
You know it's an issue that has been in front of of the transportation and Environment Committee.
It's an issue that you know like touches.
You know pretty much from 45Th street all the way to to 57, and we think that it is an opportunity of a lifetime to actually improve them.
You know whose custody is going to be shared between the Parks, Committee and Tna, but and online views.
As little you just I would please let me know either way and for those of you who have meetings when you do not, especially if you do not have voting items.
It's one of the things they're looking at specifically are how we keep minutes and the transparency of meetings and meeting notes, so I will find out about actual committee meetings and what is going to be required, but I think, probably just as good practice.
There should be some committee notes for everything and also we're now going to put them on the website or regular or full board meeting.
You know I mean it's like I can show you.
They should come to the board office because there's ever a question, there's ever an issue.
So you know a different person on the committee takes the minutes at each meeting, but that's really what we did.
I mean like who on the committee is going to take notes.
