From this vantage point, here's another view of the building looking west from times square along 42nd street, and you can see the building is now part of a fabric of high rises, and you know more obscured, obviously than it used to be by their presence tower roof at 130.
That is, you know, quite nicely matches aged copper, and we would have that green This system of roofing has been installed on other historic buildings in new york city, including the lower roof of the new york stock exchange and, while not a landmark, a significant building at 250, west 52nd street This slide is a view of the roof, as it is today, with the black modified bitumen and with the patina green surface that we would end up with with our proposed re-roofing I think it must have been one bryant park or the conde nast.
The entire roof area will be scaffolded, there will be sidewalk, bridging and as in terms of the occupancy of the building, that this area is well above any occupied part of the building okay, so seeing none I will move to open up the floor to members of the public members of the public You have questions or comments to this application.
That's at the northwest corner of 18th street and fifth avenue, and this is for the retail space at the ground floor and it was formerly or most recently occupied by the express proposals for new storefronts signage and to create a new entry in the easternmost bay on 18th street New entry will include automatic doors to allow for unobstructed access, and that's in that easternmost bay on 18th street and, as we all know, today, pharmacies are providing more critical health care services in addition to the pharmacy needs and access for disabled and other escorted customers who need assistance through the doors is critical.
But this is the original condition, and so what you see there are projecting storefronts which were original to the building, and there is a an entry included, a little farther down a couple of entries actually on 18th street and those existed from the time of construction until the early 1920s Also of note is the signage which, when you're in full view, rises up the full height of the of that corner, pier and the signage along the base of the building the tendency of the the retail space changes to a bank- and this is this happens along fifth avenue All of the encroachments on fifth avenue.
At that point, the storefronts, the infill and signage all change and evolve as the commercial use and So now I think I'll pass the presentation over to richard who can walk you through the design details good evening So this as aaron said we're on the north northwest corner of 5th avenue and 18th street we're going to start with 18th street with the elevations and then move on to the fifth avenue So these the existing elevations in the top of 18th street and the proposed at the bottom.
For compliance with new york city energy code and the biggest change is that the current storefront is equally divided in typically in three bays in the largest modules, and the new proposed storefront is reflecting these historical modules that aaron alluded to in the photographs which don't provide equal lights In this bay, the remaining store front, is being removed and replaced with the new double glazed units, and this is the bay on the end where the new sliding door assembly is being inserted.
Think the in terms of the overall design Karen also had a question on the the rolling grill the security gurl is existing, but I don't know if you're going to use it david We typically don't use them, because it's open, 24 hours, correct right, The security grills exist behind the metal panels that replaced the where with the transoms would have been, and so with the new storefront system, there's an entirely new glazed transom and instead of having an opaque panel there, we just will use back paint or film to obscure the area behind, so that whoever uses the storefront next has the ability to open that back up again if they want as a storefront transom Thank.
I, don't see anybody, okay, any questions from members of the public on this application, We will move back to a business session for comments by members of the committee First, one is that automatic doors on fifth avenue in a the history district, especially the ladies now in a building that is so prominent, is a very problematic I.
That will certainly have an impact on the general district So. Those are my two comments, but I would like to hear more from members of the committee and I'm interested to hear what everyone else has to say on this before I can vote brilliantly done, but I think that, given the contextual responsibilities we have to this beautiful building and the presidents that has been set in the area that the rationale for this being a convenience build business We know it is not enough to, in my opinion, make way for these type of doors, and also this generous and or excessive amount of light, and how it will impact contextually, this part of town as well as this building I'm across the street, from it The doors slide open for me, I'll just put in a boat for let them have the sliding doors, because if we don't let them have it, then maybe they can't be there at all.
This is the the w hotel I'm a partner at fire department, architects and we're here in reference to proposed rooftop alterations to the w hotel building on 17th and park avenue The proposed alteration that you'll see today is part of actually a planned, broader interior renovation of the hotel, its first renovation, since it opened back in 2000 really so it's sort of been over 20 years that it's sort of you know There are a number of infrastructure upgrades that are necessary as part of this renovation, which includes mechanical and life safety changes, as well as a programmatic change to be able to occupy and use the roof.
The building was designated as an individual landmark in the city by landmarks commission, which takes us to 1999 2000, which was which was the conversion of this office, building into the w hotel that we know today right Obviously the signage changed to w union square, but keeping in terms of the historical signs.
These are the elements that we're proposing to modify to be able to sort of tackle the the two-pronged approach of trying to deal with the infrastructure upgrades that we need to do on the building and also to provide rooftop access for people and for the public One of the first modifications that we wanted to make was to actually raise well, first of all, was to sort of clear it as much as we could along the southwest corner of the roof.
The design of the in the structure itself was really carefully chosen and have some slides of what the system is, but it's essentially sort of an l-shaped lean to series of panels that are leaning up against the the bulkhead itself and they actually can open up The strategy with this with sort of this idea of this lean to structure is that we could keep the eve line as low as possible to minimize the sight line effect when viewing it from the street and the second piece of it was we intentionally chamfered this corner the southwest corner again, with an eye to this idea of sort of minimizing the sight line from the street We, not only sort of have a more visible sight line from the street, but we're also sort of encroaching upon sort of the w portion of the terrace is that it could open up which allows you know w hotel that actually uses in different ways in ways that we may not even know how we're going to use it today, given sort of the situation we are in our country, but this allows us to have the outdoor space and indoor space and be able to use it in a very flexible manner, all right This is just the existing plan of the roof diagramming the generator park Avenues on the left, septing street is, is running along the bottom of the page and again so.
So you'll, see how we've you know intentionally taken the proposed structure and sort of tied it back to the bulkhead and sort of you know, leaned up against it, creating a setback along its full perimeter, which currently doesn't exist as well again, providing a little bit more relief from the sign and also the ability for people to be able to actually go up the edge of the building Of course.
The south elevation of the building again you'll see the w sign cooling tower the big mechanical unit that currently exists and the proposed glass structure that is sort of right behind the sign there set back in replace of that piece of equipment, as well as the expanded bulkhead that you can see sort of further beyond on the north east corner of the building on the park avenue side, you can see sort of the same comparison from what is today, the generator the bulkhead The piece of equipment which you can actually see in this comparison is shows how close it is to the sign versus what we are proposing here again, a very sort of simple formal structure up on the roof here that kind of just cleans up the roof line that may be visible minimally visible from the street and then the third facade is the east or I.
This portion here is the stair bulkhead and portion of the elevator bulkhead, and the portion back in the northeast corner is the expanded, bulkhead housing, the generator We can see it, and then the image on the right is the pretty close approximation of where we took the first photos a few months ago, but with the mock-up So. From this vantage point, which is basically from the farmers market middle of the square, roughly 16th street, looking back at the building, there's actually really no difference between existing proposed or the mock-up We sort of slide ourselves down park, avenue south towards 15th street and look back towards the building.
We do acknowledge that on the you know, a northeast facade there's a little bit of visibility from this generator enclosure and it looks like we have a motion to approve and we need a second all right, final vote of the evening.
