I will open up the floor to members of the public for questions and comments to the application.
Over the past several years, beginning in 2012, a great deal of historic restoration and preservation works been done on the building, including restoration of the 42Nd Street storefront, replacing a more modern replacement that had been there for many years at the higher floors of the building.
This is a view of the building looking west on 42Nd Street, and it is the point of view from the public sidewalk, where the roof is most visible.
Even from this vantage point, here's another view of the building looking west from Times Square along 42Nd Street, and you can see the building is now part of a fabric of high rises, and you know more obscured, obviously than it used to be by their presence.
West 42Nd street is a hip roof structure that is was originally roofed in Baton, Seam, copper and the reason that we're meeting tonight and presenting to you tonight This is a steel armature that used to support a decorative Florida lee that was installed one at the north end and one at the south end of the roof.
Additionally, during the construction, phase, handling, the liquid membrane and its reinforcement, layers, which are lightweight fleeces and like, is much safer to do in the confined and steep areas above 42nd street, as well versus handling large sheets of formed, copper, A benefit of using the liquid membrane product also is it does come in a very good, patina, green version.
Are you know, ordinarily, a sound and sturdy way of connecting a copper roof to a building, but at this height and subject to the weather that we're seeing, we feel it's prudent to have something that is even more secure securely attached to the building such that should any portion of it begin to loosen all of the square inches of material adjacent to it remain tight.
It's, going to be a new CBS location It was formerly or most recently, occupied by the express proposals for new storefronts signage and to create a new entry in the easternmost bay on 18th, street.
New entry will include automatic doors to allow for unobstructed access, and that's in that easternmost bay on 18th street and.
The entry on the left is the existing Fifth Avenue building entry and then they sort of sandwich a storefront on one single storefront on Fifth Avenue on 18th street It's, a freight entry.
This is the original condition, and so what you see there are projecting storefronts, which were original to the building, and there is a an entry included, a little farther down a couple of entries actually on 18th street and Those existed from the time of construction until the early 1920s.
Ours goes away in the early 20s with the introduction of the bank at the at the retail space, and so here you can see that configuration that I was describing the large central bay, flanked by two narrower bays in the in the Fifth Avenue Storefront and then and then shifts in signage, on the corner, pier and at the at the sign band at the second floor, cornice and a spectacular array of light bulbs at that point, Photo Richard, Oh great, thank you and then 1940s tax photo shows consistent, storefront configuration new signage, and all of this is you know very typical in the historic district , the storefronts, the infill and signage all change and evolve as the commercial use And So now I think I'll pass the presentation over to Richard who can walk you through the design details, good evening.
These the existing elevations in the top of 18th street and the proposed at the bottom, the obviously we're retaining the historical detail at the bulkhead and the cornice above and below the new storefront.
The storefront is, is being updated to a double glazed system for compliance with New York City, Energy Code, and the biggest change is that the current storefront is equally divided in typically in three bays in the largest modules and the new proposed storefront is reflecting these historical modules that Aaron alluded to in the photographs which do not provide equal lights.
This bay, the remaining store front, is being removed and replaced with the new double glazed units, and this is the bay on the end where the new sliding door Assembly is being inserted.
We have open hours, which is applied vinyl on the on the new door and a static sign on the exterior of the building.
Is that the idea is that when people are escorted, clients, customers that come in, if someone needs assistance, you can't physically hit an actuator, have out swinging doors and then be able to like smoothly enter the space with someone who's accompanied or if a person is in a wheelchair.
Obviously, people are coming and going to work and lunch time and when things are getting busy, we like to create the most convenient access to the store as possible.
I. Do not believe that there are any automatic doors of that type on fifth avenue and, as we know, precedence do matter, and we certainly do not want to.
You know if this is a roll out, just like every other CD cvs in a non- historic landmark, building.
It looks like we have a number of issues with this application: The sliding door being won the amount of signage and the amount of illumination.
I did want to note that this proposal does not seek any changes to any of the historic facade elements of the building.
That sort of runs the entire length along 17th street and at the time, represent the name of the company that the building was built for which In 1940, one of the sort of the most significant changes to the facade was that the balcony on the 16th floor actually got removed and we could not figure out.
When there was a renovation of the infrastructure portion of the building, where two cooling towers were installed on the roof sort of directly behind the guardian light sign.
These views back to the building from Union square, looking acrosss towards the building or from the south, or from the east, looking back west to the western facade of the building, and you can kind of see that today there are some equipment that are quite visible up on the roof With, that in mind, if we just focus in on the rooftop itself, we're actually able to dig up the original drawing for the roof plan, which is kind of interesting.
So, those sort of the big pieces, as well as some internal equipment that was added within the existing bulkheads Then this is sort of a pictorial view of those three stages as well as it was built as it looked from the 1960s with the two cooling towers and where what it looks like largely today, right with the with the equipment up on the roof.
This is a little key plan on the side, but you can see the the generator that's sort of sitting up there facing park, Avenue South the cooling tower and then sort of this maze of ductwork and this large piece of mechanical equipment sort of right behind the W Union square.
These are the elements that we're proposing to modify to be able to sort of tackle the the two- pronged approach of trying to deal with the infrastructure upgrades that we need to do on the building and also to provide rooftop access for people and for the public.
The stair bulkhead needs to also rise up as well, because we need to be able to get people out onto the roof We also wanted to provide and need to provide elevator access for ADA access up to the group, which, of course, for the 110 years of this history, of the building that that's not currently, exist.
We need to figure out what to do with this large piece of mechanical equipment, and we figured sort of a smart way to split that up and relocate that to the eastern side of the roof, and the other piece was to rethink what we did with the generator.
The design of the in the structure itself was really carefully chosen and have some slides of what the system is, but it's essentially sort of an l- They actually can open up, and the strategy with this with sort of this idea of this lean to structure is that we could keep the Eve line as low as possible to minimize the sight line effect when viewing it from the street and The second piece of it.
, it's our strong belief as well, that you know any sort of new addition that we place on a historic building ought to be of today's time.
It should be distinctly different than the style of the historic portion of the building, and we believe that sort of a glass and metal enclosure like this could certainly accomplish that and be sleek and as well as be minimally visible, Is that it could open up which allows you know w hotel that actually uses in different ways in ways that we may not even know how we're going to use it.
So you'll see how we've you know intentionally taken the proposed structure and sort of tied it back to the bulkhead and sort of you, know, leaned up against it, creating a setback along its full perimeter, which currently does not exist as well again, providing a little bit more relief from the sign and also the ability for people to be able to actually go up the edge of the building.
The south elevation of the building again you'll, see the W sign cooling tower the big mechanical unit that currently exists, and the proposed glass structure that is sort of right behind the sign there set back in replace of that piece of equipment, as well as the expanded bulkhead that you can see sort of further beyond on the North East corner of the building.
The piece of equipment which you can actually see in this comparison is shows how close it is to the sign versus what we are proposing here: again, a very sort of simple formal structure up on the roof.
We sort of slide ourselves down Park, Avenue, South towards 15th street and look back towards the building.
So, we went past 14th street, we're actually mid block between 14th and 13th on broadway, looking back at the building, right.
It's, going to rise up to the height of the existing wall, And, it will expand towards the south for us to be able to house the generator and 5 is a view from acrosss the park on 15Th Street and Union Square West, looking back at the building, and here likewise you can see actually, from this vantage point of the generator, the Rtu and the cooling tower and as proposed.
