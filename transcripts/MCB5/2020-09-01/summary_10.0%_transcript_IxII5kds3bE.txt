Also we want to be mindful of the time of the committee members and other applicants.
I will open up the floor to members of the public for questions and comments to the application.
The bush tower is a 1916-1918 construction, vintage high-rise, building on 42nd street south side of the block between broadway and sixth avenue.
Over the past several years, beginning in 2012, a great deal of historic restoration and preservation works been done on the building, including restoration of the 42nd street storefront, replacing a more modern replacement that had been there for many years at the higher floors of the building.
This is a view of the building looking west on 42nd street, and it is the point of view from the public sidewalk where the roof is most visible.
Even from this vantage point, here's another view of the building looking west from times square along 42nd street, and you can see the building is now part of a fabric of high rises, and you know more obscured, obviously than it used to be by their presence tower roof at 130.
New entry will include automatic doors to allow for unobstructed access, and that's in that easternmost bay on 18th street and.
130 fifth avenue is an 11 story, store and loft building constructed in 1902 and 1903, designed by robert maneke, who was prolific in the historic district.
I think, but this is the original condition, and so what you see there are projecting storefronts, which were original to the building, and there is a an entry included, a little farther down a couple of entries actually on 18th street and those existed from the time of construction until the early 1920s.
Ours goes away in the early 20s with the introduction of the bank at the at the retail space, and so here you can see that configuration that I was describing the large central bay, flanked by two narrower bays in the in the fifth avenue storefront and then and then shifts in signage, on the corner, pier and at the at the sign band at the second floor, cornice and a spectacular array of light bulbs at that point,, the storefronts, the infill and signage all change and evolve as the commercial use and So now.
These the existing elevations in the top of 18th street and the proposed at the bottom, the obviously we're retaining the historical detail at the bulkhead and the cornice above and below the new storefront.
I will open up the floor to questions from members of the committee.
We, matched the facade and we have the sliding doors there, also to the left on 6th avenue and washington street, where we did receive landmarks, approval.
Is that the idea is that when people are escorted, clients, customers that come in, if someone needs assistance, you can't physically hit an actuator, have out swinging doors and then be able to like smoothly enter the space with someone who's accompanied or if a person is in a wheelchair.
The security gurl is existing, but I don't know if you're going to use it david We typically don't use them, because it's open, 24, hours, correct, right , The security grills exist behind the metal panels that replaced the where with the transoms would have been, and so with the new storefront system.
Obviously, people are coming and going to work and lunch time and when things are getting busy, we like to create the most convenient access to the store as possible.
Okay, so seeing none, we will move back to a business session for comments by members of the committee.
I also was thinking initially about the accessibility issue for someone, but My understanding is the existing door, is ada, accessible, The first thing that jumped out at me was the amount of signage that cvs red is definitely bright, red and the fact that the lower walls behind the windows, the display wall will be very low, that very bright, concentrated fluorescent light will also be quite visible from the street, which again is interior, but cbs in general just gives off a very different feel to the to the neighborhood, but a lot of signage, a lot of it bright, red.
It looks like we have a number of issues with this application: The sliding door being won the amount of signage and the amount of illumination.
That was sort of the this one piece that on the facade that actually changed, and so the rest of the building has largely kind of stayed.
There was a storefront replacement program on the ground floor, which leads us to sort of the first major change on the roof which occurred in 1960 when there was a renovation of the infrastructure portion of the building, where two cooling towers were installed on the roof sort of directly behind the guardian light sign, and this was going to be consistent as we move forward in time by 1988.
This is a little key plan on the side, but you can see the the generator that's sort of sitting up there facing park, avenue south the cooling tower and then sort of this maze of ductwork and this large piece of mechanical equipment sort of right behind the w union square.
These are the elements that we're proposing to modify to be able to sort of tackle the the two-pronged approach of trying to deal with the infrastructure upgrades that we need to do on the building and also to provide rooftop access for people and for the public.
The stair bulkhead needs to also rise up as well, because we need to be able to get people out onto the roof We also wanted to provide and need to provide elevator access for ada access up to the group, which, of course, for the 110 years of this history, of the building that that's not currently exist.
Here so adding to that, then we're we wanted to also look at how we would create an enclosable space, a functional space up on the roof, so that it could be used, year-round guests and the public could come up the roof and really sort of be able to enjoy.
So you'll, see how we've you know intentionally taken the proposed structure and sort of tied it back to the bulkhead and sort of you, know, leaned up against it, creating a setback along its full perimeter, which currently doesn't exist as well again, providing a little bit more relief from the sign and also the ability for people to be able to actually go up the edge of the building.
You know actually be a little bit closer to the sign itself and also be able to have a slightly different vantage point, looking back down to union square.
Since, the south elevation of the building again you'll see the w sign, cooling tower, the big mechanical unit that currently exists, and the proposed glass structure that is sort of right behind the sign there set back in replace of that piece of equipment, as well as the expanded bulkhead that you can see sort of further beyond on the north east corner of the building on the park, avenue side, you can see sort of the same comparison from what is today, the generator.
That may be visible minimally visible from the street The third facade is the east, Or, I guess, the west facade facing facing the east, which shows the enlarged bulkhead, where the generator would be housed and there's a couple points here that I just I just wanted to call out one is: The increase in height will match the existing party wall, the existing parapet wall that exists on the north side of the building, so we're not going any higher than that.
Roughly 16th street, looking back at the building, there's, actually really no difference between existing proposed or the mock-up.
We sort of slide ourselves down park, avenue south towards 15th street and look back towards the building.
You any other questions on this application from members of the committee.
