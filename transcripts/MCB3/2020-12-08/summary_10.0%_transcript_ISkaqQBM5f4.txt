Applicants will have a chance to respond, and then the committee members will discuss and come to a resolution and with that being said, Alex.
The applicant submitted a statement that it is applying for hotel wine license with second, with its second floor, closing at one A.M Sunday through Wednesday: two a.m: through Thursday through Saturday, a ground floor lobby closing at 12 A.M Sunday through Wednesday, two A.M Thursday through Saturday Ground floor outdoor seating on Orchard Street, closing at 10 pm Sunday through Wednesday and 11 pm Thursday through Saturday Ground floor outdoor seating on Allen Street, closing at 11 pm Sunday through Wednesday and 12 A.M Thursday through Saturday and 12th, for if they put 12 floor.
It's the rooftop closing at 2 A.M Sunday through Wednesday and 1 A.M. Thursday through Saturday, while the tavern wine is limited to its second floor.
In November of 2016 and approved with stipulations to operate a tavern lounge with prep area serving food, all hours having service and sale of alcohol, limited to the second floor, Having hours of 9 am to 8 pm all days, having no music, having no kitchen having no speakers tvs or monitors installing soundproofing along the walls and installing soundproof barriers and planters along the parapet.
Walls on this floor, having happy hours to 8 pm, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials having its entrance through either the Orchard Street or Allen Street entrance, maintaining low-level lighting not having weight lines and having to step outside and not seeking an upgrade.
It's just closed facade that the second floor is actually an open arcade which we'll I guess we'll get into.
It, says one private party per night, no pub, crawls or party buses happy hours to 8 pm, no wait lines and plans to use the lobby as a waiting area for the second floor.
Having people responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the particular specs for the public spaces would be the hotel's 460 square feet with a capacity of 15.
And I'm, going to ask that the applicant is making your presentation that you include actual opening hours for the spaces, because all I have are closing hours so closing at 12, A.M Sunday through Wednesday 2 A.M Thursday through Saturday no bar food service from the prep area.
It, says all hours of the second floor bar cafe is 1400 square feet.
It says, surf food service from the prep area recorded background music.
Closing at 12 A.M Sunday through Wednesday 1, am Thursday through Saturday, no barn or food service recorded background Music Orchard, Street, Ground, Floor patio, it's 360 square feet, capacity, 16 core table 16 feet.
Closing at 10 am Sunday through Wednesday 11, Pm Thursday through Saturday no bar, and it says what you may have to explain: food from prep area purchased in hotel, no music, I, assume that meant people are buying the food inside and bringing it outside and sitting down.
The proposed closing hours are 11 P.M Sunday through Thursday 12, A.M Thursday, through Saturday and in response to proximity to residential windows, which is a component of our hotel, application.
You know this is a new applicant, a new client for us, but they had originally applied for hotel liquor and were not I.
No physical, alterations, Being made, The idea would be to expand it to a hotel, wise hotel wine license to allow room service in the interior lounge and on the roof and the outdoor spaces outside the pro part of the problem.
The principles could probably give you a better idea of exact opening hours, because of course you know there is your breath when the hotel is open, which is not now there is breakfast served.
I wasn't here when they applied for the liquor license, but I was here as soon as we just received the liquor license to be able to do this, so I've been operating the space for since it's been open and since we've started being able to serve on the second floor, make a couple of points.
You know the Orchard Street hotel, it's a small 50 room hotel that is almost like a select service with a little bit food and beverage.
We use it as a really as a amenity to the gas to be able to drive sales and be able to make sure that the guests have a good experience than just here's, a hotel, room, and then you know, and that that's it.
So I'll try to focus the conversation a little bit more because I'm not getting the information that at least I think I, need, or my committee members need to be able to construct any kind of resolution.
If it was just currently how it's set up, it'd probably be like we were opening at four before, but I would say maybe a little earlier in the weekends, maybe like, maybe at 12 o'clock, because the thing is just whatever need I need you to give a specific time, because I'm going to construct a resolution of stipulations from those times or I'm, going to change.
So then, The proposed opening time for the second floor area would still be consistent with the 4 pm.
Our hotel is very small, So. You know personally I think that it should be 12 p.m. In most spaces, because, if someone's having lunch and they just it's really just walking down the side, It's not a large place with lots of different areas, but I'm not negotiating with you.
If, you want to put it that way, you know floors three through 11 are 24 hours, because it's a hotel, No. I'm asking about the check-in.
On, the second floor, Do you actually have another area where food is served.
Okay, all right, I'm only clarifying that, because Elsie said it would come from the lobby, so I just wanted to make sure that it clarified that no I think okay.
If you can speak to this now, rather than us having to go into more of a discussion about it later, you might be able to answer these questions up front, which would clarify everything for the committee and anybody who's listening, and it was an open air arcade with four foot parapet walls and then this funny not really like glass or plexiglass barrier that went from the fourth foot to the ceiling on both sides.
So I'm asking: has there been any DOB plans to con to change the structure so that it's foreign closed and has have any soundproofing efforts been made with respect to the second floor, which was part of our stipulations in 2016.
Okay, and the final question I have is with respect to this rooftop, which in which you're proposing to have recorded background music.
Let me tell I think it's on orchard actually, where we right now currently we'll be throwing refresh so deliveries on Allen, Street, Happy hours to 8 pm in any publicly accessed area.
We're responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside and directing vehicles, So with respect to the lobby, I would say, operates as a check-in out area, seating area for guests waiting area for people going to the second floor, bar cafe with food service during all hours of operation.
The second floor, prep area recorded background music hours of 12 p.m. Does anybody, Let me ask the committee members, so the proposed hours are 12 A.M Sunday through Wednesday, two A.M Thursdays.
So, then it's 12 p.m, to 12, A.M Sunday through Wednesday, 12 pm to 2 A.M Thursday through Saturday, and having a close fix facade with no open doors or windows.
And I will say this with respect to hours of operation, The applicant is asking to close at 10 Sunday through Wednesday 11th Thursday through Saturdays our standard in terms of what we approve for outdoor spaces, 10 p.m. On orchards, Our standard on Allen Street, although there are fewer, has been the closest nearest approval has been for 10 pm.
Also, so that's 140 Allen, which is the block below this building, so I, would propose just changes in the hours of operation for closing at 10 pm.
It's no food or alcohol service, but food and alcohol available for purchase from the second floor bar cafe is that correct.
We're approving them, with an actual like found plan to address music on the roof in any kind of capacity.
The positions below the parapet- walls, yes, okay, all right and then with respect to hours of operation, I would just propose 12 p.m, to 12 a.m. Be service up there, but they are gonna, be able to buy their drinks and take them up.
You know the plan is not to have we're not going to have like a portable bar up there, where people can.
It was approved background music, I have to double check, but I think my understanding was that they went to the liquor authority in this.
So, with respect to the second floor, So the method of operation would be the bar cafe with prep areas serving food all hours of operation, then we have to I guess, address music at proposed hours and our original stipulations were for soundproofing along the north and south walls, consistent with the recommendations of the sound engineer and sound baffling materials and vegetation in front of the nano walls at Orchard, Street now and street.
Open Air, Terrace, Open, operated from 9, am to 9 pm, notify and request approval for class change and ambient background recorded music, no promoted, events.
I know it was proposed, but from the applicant it hasn't happened, but in order to build the hotel to the height it wanted it had to leave that second floor open.
Now we have a space that has been playing recorded, background music, but hasn't been open.
You know I just turned on the music and went to the rooms right upstairs, because you know that was really our main business to make sure the guests don't have complaints.
Know, security personnel at this type of hotel, okay.
Sorry I think the idea was that you would never have multiple people booking various spaces, but that, If somebody had like, if there was a birthday party or an event in one in the cafe, there would be no other events.
The cafe could be a private dining, A private party, like anybody like any restaurant, would be able to do a private, it's already advertised as an event, space, so you're saying that any event would be confined to the second floor.
I, also understand from your website that it may apply to a business event for people who are staying at the hotel if they want to use the space.
Okay, So the other warehouse clauses I, would put that this is this hotel has been operating since 2014 with the tavern license since 2017, but is in an area surrounded by licensed businesses, including hotels and I, would reference that the conditions in the end is adjacent to residential apartment buildings on both sides of the building on both Orchard and Allen Street that consequently, We would approve this application with stipulations governing the use of the hotel and the public spaces and specifically addressing the extent of the use and bound attenuation or mitigation for the spaces.
Says, recorded music, no outdoor space on the first floor in basement.
That's, the SLA notice or the notice to the Fla. The previous applicant was approved in Opi, license in September of 2003, with stipulations not to have djs and to have a bar no longer than 10 feet, and it was heard for renewal in March of 2010.
There were complaints of noise from the open facade, and we approved additional stipulations to replace the speakers with smaller speakers that would be repositioned off the Avenue B wall and below the ceiling level and to install a limiter.
Add djs increase the bar size and change the hours from 4 pm to 4 am all days, and we have proved with stipulations that the facade would be close to 10.
Music, have djs in the basement, not have live, music, promoted and scheduled performances or events with covers, not host pub calls or party buzzes not apply for alteration without first coming before the community board and then approving security, Friday and Saturday for 10 pm.
The diagram shows what looks like a 19 foot by 8 foot bar with 13 stools, three tables with 18 seats, compress seats, comprised of a chairs and a sofa, and one of the diagrams submitted with the original and amended application had the sidewalk cafe, consisting of two tables and four season: avenue, B and eight tables in 16 feet by east 3rd Street.
No wait: live staff outside the African County 12 repeats within 500 feet and has operated a business called blue room on 9th Avenue since 2008, which has a beer.
She had to transfer the license into these trusts and now they're selling the bar, because you know she doesn't want to operate.
Then you know he's every day going to the bar and then surprise it and then in terms of the music.
Okay, My point is that if the sidewalk cafe was a cause of many of the noise complaints, do you want to speak to them.
Actually, when I was there, I think for a short period of time, I, believe it's somewhere around 2015 or 16, Jeff and Jenny, and you know they lived on a bow.
I. Don't want to be too okay, personal about it, I, just a quick statement that corner is extremely noisy and when Mama's bar open facade was open, You could hear it halfway down the block.
On the sidewalk day, in and day out, You hear the music in the middle of the block, so those open facades are basically outdoors.
You know we'd, be interested to hear your concerns about noise, and you know also I'm wondering if the configuration of bars in the area because of the pandemic maybe has changed.
The problem with Mama's bar has always been this open facade, So it generated many complaints like the resident down the street said because you could hear the noise from the open, facade, half a block, away.
If we're going to approve this license, we have to understand that these applicants are equipped to address that, because, on an ongoing basis, The last people were not, and we did multiple things to try to limit.
Music is appropriate for that space unless you're willing to say that you're, adding additional sound proofing or you're going to do something to address that noise, Even with your doors and windows closed and with your doors and windows, open it, it's unbearable.
You know where, Wherever you are so we are certainly not going to operate the business in isolation of the community.
Well, I was saying to the lawyer with the same I'm just backing up what Clint is saying, but that I'm generally passing to that place almost six days a week going back and forth from my office or the buildings or whatever, and you know, I, try to cost them at times if they could just Lord music, because the doors are open.
I, know, there's competition in your type of business, and you have to do this to get people to go in and out and also the lateness of the opening, At least during the week disturbs me.
Then, especially during these Covid-19 times, You know with the capacity limits we would like to keep the opening hours.
I would say if you're going to, If you want to include whereas clauses about the complaints I, would include that consistent with the output, the previous applicant's history of complaints, there were 18 true on one calls within the past, year, six of which were non-crime corrected, or rather in a resolution.
So I, also put it a resident and two of his community board members who live and work in the immediate area stated that the music from the open facade travels down the street music can be as well as voices from a microphone used on trivia.
We heard that a number of times I think we understood that okay I just wanted to look up.
Addressing its method of operation, including addressing potential noise traveling outside I'd, also say that the applicant has represented that that's not using the basement for patrons that's correct and not yet will not yet have a sidewalk cafe, but we'll apply for that separately.
First, so would be tavern with a prep area, less than a full service kitchen serving food during all hours of operation.
Okay, then we have to address live music, so we'll go back to whether or not they're going to have live music, because that's a variation from the existing method of operation that we would have to consider separately so and then, With respect to private parties.
Okay, so no pub, crawls or party buses, no unlimited drink specials with food, no alteration without first coming before the community, board, no wait lines and a staff person, whether it's a security guard or a employee.
You don't have a security guard responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside that doesn't mean that that's the person who has to stay outside, but a person who has to be mindful of what's going on outside the droplets all right.
Placement of the speakers, whether or not there should be a limiter, both of which we had at the prior business to address sound problems and hours of operation and live music.
You're, proposing you're, saying that you want to have entertainment level music on the weekends.
So, with respect to the speakers, I propose, We just have that their position away from the open, facade and below ceiling level, Facing inside, you know not facing towards the road.
Okay, so I would say that we should put an awareness clause that the applicant is not proposing to add soundproofing and that the as representative the space does not have soundproofing so that to be in any stipulations, but also address the absence of soundproofing, and we would just leave music at recorded background level.
And, then the other things do you want to add that there should be a limiter to ensure the background level of the music and the bass and the hours of operation they have to address.
Late, night, Their noise problems are more between the hours of 8 a.m. To, midnight, I'm, sorry, 8 p.m. I would actually I'm not opposed to the 4 a.m. I, Do know that many times during the week, even if I mean I, know, they've, always had 4 a.m, but many times during the week, they're, not open, not, That I'm out till 4 a.m. But I know many times during the week they close a little earlier than 4 a.m. If it's only going to be the background music, it's okay.
The proposed hours are 12 pm to 4 a.m, all day with alcohol service to 2 a.m and take out service after 12 a.m. All day, Although the questionnaire said that the business is primarily a takeout business, kitchen open all hours serving caribbean food, there's no answer about the facade one television Dj's live music juice box, Karaoke.
It says that background levels, no promoted events, schedule performances or covers one security, guard, no sound proofing, no control, but party buses, happy hours to 8, pm, no weight loss staff outside the applicant counted 26 ops within 500, feet, I, counted 30 as well as four pending ops using the lamp map.
There are other reasons why I don't know that I necessarily would approve this application as it's proposed, but you can't have an op license in your bathroom.
Does he just want to speak about his application, because I can assist the committee by saying what I think are outstanding issues for the application as it was sent to us.
Don't, think anyone would confuse it with a bar that they would go into which I know has been a concern in that area.
They'd have security and they're saying that the way that they would minimize all of those impacts is by having the alcohol, whether it's beer, one or anything, else, not served at 12 a.m. It's clearly a takeout place with very limited occupancy in an area.
That being said, This was an unlicensed location that was just a takeout place, so we're incorporating alcohol and the possibility of Djs live music karaoke into the shallow space.
The applicant is saying that they're not going to have weight loss, so I'm, hoping that that's the case, but I, don't know if that's realistic, given that the businesses in Brooklyn at least have weight loss without those elements.
It should not have security, whether or not it has the alcohol service, whether it's alcohol service or beer wine, it shouldn't be past 12, and then they have to decide whether or not the business is going to be open until four I think.
I. Think that the question is, how would live music be even possible.
I think that you know the kind of space that it is in order to just generate interest and excitement.
You, know avail themselves of the outdoor allowances that exist through the Covid-19, but I think that they want to have the option, which is why we included it depending on what the state decides to do with its Covid-19 related outdoor applications to apply for a permanent outdoor seating.
We should go back now to the hours the idea of security and music type right.
Only after 12 a.m. That was a part of the proposed application, but I'm just talking about the hours of operation, so it would be 12 a.m to 4 a.m. I'm, anybody, fine, with that.
Those are the things that would be different from recorded background music and also there's still the proposal for a security guard.
We use just to make sure everything is going flowing because I know this is the area that includes a lot of bars.
Oh, but also alcohol service is ending at our place at 12, so for people that are potentially you know, barnstorming and stumbling around or looking for the next drink or continuing their night they're going to come stumbling in, though after 12.
Just saying your peak hours on Friday and Saturday of people walking by and stumbling by are definitely not going to end at 12 on Stan Street, I'll watch it, but I will incorporate a security guard to four.
When it's not supposed to be part of the method of operation of the business right, A takeout place is not supposed to require a security guard for the SLA.
This is my concern with this application and that, and also from what I've heard right and all of the elements of this application look like a place that wants to capitalize on what the area is.
You, know that the reference to whining something lively and entertaining like with respect to the possible dj and the possible live music to draw people in and to develop interest in the business that I get, but.
The applicant said I just feel like you're trying to be too many things with a space.
I, don't feel I need a security guard, but being that Covid-19 is going on where all these things happen in that area, I just wanted to make sure everybody's safe, there's.
You know in basically a 150,250 space, Any kind of live music would probably just seems like it would be a lot even just come in an order.
This is an application for a tavern wine bar with a full menu recorded music on a ground level of 172nd Avenue.
We play background music, so we only have four speakers that are going to be inside the space, the french windows and doors, There's a french window just on the right side of the front entrance and just along the corner of the facade along between second and first Avenue, and for the proposed outdoor seating.
Tavern would operate as a tavern wine bar with a prep area or less than a full service kitchen serving food during the lives of operations at the hours would be 3 p.m, to 12, A.M, Sunday and Monday 3.
Think in quick, dogs, no security, existing crown, proofing, no pub calls or party messes, no happy hours, says no agreement about no weight loss, but then there was a statement that they were that they had a reservation policy in place now and staff personally responsible for crabs and noise outside the applicant found.
This would be tavern restaurant with less than a full service kitchen serving food, all hours of 12 pm to 4 a.m. All, day, no outdoor, space, closed, facade recorded background music, only no dj5, music, promoted and scheduled performances or events with covers no alteration.
You know the people like standing in front of businesses on the street and milling from place to place.
