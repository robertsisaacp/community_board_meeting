They also retained the services of a security consultant that would help them in navigating how best to address the vulnerabilities that NYPD had identified, and the building, of course, is a New York, City landmark.
Looking carefully at landmarks rules and guidelines for health, safety and security, upgrading, and almost everything that had been presented to the landmarks Commission applying you know, different measures met with the landmark staff's rules.
12 feet, high black and one would be located at the north area way and one would be located at the south area way, So that would be within the bounds of the existing areaway fencing, but as it happens, or sometimes with older buildings.
In addition to applying to the Landmarks Commission for the security polls, we also went to the department of transportation and their revocable consents department and because we were able to prove that the Areaway fencing was in existence before 1940.
This case, The museum has two fire escapes one at the south: area, way, one at the north area way and due to the close concentration of other buildings that have been developed and over time at different heights.
There are some opportunities for people to jump onto the fire escape and then potentially get access to the interior of the building, and so one of the recommendations was to of the security consultant was to respond, and.
It wasn't on the primary facade, but it was on the area way on the south area way and that you know corresponds with the need for the security measures that have been so far identified by NYPD.
This location was identified by the security consultant as the best possible location for this pole and the pole, which would be painted black and metal, and we identified the Vega manufacturer, it's a specific product and it would support a light that would be able to illuminate the facade and a motion sensitive camera, so that location as I said, was specifically chosen by the security consultant.
And then, If you go to the exact south, so at the top of the drawing, also right next to the areaway fence and the exact same installation is proposed, there would just be these two.
You know to try to not impede any egress points, because obviously these are egress corridors for anyone in the sanctuary that exits through the fire escape and would need to then exit out onto the street.
There's two locations on this fire escape where these anti-climb measures are proposed, and you can see that the adjacent conditions on the south there is an existing building with a lower one-story appendage to it.
Then you can see the boundary of the fencing, the Areaway fence, okay and the gates, so that you can gain access to the area ways you can gain access to the steps going down to enter the museum.
Okay, I love this right, yeah, yes, one at the south and one at the north, sir, and.
Yes, is the ADA, so, As you can imagine, We had very specific size limitations and dimensional limitations, but we responded to the recommendation of the security consultant that the museum engaged in placing these polls in these two locations, and we identified the manufacturer of the polls and security lighting and camera that would mount onto the pole and again, The goal is to try to find a pool that is going to have a good longevity, A good life to it.
You know a solid installation, but at the same time we wanted it to be something that would not call great attention to itself and try to recede somewhat in the background and yet be functional and utilitarian.
We know that there are a number of pavers that are blue stone that would need to be lifted to accommodate the electrical conduit run and then replaced not reinstalled, I should say reinstalled once the electrical conduit feed into the building has been established and then at the south area, way.
So, it's a little bit more difficult to access than the north area way, but the goal is to be as minimally impactful as possible and to return the you know, the blue stone pavers, where they exist, to the condition that they were in prior to the installation.
Ah, Behind the pole, There are two proposed gates that would that we found clearly shown on the historic drawing from circa 1905, and the goal is to install new Areaway gates that match the historic elevation drawing and those would be reviewed at the LPC staff.
What is before you today are the two security poles and then the anti-climb measures that the fire escapes.
We, don't know how it was installed, it's in deteriorated condition, but has no historic merit and the gates that we are proposing under a staff level are trying to recall the historic condition based on the documentation.
Then we can do the south elevation and talk about the anti-climb measures, and you can also see the poles in section, and here, sir, You can see the location of the pole and then you can see the plane of the Areaway, fencing and gates.
Similarly, Here we want to discourage anyone from trying to climb onto the fire escape and, as I said, These anti-climb measures, are.
And, you know whatever they want to do, but it would certainly be a deterrent for anybody that was trying to gain access onto the fire escape, and so the intention is to do something in an extremely light metal mesh so as not to you know, compromise the visibility of the historic landmark and certainly not to diminish any light coming into the building through the windows beyond, but at the same time create this anti-climb measure.
Fencing is going to be replaced with new fencing as part of a staff level application, but the anti-climate measures at the fire escapes are not something that the staff can do at staff level to approve, and so it must be presented to the commissioners at the public hearing.
As I said earlier, The building was designated by the Landmarks Commission in 1980 and then listed on the state of national registers and historic places, and they as a national historic landmark as well, and the museum of course prides itself in its history and there's the image that I just sent.
I can only do one thing at a time, so let me see if I can find that metal and while the image is coming, through, okay.
We, were talking about security issues in various landmark buildings and in my case, in the park that I look after.
You know that making very surgical, specific installations and upgrades in a way that tries to meet the needs of the security requirements.
So, certainly I'm familiar with this type of metal mesh, but had never seen it in an application like this at fire escapes, but landmarks.
Okay, She wants to know how much taller the pole is than the Areaway fence.
Then, If we can advance to the north elevation and that shows the relationship of the Areaway, fencing and gates to the proposed poll.
This proposed pole- is five inches in diameter and 12 feet high with the goal of being high enough that you don't allow people to try to tamper with the placement of the security camera.
You know that in placing this poll, these two polls that they would be beyond the property line and we did apply to the New York City DOT, revocable consent department, asking for their determination as to whether or not a revocable consent would be required, and they said no, because you have demonstrated that the area way fencing and gates existed prior to 1940 that they would not need to issue a permit for the proposed polls.
However, They are obviously required for permit from the landmarks Commission, but I can have someone scale the off at the office tomorrow, the dimensional difference in height between the top of the existing area way and the top of the pole, so that you would have that dimension.
Actually, don't know if the cameras would focus where the security consultant suggests that they'd be focused, I would think on the doors, but again I, I'm, not privy to where they would be focused.
It needs all of the security that can be provided within the context of a historic building and that these measures should be endorsed by the community board.
You say that again, I'm putting up where is in, whereas in here I said, whereas this building is not only in New York, City landmark, but also it's a national landmark national, historic, landmark, okay and also a national historic landmark, as well as a architectural and cultural touchstone of the community and has been such for over a hundred years.
Only other thing I could think of is you might want to add something about the experience of break-ins and therefore the need for these security.
You can see also that there is a you know, an opportunity for someone getting on top of that low building immediately next to or low roof immediately next to the museum and then jumping over the area, the fencing and getting on to the fire escape or wherever else they wanted to get into.
Well, you know, I, dare say a home depot or somebody needed an areaway fence, a gate, and that was procured, but it does not rise to any level of doesn't do preservation, no, not something, and then this is the view down the north area way really and those how wide it's very narrow.
Yeah, You said that the south area is elevated.
You could put it right across, You would started that the south is a little bit taller than the left than the North pole.
Yes, well, I would take away the reference to the gates, because that's something that the landmark staff are going to be reviewing so I instead would ask that the application to be to install two security, polls.
I mean we may want to say something pretty brief, because we don't know a lot here, but it seems to me that we should be on record that every possible effort should be made to save these buildings and restore them.
I would like to say, and whereas the stone facade of the building is still extant or still standing this in the tower, the belt, the steeple I, don't know how you would want to describe it.
