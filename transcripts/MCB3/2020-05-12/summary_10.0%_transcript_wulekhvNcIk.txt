Mary may have may not marry- And, then we'll create the resolution and vote on that Then we'll vote to adjourn okay,, so first I guess I should just leave that agenda right up.
We are the architects for 538 East, 11th Street, and this is the free public baths of the city of New. This was originally built by Arnold Brunner, well-known New, York architect in the turn of the century, and it was completed in 1905 1904-1905 and in 1996 around then it was converted from its previous use to a single-family residence which it is now still to this date.
So, it's a vestibule, that's still exterior, but through the threshold of the of the main facade This is the on the second floor of the residence This was already approved at staff level and has been installed as well as a rear garden on this second level, on the exterior, also not visible from any public way where the same application was approved by staff and installed in the rear.
So, this is the east facing wall, interior of the exterior facade, the west wall and These are these- are minimally visible from the street We're working with staff.
Most of the restoration work is going to probably be cleaning and repairing some of the limestone, but nothing No modifications to the facade which would include the gate, so The facade is kind of kind of cool , don't know if you can point to these tribals better at the top of them on that top a lot where it says three public baths, and these little trident sin there Many members of the public wish to speak.
The brick walls you can they're on there on the inside of the residence The interior of this vestibule that was open to the street was clear.
They essentially said that lefty understands the work to consist of the removal of non historic blue tile from within which you're not actually doing right, you're, just covering it over and its replacement with IP hardware funding, as this work appears to become confined entirely to non historic portions of the building and will not involve any changes to the historic Street.
