Seeing the minutes of the last meeting, nothing that's terribly important, but we're gonna be voting on So there wasn't a resolution: Mine doesn't need to send out the minutes to people Now. All right may I have a motion to approve minutes.
Don't know what you have in mind when down the road you're talking about restoring the facade as to whether those exterior spaces beyond the arches will be more visible or less visible, I'm, assuming that the existing gates are not historic and I realize it's now a private residence, but your expectation of entering a bathhouse is closer to seeing tile It's an aesthetic thing.
I'll be a pro one, more thing, while Linda's pulling that up just I know, there's a few more people that have joined since the beginning of the meeting You are a guest or a member of the public if you could go ahead and in the chat box at the bottom of the screen, if you could just type your name and your affiliation since we don't have a sign-in sheet They essentially said that lefty understands the work to consist of the removal of non historic blue tile from within which you're not actually doing right, you're just covering it over and its replacement with IP hardware funding, as this work appears to become confined entirely to non historic portions of the building and will not involve any changes to the historic Street That's that that's it any other public comment speak now or forever hold your peace, and it may be a moot point now and I'm involved in a developing community project.
Let's move on to the resolution then I drafted, something which we can modify as we as we like back to sharing the screen again So first, the first sentence is just routine, whereas the free public baths- architect, Donald, W Bruner, was built in 1904 1905 in the NiO to Italian, Renaissance style used the Indiana limestone on the facade and whereas the designation report published in 2008 makes no mention of the blue mosaic tile, the applicants we replace and whereas the blue misiek tile was installed around 1980 I think it was 1990 Now. Okay, so going down to the designation report.
