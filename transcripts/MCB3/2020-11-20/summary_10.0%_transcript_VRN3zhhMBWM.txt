First I would like to just take a minute to say thank you to all of you for all the work that you've done and support, and you know the support you've.
So during the spike of Covid-19, I'd like to ask each of you to just check in with your committee members as you as much as you possibly can I mean.
Some people are going to be alone for the first time for the holidays, and this is something that you know.
So I just want to ask you to reach out to people on your committee's text.
You know, like I, think it's important to be festive.
And, then the last thing I wanted to say is: This is the time of year that traditionally, the community board does something for the staff.
I, don't know what people are going, through, financially I know we all have different needs or whatever, but we normally give them a gift of gratitude, and it's that time of year.
Okay, I, don't want to make a statement, but I do know that it is important for us to acknowledge everyone's work and the work that they do.
I'm also going to extend it to the full board as well and ask them the same thing if they would be willing to contribute gifts of gratitude to the staff during this time of year, and so I will send you an email with a link, I guess telling you exactly.
No doubt the nominating committee is work, but it does is work people running for election using that list to call and email.
You know I'll change it to whatever ever people want good question.
You know talk to people make committee lists from them.
I mean not a staff member board member that was doing personal work and emailing all of the community board, so I know in the past.
It seems to me the question that was asked was: Do we want that it to be clearer what we mean by board, work.
We could ask her to what she thought might be appropriate to make that clear, Susan, so I think you're, saying language that would include campaigning and maybe would be to be used only for CB3, related activities or CB3.
We're, saying we want to send out the entire CB list to all CB3 members right as opposed to someone asking for it.
I have two lists, one is for members, and one is for the office and the office has some people have off their work numbers that they don't want.
You know you can just ask the office for I can send out an email saying the list is available.
I understand why you'd want maybe to get an understanding of what neighborhood people live in but like having their home.
Only thing I wanted to report was that the letters were sent out to the three people that were identified as not meeting the requested.
So Susan, suggested that I put this on the agenda for the exec to talk about whether they wanted for in the future, for the nominating committee meetings to be recorded and counted in the computation.
President I, remember the nominating committee, one or two years in a row just had trouble scheduling their meeting and time, so it didn't get on the agenda.
If, you want to change it, you can make it a regular meeting that will go on the public agenda and then Deidre would automatically send a minute template or you can schedule them the way.
You know I, hear that some people feel as though that that's not necessary for people to come in, but all of our meetings are public and you know it's not encouraged because it's like what are you talking about just the committee's you know nominating whoever, and you know people get an opportunity to see firsthand how the board does their nominations.
The borough president's office under Scott said it wasn't necessary to have it as a public meeting, because there's no input, you know no community voice.
Just being you know, a lot of work and other people might have more expertise, and this would be I would think human services issues economic development because of outreach to bids and businesses and may can you remember what else or if there was anything else we were considering.
For your committee, yeah, I would, or you know, or if I'm not available to attend the meeting.
You think you could speak to someone in NYCHA subcommittee, because you know I get questions about like tenant association contacts and that kind of thing I could share the information on the natural subcommittee, okay, just to get a person that we can work with or an old person and an alternate.
Since, it's an open street with Paul, so he'll have more to say about it, but I think the biggest problem right now is the street enclosures, because people are enclosing them on all sides and they're, making them enclosed and they're, making them worse than indoor dining, because there's no ventilation, there's no standards for ventilation.
I just wanted to ask Susan question: Has she or the office received any complaints from Haven Plaza about the heating issues going on there.
People will get an email in the afternoon of the full board meeting and they will be asked to wait to vote until after they've heard the presentations and then we'll take time.
I think we had talked about this last time, but so there's also going to be like one of you on the phone to deal with people who are having technical, difficulty.
So this is the suggestion for making it really clear if the purpose, the way it's written, is generally to make it possible for a vote to be taken, unless it's expressly determined that it should not be, and that would call for information purposes only being part of the agenda item when there would be absolutely no resolution.
Michael I, think we're going to have to pay very close attention to indian agenda item.
If we just want to make sure that the committee members are aware that we really need to pay attention to the agenda, items.
Think this comes up, particularly in land use, where an agency may be going to at some future time bring to us an issue that requires a vote, but they precede that with an informational presentation, and we would not generally take a vote on that informational, presentation.
And I wanted to ask like who would decide that item should be for information.
Only I think that the chair of the committee should decide that right, not the manager, okay, I, just want to clarify that.
Because I mean this is what's the reason that it's come up in the past, because when you're there, you don't have people from both sides to give the you know other perspectives, and you don't have all the research done.
I mean I know times when people we don't do it anymore, but people used to come to full board and say.
So I didn't come, so people want to know whether to be there.
You know, like I, think it needs to be more direct if we're going to preclude a resolution.
Like then, you have a little more latitude to explain what it means, rather than trying to make it succinct because you're going to put it after each agenda, item.
So I think we need to focus on in terms of transparency, to make sure that the public is aware of what we're doing and some items are just informational and some others.
Yeah no resolution will be voted on I, don't know what do you think.
Don't think I need to make an official motion, but I'm just going to say that I am fine with voting for this.
I received some feedback and a few calls from some elected officials who attend a few of our zoom meetings and sometimes items get don't get heard by them, because the meetings can be running a little longer than anticipated, and so thank you to Michelle for helping us come up with some guidelines.
Then this part here I know we had discussed this I, don't remember it was last month or the month before, but about how we want people to quote unquote, sign up to speak, I believe that every committee, maybe did it a little bit differently, even when we weren't in person, but Susan had said that there are questions coming into the office about how people need to sign up to speak during committees and.
That every committee has the same standards about how we will have people speak just so that there's a you know a standard kind of protocol in transportation.
And, then the other thing that we at least in transportation, do is we make sure that we time people which is you know here in this first bullet, we'll have two minutes to speak, which I believe that in the past there that's been the standard in transportation, with the with the a discretion of the chair to ask committee members.
If they'd like to extend someone's speaking time, I, think from my own experience, both in professional work and with community board.
But I think a lot of times when we let people speak.
I mean I, think I know Paul.
You wanted to weigh in just about how why you chose why we chose the 7 pm on transportation versus the raise your hand, but I do think that we should probably have a standard across all the committees.
They, do seem to have standards and the issue of people talking and meetings going on too long is an issue shared by all the boards.
You know, I tell everyone how the meeting's going to run.
We've eliminated a lot of the two-minute statements, because now people are just asking questions: okay, yeah, because I'm just wondering, like part of the reason we ask people to sign into the chat, is so that we can easily like at the bottom of the minutes, put in all the speakers with their name and affiliation rather than having to like take it off the you know.
Think after May, 2020's, committee, meeting, I, Michelle and I had a conversation, because that was kind of how this all really came to petition.
You, know like if you're really passionate about this certain agenda item I, expect.
I know it doesn't work for other committees, but I think it's kind of worked for us.
I, don't know that it's practical, like Trevor for us to have a deadline by which people can sign up, because sometimes they just come a little later, because the agendas are somewhat longer and sometimes they're telling me in advance.
I would like to say I think all the zoom facilitators on this board are excellent, but we haven't had you know.
A lot of the other community boards are doing this setting standards about how to run their meetings because I think even like.
Necessarily, you know like what you not I'm, not saying it on each meeting.
You, know, I, just I think that it's a little weird to have committees run things very differently.
If, you like, didn't know what you were to be expected of when you walked into any given medium CB3, like that, just seems a little bit difficult to me, and especially since we've learned some of the like I think, like Trevor's point about you, know, people don't raise their hands once they've heard a lot of the stuff already.
Don't know it's just me, but you know, having been at various committees over the years, I, feel like that kind of works, that each committee does need to have a little of its own discretion and.
You are expected to sign up at seven and I think that is confusing, especially if you are trying to go to different committees as a person from the public.
Think that question about, like if I, went to SLA or land use and there's different times for when I'm supposed to do stuff, it could be confusing to people.
Sorry Paul, because I do think that Trevor's point about like having the committee, at least in his experience.
And, then I think really the only thing that I'm just going to exit out the only thing then would be agreeing that we give people a two minute limit with discretion from the chair to extend that time.
I think you know, as Linda said.
I, don't know Paul's raising his hand, because people will just like take.
I think you know, if we could be okay with this yellow highlighted part, then everyone has a lot of discretion within that.
You know to run their committee slightly differently, but we have like some communicated standards that the community understands what they're expected to do.
Is people do have a tendency to get long-winded and it is not fair to other people that would like to comment and give you know input as well, because if you're dominating the time slot of me sharing, then I'm going to back down.
You know you have to budget your time, so I would want them to come in the beginning of the meeting.
We need to come up with something that we're comfortable with posting online for people to see so that there's somewhere that Susan can refer people to say this is how committees are going to run.
Long and a lot of people join them late because they join them when they think the agenda item that they want to be there for is going to be on, and it also you know.
I, don't know what I missed, but I'm not going to disrupt the meeting and say hey: Can you rewind for me, but some people do.
This is going back now in our agenda and Olympia wanted to say something about sending phone numbers with lists.
What was the comment that was about the CB3 membership list, but we've decided that we're only going to send emails and phone numbers, but I think Olympia also had said that the thing about giving shares discretion to change, which we've discussed and said that we can do that from the as Trevor said from the bench wrote not on paper.
You hear me yes, great, so I ask that we share only emails and offer to people often if they want to share their phone with everybody, because in the past we had an instance of harassment, especially for younger female members like having the phone can be a bit too much.
You know I actually have the whole list, because I asked for it, and it was really just from my committee because I have the outreach to my communities.
Think, of what we're hearing, which is you know, people who say, I really want to open a business.
At the end of the day, it was denied, but I just want to give you an fyi, because I think that they will come to the full board.
We took a stand on that and said: hey no, it's time to start enforcing a lot of this going on Susan mentioned earlier in her report about a lot of the open street issues coming our way to transportation.
We are going to ask City Council, as well as community board 3 to co-sponsor a town hall instead of putting it as an agenda, item.
So that's the route we're going to go with it, because it's such a big issue that comes to committee with so many people coming out for it and businesses are affected.
We have more people involved in saying what needs to be said, especially if they're thinking about making this permanent.
Community groups send an email saying that they would like this to be an agenda.
It were really folks that brought quality of life concerns around noise, because the specific resolution really focused on the issue of noise and ultimately there just wasn't enough information from the arts and culture subcommittee about some of the concerns that the public and also Economic Development Committee members, raised.
You know we had our committee meeting.
You know future items that we agenda items that we want to put on our committee and.
I think it would be fair for the land use committee member to spend some time before the meeting to digest deeper, especially after Bcp, gave us a very good presentation at the last land news meeting, so I feel like it should be.
You, know too, because I think there is good things about it.
So I think we need to have a vote in the subcommittee that we wanted to do this time hall meeting.
Is this issue about like timing for the arts and culture subcommittee, just to have it out there that you know they do meet after economic development in the month and.
What we were proposing with the town hall is that we would ask the town hall to be co-sponsored by the council, person, or perhaps the city council, with arts and culture committee, and that we wanted to reach out to them to find out if they would be interested in doing that, because it is something that's like dire need for people in this neighborhood.
If someone was going to decide, it would be the subcommittee or the committee, but do they need to do a resolution.
Sorry, Alicia I wanted to ask a clarification question so Susan they arts and cultural subcommittee has their meeting after the economic development.
I think that they need to be voted.
If you feel that the town hall is beneficial to the work of your community and you want to invite these people like the election go ahead and decide and do it, you did it on it.
