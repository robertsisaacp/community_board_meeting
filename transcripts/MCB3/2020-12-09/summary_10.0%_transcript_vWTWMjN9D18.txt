3 transportation, public safety, Environment committee meeting for December of 2020 also want to welcome our colleagues from the Parks Committee, who will be on for a joint agenda item Michelle.
The members of the public will speak and then we will form a formulated resolution if relevant- and thank you all so much for being here tonight and for our parks.
Please don't be offended if I cut off questions at some point, I will try to get to as many of your questions as I, possibly can, but I do want to think about time.
The attendance I'm gonna have to handle at our Thursday meeting, primarily because I know there are a number of people who signed on who were not able to continue.
Everybody, If I, could ask community board 3 to please also add James Greco who's, also on the list, as presenter he'll be sharing his screen great good evening, everybody hope everybody is staying, healthy and safe.
Like folks have noted, We typically do give up on that project at the parks and waterfronts and Resiliency Committee, but we're here tonight because of the issue that pertains to transportation.
Since, like I mentioned that we typically present at the Parks Waterfront Resiliency Committee.
We are looking tonight at the proposed changes to so traffic modifications at Robert, Wagner senior place at the intersection of South Street and Robert Wagner.
Are the remainder of the projects, So we are included at the Brooklyn bridge abutment up to Montgomery Street, we'll see that a few times throughout, as we zoom in a little closer here's, Our project I outlined in the black-lines overlapping, with some of the adjacent projects that have either been completed or are going into construction, namely pier 35, complete ere, package, 3, complete package 4 under construction and bbe to the south of our project.
We will eventually be zooming in right at this intersection here of Robert Wagner and in South Street, So the project can be described in three main areas: enlargement, One. Two and three: it crosses a fixed, concrete flood wall to keep water back.
These orange lines running up underneath the FDR, are flip up barriers which we'll show in more detail a couple localized operable gates that are that stay exposed, but open for vehicle and pedestrian traffic, some areas of fixed flood walls and then eventually crossing back across south street and tying into high ground on Montgomery Street wrap around the existing school playground, we'll zoom in here on enlargement, one where we'll see the flood wall tying across South Street and then the flip of barriers running up under the FDR along Esplanade.
We're going to install a concrete box, a vault below South Street here that allow us to shut down that sewer when we need to and to operate the gate and the equipment located in that below grade structure, we'll be constructing a control, building a control house right next to the existing DOT yard, along Robert of Wagner senior place, we'll explain those a little further in a couple.
The majority of this section is characterized by the orange lines here, which are the flip-up barriers which operate similar to the roadway one that crosses South street, going under the Manhattan bridge.
In addition to the gates and walls, There is a the large intercepting sewer currently below South street that collects water from upstream and within the two bridges: area.
We want to take advantage of this system to be able to collect and store water in this considerable volume within you know below grade, so any water that is getting into this area can drain and have a place to stay below grade without causing street surface street level.
There is we're going to zoom in right into this area right near Robert, Wagner on below right above South street.
We have the interceptor sewer, which would typically continue left to right through here, and we have this large stainless steel gate that will close, typically or main open, Allow water to flow through to the pump station during the storm.
We want to point out, and we're getting at mainly for tonight- is that the south end of Robert Wagner is currently a two-way traffic.
The city DOT has a dugout yard right below the FDR off-ramp and their access for their fleet vehicles are through in and out gate currently accessing at Roberta Wagner, where they would typically make a left to go north or make a right to go here and access South, Street again, creating some conflicts between turning and blind turns for traffic coming either northbound on Robert Wagner or trying to turn southbound to get to South street.
The best of all the pages is that essentially, while the ESCR project to the north and our project into bridges, are keeping storm water out, If the river rises like it did during Hurricane Sandy, we also need to protect against having water come up from the sewers into the neighborhood and also need to be able to handle rainfall.
However, Some of the benefits that come from that are I forgot to mention in the existing conditions slide that performed a traffic studies area in June of 2019 and found that traffic two-way traffic on the south end of Robert Wagner.
Typically, most cars were traveling northbound on Robert, Wagner and majority of the cars that were using the two-way condition heading south on the South Street were actually coming out of the D.O.T yard and making a right so to accommodate that traffic.
Here, We do want to point out that this also eliminates a lot of turning conflicts from people trying to make a left or a right over sexting or intersecting in this area, while also removing some of the possibility for the illegal parking.
Looking from Robert Wagner down to South Street, You can see a better view of the parking, the building, the DOT yard, access to South, Street and then beyond.
Actually, So we did discuss the on street condition with the new building the new crosswalk, the sidewalk changes.
I'm glad regarding the timing, valley, neglected to answer that this work is all going to be part of the Bmcr project, So we are completing design in spring of next year and then that project should begin construction by the end of next year.
The interceptor gate building did appear in our latest presentation, and this sub-grade work did not, but is I, don't think is subject to pvc necessarily, but we are like.
So I believe our team has been in contact with the resident association leaders from nearly all the developments along South street, Simultaneous interpretation in spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Fujinis next week on December 16th, So Val. Thank you for reminding me to say that I'm gonna put the link to the website where you can find the info about the event and any you know, I'll put that in my email in the chat so that everybody can see that.
If we could make a note to present that to the parks committee in January, that'd be helpful, so we can focus questions on that for that particular topic.
The concern is that you've moved the entrance and exit from the DOT yard from Robert F Wagner, Robert, Wagner, place, And you're, not placing on South Street a lot of those cars, because there's only one turn making Tessa Street actually make a left turn to get on the Brooklyn bridge, because it's very quick from that.
If, you wouldn't mind showing the proposed condition, so there are going to be balls, protecting the interceptor gate building, but not the sidewalk itself, I'm sorry.
The area is horrible, and this is DOT they're going to want to park on that.
Just, there's no enforcement at all in that area of parking, which brings me to the next point about South Street and the increased traffic, and I'm happy that you're looking at this portion of the street to improve pedestrian and traffic flow.
Anyone who has bike down South Street knows that there's lots of conflicts and we want to make sure this is a safe, area.
Remember the survey from the Brooklyn bridge Esplanade pedestrians experience was number one or number two, because we walk the people who typically bike through the neighborhood, and we want to avoid these conflicts that we have.
So I'm, just going to add one more thing that I'll let the community members because I know some wanted to speak.
. I'm, sorry at the access points of all entry into the Bmc or like across, because people do cross there and there's very a very little strip of media walkway before you know you get, you, know, intercepted with a bike, so.
So I think it is very important if we're addressing like safety and we're looking at everything.
I would also say that, like I mentioned, We are at 75 percent design, but which means that we can't move a lot of the larger elements around anymore, but we can continue to fine-tune smaller elements such as you, know, adding rumble strips or looking at what crossings.
If there's a way that to address that issue as well as you're doing the rubber strips and everything like that design, you know to put that in because that also causes a safety issue where they're sharing the same lane as bikes list.
You know as you're looking at all these safety issues and addressing it absolutely okay, we'll keep that in mind.
Everyone thanks will and James for the presentation, just wanna back up what grace and Trevor mentioned about having the bike traffic signals, whatever they're called at the intersections I know when DOT was installing bike lanes like around the neighborhood, The kvta had actually asked for these signals at all.
What I'm asking is protections this signal for our residents, because when you cross there we're like sandwiched in between oncoming traffic, a very narrow pedestrian path, and then we have the cyclist before we get to the esplanade.
So I think that it will make a lot of sense if we will have a signal traffic for cyclists, and, unfortunately, like I, don't want to infringe on the cyclists rights, but I have to say that they are infringing on our rights because they have a certain arrogance because they speed.
So, that being said, Trevor I want to ask what is the ask of our transportation committee tonight to assist the parks.
I know you wanted to talk about potential resolution for tonight.
For this specific item, I know that it's a change in street direction, right we're looking at making this a one-way westbound, If, I'm, correct all right, so.
With regards to the actual change, I mean they're, actually bumping out portion of and removing a lane of the street, which I'm not too particularly concerned about, because I know that particular term serves the dltr.
I mentioned that I'd like to see ballers extended on Wagner place, to the extent that they can and any other way that can discourage sidewalk parking.
Even if they are plastic, if their generator needs to come in that way, I, don't think it's going to come in that often, but we need to make sure that we don't have that doesn't turn into a parking lot and then make it a very dangerous situation.
We need to ask or demand that lights bike lights be installed whenever there is an intersection and make it coincide with the changing of the street lights or the vehicle lights.
So lights are the only thing that gives the pedestrians some safety that they know they have the light to cross because they're not in a safe area until they cross through the bike.
I know there was a mention in the chat that seems to encourage people to walk anywhere in the bike lane, and that is not true.
That's Near Catherine slip if I believe, If I think that is where people crossing the crosswalk and that's the problem that we have is that you walk into the street and that's it.
Still want that to happen where they bump out the space where people can travel from, but I, think lights are the only solution.
The thicker painted thermoplastic striping, rumble strips well, The ones down to battery park are the ones that I think would be good here, because once I've gone over them, I know they're, there.
In addition to lights at every intersection, where there is a light, can I ask you a question Trevor sure you had just mentioned a bicycle traffic light at every location where there's currently a traffic light.
I'll try to find like a design detail that shows them, but I think just rumble strips is correct.
But I want to make sure we're getting the ones that David is talking about, because I haven't seen any of those types of strips along between Brooklyn bridge and Montgomery Street Paul.
I just want to get clarification on what exactly we are talking about, because if bikers are going to avoid what are in essence, speed, bumps right, then it decreases and increases danger for joggers I used to jog a lot down there and because of the construction I've stopped jogging, just because of the danger level, but I.
If, their traffic lights, you know is I, mean there's really no penalty right for not recognizing speed, lights, traffic lights for bikers, especially along that strip, and that's been a serious issue on a daily basis.
I, don't know you can also just put a lot of signage and just make it ugly, but anyway I, don't think I'm, a rare biker who respects pedestrians, What I'm hearing just to wrap this up.
After a while people are going to figure out a way to go around them, but I didn't think we need to do something for safety in that particular era, because a number of people have already been hit by bikes, and this includes the safety for the bikers and pedestrians and people who want to walk.
You have all that just want to make sure if there's anything you feel like you're missing, So we got the signage, The rumble strips that are perpendicular the intersections and the with the lighting.
I mean yes, There are raised crosswalks in other parts of the city, but I would need them to tell you like what the necessary studies are.
I'm, saying if the bike path was like the drivers, there's no change for them to indicate that this is more than a crosswalk more than the crossing and the rumble strips and the other things.
If you look at this slide, where the wheelchair is that portion be raised like a speed hump, basically to where the person is crossing, only that particular section I should also add here that you know we do follow.
There are raised crosswalks in other parts of the city, but as far as I can understand the request here, If we are looking at this slide, you know and Catherine kind of already explains that the bike lane and the and this portion is already in line on the same grade as the sidewalk.
My question all right, so I'm going to move this along because I know there's some other items.
And, then I have concerns raised regarding illegal parking near concrete structure, Additional bollards placed on Wagner plays looking into removable and retractable bollards, so that when access is needed for the generator, it's there.
Addition of intersection, like bike lanes, bike, lights, to protect pedestrians, to coincide with traffic lights, I, put down that anything to like slow down bikers like bike lights, rumble strips and then the possible addition of like another lane for like joggers or pedestrians, and then I also got some form of enforcement and or ramifications for the like any possible, like I, guess, side effects of speed bumps getting added, because someone mentioned that, if you add speed bumps or the rumble stress, the bikers can just like avoid the strips all together and go right into the pedestrian lanes for the bullet.
I would even narrow this down a little bit more because we're getting into what we think we can ask in order to give the community board's opinion on this change at the intersection.
Add the signage of yield to pedestrians at each intersection to let people know and Lee has pointed out that bike lights should be changed to bike traffic.
I would suggest that we look into to look into adding an additional lane for joggers I know but flew as mentioned with 75 percent design, and that might change things, but I do think it needs to be studied.
I, don't see it written down here, but I actually, Don't think we should do that because I know DOT is not going to do two things where one thing will suffice.
Okay, So we really need to decide which we want to ask for I, prefer the traffic lights.
That's that should, If we do something like that, it should go to different agency, or maybe we should ask for coordination, but the design of the either the transportation or the park components.
We're gonna go right to the proposed change of signage, on attorney between Houston and Staten on alternate side, Parking Susan, who is here presenting I, believe the seventh precinct.
Our proposal is to have the signs changed to alternate sides, and this would create additional parking on both sides of the street, because at the current moment, parking is only allowed for commercial vehicles.
But, if you just elaborate a little bit more I, just want to know how it best assists the seventh person and everybody in that area of attorney.
There shouldn't be any cars parked on that block unless it's a commercial, vehicle, Just I know this is part of a bigger presentation for later tonight, but.
This slide has I, guess some of the photos of the things going on Attorney street between Houston and Staten, and this looks pretty problematic.
The first I want to say the nature of the street has changed very much from commercial to residential and the garage actually uses the sidewalk.
Like Susan was saying that this there were a couple of businesses, but now we're going back almost 10 years or maybe more on that block and those businesses have now turned residential, so they need I know the residents need additional parking and if I could also say right nearby there's the cul-de-sac, which is no parking and people are illegally using that also.
There are like three to maybe even four lanes of parking being used on this street now and so.
So people sometimes just leave the car anyway, and you know fight the bullet on that, but I mean like.
Those of us who are dumb and don't know exactly what the regulations are Michelle, What alternate park side means is that once or twice a week, each side of the street will be no parking for purposes of cleaning.
Why putting alternate side of the street parking is going to change the situation unless they are monopolizing.
You know it's like what is the downside if it doesn't work, you still created more legal parking and you haven't made this situation any worse.
And, like I, said as well as residents will have more parking spots because essentially, the commercial space is underutilized because there's no commercial vehicles on that block, it's mostly residential.
There they're not storing excess cars that are trying to park overnight or anything like that anywhere on attorney street or even I, believe near the cul-de-sac.
So, If they're taking up spots, which I'm sure they are it's for cars that are either awaiting repair or have been repaired and are waiting to be picked up by their owners, so they're not parking long, term, And I, think that's an important distinction and the suggestion to modify commercial parking to allow additional permitted parking will help both the neighborhood as well as Ludlow Garage, which the other misnomer is it's Ludlow, but it's actually on attorney street by allowing them to legally park a car that has been repaired or as a waiting repair until they can take it and fix you know and send it out to the until the owner comes and picks it up.
It is also not enforced same thing with the no parking area is not absorbed, observed or enforced, and then I know that this is not illegal, but there are pickup trucks filled with trash that are permanently parked by the garage owners which creates an unsightly appearance, and that leads to constant littering and illegal dumping.
One puts a parks, a boat in a New York, City Street, but unfortunately, everything was up to code, the registration, the insurance, the vehicle paperwork was everything was correct and there was no reason to issue the boat, a summons.
Yeah I just wanted to chime in to the detectives on the call to say that I do think that enforcement is a big issue.
We will continue working with sanitation on that, but also with the enforcement is, You know when you send pictures of those cars on the sidewalk.
We do I, did send it out to the committee yesterday to start taking a look at it, I, David, I, guess, I, don't know if I can make this motion, but I make a motion to enter this resolution.
And I think they really do need to be part of this, hopefully to come up with a solution, but I really do want to hear from them as well.
And I, don't know if they are fine losing commercial parking, they may need it as part of their as part of their business.
If the precinct is on I, don't think that a business that you know has vans that go out to their customers is allowed to store their vehicles in front of their business or near their business in a commercial zone.
Because I mean frankly, I, think everyone knows that I do not like adding parking anywhere, and if we have this, if we have increased enforcement, as the detectives have told us.
I mean if you look at the resolution, it says number two in the first, whereas that the whole street on the west side is truck loading only and no parking.
You want to add that to the second number, two in the first, whereas that the north half of the west side is truck loading only in the south side, the south half is no we'd parking able to compromise instead of taking both.
I know the detective said you couldn't see the loading zone or the excuse me that the truck loading only part so I was in the no parking part of the block.
No parking except Sunday is on the east side of the street, because you just had Ellen change it to say I mean when you change it to say the West side.
What you wanted to put in the second one was that to try to make it clear where the truck loading was and where the no parking was on the west side, because it's not clear from the original resolution like what section is what okay, but is there a different regulation on the east side.
You know like your ups trucks, They don't leave it open and walk down the block, So the truck loading unloading might not be suitable for them, Basically, I, don't know exactly which to ask for.
The other one is you know your plumber, your electrician, who may need to be there for three hours for those I think we end up putting in meter parking for that.
I did also want to add that you know once we receive the resolution.
So, you know up to the board and the committee, If you'd like to sell, out, sell it out exactly, but also, If you just lay out the means and the requests here, that's something that we can take a closer look at.
My understanding I mean unless we come up with another phrase which says you know other kinds of vehicles as well converted to signage that allows for truck loading and unloading.
I think it should be a separate, whereas, Oh somebody can come up the language, because I can't like something, whereas the seventh precinct has done the extensive outreach to Blah repair shop and invited them to this meeting.
Coming back with a specific study on this, If you want, we've already talked to them about coming back to us with the plan for the city in three months, which they said they would do okay.
You help me with what you want to said sure, of course, and so just to clarify once the board submits, or you know, sends us the formal resolution that then triggers the evaluation for us to you.
Know, take a look at the possible change in the parking regulation, and what I'm seeing here is that there is the specific location and kind of like the requested needs that are spelled out and Jen. We will need to receive the formal resolution from the committee on the board.
You know our next agenda item for CitiBike infill last year, DOT embarked on our five-year phase, three CitiBike expansion alongside our partner Lyft, and this is going to double the size of the bike, share, system, service area and triple the number of available bikes.
But hello, everyone, my name is Caitlin toner I am a bike share planner at the New York City Department of transportation, and tonight I'm going to be presenting CitiBike expansion and infill.
If you look at the picture on the right, this is a design we call 3D bridging because it allows us to have one station beyond both the sidewalk and the road bed and so in more detail about our planning.
Yeah I wanted to ask for I'm always concerned when the bikes are on the sidewalk.
Not that people didn't want it, but I really think that there needs to be outreach before these two natural locations.
We got the locations at the end, so I'm just going to repeat what David say and to take a look at that location because I'm not sure it's appropriate, but if you deem that it is that you really need to do some outreach to the two NYCHA buildings on that corner and Trevor and David, you can speak a little bit.
I think it would have given a lot more feedback, But thank you Paul for letting me ask that question.
It's boards, one through eight, It's the system's busiest areas as well as portions of like downtown Brooklyn and north Brooklyn, which is essentially the you know, the initial areas where we launched the bike share program, but right now we're focusing in Phil on that, as David had mentioned, and as Katelyn mentioned during the presentation, It is an iterative process where we will be rolling out additional new infill stations over the next few years, but right now, This our plan is to kind of focus on the first kind of busiest sites, And I know this.
I, think you know that we want to emphasize that we think this is going to be an iterative process, so we'll likely end up coming back in over the next couple of years, But we don't know what that will look.
Only, because we requested them, you know, like the street side, parking, the way that those operate is.
I understand that you know that when you make presentations, you're thinking that you're coming to the community.
You know it may not always be that we are able to make that certain accommodations, but we have been I, think you know trying as much as possible to meet concerns and things like that.
I do if I may just want to give a little bit of a response myself to you, know, DOT being accommodating and open to requests for station adjustments.
Do think that you know we have been trying to accommodate a lot of these requests that have come to the board, but, as Lily said we'll, You know we're continuing to do that with our infill stations.
So, please, You know we're open to continuing to work with the board on finding the right, site.
And I will tell you that many times people contacted me and said I, don't want a bike installation outside my front.
I, don't know if we want to go ahead with a resolution tonight, just because of the amount of time we've already put into a lot of stuff.
That said, I do hope that this committee will pass a resolution next month to move the station on First Avenue between sixth and fifth street, on the east side to the road bed right now there are three vehicles parked there where 40 bike docks can be thanks.
Second, out of every light, leaving pedestrians to dodge traffic like Frogger characters and I applied to be on CB3, so that I could join this committee and work on these issues.
We're definitely not going to fix this problem tonight or in a day, but I think we need to think about things like a left turn only light cycle onto Lan Fountain Delancey from Essex.
What I can say is that if there are specifics that we can look at signal, timing concern intersections, you know additional signage.
Those are those little things that I could definitely share with my different groups of you know within DOT to take a look at them.
I. Think that's why I'm not able to have all of them join me tonight to speak on behalf of you know this area, but I am glad to you.
We could definitely take a look at trying to think what else was that I can also mention loading zones.
I would say that you know this is something that our agency is going to continue to look at and see.
I would strongly suggest if there's an area that you want to take a look at, for you know putting in designated loading zone.
We want to focus on before we go to the next agenda, item, which is going to address what next month kind of looks like for us, As a committee give us some things that formulated out of that presentation, then David.
I, don't know what people think I agree that it's an intractable problem without gigantic infrastructural infrastructure changes which we can joke about.
Don't know what do people think about like things like those like big light up signs like even putting them in there's like some space in the median, the grassy median.
So, Michelle and Susan I understand your point of a hard-hitting resolution, but I also think that if we're able to ask Jennifer to go forward with a couple of bullets, a couple of bullet points, for example the enforcement, if she's able to coordinate with PD, you know in a week to get enforcement out, there, couldn't that, That's not what she does.
They particularly did not know when they were asked about the structures in the street that had to be 50, open.
You know they certainly need to hear from the community, but I think we don't want to have like just a session of people saying the same complaint over and over.
Here, I think we should do it in presenter, mode, First of all, You can ask them to send the questions, preferably before the meeting, and then we can have them write down so that we don't have people saying the same thing over and over that's what CB2 did they had.
I, don't know which order it was, but they broke it down into like different stakeholders of who asked the questions, and he said, I only got bits and pieces of it.
You know an open round table like what they have done is what you were just describing: Paul, I, think, If I, remember correctly, it was, they would start with the committee.
I saw that they elevated people into the I, guess the presenter part when they needed to and then dropped them back into the regular level after that, which I think makes things easier.
Submitted, go ahead, Ellen, I think it might be easier if you had people sign up like some of the community boards.
What you're, representing who you're representing, as well as the issue or question that you want to ask or submit, and then from that before the meeting you can gather up those and divide it up between the constituencies, various constituencies and similar issue areas right and collect them.
There is a coalition of community block associations and they didn't want to wait till January, so they actually had a meeting last night for me to address all of this enforcement and explaining you know what was going on to them.
You know it, but I think it's also important to make sure there.
I, don't think Trevor's on the line anymore, but parks would not like go ahead.
Like I say, you know, We can have people asking questions, but we also know that the questions ahead of time and I would actually ask the agencies, if you want them to give some presentation to start with to address as much as they can.
Council is going to be voting on making this permanent, So we also want our council members to know what the problems are.
It would be interesting if, once we do get, Those questions submitted that we can aggregate information right if we discover that 80 of the complaints are of a specific certain issue, I think all the electives would be interested to know, because these are representative right of the people who live here, but also.
That's right with the holiday coming in a lot of people are going to be doing their own thing.
I'll, send it over to you and if you want to make any changes or ask any specifics on there or just let me know, I'll, send it over to you.
