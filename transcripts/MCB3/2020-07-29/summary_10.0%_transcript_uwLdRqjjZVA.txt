She is going to be covering basically everything workers need to know, as people start returning to their workplaces and their offices.
I just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure You can submit comments in advance and we will also have a spanish and interpretation so for those of you who need it that will be available, so And we're gonna move into our public session.
First of all, I believe the open meetings law applies and these meetings have to be public, since they include elected officials, community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency.
I'm happy to see assemblyman epstein on the on the call right, now, so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe-.
They will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with Covid-19 of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as south.
I believe we had an influx of people wanting to testify regarding the open, streets, specifically avenue b.
I really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and cb3 for supporting it and hearing testimony at the committee's meeting on people's experience with avenue b, open streets.
We heard some concerns from fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations, made, I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping avenue b in open streets remains in effect and intact.
A NYCHA resident myself, with limited space due to construction and scaffolding, having avenue b as an open street as an option to walk, is exciting and vital, and I.
Laura sewell, I'm speaking today as a long-time neighborhood resident and the executive director of the east village community coalition, in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the avenue b.
So we really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open.
And I'm, also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the DOT about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and fdny's concerns can all be addressed, and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone.
We did a lot of work at the committee level, drafting a resolution that takes into account all of the stakeholders, needs, and I, think we presented a list of four or five really good options for not just It's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities.
For you know, outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling, So I hope that the full board will support the resolution.
Resident, I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the new york city department of transportation.
As you now know, made us an official partner of avenue b's open street in late June, and we are a group of east village and lower east side, community members, business owners and non-profit leaders who formed with the goal of stewarding and maintaining avenue b as a shared street for safe and socially distanced.
This open street is a crucial public health need and no small joy to a community that has suffered greatly as a result of this pandemic.
We thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee, who has been working to find the solution that will allow the avenue b open street to succeed, moving forward, including their resolution.
If you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56, so again a little bit higher, which is great, but Of of the total people who live in cb3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood, the lower east side is at 59 response and chinatown If you think like we don't want half of a hospital, we don't want half of a school.
There was an article in the new york times a couple weeks ago about wealthier new yorkers being out of the city and that's a huge issue, because just because they just because they have the personal resources, doesn't mean that they can just not respond to the census, because they don't think that their neighborhood might need.
2020, have a list of residents in our area that we could call that you know, maybe you called before, and they didn't answer the census, so you weren't able to reach them Could you cut a list for us, so I could definitely cut the list specifically for cv3 or for your neighborhood.
Yeah russell, if you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us Is there any online tools, because I'm part of a cooperative We have dear neighbor letters that we can send you a packet of that you can distribute within your building, and that would be great and the last thing I want to say.
People are dedicated to the open streets on avenue b and they are doing such a service to our community.
I also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the mta board, if they, if they decide to reduce subway service, less than 24 7 after the pandemic is over.
You know anger inducing than that they're using our public services, I mean I'm, not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they don't want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes.
The government is not going to know your our colleague here from new york city, census.
Working from home, I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community.
On top of you, know, from night south of 96th street to lower Manhattan on murray street, and that includes chinatown on the low east side That will really help alleviate some more of the burden during this pandemic, and also we just passed a bill last month about supporting small property owner with some property tax relief, because we have a lot of you.
You know 116 million dollars in our youth, program, and I really wanted to thank all the nonprofits in our community.
That was able to step up and really ready to do, this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding, all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget, side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with councilmember, rivera and speaker to the clemente cultural center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're gonna.
You know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city council to do that, and the rutgers community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program.
It was mainly saving all the north programs that are in our district, and we hope that our senior center will be open soon, because we want to make sure look.
If you can try to keep your reports to two minutes, I'm, not gonna put the timer on, but if I feel like you guys are going, long, I will put the timer on andrew from mayor bill de blasio's, office.
You know, if the current rate, if a lot of people are not responding to census and at the moment our district office is not yet open, but we can be reached at at 718-539-3650 for any constituent service, and you know we can also be reached by the congresswoman's website.
Is, is producing like sanitizing wipes, because I guess you know, because people cannot get enough of the clorox, My question is for the congresswoman, so hud and section eight developments did not qualify for the Covid-19 19 rental assistance and I was wondering if there was going to be any type of support for affordable housing residents for Covid-19 19.
Number two affordable housing, something that community board three is incredibly expert: What we're doing is we're talking to every affordable housing, expert, I, can think of and at least having a listing as to what needs to get done.
And I just feel like we're falling way behind on this topic, so we will be working with the community boards and others to at least have.
We worked on the avenue, b, open street closure, issue, and I know that in terms of the park and the scr they don't, they meaning the city doesn't seem to want to do.
And, you know, I see, d.o.t doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and As. Far as like fluidity of the grid, I.
The way it's best for you, but I think we should have an opportunity, a planned opportunity for people to respond if there isn't I'm just saying give six months with the work and then see what happens.
I want to plan it, because if people don't know that there's a place to respond, they may not.
You tell us how important these seconds, or these minutes are, for saving people's lives, because I'm a little concerned that we're hearing everyone talking about the fact of walking the streets?
You, know the fire lane idea, which I know most street festivals- And, but I also had a question about the trap, the parked cars on avenue, b, And I , don't know if this could be added some friendly resolution to add that those stretch of blocks don't have any parked cars, which would also create more room for both pedestrians.
Think that's why we wanted to ask you what was your potential ideas of what you would like to see happen for that firehouse on avenue, b , The wish list first would be reverse.
Both I mean, I understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood.
There are traffic, calming measures that wouldn't require closing the street like speed, bumps, I, don't know.
You know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety, david.
Now I, actually, don't think that going down 6th street is a safe way for the fire engine to go.
And I've never seen people using avenue, b next to tompkins square park, while it's in an open street mode.
I think we must deal with public safety, and I and I talked first I would like to offer amendment if I could speak a second time just to put public safety to make it clear that public safety is first and that if they cannot, if they cannot come up with a safe way to get the fire engines to go up avenue b from 6th street to 10th street, then we do support removing the open street designation for that stretch of avenue b.
The worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make new york city a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in I'm on the phone to come up with a solution where you can keep it open, but at the same time, keep a lane open for the fire department to use that we're not obstructed.
I don't mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes.
I use the open street to go to 12th street to the community garden there, and there are people that are using it.
The city should remove the open, strategy, installation on avenue b from east 60 to 10th street and the open restaurants designation for having to be between okay, someone had modified it after I sent it, but that's fine, because I hear that's problematic and the open restaurants, designation revenue b between second and third street in order to protect public safety by providing for efficient and timely response, we have dny units in the area.
I, don't want it to go another month, because I really think it's a bad situation over on anywhere east of the park is a bad situation, but you understand that we've got like 24 story, buildings, I, believe over on avenue, d, And we know that the local firehouse is arriving to the scene.
I want the board on record that we would prefer to they cut the open streets.
And I do want the open streets to remain, They even came to the community board.
We talked about second and third street potentially being closed and they went and closed it anyway, like a day or two later But you know even the restaurants between third and fourth are trying to apply for the open, restaurant.
I would like to extend that to remove parking on east forestry and an avenue b between you know, If, that's the side of the street that the fire department we want to make this into the emergency lane.
About right, I know it's along the east side of avenue b for a good part of the way.
