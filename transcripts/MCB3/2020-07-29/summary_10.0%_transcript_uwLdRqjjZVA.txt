She is going to be covering basically everything workers need to know, as people start returning to their workplaces and their offices.
I just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on Monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure You can submit comments in advance and we will also have a spanish and interpretation so for those of you who need it that will be available.
The era of meeting virtually we ask the speaker- forms be submitted the Monday before the meeting by noon, but we're going to grandfather some people into that tonight who did not get it in time, because virtual meetings are a challenge for all of us, so we're trying to be as fair as possible.
First of all, I believe the open meetings law applies and these meetings have to be public, since they include elected officials, community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency.
Assemblyman Epstein on the on the call right, now, so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe-.
We can't go northbound, and my concern is basically that we know we can get to 34th street, which is one of the two hubs where you can transfer to many other routes and for those of us who live all the way east.
Where otherwise, they will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with Covid-19 of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as South.
I believe we had an influx of people wanting to testify regarding The open, streets, specifically avenue B.
So. My name is John Velasco, I'm, a NYCHA, Jacob race, resident, I'm, the district leader of the 74Th Assembly district part A, and I'm A founding member of the Loy Said the open streets community coalition.
I really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public Safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and CB3 for supporting it and hearing testimony.
At the committee's meeting on people's experience with Avenue B open, streets.
We heard some concerns from Fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations, made, I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping Avenue B in open streets remains in effect and intact.
A NYCHA resident myself, with limited space due to construction and scaffolding having Avenue B as an open street as an option to walk, is exciting and vital, and I.
Hi, I'm, Laura, Sewell, I'm speaking today as a long, time, neighborhood resident and the executive director of the East Village community coalition in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the Avenue B open street D.O.T Gave the loiseda open, streets.
Community coalition stewardship of the avenue be open street just one month.
We really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open.
We now have an open line of communication with battalion chief spelling and we hope to work with our fighter fighters and the committee on the best solution for all.
Now we're going to go to Andrew, Gilbert, hello, I'm, also a CB3 resident And I'm, the volunteer coordinator of the Los Cc Chloe's side, open streets, community coalition, and I'm also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the DOT about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and Fdny's concerns can all be addressed and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone.
Think we presented a list of four or five really good options for not just It's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities.
For you know, outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling, And, so I hope that the full board will support the resolution.
I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the New York City Department of transportation.
As you now, know, made us an official partner of Avenue B's open street in late June, and we are a group of East, Village and lower east side.
Community members, business owners and non- profit leaders who formed with the goal of stewarding and maintaining Avenue B as a shared street for safe and socially distanced.
We thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee, who has been working to find the solution that will allow the Avenue B open street to succeed, moving forward, including their resolution earlier.
If you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56, so again a little bit higher, which is great, but Still that's still only 656 of of the total people who live in CB3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood, the lower East side is at 59 response and Chinatown is at 53.
And, that's a huge issue, because just because they just because they have the personal resources, does not mean that they can just not respond to the census, because they do not think that their neighborhood might need.
Make sure that everybody you know has completed the census, and the last thing I will say is that we actually are running a week of action.
If our community board wanted to gather some volunteers to do some outreach, maybe by phone or for example, by phone, is there a list of does NYC census?
Just shoot me an email and we can talk about ways to do a phone bank specifically for your neighborhood, okay, great, because some I mean there are many members who are already involved, maybe through their own organization, but some may not be involved, so we just want to do more.
Itself, If, you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us Is there any online tools, because I'm part of a cooperative If you go to the census, friends and fam link there, we have.
People are dedicated to the open streets on Avenue B and they are doing such a service to our community.
I also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the MTA board, if they, if they decide to reduce subway service less than 24:7 after the pandemic is over.
Insurance we've been continuing to work, Caroline rexelbound who's on the phone has done an amazing, job, and I just wanted to thank her publicly and in helping manage so many cases.
I mean I'm, not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they do not want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes.
The government is not going to know your our colleague here from New York, City census.
Working from home, I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community.
You know, restaurants, are closing a lot of our favorite stores are closing, but one of the dining out program has been successful, that a lot of restaurants have applied for permit to have outdoor dining and in Chinatown we're actually going to start one with D.O.T, Rockwell, Group and Hospitality alliance.
In the city council, we had a stated meeting and I joined with councilmember powers, who is the council member form for the district number four and with borough president on a bill to temporarily repeal the commercial rent tax and that's the tax that the businesses pay on their On top of you, know, from night south of 96th street to lower Manhattan on Murray Street, and that includes Chinatown on the low East side.
You know 116 million dollars in our youth, program, and I really wanted to thank all the nonprofits in our community.
That was able to step up and really ready to do, this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding, all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget, side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with Councilmember, rivera and speaker to the Clemente Cultural Center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're going to you.
You know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city Council to do that, and the Rutgers Community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program.
It was mainly saving all the north programs that are in our district, and we hope that our senior center will be open soon, because we want to make sure look.
So, the paycheck protection program that was passed by You know it's people Can business can start applying.
If, you know, if the current rate, if a lot of people are not responding to census and at the moment our district office is not yet open, but we can be reached at at 718- 539- 3650 for any constituent service, and you know we can also be reached by the congresswoman's website.
This you know, a lot of elected offices are giving them out for free and in fact I was out in Sansa Park on Monday, with volunteers, doing census, I mean we gave out free mask to anybody stopping by the table.
Is, is producing like sanitizing wipes, because I guess you know, because people can not get enough of the clorox, So Hud and section eight developments did not qualify for the Covid-19 rental assistance and I was wondering if there was going to be any type of support for affordable housing residents for Covid-19.
It strengthens oversight by establishing a transparent process where nursing homes and residential health care facilities are threatened and requires the commissioner of New York, State Department of Health, to ensure that, like the local community, has that same resource elsewhere before closing down, so that was passed.
Number two affordable housing, something that community board three is incredibly expert: What we're doing is we're talking to every affordable housing, expert, I, can think of and at least having a listing as to what needs to get done.
We need to focus, as you know, more on accessibility, not in your area, but in board.
We worked on the Avenue B open street closure.
That committee asked for the second street reversal, but we this is the first time we heard about the delineators as a potential option.
And, you know, I see, D.O.T doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and as far as like fluidity of the grid, I think in Manhattan.
Just hope that you know there are not any The way it's best for you, but I think we should have an opportunity, a planned opportunity for people to respond.
I want to plan it, because if people do not know that, there's a place to respond, they may not.
You tell us how important these seconds, or these minutes are, for saving people's lives, because I'm a little concerned that we're hearing everyone talking about the fact of walking the streets?
Thank you, captain moye for coming, and I just wanted to ask you, because I'm not sure if you had a chance or you saw the resolution that we passed in our committee, because we had a couple of proposed solutions that we developed in conjunction with with with another Rep from Fdmy.
Both I mean, I understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood.
If your goal is to slow traffic down, so that's a measure that you could suggest as a resolution to install speed bumps along Avenue B that would slow traffic down It's better if there could be a way that at least one lane could be, You know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety, David.
Now I actually do not think that going down 6th street is a safe way for the fire engine to go.
Never seen people using Avenue B next to tompkins square park, While, it's in an open street mode.
I think we must deal with public safety, and I and I talked first I would like to offer amendment if I could speak a second time just to put public safety to make it clear that public safety is first and that if they can not, if they can not come up with a safe way to get the fire engines to go up Avenue B from 6th street to 10th street, then we do support removing the open street designation for that stretch of Avenue B.
So the fire department is the Le. The worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make New York City a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in I'm on the phone to come up with a solution where you can keep it open, but at the same time, keep a lane open for the fire department to use that we're not obstructed.
Think I put forth And everybody's kind of come up with good solutions here that we can still provide a fire access lane, while keeping this area closed.
I do not mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes.
I want the board on record that we would prefer to they cut the open streets.
I would like to extend that to remove parking on East Forestry and an avenue b between you know, Second and tenth streets on the on the east, side.
I know people are starting to go outside and frolic, as my grandma would say, but I just want you to you: Remember, your responsibility to the board and attending your committee meetings.
I know that people have things that come up.
Please, be in communication with the board, the chairs of the committees in which you sit on or the subcommittees of which you sit on so that they know what's going on, because if you do not tell us, we do not know, and I want to welcome David Adams back as he has been dealing with his own personal things happening in his home.
