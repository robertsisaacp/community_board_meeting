I just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure You can submit comments in advance and we will also have a spanish and interpretation so for those of you who need it that will be available, so and we're gonna move into our public session As I mentioned we have a about a half dozen or so people who signed up to be speakers In. The era of meeting virtually we ask the speaker- forms- be submitted the monday before the meeting by noon, but we're gonna grandfather some people into that tonight who didn't get it in time, because virtual meetings are a challenge for all of us, so we're trying to be as fair as possible.
Community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency, These should be open to the community to observe since important information is going to be related and the community has a right to see both the questions and the answers that ddc surpr supplied so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe- and I would like this to be referred to a community board committee, so that the community board will take a position on whether they believe the community action group meetings should be open to the public.
We can't go northbound, and my concern is basically that we know we can get to 34th street, which is one of the two hubs where you can transfer to many other routes and for those of us who live all the way east I feel like we're already in a transportation desert and that this basically the edcs did not have any kind of community input.
I had a conversation with people from EDC Vice president in charge of this, and all they're really concerned about, is numbers of basically having a groundswell of people who are actually using it where otherwise, they will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with Covid-19 of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as south I would suggest that you reach out to our district manager in the office.
I really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and cb3 for supporting it and hearing testimony at the committee's meeting on people's experience with avenue b, open streets Specifically through the coalition we started of resident and community stakeholder volunteers.
We have seen some major improvement barricades, get replaced faster, they're, positioned in the correct spot, based on guidelines from the department of transportation and more folks come out to enjoy the streets at the transportation committee meeting We heard some concerns from fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations made I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping avenue b in open streets remains in effect and intact.
laura sewell I'm speaking today as a long-time neighborhood resident and the executive director of the east village community coalition in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the avenue b.
So we really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open street It's well used by a diverse group of neighborhood residents.
Now we're going to go to andrew gilbert, hello, I'm, also a cb3 resident The volunteer coordinator of the los cc chloe's side, open streets and I'm also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the DOT about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and fdny's concerns can all be addressed and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone involved.
We did a lot of work at the committee level, drafting a resolution that takes into account all of the stakeholders needs you know, it's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities.
For you know, outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling and so I hope that the full board will support the resolution.
Thank you to my fellow founders of the louis cida open streets, community coalition, As, a co-founder of lask and a former public member of cb3's transportation, public safety and environment committee and an east village resident I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the new york city, department of transportation, as you now know, made us an official partner of avenue b's open street in late June, and we are a group of east village and lower east side.
We have won a groundswell of volunteer support of 50 volunteers from local businesses, families and individuals who have been robbed of their rob summer, programming outdoors and are dedicated to managing this open street We thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee who has been working to find the solution that will allow the avenue b open street to succeed, moving forward, including their resolution.
I do want to give us some numbers for your area and for the city, so new york city as a whole right now has a 54 response rate That's just over half of new york city residents have completed the census just for some context, the country as a whole, because it's of course a nationwide effort, The nation as a whole, is at 62.6 percent, so we're pretty far behind the country as a whole and let's get a little bit more detailed Manhattan as a as a borough, is at 55, so we're doing a little bit better than the than the citywide average, but not by much cb3 If you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56, so again, a little bit higher, which is great, but still that's still only 656 of of the total people who live in cb3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood.
So you mentioned this is the census week of action and, for example, if our community board wanted to gather some volunteers to do some outreach, maybe by phone or, for example, by phone 2020 have a list of residents in our area that we could call that you know.
We don't have the actual responses we just can know based on what the public data that the census bureau is putting out But what I can look up quickly is a racial breakdown, so I don't have access, unfortunately, to corrupt the data itself, If you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us, We have dear neighbor letters that we can send you a packet of that you can distribute within your building, and that would be great and the last thing I want to say.
That's also going to protect our journalists, the new york times, msnbc I, also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the mta board if they, if they decide to reduce subway service, less than 24 7 after the pandemic is over.
The 27th is only responding at 49, so we are below the nation below the state below the city of new york and below Manhattan You know anger inducing than that they're using our public services, I mean I'm, not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they don't want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes.
You just have to hit the space bar or hit the microphone margaret Working from home I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community and you know, restaurants, are closing a lot of our favorite stores are closing, but one of the dining out program has been successful, that a lot of restaurants have applied for permit to have outdoor dining and in chinatown we're actually gonna start one with dot.
Rockwell group and hospitality alliance, To close off I, mean to have a section on mars street that to have outdoor dining and that really nice furniture to make it more attractive, hopefully, can help some of the small business and the in the restaurant Residents about you know some of the bad actors who don't follow the rules and don't do the social you know, distancing and creating a lot of concern and their enforcement I think one of the places in the lower east side got their license, legalized and taken away and I think that we have to punish the bad actors and support the one that are really trying hard to stay in business and support their workers and support the neighborhood Today.
In the city council, we had a stated meeting and I joined with councilmember powers, who is the council member form for the district number four and with borough president on a bill to temporarily repeal the commercial rent tax and that's the tax that the businesses pay on their and, on top of you know, from night south of 96th street to lower Manhattan on murray street, and that includes chinatown.
That was able to step up and really ready to do this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with councilmember, rivera and speaker to the clemente cultural center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're gonna You know we also provide a funding for exterior lighting for nature, believe it you know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city council to do that, and the rutgers community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program.
What she's talking about is that since the protest and oh okay, a lot of the precincts have been barricading the blocks that their precinct was on We've been following up that we, you know, send a letter to the police headquarters and the mayor's office complaining about that because that's happening all over lower Manhattan You know us for cutting their budget and or passing all these bills reform bill that are so they're not being as cooperative as they should be, I have a question about the lower section of march from moscow to challenge school or nabari.
You know with the street seating there is that a closure daily or could Some certain time is that a daily street closure a street closure It's like the outdoor dining Not it's not closing the street It's that they're setting up the outdoor seating so that the restaurant can utilize the space for that You know the local restaurant to be able to Let's try this out and see and see how you know how well it can to help the restaurants in the area, or maybe you can advocate to expand that toward the traditional core of chinatown Try with this first, you know how china well italians right the outreach and then people will want it.
We worked on the avenue b, open street closure issue and I know that in terms of the park and the scr they don't, they meaning the city doesn't seem to want to do infant blood, interim blood protection measures, That's really important to the community.
The construction project is a concern, but I think a greater concern is having barricades blocking the intersection of second and b I believe our resolution that we voted on That committee asked for the second street reversal, but we this is the first time we heard about the delineators as a potential option.
I just want to be able to make sure the public has a risk time to respond after six months or so to see if it goes away- and you know, I see dot, doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and as far as like fluidity of the grid, I think in Manhattan I just think we may not understand the unten tension consequences of what happens so The way it's best for you, but I think we should have an opportunity, a planned opportunity for people to respond if there isn't I want to plan it, because if people don't know that there's a place to respond, they may not I just want to have something that said in the on our agenda that we can cover we'll and I think that's important well , what I think is important, because I did hear four speakers in the beginning.
In my experience, that's going to be a heavy lift for in the community to get rid of parking, as we know so , I mean I may be Keeping this thing open and providing proper access for the fire department, that's why we wanted to ask you: what was your potential ideas of what you would like to see happen for that firehouse on avenue, b.
At, one of my neighbors who's, a mother of three small children, was hit by a car speeding down avenue b when she had the light, because people came off the williamsburg bridge and used clinton street and avenue b as a freeway So. Having the street closed in portions has been a godsend for our neighborhood, particularly with people with small children trying to cross the street to get to tompkins square park to the playgrounds, so anything that could be done to facilitate safety For both I mean I, understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood You know.
That would slow traffic down it's better if there could be a way that at least one lane could be You know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety.
The worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make new york city a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in I'm on the phone to come up with a solution where you can keep it open, but at the same time, keep a lane open for the fire department to use that we're not obstructed So. That's my purpose for being on the call, so I think there are other measures that can be taken before we have to get to the worst case scenario, which is removing it from the program and everybody's kind of come up with good solutions here that we can still provide a fire access lane.
I don't mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes.
It's public safety We would prefer that they get rid of the open streets designation there I don't want it to go another month, because I really think it's a bad situation over on anywhere east of the park is a bad situation, but you understand that we've got like 24 story, buildings I, believe over on avenue d, and if there were to be a disaster, it would be a disaster if there were a fire- and we know that the local firehouse is arriving to the scene Second, whereas they ordinarily operate arrive first.
We talked about second and third street potentially being closed , I, don't know if it's giving them an out, but you know even the restaurants between third and fourth are trying to apply for the open restaurant It's about to take up all of avenue and that's going to really hurt fdny and any other first responder I will tell you that dot is very in favor, of keeping open streets open, so I, don't think that it is giving them out because actually they're the ones who would have to make that decision and it's not like they're itching to get rid of open streets.
You know from someone from new york city census talk about the upcoming week of action, and he did say that you know the response rate in our area is something from 49 to 53 That really is a lot of people, in spite of all the rah-rah we're doing a good job, so we are doing a good job, but we need to do a better job, and maybe we can follow up with that.
