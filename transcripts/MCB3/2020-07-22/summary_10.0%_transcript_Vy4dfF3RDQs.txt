That might be an important change, but Are you able to share that with the committee What's difficult is even in july, 2021 You can kind of state your concerns, but we're not able at this time right to like assert definitively that this is This is the impact that will happen, but and then it almost serves as a reminder for next year's district needs statement on those metrics or markers or whatever issues you had to say, Maybe.
The facade at 10 pm play recorded background music not apply for an alteration without first coming before us, not host pub crawls or party buses not have unlimited drink specials not have happy hours, not have weight lines outside and also have someone responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the this application says: The cfo on the first floor is 50 People on the second floor is 70 10 tables and 20 seats outside with seven tables and 14 seats on each sixth street It said: vegan, spanish tapas it didn't the applicant didn't provide a menu.
So two clarifications before I see: If there's anybody who wants to speak to this in the audience, the virtual audience or ask questions, is 445 e6 street still going to be a separate little first So is it just going to operate as one continuous space, but there's going to be like still a separate bar and a separate entrance at that location?
I can only say that has no recent complaints or sla history that we would approve the alteration or deny it unless they would agree to the following stipulations and then I would propose almost the same stipulations as existed before so now it would be operate as a full-service vegan spanish tapas restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food to within one hour of closing on both floor The I may have already done it, which is that it will operate as a full service restaurant on both floors, because our form doesn't really permit it to be typed into the top.
All three rooms will be essentially operated as the same business Okay, but with that little back room we want to use for private events for teaching classes, and maybe, if we get run over on the weekends, if we're busy enough we'll use it on them for those nights But, we will still keep the liquor license on that bar okay, then I'll just put both floors at both addresses as a full-service, restaurant and bidder's bar okay, that the hours will be 5 pm to 2 am all day that the sidewalk cafe hours will be 5 pm to 10 pm and I'm, specifically referring to the outdoor cafe you're going to operate.
Okay of the committee members So, it's a closed facade with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours, and then we'll go to the discussion of whether or not we should keep the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe the closing hours the same or extend them in any way, and what the applicant is asking for is to extend them to 11, saturdays fridays and saturdays Does.
On sidewalk, cafes, Sorry I said we approved a sidewalk cafe last in 2016 Well, at one point in time we turned it into a bar that did not require outdoor seating, so I gave it up and then that bar didn't work out very well Then again, we that's when we turned it into mother, pearl The tiki bar which outdoor seating was a good addition to a tiki bar and polynesian restaurant I think I'm with clint that this can I'm okay, with this being an exception, and you know a decade of the being in business there with little complaints going to 11 I mean people who sit on this committee wants to decor everything.
Everybody said I we're going to move to number four, which is also an alteration application of robbie's, which is for 111 east 7th street, and it's also to change the type of restaurant It is when I looked at the application We approve this Originally, this location in January of 2007, with stipulations to operate a fondue restaurant It's, a different space, One used to be a fondue restaurant , it's next door, it's the one that was approved in may of 2017.
We approved a beer wine license in may of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full service, vegan restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 am monday through friday, 3 pm to 2 am Saturday and sunday not using outdoor space.
Having happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight loss and having staff outside and the alteration proposal is to change from a vegan indian to a vegan mexican or vegan filipino restaurant The cfo is for 74 with 14 tables 44 seats, a 17 foot bar with 12 stools, The hours, that I wrote from the application were 5 pm to 12, am All day kitchen open all hours, There's no answer about the facade and I.
Don't know if I'm thinking about the right storefront, but I thought that it had open windows, no tvs, recorded background music, no promoted events, schedule performances or covers no security, existing sound proof proving no punk calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait line staff outside, and this said that a license was issued.
The resolution will say what the applicant is applying for what the elements of the application are, what the history of the application is for this storefront and when the license was issued, and that, given that this has been an existing business, that's only seeking to amend the type of food served that we would approve this with the essentially the same stipulations governing its method of operation and those being as follows: operate.
I was just thinking about it for a little while and the four am on a side street, but I connect with other committee members So then we'll go to the making of the resolution, and before we do that, can we can you just speak, please and I'm speaking to the applicant about why it's classified as a tavern with a full menu in a kitchen more for the historical perspective, this area as I'm sure most everybody knows, was little germany way back in the day.
Okay I just want to get through part of the making of the resolution so that I know where we're headed So. The resolution is going to state what the application is for the elements of the applications, the location since it's relevant to the location of the residential street, the history of the location, the number of ops, the history of the applicant- As part of the discussion, the and I'll put in a warehouse with the amendment that this is a restaurant, not a tavern, as identified the original fla notice Now, with respect to the stipulation it's restaurant with a kitchen open and serving food all hours right , seafood, continental, we'll get back to hours, no outdoor space, facade closing at 10 pm , a small stage in the background would just be like you know, jazz axe during the weekend, though, which he they shouldn't have had to begin with, but I guess we'll speak to that may not be able to understand okay, it's not integral to the business, so no alteration without first coming before us, no pub crawler party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines, no staff outside no unlimited drink, specials What the applicant's attorney has proposed is this business being open from 11 am to 2 am all day as opposed to the originally proposed hours?
It sounds like he actually did a decent job, probably with it, but I would like to have some more assurances from either the people that live above or something else once he's open that it's not going to be a problem, because we we've had live music in these old buildings and it echoes or carries through spaces that are very strange in these old buildings and can bother people three floors up Okay, so I think we can only approve it at this stage Drafting the resolution with recorded background music, no djs, no live music, no promoted event, scheduled performances or events with cover fees, You know adequate, sound proofing and how that would look and how often you would have live music where they would be located, and other people have done that now, via email and even via in-person meetings for locations Is there an amendment or any addition to the resolution that exists now, because we addressed both the hours of operation and the music?
That's been licensed for a while and is on good terms with the community there or, but he lives in the building above this bar lounge with his family So. If anyone's concerned with it being a good neighbor, it would be him You know really watching the different people having come through the space and I really want to have a place that people feel comfortable in coming to and then I'll ask the committee members.
The number of ops, the history of the applicant that he lives in the building and operates the business that was mentioned and what his history was, as he stated in his in the questionnaire and then that we would approve this, given that it was a tavern with a full on premises, licenses similar or the same stipulations, That being as follows, that it would operate as a tavern with less than a full-service kitchen serving food all hours There would be no outdoor.
This is keeping me from writing that we can speak to whether or not we want to include anything about additional soundproofing which wasn't the last resolution, but employing security as needed, playing recorded music and having djs and live music with live music consisting of acoustic piano or guitar, but not having promoted event, schedule performances Events with cover fees not applying for an alteration without first coming to before us having happy hours to 9 pm, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight loss and having staff outside the last applicant Any discussion of sound proofing or the sound system in this resolution?
We denied an op license for this applicant in october of 2017, and then approved a wine beer license in november of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full-service cheese focused restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 11 am to 10 pm.
A six-foot bar or service counter The same proposed hours of operation, kitchen open all hours, open windows closing at 11 one tv It also looks like there are open doors in the picture that the applicant can speak to that one: tv, recording, music, no, promote event, schedule, performances or events with cover fees, no security, no sound proofing, According to the applicant.
It has to be typed into the bottom, because it's different from the standardized one playing recorded background music, not having djs, live music, promoted event, scheduled performances or events with covers not applying for an alteration without first coming before us not having happy hours, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines and having a staff person responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside Are you referring to the hours of operation or which one I was referring to the the existing stipulation for the facade, is to close it at 11, which is different from the standardized facade So. If you can x out the 10 pm and add in 11 where the resolution where the typed out, then you can change it there, otherwise it just has to be typed into the bottom, with 11 pm Is there, a second a second You can't vote ellen Did you vote?
