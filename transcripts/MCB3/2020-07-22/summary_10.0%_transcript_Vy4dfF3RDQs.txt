Your committee is lucky in certain ways, because a lot of the needs are kind of evergreen But we've also asked every committee to try to tailor at least a paragraph or two just something related to conditions that have arisen because of Covid-19 We , don't know what the licensed business landscape will look, like.
Do we need to ask for a more specific intervention now that we've had a year to digest the changes to the landscape of you, know, liquor, license and well all sorts of licensed businesses The committee should just look at and But I think on the office end, we felt pretty good with that.
We have suggested over time, because it's kind of a static committee in terms of what the We continue to request, something like that, or should we be maybe just talk about using tools to address quality of life complaints and also have perhaps having agencies work more efficiently together to address them in a more efficient way.
You want to think about like a separate resolution that calls for something specific to change for an existing law.
What one more thing this procedurally unusual from the past is, I think, we'll try to finalize it in august, but technically that'll, be when the committee stops working on it, but we're gonna actually vote on the district lead statement as a full board at on the same time as the budget is in October, which is unusual.
You know safety valve there to add something if something just out of the blue comes up that you that you missed We're, going to move on to the applications now, starting with number three, which is yes, which is 95 avenue a aka, 445 east 6th, street.
Ravi okay sounds good, so this is a alteration: application, changing the method of operation of a two-story venue separated into two separate businesses and combining them into one business, presumably to mirror the existing small business at 445, east 5th, street.
When we approved an alteration to change the second floor from a cuban restaurant to a vegan, texas, barbecue, restaurant and whiskey bar with the following stipulations, operate a full-service, vegan, polynesian restaurant on the ground floor, which is what existed there at the time at a vegas, vegan, texas, barbecue restaurant on the second floor, serving pooch within one hour, closing on both floors operating the storefront at 4, 45 86th street at the bidders bar have hours of 5 pm to 2 am all days have a sidewalk cafe, and this is a little bit incorrect because it says, with hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m. And, we said open at 11 a.m, but Those were the existing sidewalk cafe hours.
We heard this alteration: close, the facade at 10 pm play recorded background music, not apply for an alteration without first coming before us, not host pub crawls or party buses not have unlimited drink specials not have happy hours, not have weight lines outside and also have someone responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the this application.
So, two clarifications before I see: If there's anybody who wants to speak to this in the audience, the virtual audience or ask questions, is 445 e6 street still going to be a separate little first.
Yes and the entrance is still going to be on avenue Then you can either go directly into the ground floor or up to the second floor, There'll be one entrance on avenue a that will go into what is now the tiki bar You. Can't the only way to get into the small space would be through the kitchen so that room will still operate with its own entrance.
And, then I would propose almost the same stipulations as existed before so now it would be operate as a full-service vegan spanish tapas restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food to within one hour of closing on both floor, and I would put.
But, we will still keep the liquor license on that bar okay, then I'll just put both floors at both addresses as a full-service, restaurant and bidder's bar okay, that the hours will be 5 pm to 2 am all day that the sidewalk cafe hours will be 5 p.m, to 10 p.m. And, I'm specifically, referring to the outdoor cafe you're, going to operate.
The outdoor cafe separate from the rest of the restaurant, no it'll be part of it, but you said: 5 p.m to 10 p.m. What I was saying should I then change the indoor hours of operation.
So, it's a closed facade with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait live staff outside And, then we'll go to the discussion of whether or not we should keep the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe the closing hours the same or extend them in any way, and what the applicant is asking for is to extend them to 11, saturdays fridays and saturdays.
Okay, I think we should stay consistent because I'm sure other people is going to come and ask for that extra hour, which we have diligently withhold all the time that we have been issuing.
All hours I was going to leave what we had agreed to before, but clint is right that we've amended sort of what the standard is that, as the fla has amended it, and generally we ask people to serve food all hours which takes into account that you're going to be shutting down your kitchen, so that doesn't know that You have to necessarily cook them before me and serve them, but the wording the sla has been using more has been open and serving food all hours, but I, don't Otherwise.
We approved a beer wine license in may of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full service, vegan restaurant serving food, all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 a.m, monday through friday, 3 p.m, to 2 a.m. Saturday and sunday, not using outdoor space, closing its facade at 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming to us not seeking an upgrade, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, having happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight loss and having staff outside.
Don't know if I'm thinking about the right storefront, but I thought that it had open windows, no tvs, recorded background music, No promoted, events, schedule performances or covers no security, existing sound proof, proving no punk calls or party buses.
We were first approved in Okay, 5 pm to midnight 7 days, a week, our we opened that place our chef passed, away, and then I came back to you guys and said I want to turn it into an indian restaurant.
Given that this has been an existing business, that's only seeking to amend the type of food served that we would approve this with the essentially the same stipulations governing its method of operation and those being as follows: operate.
A full-service vegan filipino restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 12 am all days not using outdoor space.
Staff outside this applicant has operated an indoor outdoor beer garden at 272 missouri street in Brooklyn, since 2014 with an op license issued november 13th of 2014.
It was also the issue that existed for chola noir, which ultimately got a license from the sla, but we heard it multiple times and it reduced its hours somewhat, but it also had a It wanted to have like a restaurant pseudo bar bar gallery, but ultimately, restaurant bar business.
So then we'll go to the making of the resolution, and before we do that, can we can you just speak, please And, I'm speaking to the applicant about why it's classified as a tavern with a full menu in a kitchen more for the historical perspective, this area, as I'm sure most everybody knows, was little germany way back in the day.
It didn't sound like you were ahead, because the sla asks are you going to be a restaurant with a full menu and a kitchen , that's open all hours and tavern is minimal, food, organic candy, kitchen or less of a full service kitchen with some kind of food, all hours.
With respect to the stipulation, it's restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food, all hours, right, seafood, continental, we'll get back to hours.
You want to discuss that and going to the committee How it you would have it incorporated as the business What I would propose would be having jazz musicians on a small, elevated area in the back of the room, and it's an area that couldn't hold any more than three people.
This is an application for a tavern with minimal food recorded music, djs security, no outdoor space on the ground floor and basement of this location.

That said, it was a 25 foot bar is at proposed hours or 11 a.m. To 4 a.m. All day, A prep area serving small place, all hours, a close facade, no tv's recorded in live music and dj's at entertainment.
I think it was their first location in new york, but it was also maybe different, because it was a transfer of 4 a.m. He does have a place in chelsea, that's been licensed for a while and is on good terms with the community there Or, but he lives in the building above this bar lounge, with his family.
And I really want to have a place that people feel comfortable in coming to Then I'll ask the committee members if they have any questions or comments?
