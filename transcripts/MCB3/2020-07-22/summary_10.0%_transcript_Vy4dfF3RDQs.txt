Do we need to ask for a more specific intervention now that we've had a year to digest the changes to the landscape of you, know, liquor, license and well all sorts of licensed businesses , that's kind of a safe, way.
And if it's feeling irrelevant at this point, you may want to remove it And You know that we've recommended to other committees if it feels like something's, not working.
You want to think about like a separate resolution that calls for something specific to change for an existing law.
What one more thing this procedurally unusual from the past is, I think, we'll try to finalize it in August, but technically that'll, be when the committee stops working on it, but we're going to actually vote on the district lead statement as a full board at on the same time as the budget is in October, which is unusual.
We heard this application originally in 2010 and approved it as cn flagos and last heard it November of 2018 when we approved an alteration to change the second floor from a cuban restaurant to a Vegan, Texas Barbecue, Restaurant and whiskey bar with the following stipulations, operate: A full- service, Vegan Polynesian restaurant on the ground floor, which is what existed there at the time at a Vegas, Vegan Texas, Barbecue Restaurant on the second floor, serving Pooch within one hour, closing on both floors operating the storefront at 4:45 86th street at the bidders bar have hours of 5 pm to 2.
We heard this alteration: close, the facade at 10 pm play recorded background music, not apply for an alteration without first coming before us, not host pub crawls or party buses not have unlimited drink specials not have happy hours, not have weight lines outside and also have someone responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the this application.
So, two clarifications before I see: If there's anybody who wants to speak to this in the audience, the virtual audience or ask questions, is 445 E6 street still going to be a separate little first, I've never been in it.
Then you can either go directly into the ground floor or up to the second floor, There'll be one entrance on Avenue A that will go into what is now the Tiki bar or You. Can't the only way to get into the small space would be through the kitchen so that room will still operate with its own entrance.
And, then I would propose almost the same stipulations as existed before so now it would be operate as a full- service, Vegan, Spanish, Tapas restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food to within one hour of closing on both floor, and I would put the I'm going to have to put this as a separate ellen unless you can fit it in at the bottom.
But, we will still keep the liquor license on that bar okay, then I'll just put both floors at both addresses as a full, service, restaurant and bidder's bar okay, that the hours will be 5 pm to 2 am all day that the sidewalk cafe hours will be 5 P.M to 10 P.M, all day.
It's a closed facade with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no pub crawls or party buses.
And, then we'll go to the discussion of whether or not we should keep the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe the closing hours the same or extend them in any way, and what the applicant is asking for is to extend them to 11, saturdays, Fridays and Saturdays.
Okay, I think we should stay consistent because I'm sure other people is going to come and ask for that extra hour, which we have diligently withhold all the time that we have been issuing.
I was going to leave what we had agreed to before, but clint is right that we've amended sort of what the standard is that, as the Fla has amended it, and generally we ask people to serve food all hours, which takes into account that you're going to be shutting down.
Everybody said I we're going to move to number four, which is also an alteration application of Robbie's, which is for 111 East 7th street, and it's also to change the type of restaurant.
Just let me go through my history that I have We approved a beer wine license in May of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full service, vegan restaurant, serving food, all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 A.M Monday through Friday 3 P.M to 2, A.M, Saturday and Sunday, not using outdoor space, closing its facade at 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming to us not seeking an upgrade, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, having happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight loss and having staff outside.
Windows, no tvs, recorded background music, no promoted, events, schedule performances or covers no security, existing sound proof, proving no punk calls or party buses.
So I just want to, I think, understand which location it is and when the license was actually issued and what the license is for, because it also seems to be unclear about whether it's a wine beer license or a gear license.
We were first approved in, either the end of 17 or 18 as the Vegan Japanese with a midnight beer and wine license Okay, 5 pm to midnight 7 days a week, our we opened that place our chef passed, away, and then I came back to you guys and said I want to turn it into an indian restaurant.
So for that space east, we would like to change it into Vegan Filipino, Restaurant, 5 P.M to midnight seven days a week offering food at all.
Given that this has been an existing business, that's only seeking to amend the type of food served that we would approve this with the essentially the same stipulations governing its method of operation and those being as follows: operate.
A full- service, Vegan, Filipino restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 12 am all days not using outdoor space.
I'm thinking of the last one having a facade that closed with windows, that closed doors or windows that close at 10 p.m. Or, whenever there's any amplified sound, but having recorded background music, no dj's live, music, promoted, events, schedule, performances or events with covers No alteration without first coming before us no upgrade without coming before us Whereas clauses they should indicate within 200 feet of two churches: two houses of worship, no happy hours, no wait lines and a deaf person responsible for overseeing crowds and noise, outside.
Staff outside this applicant has operated an indoor outdoor beer garden at 272 Missouri street in Brooklyn, since 2014 with an op license issued November 13th of 2014.
There has, over time in the community board's history, been issues with the fact that there are Back licensed businesses on that side of the street.
It was also the issue that existed for Chola noir, which ultimately got a license from the SLA, but we heard it multiple times and it reduced its hours somewhat, but it also had a It wanted to have like a restaurant pseudo bar bar gallery, but ultimately, restaurant bar business on this side street that we were hoping to not add to when we already had a history with issues, a history of issues with the number of businesses and the types of businesses over time.
So I mean committee members: Does anybody else want to be heard or make a comment with respect to the application?
So, then we'll go to the making of the resolution, and before we do that, can we can you just speak, please And, I'm speaking to the applicant about why it's classified as a tavern with a full menu in a kitchen more for the historical perspective, this area, as I'm sure most everybody knows, was little Germany way back in the day.
It did not sound like you were ahead because the SLA asks are you going to be a restaurant with a full menu and a kitchen , That's open all hours and tavern is minimal, food, organic candy, kitchen or less of a full service kitchen with some kind of food, all hours.
Now, with respect to the stipulation It's restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food all hours, Right, seafood, continental, we'll get back to hours, no outdoor space, facade.
All right, so we have to address hours and music So, no alteration without first coming before us, no pub Crawler party buses, no happy hours What what the applicant's attorney has proposed is this business being open from 11 A.M to 2 A.M, all day, as opposed to the originally proposed hours?
You want to discuss that and going to the committee In there's a level of the two am all days for the hours now, with respect to the music.
This is an application for a tavern with minimal food recorded music, Djs security, no outdoor space on the ground floor and basement of this location.
The last op that we heard for this location was approved in September of 2015, with stipulations to operate a tavern serving food all hours.
If necessary, consistent with the recommendations of a sound engineer, employing security all day playing recorded music and having djs and live music consisting of acoustic piano or guitar, but not having promoted events scheduled performances or covers installing a sound system consisting of distributed speakers to minimize noise and base not applying for an alteration not having happy hours.
That said, it was a 25 foot bar is at proposed hours or 11 A.M to 4 A.M all day a prep area serving small place, all hours, a close facade, no tv's recorded in live music and dj's at entertainment.
And was there was a couple other people as well, that were from like the Bowery Block Association That wants to say anything on this item before we move on okay committee members, No, the entire business had no happy hours.
The number of ops, the history of the applicant, that he lives in the building and operates the business that was mentioned and what his history was, as he stated in his in the questionnaire And, then that we would approve this, given that it was a tavern with a full on premises, licenses, similar or the same stipulations.
A full- service, cheese, focused restaurant, serving food, all hours having hours of 11 A.M to 10, P.M, sundays, 11 A.M to 12 A.M Monday through Tuesday Thursday, 11, A.M to 3, A.M, Friday and Saturday, not using outdoor space.
It also looks like there are open doors in the picture that the applicant can speak to that one, TV, recording, music, no promote event, schedule, performances or events with cover fees, no security.
Anything else you want to say, with respect to the application same operation, there'll be no changes, anything we're doing.
You know: we've opened through Covid-19 Around us closed I mean, except for the bars, but food wise has been really hard.
But we're having our guys still work So then does anybody want to speak to or be heard with, respect to whether or not to approve a full license?
It has to be typed into the bottom, because it's different from the standardized one playing recorded background, music, not having Djs, live, music, promoted, event, scheduled performances or events with covers not applying for an alteration without first coming before us not having happy hours, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines and having a staff person responsible for overseeing crabs and noise.
