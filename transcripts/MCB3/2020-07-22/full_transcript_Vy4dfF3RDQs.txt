Yeah I'm trying it now, I'm still! Well I just I just resent another one though, oh god, I got it. Okay, great apologies, everyone for the technical difficulties here, but we should be up and running momentarily so while we're waiting in on jesse to check the minutes, so the chat box, as I said earlier, we're using that for our attendance, but also the chat box is not to be used for side conversations. So if you do have a question, please raise your hand using the raised hand, function or if you have an issue, you can also request to speak in the chat box, but let's try to keep the side conversations in the chat box to a minimum. All right, this isn't working. So I'm just going to try and take the notes in rig hold on jesse. You could just type them as paragraphs and then we'll insert them into the minute form. That's what I'll do? Let's just get started I'll. I have to do that later. So, okay and I'll refer to the numbers so that you know thank you, oh herman just signed in. So I'm just admitting him now. So we're all here: okay, thanks! So I'm going to start good evening, everybody! Hopefully we can move this along for you relatively quickly. We try to do that, given that the format is so unusual or I guess we're getting used to it. So it's not it's less unusual for us we're going to start the meeting with two items that are not applications and then we're going to move to the applications, and there are six of those. The first item is voting or approval of previous month minutes. Do I have a resolution or any amendment for the minutes that I send out. So this is, for my committee members said: was that you hermann? Yes? Is there a second all in favor hi, and that was all five of us we're moving now on to a discussion, a continued discussion of the district needs statement. We started this discussion last month and we'll finalize it next month, but essentially it summarizes the community. Our community needs in a document that we give to the city present here to assist us with that tonight is our assistant district manager, jim hi, bro, hi, jim, and I sent out for everybody what I sent out last month, which was a slightly amended, need statement for our section. It was amended by the office, and then I updated it by just including some language that references, what we're going through now and how we're unable to perceive the complete consequences of what we're going through now, and that is because I was trying to do it from the perspective of the fiscal year that it's addressing the need statement is addressing fiscal year. 2021 right, jim is there. I know I sent it to the office. Were the there any suggestions or comments you had with respect to it. I sent it to the committee members as well, and then we can pull it up if we need to yeah the. So I think what alex is describing is kind of that every single committee has had to grapple with. Your committee is lucky in certain ways, because a lot of the needs are kind of evergreen and mostly we can kind of update statistics, but it's really a lot of the same needs, but we've also asked your year. It's often a lot of the same, but we've also asked every committee to try to tailor at least a paragraph or two just something related to conditions that have arisen because of Covid-19 and, like alex said, you know she put together a great like draft paragraph of what that could look like. I don't really have any particular suggestions, I think you're. The challenge you just described is the challenge everyone's facing is you're, trying to kind of throw the needle between assessing things you've seen on the ground that are that are happening now, but projecting out fiscal year 21 into a real unknown right. We don't know what the licensed business landscape will look like. Then. I think one of the only things we mentioned is that it this is. This is a small thing, but it might make more sense to just talk about the total number of licensed businesses versus the concentration of licensed businesses, because I guess when we start thinking about concentration, it might not be a stark how impacted our district is compared to other ones, because there may be some districts that have a higher concentration of licenses per resident, but clearly we just have an overwhelming volume of gross licenses, so that was something we talked about. That might be an important change, but I know I don't know. I think I think what you put forward makes a lot of sense. Are you able to share that with the committee yeah? I was just gonna. I have it ready to share yeah hold on one. Second, I'm just waiting to give you a chance to speak. I'm gonna share it on the screen for everyone. I think. What's difficult is even in july 2021. We might not be seeing the full effects of what's happening now and that itself is difficult, so something that we just talked about while drafting the land use and this hasn't been finalized. Yet so this is just an idea is to say something like like. We will be closely watching these conditions over the next fiscal year, we're closely monitoring these developments over the next fiscal year. So you can kind of state your concerns, but we're not able at this time right to like assert definitively that this is. This is the impact that will happen, but you just you know you can just have a line that says this is what we're going to be watching and then it almost serves as a reminder for next year's district needs statement on those metrics or markers or whatever issues you had to say. Okay, do we need to ask for a more specific intervention now that we've had a year to digest the changes to the landscape of you know, liquor, license and well all sorts of licensed businesses, that's kind of a safe way. I think to phrase it because there's so much unknown but again, like I said, I think what you came up with once you make that change to the to the num gross number of licenses versus concentrations is quite strong, so that might be maybe well. Maybe the committee should just look at and you know I mean what we can we can discuss if there needs to be changes, but I think on the office end, we felt pretty good with that. Jim I do have a question and that is there are some a couple of suggestions, further down or recommendations that have been there for, like that. We have suggested over time because it's kind of a static committee in terms of what the yeah the needs are for the city they're right here, they're the two bullet points, strict adherence and use of existing tools, and I wonder about the existence. The continued existence and relevance of six and sixty legislation and its use like it was enacted in 2010 it wasn't, it wasn't used really, maybe sparingly. We had a call for using it. I don't know whether or not it should. We continue to request something like that, or should we be maybe just talk about using tools to address quality of life complaints and also have perhaps having agencies work more efficiently together to address them in a more efficient way. I think so. That's a good point, something that I've been recommending, and this has kind of been a learning process for me over the last two or three statements is to try to simplify things by reframing them around the need without getting into too much of the specifics of policy. So, in this case, if it feels like those two, those two bullet points were pretty narrowly calling for enforcement of particular legislation, and if it's feeling irrelevant at this point, you may want to remove it and re that based around like that, the need is some sort of interagency or legislation, legislative action that effectively addresses violation of stipulations or saturation of licenses in certain areas. You know what I mean like you can fill it down to what the underlying need is and get rid of the superfluous discussion about particular legislation and what you could also do. You know that we've recommended to other committees if it feels like something's, not working, you may want to just like identify the need and then at a later date. Maybe you want to think about like a separate resolution that calls for something specific to change for an existing law. That's not working! You know. Maybe the district news statement is in the place for that. So I think that's a good idea if you can distill those below points down to just the need, rather than the the like mechanism through which that need gets addressed because you could always. You could always deal with that at a later date through a resolution. Does everybody agree that we maybe should make those needs more general than they are right now, although essentially saying the same thing, many members, does anybody want to be heard with respect to that? No, I agree. We've been, you know, I think we've had these in, for I don't know how many of the past years and it's fine. I just like you, said about the six and sixty. I don't know that that's really ever been used very much and it's maybe pointless to kind of add it in there. If it's not going to be, you know effective mm-hmm, and I do anybody else. I do agree as well that I think we should you know, maybe just focus on actual enforcement between. You know the different agencies that are involved. I know that's mentioned elsewhere in here, but I think that seems to be our main issue any. Is there anybody else clint? I don't think I see that anyone has their hands up. One thing that just to be just procedural that I forgot to do in some other committee. If, because we're doing this over the course of several months, which is a little bit unusual in the past, if there is something proposed, like revise that language, be sure to just note it in the minutes, because we forgot to note it in minutes for some other committees and then, of course, when a month went by forgot to make the changes, so I'm just flagging that to make a note in the minute, so no one forgets. Okay, thank you, jim all, right so I'll. I will I'll try myself to add in language about closely watching the conditions. Jim. Are we putting that at the beginning of the needs statement where we put like the general paragraph about the yeah, the district? You know it's up to you really. That has been. Let's see, I've seen almost every committees. At this point, I think everyone has almost either started with that or had it be kind of like the second paragraph, or maybe they started with general intro and then the second paragraph they said and like here are some specific kind of emergency issues that have come up over the last three unprecedented months, so maybe having it come after that. Intro initial paragraph makes the most sense, but that's been what other committees have been doing all right, so I'll do that and I'll reframe the needs and also the recommendations and I'll send it back out to everybody, okay before august meeting, which is when we have to vote on it. Okay, what one more thing this procedurally unusual from the past is, I think, we'll try to finalize it in august, but technically that'll be when the committee stops working on it, but we're gonna actually vote on the district lead statement as a full board at on the same time as the budget is in october, which is unusual, so just you could have in the back of your head. If anything comes up in those interview you know in september or october, because things are changing so rapidly, you do have that little. You know safety valve there to add something if something just out of the blue comes up that you that you missed okay. Thank you. I think that's it jim! Thank you. Okay! We're going to move on to the applications now, starting with number three, which is yes, which is 95 avenue a aka, 445 east 6th street. All right, I'm going to summarize the application in history and I'm going to give you an opportunity to talk. Ravi okay sounds good, so this is a alteration: application, changing the method of operation of a two-story venue separated into two separate businesses and combining them into one business, presumably to mirror the existing small business at 445 east 5th street. But I think the applicant will speak to this more. We heard this application originally in 2010 and approved it as cn flagos and last heard it november of 2018 when we approved an alteration to change the second floor from a cuban restaurant to a vegan, texas, barbecue, restaurant and whiskey bar with the following stipulations, operate a full-service, vegan, polynesian restaurant on the ground floor, which is what existed there at the time at a vegas, vegan, texas, barbecue restaurant on the second floor, serving pooch within one hour, closing on both floors operating the storefront at 4, 45 86th street at the bidders bar have hours of 5 pm to 2 am all days have a sidewalk cafe, and this is a little bit incorrect because it says with hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m. All day. Obviously, it's hours for five pm and we said open at 11 a.m, but those were the existing sidewalk cafe hours. When we heard this alteration close, the facade at 10 pm play recorded background music not apply for an alteration without first coming before us, not host pub crawls or party buses not have unlimited drink specials not have happy hours, not have weight lines outside and also have someone responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the this application says. The cfo on the first floor is 50. People on the second floor is 70.. There's 38 tables and 108 seats inside they're, not broken down 10 tables and 20 seats outside with seven tables and 14 seats on each sixth street. According to the diagram that was submitted, three bars of unspecified size with a total of 22 seats hours are 5 pm to 2 am all day kitchen opened within one hour of closing. It said: vegan, spanish tapas, it didn't the applicant didn't provide a menu. There was no answer about the facade, no tvs recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or covers no security. Existing sound proofing, no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines. Staff outside the original license was issued april 23 of 2010, and there is some history in 2012 from fla report history in 2012, with the conditional no contact contest play december 5th of 2012 for pre-mixing and unauthorized trade name on july, 2nd of 2012., okay ravi. This is your opportunity to clarify anything or make a presentation. Sorry say that again, this is your opportunity to clarify anything that I summarized. I summarized what documents I had or your opportunity to make a presentation about your application. I mean basically we're just we're just preparing for what I expect to be a really terrible economy for who knows how long right now we operate the three businesses in one. In order to do so, it requires two chefs three managers, two beverage directors, a bar manager like it, the payroll is it's astronomical. It's very high, and I just don't think that in the future, for god knows how long it's going to be possible to sustain that, so my team and I sat down and decided- we just want to operate one business in all this, because then we don't need all that staff in order to make that operate. So we decided to go with the moya market, so we'll be adding a full dinner menu of spanish tapas which we're still working on and yeah. Basically, that's it. It's not going to operate much differently than it does now. It's just going to be. It also allows a lot more space for distance between people, the upstairs we actually want to break it into separate rooms, divided by whether it's curtains or walls, so that, if you have a group of four here you can you can everybody can have private rooms or separate rooms and social distance in a very safe manner. So two clarifications before I see: if there's anybody who wants to speak to this in the audience, the virtual audience or ask questions, is 445 e6 street still going to be a separate little first. I've never been in it, so I don't know if it's attached, because I couldn't get from the plan, so is it just going to operate as one continuous space, but there's going to be like still a separate bar and a separate entrance at that location? Yes, correct, they're, all they're all connected, there's one kitchen in the middle that services all three spaces. It's all connected, so there's a bar on each floor and a bar at 445 e6 street. Those are the three bars yes and the entrance is still going to be on avenue a and then you can either go directly into the ground floor or up to the second floor, yeah there'll be one entrance on avenue a that will go into what is now the tiki bar or you can go upstairs through the same entrance. You can't the only way to get into the small space would be through the kitchen so that room will still operate with its own entrance, we're going to start teaching classes and cocktail classes and things out of that room. It'll be it'll only be used on occasion for special events. Things like that. It won't operate the way it does now. As a bar. That's open seven days a week. Okay, all right, clint! Are there any people who want to speak to this or ask any questions? No one signed up in the chat. I don't see anyone with their hands raised. Is there anyone that would like to speak to this item? I am still getting a sense of how the two places in two separate places is still gonna he's trying to explain to me, but I can't visualize what it looks like. There are two buildings there's separate addresses, but they are connected. There's a there's, a kitchen at 95 avenue, a with exits into 445 e6 street, as well as into the bar at 95 avenue, a there's, also a staircase that goes from 95 avenue, 8 into 445 east 6th street. So it it's two buildings, they're owned by the same person, he's connected them completely, so it although they're two addresses inside the space. It's like just one space with three rooms. Does that make sense? Can you also just speak to what the facade is like on the ground floor and on the facade? So that is not going to change. Does it open? I can't remember what it's like. There's no opening windows. We have. We went to the landmarks commission and did exactly what they approved us, which was no open windows yeah. So there's nothing! Okay! Thank you! Any other committee members or hermann. Do you have any additional questions? No, okay! Okay, do you want? Should we go to the making of a resolution then sure right, working from the draft that clint provided us? We should make a resolution to deny unless resolution, which would start out with awareness stating what the application is and aware of clause detailing the elements of the application, the history of the location or approval or denial history when the license was first issued, which was april 23 of 2010 here. I think we would also say that, given that this has been a long-standing business that hasn't had complaints or any recent summons or fla history, I don't think it has a common system history. Well, I don't know, I can only say that has no recent complaints or sla history that we would approve the alteration or deny it unless they would agree to the following stipulations and then I would propose almost the same stipulations as existed before so now it would be operate as a full-service vegan spanish tapas restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food to within one hour of closing on both floor, and I would put the I'm gonna have to put this as a separate ellen unless you can fit it in at the bottom. I may have already done it, which is that it will operate as a full service restaurant on both floors, because our form doesn't really permit it to be typed into the top where we kind of identify. If it's operating as a restaurant number. Eighteen, I will operate a few service restaurant on both floors. Is it fair to say, robbie the storefront at 445 east 6th street? It's still going to be a bar or you're saying it's just going to be used for. Is it going to be used contiguous with everything else, or it's going to be used just for classes and other it'll be used as an event space and for teaching classes, maybe on the weekends? If we have the draw we'll open it up, but I just don't expect that, but I don't want to put it sorry, but it's still operating as a bitters bar. In essence, it's not going to be a place where you go, because it's just a narrow bar a place where you go and you have like a dining experience. You might have going into the other floors. All three rooms will be essentially operated as the same business. Okay, but with that little back room we want to use for private events for teaching classes, and maybe, if we get run over on the weekends, if we're busy enough we'll use it on them for those nights. But we will still keep the liquor license on that bar okay, then I'll just put both floors at both addresses as a full-service, restaurant and bidder's bar okay, that the hours will be 5 pm to 2 am all day that the sidewalk cafe hours will be 5 p.m, to 10 p.m. All day, can we can we make that 11 on the weekends? Do you want us to change the hours then to 5 pm to 2 a.m? Mondays through fridays and 11 a.m, to 2 a.m, saturdays and sundays, yeah, and I'm specifically, referring to the outdoor cafe you're going to operate. The outdoor cafe separate from the rest of the restaurant, no it'll be part of it, but you said 5 p.m to 10 p.m. Yeah! That's what I was saying should I then change the indoor hours of operation. We had this discussion when we talked about the polynesian yeah trying to do the brunch thing, listen! Well, I'm going to try to do brunch again if it works great. It just has never worked for me in the past, so you might as well put the hours there for earlier for 11.. So the hours of operation we'll put 5 pm to 2 am these: are the hours of operation inside 5 pm to 2 am monday through friday, correct 11 a.m to 2 a.m? Saturday and sunday, correct is 5 pm to 10 pm monday through friday. 11 am to 10 pm saturday and sunday for the summer cafe. So what I'm asking is on fridays and saturdays? Can we keep the outside open until 11 p.m? Instead of 10.? Oh, I see what shit does that make sense? There are no clothes. I don't know this is. Let me go through the rest of. Let me go through the rest of the resolution. Then we'll go back to that, because this is a little bit. This is something we have to consider because we have been trending in earlier hours outside. Okay, just have to have a discussion about I'm sorry what'd. You say there are no tenants above us zero tenants, I'm the only tenant in the entire building. So as far as noise emanating upwards from the outdoor cafe, yes, it could go across the street, but upwards we're the only tenant in the building. If that makes a difference, I don't know that it does necessarily on that corner of avenue a. But I think that's something we'll discuss okay of the committee members. So it's a closed facade with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait live staff outside and then we'll go to the discussion of whether or not we should keep the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe the closing hours the same or extend them in any way, and what the applicant is asking for is to extend them to 11, saturdays fridays and saturdays. Is that right, correct? Okay? Does anybody find it be heard with respect to that from the committee? Has the guidance changed for sidewalk cafes? The guidelines for sidewalk cafes are later. We just have been trending toward asking that they close at 10 in certain areas. Those areas include like avenue a where we've had significant like crowds at night, and it's not necessarily the disturbance to upstairs neighbors, although that's certainly one factor, but it's the more people on the sidewalk and the general noise outside that has had us trending to earlier hours. How big was that sidewalk? Cafe? Did you list that in history hold on a second and I'm just going to minimize my screen and see if I can bring it up, bring up the minutes? What he wrote was 10 tables and 20 seats with seven tables and 14 seats on 6th street on east 6th street, and then I'm just going to look and see what the what we approved, I believe yeah. Are they they're seven two tops and they're right along the facade, yeah they're right along the building on sixth street and then there's six seats on avenue a and 14 on, sixth doesn't ride with me. Okay, I think we should stay consistent because I'm sure other people is going to come and ask for that extra hour, which we have diligently withhold all the time that we have been issuing. Sidewalk cafe, recommendations. So if what he said, which is 10 tables 26, but I don't think we broke it down, I know that we did discuss how they would be set up and the tables on east sixth street. So it seems consistent with what the discussion was. Okay, anybody else want to be heard with respect to this, so it's just jesse, I think, did we hear from you? No, I was just saying like: does this warrant a special yeah? I agree it's nice to be consistent with the 10, but do these times warrant a exception to our consistency in going later- and I mean- and I mean that is a legitimate question for us to consider- I don't I don't know, that's why we should discuss it. So I mean we already see what's happening with people outside and these times are accommodating the businesses to an extent right. The sidewalk cafe how it exists is not really going to necessarily impact businesses, because as long as there's an accommodation there's going to be something more than the cafe, so we could think of it that way, or we could think of it as it's like a small accommodation that maybe we should make. But then we have to consider what herman said, which is then we do we make it for everybody and what's going to happen, then, can I comment on that? Can we do that? Can't we do it? Let us finish: our discussion. Go ahead. Can't, and I get this slippery slope argument, but could I mean don't we always do case-by-case basis for most of these things, and or does this open in your experience? Does this open the floodgates or are we saying, like case by case on this case he has a he has experience with no complaints, it's on an avenue that you know that isn't on issues, no one above that's why we made this exception. I don't I don't know because DCA doesn't really hear case by case they just hear you know what we approve and what we don't approve. It's not like evaluating an externally application, even though we're doing it that way go ahead. Ravi yeah, you guys are you guys, are always pretty clear about. You know someone trying to get a liquor license or trying to tell them to start with beer and wine. They come back after you know in a year or two. If they have no complaints, then you upgrade them. I've been I've, been in this space for 10 years, with almost no complaint history, I feel like it might warrant an exception to the rule, because it's been 10 years with no complaints, mind you. I have eight other businesses in the neighborhood with zero complaints as well, and I you guys do what you like, but I feel like it might. It should warrant an exception now and forget the whole covert thing. I feel like just the fact that I run these operations with very little to zero complaint and for many years, 15 years now, 16 years in this neighborhood clint. I know you have feelings on sidewalk cafes. No, I do, but I am I'm leaning towards saying you know. I understand the point of being consistent, but I'm leaning toward saying it's an hour and fridays and saturdays. He does have a point that he does have other businesses and he hasn't been a problem. We last approved it in 2016.. I don't know what happened between the approval in 2011 and 2016.. Sorry, I said we approved a sidewalk cafe last in 2016., so we initially approved one in 2011. yeah. I don't know whether or not that happened. We approved it again in 2016. yeah. You want me to explain that sure. Oh well, at one point in time we turned it into a bar that did not require outdoor seating, so I gave it up and then that bar didn't work out very well. So then again we that's when we turned it into mother pearl. The tiki bar which outdoor seating was a good addition to a tiki bar and polynesian restaurant. Okay, thank you, okay, so we have to just decide what we're going to do. Committee I mean I I'm with. I think, I'm with clint that this can I'm okay with this being an exception, and you know a decade of the being in business there with little complaints going to 11.. I still hold fast to my way of thinking, because the moment we start dickering around the edges, it's going to be an avalanche and I don't think we should do that at all. I mean people who sit on this committee wants to decor everything. Sooner or later I would like somebody to come and not fly and we're somebody's going to say yeah, but you're, not ceo, fragrance and you're, going to want to know why and we're going to have to explain that the, but that's my feeling, so that's how I will vote where, as the time comes, the other thing is. I think that this might have to be something that's brought to DCA because, generally, what happens is we amend we amend? We have a resolution with respect to the sidewalk cafe that we send to DCA, and then our sla stipulations are amended administratively to conform with the DCA resolution right so that they don't require another hearing, but that whatever stipulation we have is amended to conform with what we have with DCA. So I think it might be something that has to be amended with cca before being amended with the fla. Okay, I think you're. Actually, I think you might be right on that, and then I think, if we do that, if we decide that we're gonna do that, then we wouldn't need to rehear it as part of the sla application or as an alteration. Okay, I'll check with my attorney, I'm not sure how this all this process works. Okay, sure, okay, let us know so we'll leave it, as is for now, and we'll just put that we have this as part of the discussion. The only other thing I want to just mention in your application. Robby you had that your food service was going to end at 1 am even though your hours were until 2 a.m. I mean our standard. Is open and serving food all hours it's one hour, alexander just said it was until one hour prior to closing. I was going to leave what we had agreed to before, but clint is right that we've amended sort of what the standard is that, as the fla has amended it and generally we ask people to serve food all hours which takes into account that you're going to be shutting down your kitchen, so that doesn't know that yeah sorry, I was just going to clarify. It doesn't mean if someone walks in it, you know 10 till 2. You have to necessarily cook them before me and serve them, but the wording the sla has been using more has been open and serving food all hours, but I don't that's just basically. Practically speaking is the same as within one hour of clothing. Yeah! Okay, are you? Are you okay with that amendment and I'll just add it in yeah? Okay, thanks robbie! Okay, so does anybody want to add any other amendments or suggest any other changes? Otherwise we could vote on this alex. I just have a clarification for alan versade or not. I'm sorry, what did you say? Is there a fixed quote? It's a fixed facade, it's the second second paragraph. In that section, the one to the right is everybody prepared to vote all in favor, okay, hi! Thank you. There's no oppose or abstain. Everybody said I we're going to move to number four, which is also an alteration application of robbie's, which is for 111 east 7th street, and it's also to change the type of restaurant. It is when I looked at the application. It also seemed to be changing the hours of operation and having happy hours, no, the it should be the same, I'm gonna go through it and then I'll give you an opportunity to speak to it. So we approve this. Originally, this location in January of 2007 with stipulations to operate a fondue restaurant. No, it's closing 2 a.m all day, and then we approved it in different lights. It's a different space. It was never a fondue, it's not 111! I'm sorry! I have two, but this one I have. I have two spaces at 111. One used to be a fondue restaurant. The one we're talking about is it very it's next door, it's the one that was approved in may of 2017., yes, 17 correct. So when I try to look up and I'll get to that, just let me go through my history that I have and then I will get to that and I'll ask you to clarify so also at this address we approved a beer wine license in may of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full service, vegan restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 a.m, monday through friday, 3 p.m, to 2 a.m. Saturday and sunday, not using outdoor space, closing its facade at 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming to us not seeking an upgrade, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, having happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight loss and having staff outside, and the alteration proposal is to change from a vegan indian to a vegan, mexican or vegan filipino restaurant. The cfo is for 74 with 14 tables 44 seats, a 17 foot bar with 12 stools. The hours that I wrote from the application were 5 pm to 12 a.m. All day kitchen open all hours. No menu is provided. There's no answer about the facade, and I don't know if I'm thinking about the right storefront, but I thought that it had open windows, no tvs, recorded background music, no promoted events, schedule performances or covers no security, existing sound proof, proving no punk calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait line staff outside, and this said that a license was issued. The sla said that a license or no debt a license was issued october 3rd of 2017 on the lamp map. So I just want to, I think, understand which location it is and when the license was actually issued and what the license is for, because it also seems to be unclear about whether it's a wine beer license or a gear license. Okay, so which space? Do you want to know about? There's two: you spoke about two spaces. I want to know the one that you're applying for so this is stored. East we were first approved in was it 2017 18., either the end of 17 or 18 as the vegan japanese, with a midnight beer and wine license okay, 5 pm to midnight 7 days a week, our we opened that place our chef passed away, and then I came back to you guys and said I want to turn it into an indian restaurant. You approve that our chef now recently it's called night music, our chef decided to leave new york and not come back, so we were for the last month, or so it's all very new in the last couple months we're trying to figure out what to do, because several people are leaving new york and deciding not to come back so we're going between a filipino restaurant, because I have a filipino chef and my comp and my company is great or a mexican, because I also have this wonderful mexican chef in my company. We decided to go with filipino so for that space east. We would like to change it into vegan. Filipino restaurant 5 p.m. To midnight seven days a week offering food at all times, no outdoor seating. It does have windows that do open, we'll serve food at all opening hours in all whatever other stipulations you guys see because of where you're located- and I've probably brought this up with you before. But there is confusion on that block of 7th street as well as the block of 8th street. Above it, you can't have outdoor seating because your zone rap- I don't want to I'm not asking for outdoor seating. It's grandfathered non-compliant, so you can't extend your business to the outside, although that is suspended right now. Sorry, right, that's suspended by city order right now, yeah. I understand the zoning restrictions are suspended right now, but generally the zoning doesn't permit the outdoor sidewalk cafes and with respect to the upgrade. The reason that that's written in was written into it. The resolution in 2018- and you may have just offered it as part of your application because we include it in the questionnaire, but it's within 200 feet of a church right, so shoe churches. Okay, I missed one. Thank you, okay, so does anybody have any comments or questions about this? Because if my committee doesn't I'll go to the making a resolution for this, so did you did you clarify what the hours were 5 pm to midnight seven days? It is five to okay, that's okay! It's always been that okay. So I think what I had was the information about that for the other space yeah, the space next door we have 5 pm to 2 am correct. Okay, so then I will make a resolution. The resolution will say what the applicant is applying for what the elements of the application are, what the history of the application is for this storefront and when the license was issued, and that, given that this has been an existing business, that's only seeking to amend the type of food served that we would approve this with the essentially the same stipulations governing its method of operation and those being as follows: operate a full-service vegan filipino restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 12 am all days not using outdoor space. Having a closed facade, it has windows that open. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm thinking of the last one having a facade that closed with windows, that closed doors or windows that close at 10 p.m or whenever there's any amplified sound, but having recorded background music, no dj's live music, promoted events, schedule, performances or events with covers no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no alteration without first coming before us no upgrade without coming before us there's in the whereas clauses they should indicate within 200 feet of two churches: two houses of worship, no happy hours, no wait lines and a deaf person responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside. Is there any amendment or addition to the resolution? No okay, all in favor hi. Okay, thank you robbie, because, because we're hearing you in this format, I have to send you or whoever you want me to send the stipulations to tomorrow or the office will send you the stipulations tomorrow, we'll get another email and then you'll re you'll send them back via emails. Do you have an email address? Is it going to be you or somebody else? You guys should have one alicia l-I-s-h-a at de rossi, global! That's diaz and david e r o s. I global g l, o b, a l, DOT com, okay, three and four okay. Thank you. Thanks guys have a good night we're moving on now to number five is the applicant for number five at city orchard, 174 first avenue here I did not see anyone's sign, I'm looking just to make sure. I don't think anyone signed in the chat for that item and I was going to just make an announcement. I know there's a few people who have joined the meeting a little bit later so, if you've joined, can you please sign in the chat box with your name and affiliation or if you're here for an item or just interested but yeah at the moment? I do not see anyone that has signed in for city orchard, we'll move on to number six and we'll net. Let anybody who hasn't signed in have the opportunity to sign in and then maybe the applicant for number six will show up. I mean number five will show up applicant for number six, which is cheese, grill, 188, allen, street, yes, and I did. I did not see anyone sign in for that item either the fastest way we've made it through the list. Yet I'm not so fast. Oh frank. She just wanted to give a delayed response, so you can get your hopes up. Frank. Is your client here yeah? Can I ask you to go on to the next one? I know he's here I'll text, my guy you've also got down and out in Brooklyn yeah I'll text, the cheese girl guy. Okay, are you also here on that one? Yes, okay, so we're moving on to number eight, which is 503 east sixth street, I guess frank signed in and also somebody named joshua rickel. Is that right there you are yeah okay, so this is an application for a tavern with full menu recorded in live music, consisting of small jazz and acoustic axe, no outdoor space on the first floor in basement. This was the location that had the corporate name. Cholo noir. I don't remember what the dba was somebody could. Somebody knew just while I'm talking because there's background noise is that you joshua okay thanks. So the only licensed thing for this location. We denied in June of 2016 and in June of 2018 the sli issued the license, June 19th of 2017 and the business closed in august of 2018.. We did hear a lp license for a tavern for somebody who lived across the street and they withdrew because of our concerns in march of 2019. This is an application with a sea of 74 with 10 tables and 39 seats. A 20 foot bar with 12 stools proposed hours are 11, am to 2 am sunday through wednesday 11 a.m to 4 a.m, thursday. Through saturday, it says kitchen, open all hours serving seafood and continental food. There's no answer about the facade. It says we'll maintain existing facade, it looks fixed, but I can't I can't tell in pictures no tvs recorded background music, there's, no, no promotion as scheduled performances or covers. So then the live music I referenced was in the sla notice in the questionnaire that the applicant submitted there wasn't anything about live music, four to five private parties per month. No prob calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines. Staff outside this applicant has operated an indoor outdoor beer garden at 272 missouri street in Brooklyn, since 2014 with an op license issued november 13th of 2014., and I counted 23 ops within 500 feet of this location. We actually heard this applicant for another location on east 3rd street- I'm sorry, I'm just going to it in july and september of 2018 and we denied it was 197 to third street, which was previously no malice palace. Now this is the opportunity for the applicant to make a statement or clarify any of the information that I provided go ahead. I didn't actually say what you said about the facade, so I'm not sure how to clarify on that part. I said it says maintaining existing facade, but I don't know what the existing facade looks like. So I don't know if it opens or it sticks, josh do the windows open, they do yeah. Okay, thank you go ahead. Is there anything else you want to say about your application? Yeah I mean this is your opportunity to say we had come before you before at a different location and you'd express concern with that particular location. So we were able to find a new location that doesn't seem to have the same problems, change the concept a little bit just to make it more food orientated and after learning, some history about the building itself and the neighborhood more in general. I also live in the neighborhood now, and you know I've been here since the last time we saw each other. I live two blocks away and wanted to have somewhere close to where I'm living I've. You know since had to shut down the location in Brooklyn because of Covid-19, and so this is now my priority. Are you not opening your business in Brooklyn or reopening your business, real, quick? We just closed it. Yeah we will not be reopening okay. Is there anything else? You want to say not me, okay! Is there anybody here? Who has any questions or comments from the audience? Not the committee members. I did not and let me double check. I did not see anyone that signed in to speak for this item. I don't see any hands raised, so do committee members have any questions or comments. The only thing I mean my only thing I question is because it is toward a mid-block location. I'm I kind of questioned the 4am hours on the weekends we're in between a performance venue on the one side, which is alan cummings club and another location on the corner, and you know what we'd like to do is try and catch as many of the people you know leaving those locations as we can and just you know, being and kind of keeping with the surrounding area. I guess so maybe I can be more specific in that. You picked a location that we had certain problems with on east 3rd street and I appreciate that you tried to find another location. East 6th street has also had a history of issues, not necessarily the same issues but similar issues. There has, over time in the community board's history, been issues with the fact that there are back-to-back licensed businesses on that side of the street on e6 street. This was an additional license, business that we did not want. It's only ever had one previous licensee, because it was a long-standing gym and then cholo noir was the first and only licensee for the business. But before that we had, we have the beer wine license at 507 pineapple club at 509, which was a previously licensed location and even then we reduced. We asked them to reduce ours when they applied for the restaurant that they wanted to have a history identity which was a club and had a very bad history and was a club before it was identity. I mean I'm not counting anatomy because they were the same owners, but before anatomy it was a different club, buenos aires, which has very early closing hours but has been a long-standing restaurant and then club cummings, which has 4 a.m hours and was a long-standing and when I say, long-standing, continuously operated bar. Essentially, since the 30s, it has been a bar over time. There have been issues with the various businesses being next to each other, specifically, what used to be club coming what the prior business was then 509 and 511 all together, and the hope for us was that we wouldn't end up on a residential street even up close to the corner, with more businesses that were going to close at 4 a.m. That was the issue that we had with the person who applied for the tavern, even though it had daytime operating hours and he lived across the street. It was that he wanted to have late night hours and we didn't want to have late night hours. It was also the issue that existed for chola noir, which ultimately got a license from the sla, but we heard it multiple times and it reduced its hours somewhat, but it also had a it wanted to have like a restaurant pseudo bar bar gallery, but ultimately, restaurant bar business on this side street that we were hoping to not add to when we already had a history with issues, a history of issues with the number of businesses and the types of businesses over time. So our hope here was if we have to approve something. I think our hope here is that I mean we've denied the last thing, but and we denied the thing before it, but if we have to approve something, it would be something with more moderate hours and yeah more of a restaurant than a bar, because we already have those on this side street and pineapple club of the hours that we ultimately gave them were, or that we ultimately agreed to were 12 a.m. Sunday through wednesdays and 2 a.m, thursdays through saturdays- and they were the most recent approval in july of 2019 of that block. But it is a block because it's licensed we're anticipating licenses from 503 to 513 and that's not even taking into account the things that are opposite it, which are also licensed but are relatively benign businesses. Okay, could you say that this was licensed till four? I'm not sure what the sla approved when no, when we heard noir they changed their hours of operation I'll, let you know what they changed them to, so we heard them initially I mean they could have gone to the sla and asked for anything. So initially they asked for 2 a.m. Monday through 2 a.m, all day with just different opening hours on the weekend, then, when they came back in september. Oh I'm sorry, they came back. I forgot they came back in august. They asked for one am all days with different opening hours during the week from the weekends when they wanted to open earlier. So that's what they were asking for. Josh josh's problem is, as he's explained, you're making it very difficult for him to compete with the other two premises if he has to close earlier, but then everything would have a 4am license everywhere, frank. If that's, that was that's not what happened. This is unique because it's dropped between q4am licenses correct. No, it's a 507 when is a 12 a.m. License pineapples club, which is 509, is 12 a.m and 2 a.m. Identity, which is closed. I think at this point ago, alex buenos aires is a 12 a.m, license yeah, but then nobody has occupied that basement spring and really, I probably reverted back to residential, although I don't know if anybody's actually brought that up. So all the the only one that's operating right now with a 4am license is club coming and that's a continuously licensed location since the 1930s and generally on side streets. We don't approve 2 a.m and 4 a.m, which is another discussion. I think we had when we had the discussion about 197 east 3rd street. No malice palace was a business that had been there for some time since the 90s. So I mean committee members. Does anybody else want to be heard or make a comment with respect to the application? Or is there anything else you want to speak to other than ours, necessarily herman ellen? I can see herman, but I can't feel him so I just have to yell out for helen. It's ellen. I think his hours are a bit excessive. I mean I agree to their point. I would say you know I'm not gonna. Normally, we would push them for earlier during the week. In this case I would probably be fine because it is toward the end of the block, there's not residential between there and the avenue, which is where everyone's going to be coming and going. I guess I don't have as much of a problem with it being too. I just don't know that I'm comfortable adding another 4am license on a side street what if it was four a.m on the weekends or fridays, thursday every saturday or friday saturday. That's what he's probably gonna propose on friday saturday yeah. It's a 11 a.m to 2 a.m, sunday through wednesday 11 a.m to 4 a.m, thursday through saturday I don't know- I mean- I know I know I'm more of a night owl. So I'm I don't have a big issue with that. But herman, do you want to speak to this? I think we have to come to a consensus so that we can at least iron out the details of the resolution. I'll, let you speak and then I'll ask for a straw poll. I would. I was just thinking about it for a little while and the four a.m on a side street. It's not my cup of tea, so to speak. All right. Can I ask a question where you go to what if we did 3 a.m on friday and saturday and 2 a.m, the rest of the week? Could you live with something like that? Just as a compromise, I couldn't okay, but I connect with other committee members. I could go either way, but it looks like there'd only be two of us, so that would fail. Yes, the two of us all right, so I'll do a straw poll in favor of approving this with stipulations, which it would include amended hours of operation, which we could discuss everybody in favor of approving it with amended hours as part of the stipulation just raise your hand, yes with amended hours, okay, herman! Well, yes, I didn't see any go ahead. Yes, video made it always were not four o'clock. I don't understand. Okay, so then we'll go to the making of the resolution, and before we do that, can we can you just speak, please and I'm speaking to the applicant about why it's classified as a tavern with a full menu in a kitchen more for the historical perspective, this area, as I'm sure most everybody knows- was little germany way back in the day I have german heritage and my family passed through this neighborhood and saloon. Doesn't really you know, which is what an oyster saloon was called back then doesn't quite have a ring that people want to go to. Tavern has more of a classification that you know. People feel a little bit more comfortable with I'm sorry, so tavern versus full restaurant, which are classifications that the sla uses and then maybe we can see whether or not you're going to put the word tavern in your title. It didn't sound like you were ahead, because the sla asks are you going to be a restaurant with a full menu and a kitchen, that's open all hours and tavern is minimal food, organic candy, kitchen or less of a full service kitchen with some kind of food all hours. So I just wanted you to speak to the difference, so we understood it in the making of the recreation. Frank speaker, I was just gonna, say it's nomenclature, it's a tavern with a full menu, basically serving food during all hours of operation. So for your purposes, you're probably considered a restaurant, it's a restaurant! Certainly it certainly has a full kitchen and a full menu you're, the one who put in the notice that they're traveling. I think I apologize that might have been almost a year ago that I did that, so that notice is really old. We've. Okay, I've moved this meeting dozens of times, so I apologize for that. It's okay! I know you have in the interest of moving this along. Would you do 2 a.m? 7 days a week? Well, the resolution is going to be the same, regardless of whether or not we agree with 2am or not. So I just want to get because we've decided that we're going to do a motion to approve with amended stipulations. Okay, I just want to get through part of the making of the resolution so that I know where we're headed. So the resolution is going to state what the application is for the elements of the applications, the location since it's relevant to our discussion right, the location of the residential street, the history of the location, the number of ops, the history of the applicant, and we can include that the applicant now lives in the neighborhood since he he mentioned it. As part of the discussion, the and I'll put in a warehouse with the amendment that this is a restaurant, not a tavern, as identified the original fla notice. Now, with respect to the stipulation, it's restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food, all hours right, seafood, continental, we'll get back to hours, no outdoor space, facade closing at 10 pm and I'm sorry frank- is the questionnaire correct, because it's different from that. We didn't speak to this different from the sla notice. Is it recorded background music only josh, I'm sorry! I didn't quite hear the question I've got. Do we have background music? Only that's what I have recorded background music there. You know I would like to have some small live music. There's a small stage in the background would just be like you know, jazz axe during the weekend, though, which he they shouldn't have had to begin with, but I guess we'll speak to that may not be able to understand okay, it's not integral to the business. So if you're saying that you would rather not- I understand you know all right, so we have to address hours and music so no alteration without first coming before us, no pub crawler party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines, no staff outside no unlimited drink specials. So what what the applicant's attorney has proposed is this business being open from 11 a.m, to 2 a.m all day, as opposed to the originally proposed hours? Do you want to discuss that and going to the committee, I'm okay with those hours good, ellen and herman, I'm okay with that, though, so? Okay? So that's three of us, so then I'll add it in there's a level of the two am all days for the hours now with respect to the music. What type this is for joshua? What type were you and thinking of I know you said- live music in the back? Go ahead? Can you expand on what that would be and how it you would have it incorporated as the business it would be non-amplified. So what I would propose would be having jazz musicians on a small, elevated area in the back of the room, and it's an area that couldn't hold any more than three people. I was envisioning just having it on the weekends to just add to the ambiance of the room. So I will note that I just checked the zoning map and it's in this. It's still in the commercial overlay, so I think, if I think, to respond to frank, I think it technically would be permitted and then we would have to just decide whether or not we want to permit it. Does anybody want to speak to it or ask any questions with respect to it? So I was just looking at the application here. I wanted to look at the floor plan. So if you look on the floor plan, essentially in the back of the room on, I guess would be the top part of the floor plan. There's a small area with two tables in the one picture it looks like that's not. Is that closed off as a separate, not when it wouldn't be available or correct? Yeah. Okay, oh well! I don't know you'll have to speak to that. How long soundproofed is it? I did add in further soundproofing to the walls around it and the ceiling with the idea that I'm sorry consisting of what I the same sort of soundproofing I've used in venues in the past before where you have a floating false wall, essentially with specifically mandated you know, drywall, which is sealed. The outlets are pulled out of the wall itself, so there's no holes going through the wall. It has extra insulation in it and all the studs are isolated from the wall itself. The ceiling we added another drop ceiling and put in further insulation into the ceiling above that area. Since I'm not looking at it is there anybody residing above. There are apartments above it yeah. Is it a five-story or a six-story building it's a five-story. I personally would like to discuss that some other time, because is there anybody from the building that we have one line right now that could attest to the fact that they would not be disturbed or have been in when other business was there in the past? Well, the last the business before shouldn't have had a stage the business before it was again. So I don't know about the level of noise or the level of time that was remember. That was, I forgot, the name of the gym. It was a long standing gym been there as long as I've been in the neighborhood yeah right after that I mean not for very long. There was a karaoke bar in there for about two months. I don't know what happened to them, not approved by us. I think that it was just a stealth operation like not even heard by us all right, yeah, okay, I'm also uncomfortable with approving any kind of live music for this location. At this point, does anybody else want to speak to us at this point with what I'm thinking of what I express a while ago, I'm not urging him to come back, but I would wouldn't want him. I wouldn't want to be able to approve something that I have a large amount of doubt of what the result will be, so I wouldn't be able to vote to approve it at this time. So that's a no herman right, okay, clinton ellen! Do you want to be heard? I'm not totally opposed to you know a small three-page, three-piece acoustic live music here at this location. I do tend to kind of agree with herman that just given that it wasn't, you know, really hasn't been a space. I know he says he soundproofed it and I it sounds like he actually did a decent job, probably with it, but I would like to have some more assurances from either the people that live above or something else once he's open that it's not going to be a problem, because we we've had live music in these old buildings and it echoes or carries through spaces that are very strange in these old buildings and can bother people three floors up yeah I mean I can understand that I'm also willing to you know limit it to you know much earlier in the day. If we want to say it has to be done by you know midnight, I have no problem with that at all either or you know, but ellen and due to lack of additional information. I would prefer I mean I I'm not I'm it's I'm not comfortable supporting the live music. Okay, so I think we can only approve it at this stage and I'll finish, drafting the resolution with recorded background music, no djs, no live music, no promoted event, scheduled performances or events with cover fees. If you want to come back to us about live music, you should reach us here, the residents of the building and the adjacent buildings to discuss. You know adequate, sound proofing and how that would look and how often you would have live music where they would be located, and other people have done that now, via email and even via in-person meetings for locations. So you shouldn't feel like this time is prohibiting you from doing that. Is there an amendment or any addition to the resolution that exists now, because we addressed both the hours of operation and the music? So it's a completed resolution I'll, put awareness clause in I'll put that live, music was proposed and that we didn't feel like we could have proven at this point, given that there hadn't been any outreach to the surrounding residents about the live, music and didn't seem like it was well developed. I won't write it like that, but I will right away I've clawed to the fact that we're going to go to that at this point. Any committee members, are you prepared to vote? I am yeah, yes, all right all in favor. Yes, all right, they're no pose no abstain for five yeses we're gonna move on to alex. What do we do? We have a second. Do I need to record the second? Oh, I didn't even ask for a second today. Just at all, in favor. Is anybody checking that motion we already voted on I'll? Second, it did you second, it. Okay! Thank you, clint. I think I'm ahead of myself. So thank you, jesse sure three and four cheese girl guys in okay. I think we might move on to number nine and just go back frank. Are you the person who's going to receive the stipulations for number? Five and number? I mean number six and number eight. Yes, okay. I I'll defer to the committee, though, do you want to move back to number six or go to number nine? Don't I don't have a preference? Okay, all right! I said number. Nine, so I'm gonna go to number nine number. Nine is an application for 191 christie street we're here. Thank you. So this is an application for a tavern with minimal food recorded music, djs security, no outdoor space on the ground floor and basement of this location. The last op that we heard for this location was approved in september of 2015, with stipulations to operate a tavern serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 am sunday through tuesday 5 pm to 4 a.m. Wednesday, through saturday having a closed facade with the entrance door closed at all times, not using outdoor space, installing additional soundproofing, if necessary, consistent with the recommendations of a sound engineer, employing security all day playing recorded music and having djs and live music consisting of acoustic piano or guitar, but not having promoted events scheduled performances or covers installing a sound system consisting of distributed speakers to minimize noise and base not applying for an alteration not having happy hours. Excuse me not hosting pub calls or party buses not having weight lines and having staff outside this application has a cfo of 275 with 19 tables. 78 seats, a 24 foot bar with 15 stools. There was a diagram submitted. That said, it was a 25 foot bar is at proposed hours or 11 a.m to 4 a.m. All day a prep area serving small place all hours, a close facade, no tv's recorded in live music and dj's at entertainment levels. There is a piano, it wasn't specified, but there was a piano drawn into the diagram that was provided, no promoted event, schedule, performances or events with cover fees and then on the stipulations. At the end of the questionnaire, the applicant wrote in no nightclub, promoted nightclub style, promoted events, existing soundproofing, no pub calls or party buses happy hours to 9pm no wait lines. Staff outside I counted 14 lps and one pending op within 500 feet all right. This is your opportunity and speaking to the applicant, to make a presentation or a statement with respect to your application. Go ahead to address hi. I'm oh, go ahead! Sorry alex! Can you do my little bit? First? Then you guys? Okay, whoever wants to go first, just to address what you said about the insert about no night lifestyle promoters. The only reason I put that in is, I had a case with the sla recently where they said that someone advertising at dinner on eventbrite, like a cooking class, was the equivalent to being a promoter. So I wanted to distinguish something that they could do as an advertiser market event without it being the type of nightlife or nightclub type of promoter that would ever distribute stuff. You know by flyers on the street. Everything that you said, I think, is pretty accurate. I would just add that before it was at all, it was the experimental cocktail club and then before that it was a place called the cush lounge arthur carpati is one of the two principals of this entity that will apply for the license, he's also the co-owner of the building with the other applicant principal he has lived above this building with his family for 20 plus years. Okay, my understanding that kush, lounge and experimental cocktail club had a four a.m every day, for whatever reason or for reason, unknown to me at all. Who was there since 2015 agreed to 2 a.m on sunday, monday and tuesday before him? I don't think he had any experience. I'm sorry. I think he had no license experience so to the contrary, arthur has been licensed on a number of other licenses. I think that was part of the issue. The only issue with out was no license experience. I remember with experimental cocktail. I think it was their first location in new york, but it was also maybe different because it was a transfer of 4 a.m and I guess they had some experience elsewhere. It doesn't really matter arthur has been licensed. He does have a place in chelsea, that's been licensed for a while and is on good terms with the community there and, as I said before, he lives above the building or but he lives in the building above this bar lounge with his family. So, if anyone's concerned with it being a good neighbor, it would be him okay. Thank you. Does he want to speak sure? First, I apologize. I don't have great internet so not having the video helps hear everything you know. I've been in the neighborhood for 20 years. I I run a few businesses myself with licenses. I'm a theatrical producer and I'm you know really watching the different people having come through the space. I have a vision of just creating something magical and special, and you know it's changing times and I really want to have a place that people feel comfortable in coming to and it hasn't been that way for a number of years. Okay, you know magical and special is what the guy who opened the box, but I feel like he's been magical and special to us. Is there anybody signed up to speak to this and then I'll ask the committee members if they have any questions or comments? Yes, we did have. We did have at least one. I know michelle campo has signed up to speak and I know there was a couple other people that didn't specifically mention it, but I'm they may be willing or wanting to speak on this item as well michelle if you want to micheller's she's still here. Let's see it looks like michelle is no longer here. She was here and she had said she was here to speak on this item, but she's no longer here in the meeting. So well, we can move on maybe she'll yeah and was there was a couple other people as well, that were from like the bowery block association. I'm wondering I don't know. Gilda was one of them. I think gilda are you still here? Gilda is still in the meeting. I'm planning to speak. I just wanted to observe okay, so you don't have anything to say. Okay, so is there anyone else that wants to say anything on this item before we move on okay committee members, do you have any comments or questions? I just have a sorry. No mine is quick. I just thought it said: 9 p.m, happy hours when they would end yeah and alex. You mentioned that there was no happy. So I just it's a little discrepancy there. No, the entire business had no happy hours. This applicant is asking for 9pm happy hour. Oh prior okay, gotta go okay, cool sorry go ahead. Yes, could you maybe speak to when you to the type of music and different types of music and when you would have them to be background recorder, music, regularly, there's a dj booth in the sort of rear corner there'd probably be a background dj playing regularly. I mean, as we sort of stipulated there, wouldn't be any scheduled performances or ticketed events, and, as you also noted, the diagram has a piano for live acoustical music different times. It's not going to be a scheduled performance or ticketed event. So that's what I was going to ask about when you checked off live music. What is that entailing? Is it acoustic piano music? Were you talking about a rock band? No, it would be the acoustical live music. I was looking at the the resolution for at all hold on and we wanted to track the same language that was used for it, which was where is it because live music consisting of acoustic, piano or guitar? Sure? Yes, that's what that's what you're proposing the same type of music? Yes, what they, whatever they said, which was, I think we just read- live music consisting of live acoustic, piano or guitar, but will not have promoted events scheduled performances or any event which recovers you'll be charged, and if you tell me that it's okay, that they have on their website, something that says you know: acoustic, piano, 8 pm to 11 pm or whatever it is on their website, but that's not considered advertising by a nightlife or club promoter, we're okay with it. Well, I'm confused because you said that promotion is saying you're having some sort of dinner event, and I understand that not to be a promoter, but the fact that it was put on eventbrite that makes it a promoted event. What I was saying is I had an attorney at the sla saying that we viola this is a totally different matter: community board, five saying that a licensee violated stipulations by having a promoter promoted events by having advertisements for things on eventbrite, and they said that was the equivalent to having a promoter or promoted event. Well, that is. That is what I would consider an outside promoted event. I think I thought you said the example was a dinner, but you know so I'm saying that's different from this method of operation, but that's an example of a not promoted event to me is promoting like a special dinner or a dinner event, as opposed to other promoted events, but if you're saying all you're doing is putting on facebook or your twitter account or your instagram that you're you have piano on saturday night, then that's not a promoted event. That's the understanding that we're looking for we're not trying to have the nightclub type of promoters that sell bottles and things like that or say. There's a ticketed thing. It's on thursdays and fridays enjoy xyz at 191 christie know that's not a promoted event from our perspective. Okay, so then the sla. Let them know that too well, if only they would listen to us. That would be a different story, but don't worry we feel the same way sometimes, and sometimes that's all you can hope for from anybody. Go ahead, I'm so I was. I had two questions. One was the clarification of the type of live music and what was my other question windows fixed facade? No, I was just gonna ask I mean I know what some of the other events- and you know he mentioned- he does theatrical productions, there's not going to be any type. There's no intent of this to be any type of you know, performance space or have any kind of performances or whatsoever there right. No, okay! That's I didn't get that from the application. I just wanted to clarify that. Okay, yeah, I'm fine with this okay. Is there anybody else or do you want us to go to the making of a real solution? Okay, so it would be, whereas what the application, what the applicant is applying for, what the elements of the application are, the history of the location, what was left to prove there? The number of ops, the history of the applicant, that he lives in the building and operates the business that was mentioned and what his history was, as he stated in his in the questionnaire and then that we would approve this, given that it was a tavern with a full on premises, licenses similar or the same stipulations. That being as follows, that it would operate as a tavern with less than a full-service kitchen serving food all hours, the hours would be 11am to 4am all day. There would be no outdoor space. The facade would be closed and consistent with the last one. We would include- and this may be something we have to write at the bottom- that the entrance door would be closed closed at all times. I'm sorry! I have to have to move my cat. This is keeping me from writing that we can speak to whether or not we want to include anything about additional soundproofing which wasn't the last resolution, but employing security as needed, playing recorded music and having djs and live music with live music consisting of acoustic piano or guitar, but not having promoted event, schedule performances. Events with cover fees not applying for an alteration without first coming to before us having happy hours to 9 pm, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight loss and having staff outside the last applicant had stipulations with respect to installing additional sound proofing, if necessary and install and installing and maintaining a sound system consisting of distributed speakers to minimize noise and bass, does anybody want to be heard on whether or not we should include that or omit it? Any discussion of sound proofing or the sound system in this resolution I'll volunteer from arthur that if additional sound proofing is necessary, he'll do it. I know that with experimental cocktail club they had ben howden and they did some acoustical engineering work. I think that with at all, they were supposed to sort of revisit and upgrade it as necessary. Frankly, I don't know problems since then. I'm not aware of any complaints by anybody, but I think for everyone's sanity and arthur's maintenance of the space. There's something reasonable it'll get done all right. Does anybody want to comment on that or how am I looking over a solution? Well, so I think I think we would just go with you know, we'll install additional sound proofing if necessary or as needed, is. I guess, what he's volunteering for so okay and that's what I wrote, and so, if everybody agrees to that, then we'll add that in is that fine, that's fine! Oh no! I met the committee members, but thank you it's okay. So is there a second for the resolutions I'll? Second, all in favor? Yes, eleanor is that a yes sorry, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but I thought I heard you speaking okay. So where do I have the stipulation set? Should I send an email to ed? I mean it's my email. It would actually be sent by somebody else. So why don't you give me the email address a like apple b, boy, v, victor dhc, david henry charles legal.com, and your alexander victor? Yes, thank you sure, making sure I have the name with the right initials. Thank you, okay, thank you very much, everybody yep, so it should get. It should be sent to you sometime tomorrow have a good night. Thank you! Everybody! You too take care. Okay, moving back to number six frank: are you there yeah, okay, so moving and your client is there? Is here hey maxello? Can he sign into the chat room, because I think we only see him as a phone number? Oh, I think if it's emmick he's connecting to audio, he hasn't ever actually officially signed in to the meeting like join the meeting. Officially his video's there, we can kind of see him nice cup. Is that the couch with the funny like little waving in the corner, yeah and I see his hand but he's not paying attention to us. Can you text him on his phone, or is he using his phone? I tried texting him before. Should we do we need to do something for five and like make them up like that they're. Not here, do we need to yeah we'll do that last? I just want to get this one out of the way, but I don't know how we I'm confused, that he doesn't know that he's. Can you kick him out quinn to see if he'll try to reconnect I can. I can move him back to the waiting room. Let's see, if that does it yeah? Why don't you try that to see if he tries to reconnect okay, let's see I'll move him back in and see? If that didn't seem to do anything, no, it seems to be the same. His name is there, so maybe he can hear us now frank. You want to give him a yell, I'm trying. I think he probably hasn't said the audio is connected. Yeah he's now his audio is now connected. But excuse me hello. I just texted him. Okay, what's his last name, frank, david! Okay, all right! Well, I can go through the application. We denied an op license for this applicant in october of 2017 and then approved a wine beer license in november of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full-service cheese focused restaurant, serving food all hours having hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m. Sundays 11 a.m, to 12 a.m, monday through tuesday, thursday 11 a.m to 3 a.m, friday and saturday, not using outdoor space. Closing the facade at 11 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming before us, not having happy hours, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having mate lines and having staff outside the cfo is 74. With four tables and 36 seats, 20 seats at tables he seems to have been joined us 12 seats at a counter rail in the diagram, a six-foot bar or service counter. The same proposed hours of operation, kitchen, open, all hours, open windows, closing at 11 one tv. It also looks like there are open doors in the picture that the applicant can speak to that one: tv, recording, music, no promote event, schedule, performances or events with cover fees, no security, no sound proofing. No pub calls or party buses no happy hours, no wait lines, there's no agreement about having staff outside, although there was a statement that there would be staff overseeing what was going on outside and it's also existing stipulation. According to the applicant, the business has been open since 2016 and licensed since july of 2019. The license was issued july, 2nd 2019.. I counted 27 rp's and three sending reviews within 500 feet all right. This is your opportunity to make a statement where'd he go to make a statement about the application or a presentation about it. Go ahead. Mrt there. Yes he's here, it says connecting to audio and we can't see your picture, but we can hear you yeah, but I'm speaking to him, I don't think he hears me. No, it says connecting to audio, so I don't think he can hear us well, as you know, as you said, alex we originally wanted liquor at this location, maybe 18 months ago. Is that about right and we settle for wine and beer. The location actually needs liquor. It needs a liquor before covert and it boy doesn't need it right now. He has been a good neighbor for the years he's been there when you see the distinction between when the place opened and how long he's been there, he was the manager of the premises who took it from the prior owner. It was called maradona which sucks, which was part of the reason we didn't want to issue an op to a new place at that location. Hopefully has cleaned it up and made you like him now, although he was the manager for merritt, wasn't he maradona's manager, but yes, so go ahead. Anything else you want to say with respect to the application same operation, there'll be no changes, anything we're doing. It's primarily a cheese, focused restaurant. I have nothing more. Okay. Is there anybody who has questions or comments other than the committee members? Then we can move to the committee members. Are you communicating with him via text? Frank nope, one way, I'm just talking and no one's answering me. I don't know what he's doing. There's no one. No one has signed up to speak. No, you know there were no public members here to sign up to speak. So I've chatted him on a private chat to get involved, but I don't think he realizes how to do that. Okay, do you want him to call? Can he call in or text him and tell him that he can call on his phone and just have the audio he's not responding to my calls or texts? That's the problem. Well, he seems comfortable yeah. He was eating all right committee. Do you have any questions or comments? Were there any? There was no three on one right. There was no throw in one calls for it at all. Anybody else, ellen or herman. Well, I'd like to hear you from him, but since the problem is, I have no real question for frank. Okay so and maybe the audio will connect at this point. I know- and I don't know what you want to do since you can't speak with him frank. You just want to go ahead on your own or you want to. I don't. I don't know, try this again at a different time, because I don't know what to say with respect to the fact that we can't speak to him or hear him. The only concern here is that, even though it's a cheese focused restaurant, it's really not a food full service restaurant and it is definitely a grilled cheese restaurant that has size. And yes, it's been open since 2016.. You might want to speak to why it took until 2019 to get the beer wine license, because I think really it's a question of whether or not we want to approve another license. Do we want to approve it because he's been there for a while and do we want to approve it for this type of business? But can you answer the question about the? Why it does the sla records seem to reflect and the applicant also or you or the applicant wrote in somebody on his behalf, wrote in that he didn't get his license until july of 2019.? How did that happen? Give me two seconds because I'm trying to go through my emails to see if I have another number for him, but I'll be right back, so he just turned his video back on. So he like looked, he looked at us from him, but yes and his audio seems to be connected now. Okay, hello, can you hear us alex? That's okay, I can't figure out how to get back into the zoom alex you there. We can hear you yeah the answer to the question about why there was a delay of when he got the license. Maradona was a problem. The prior licensee had problems with the state liquor authority and it took a while for their attorney to resolve the issues at the state liquidator, so we couldn't get our license until maradona resolved theirs. So it was so bad that it took two extra years. I mean. Arguably I know that was still maradona's license, because she he opened a different business in the location and was the manager in the and your client was the manager, but even then it took those additional two years. Oh it wasn't all the issues. It wasn't something when I say if you sold two years, I mean from the time that we approved it to when you actually got the license. I understand what you're talking about, but what I'm, what I'm about to tell you is it's not like. The problems were so bad. It was that the attorney elected to try the cases with the authority rather than settle them and in the process of trying them it took longer than anyone anticipated how'd that go. They paid a fine, they got. The charges were sustained, they weren't major violations, they weren't sales to miners or things like that they were. They were garbage babies, so he actually now muted himself yeah. It was the fourth audio, but he muted himself he connected and then he muted himself does he not know how to use this. Is that the problem yeah? It looks like it, but that looks like the problem he unmuted himself. I don't know if he can hear us amick. Can you hear us? Oh yeah? I can hear you guys. Oh there we go he's having a little problem with okay hi good a good evening to be here, hey my camera. It's just not problems that maradona. I don't know if you heard, but the problems that maradona had previously with sla. They were asking why it took so long from when the community would approve the to when you actually got your license, and I explained that I think it was terry flynn was their lawyer. He tried the case with the authority and that's why we couldn't get our license till that was resolved right yeah. So I mean maybe they were found guilty of other violations, but most of their history was like really being some sort of stealth club for minors. That was that was why it was so awful, at least from the community perspective. I think cheese gorilla has definitely turned that place around we've. You know: we've opened through Covid-19, we've been very responsible everybody most of the places. Around us closed I mean, except for the bars, but food wise has been really hard. You know we we're now, you know still in the red but we're having our guys still work, we're you know we're paying the landlords. I just keep in you know the normalcy of things, so I think we're far from maradona days. Definitely, cheese. Grill is definitely far from the maradona days. Okay, so then does anybody want to speak to or be heard with, respect to whether or not to approve a full license here? No, so yeah, I don't. I don't have a huge problem with this. I guess it's. It is on allen street. It's there's, no one above it. It's just licenses except for the thing. That's on the corner at east, hampton right now yeah, he hasn't had any issues since he's been open. I mean really it's just a question that I appreciate that it's a business, that's been serving food, the entire time, but that's because it's the way it's constructed, it's pretty shallow, it's a pretty shallow distance and it can be, it has a. It still has a takeout offering didn't. It always have takeout offerings, because I mean it's grilled cheese in its side. So it's a limited menu with grilled cheese and thighs mac and cheese. I think that's our you know. Definitely our signature, the dishes. We have five different mac and cheese. I mean you know we do cook the pasta, we it's different types of grilled cheese. We cook most of the you know things that we put in, I mean besides the cheese we make a lot of the stuff I mean the prep time is, is pretty you know big. So it's we have fries onion rings, it's not a conventional full-service restaurant and I think that's what I'm struggling with, because then, essentially it's a it's proving the opening for, like it's a very like I said, a very shallow storefront that has this type of offering right and it would be really reliant just on his history. Since he's opened this particular business right as opposed to whatever association he has with the other business so and that may be sufficient, I'm just raising it for everybody. I you know thinking more the more I think about it, given its location given where it is, I think I would be okay with it. Given his given location, given his history, what we just discussed, I know it is a small space and it's it is a somewhat limited menu, but I think I could be okay with it. Anybody else, herman or ellen yeah, I'm fine or jesse. I was gonna fail. Jesse here you are they're muted, so I'm trying to encourage them to speak. I mean, I know where it is: it's just a stone throw away from where I am, and I've seen a without parade. I'm not sure what problem having a liquid license would cause would cause. However, I probably wouldn't have a problem with it at this point. Okay ellen. Do you want to comment? Do you have any questions, I'm starting with this? Okay, all right, so why don't we go to the making of a resolution, then so it'll state the what the application is, what the elements of the application is, what the history of the applicant has been at the location? How many ops there are what the history of the applicant is, which is the only unless there's something else that you want to raise now. The only state of history is a manager and operator of this location. Yes, that's correct and then it would be, whereas even that the applicant and when the license was actually issued for this location, so it would be. Whereas, given that the applicant has operated this business- and I would put that also that the business has operated since 2016 and whereas but the licenses is your july section of 2019. given that they operate, the applicant has operated this business since 2016 and it's location on a wide avenue. They should also put awareness clause about what the street is like. We would prove this with stipulations governing this method of operation. Then the stipulation should be the same as they were previously to operate. A full-service cheese focused restaurant, serving food, all hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m, sunday, 11 a.m, to 12 a.m, monday, thursday 11 a.m, to 3 a.m, friday and saturday, no outdoor space, closing the facade at 11. so ellen. I don't know if you can cross that out and add it in to the stipulation that exists. Otherwise, it has to be typed into the bottom, because it's different from the standardized one playing recorded background music, not having djs, live music, promoted event, scheduled performances or events with covers not applying for an alteration without first coming before us not having happy hours, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines and having a staff person responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside. Does anybody want to add anything or change? Anything for the? Are you referring to the hours of operation or which one I was referring to the the existing stipulation for the facade is to close it at 11, which is different from the standardized facade. So if you can x out the 10 p.m and add in 11 where the resolution where the typed out, then you can change it there, otherwise it just has to be typed into the bottom, with 11 pm. Is there a second a second okay, all in favor all right? That's all of us! No frank! You can't vote ellen. Did you vote? Okay? Thank you all right, frank, we'll! Send it to you tomorrow! Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Have a good night have a nice night. You too, you too is there a. Is there a net? Is there an applicant here for number five? No, not as far as I can say, no one else has joined. I don't see anyone else so for number five. We actually did a motion to deny last month and then they withdrew and put themselves on the agenda again. So I would just propose the same motion that we voted last month, which just outlined what the application was and that they failed to appear to have their application considered. Okay, I would say all right all in favor, okay, that's all of us and they'll probably withdraw again. Do the three audience. Members want to say anything or ask any questions. Hello. Do they go to sleep hard to tell when people have their sound off in their pictures? Yeah, I guess not! Okay! Well, then, I guess we'll do a large adjourn. Laura said. No! Thank you. Thank you. Joshua waterman said no thank you have a good night. Yep okay looks like there, so you too have a good night so motion to adjourn. Does anybody have any questions or comments before we move to adjourn? I don't think so. I'm before nine yeah, the only question I'd like to ask is in terms of sidewalk cafe and the president's sidewalk use. Is it this I mean the curb use. Is it that that's a fatal company for the future or is there a timetable at which the governor or the mayor will pull that back? I my understanding that it's just during the executive order prohibiting outdoor prohibiting indoor, dining yes, but right, but not inside all cafes. If you have a sidewalk cafe, then you could put your tables outside. You just have to minimize them to make sure that you're complying with social distancing requirements. Yeah, if you have an official sidewalk cafe, permit that's different than just people being able to extend their license to the outdoor areas and that's temporary. That is temporary, which I think at the moment didn't I it's been extended now through the end of october. I think it has, but it what they've said is during the executive order prohibiting or restricting indoor dining okay. But you know my understanding. Is it's going to be revisited? What it has to be is you can have tables along your facade and you can have tables in the parking lane, but you're not allowed to have tables on the sidewalk along the curb, which is what a lot of places are they're, putting their tables in the parking lane, they're putting side they're, putting tables on the sidewalk along the curb and then they're putting tables in front of the facade which then in most places in the east village, leaves a you know three or four foot space to walk by on the sidewalk or less. So that's where there seems to be some. I don't know if I'd say confusion, but that's where some of the issues seem to be coming is with that aspect of it, but otherwise, yes, herman they're, allowed to put it out without having a sidewalk cafe. Permit. Okay, that's it for me. That's it okay, slow motion to adjourn all in favor, all right, okay! Oh, we all did it: okay, thanks everyone good night. Thank you. Take care bye. Thank you.
