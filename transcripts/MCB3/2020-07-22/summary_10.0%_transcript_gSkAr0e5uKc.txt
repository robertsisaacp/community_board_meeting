I want to start by thanking you, jackie and the community board and land use committee, as well as the local elected officials, that for their support over the past six months and I, also want to acknowledge the five tenants of 70 mulberry for the continuing commitment and working with dcas over these past couple of months as well, I mean finally I want to touch base on the community input and recognize all those who have sent in letters emails, Some phone calls expressing their support for sending mulberry This is truly a historic site and because of everyone's involvement, this administration has put forth the resources needed to preserve its rich history Now. As you know, on july 2nd, the mayor and dcas announced the allocation of 80 million dollars to help rebuild this site and that the city would prioritize options to preserve what is salvageable from the remaining structure.
I think the community board's resolution still stands, Thank you lisa and do we have other committee members want to ask questions?
I would really feel like I would put my kind of personal support behind preservation, but I also think that to do it, you need to do it in an informed way and understand its implications and really make that part of that community outreach process that I'm that I'm very glad to see you doing and I wanted to ask that this project would be covered under a pla with b cast I didn't hear the last part of what you said: a project: labor agreement for d cast Are, you saying for any future redevelopment of the site?
I know that construction is gonna, stop at the third floor, but I think it's vitally important to reserve, preserve the and stabilize the structure that remains both for safety reasons, as well as preservation reasons At the third floor, or temporarily put something in there to ensure both site security and safety of the building So, while I can't go into the details of exactly what is going to transpire once we get to the third floor So there are no kind of safety issues or site security issues with the building So the scope of work has actually already been out to the public, so there were two qualifications: This is through mwb small purchase and the two requirements for a vendor to be eligible to present or put forth a proposal on for this project are one you have to be a certified mwbe with a small business services department for the city as well as you must be registered in passport But if you would like to see I, don't know I'm, not sure if, if you know of an actual business or nwb that meets those criteria and has not gotten that, if that is the case, please reach out to me.
Church is a landmark and developer plans to build 100, affordable units, and this is going to be their first time to provide the details of their plan to cp3 and the presenter I I spent about 10 years or 12 years on the lower east side, representing representing chelsea and also working for the community board and also had the the honor of being on the on the cb3 commit subcommittee, which it was an honor for me, but I'm here tonight representing st augustine, and thank you for letting us present.
Thank you father, nat and just to the really I think the big takeaway is that, while the church does need an infl, an influx to their resources and into their finances, they want to do that through the development of affordable housing and and so that it's not just financial resources for the congregation, but that it's an asset for the community, and that was an important part when the vestry was It was really focusing on affordable housing, development Wasn't there if the historic, very old and very beautiful church, wasn't there, then a fully efficient, affordable housing building could be built on the site pretty easily, but because we're preserving the church and then building around it.
Building to use all of the as of right floor area on the site, I believe jack has a powerpoint, so you may want to make him the co-host Thank you father nat.
Here's a church picture of the facade Our goal here was to take all the available floor area for the site and create a massing, a building that would allow us to fully utilize the number of affordable housing units that are available, while also taking advantage of errors, which is an acronym for senior housing So. The program is 130 units with about 5 000 square feet of ground floor, retail and 4 000 square feet of new community facility space that would be used by saint augustine church, and you can see the two massing studies on the left and to the right are just the typical floor plates for how the building would lay out on the various stories- We can't read it I mean these are really conceptual zoning diagrams We are, you know not really considering it's obviously not developed architecturally, but it's kind of a baby step to look at the height and the mass thing, and perhaps the interplay of masses interconnecting the use of at least two different materials to sort of break down the mass of the building and make it more empathetic with the church.
So the image on the left shows the lower extension actually separated from the church, as opposed to the current nx That's, a good second way to that image, which is error We would weave that into that program, just a little bit of above that space is a green area which is actually the roof of the commercial space that faces medicine, It's, a one-story rather a good size, commercial space with frontage on madison and the roof of that would be a garden for the residents of the building the new building and would provide breathing room Yes, of course, because it would, it would be accessible from their new space, which is we're kind of representing the blue glass transparent?
Basically, it allows adjoining buildings on a development site to utilize unused air rights over a landmark building, Let committee members to go first so I mean the obvious question: is: will that trigger euler?
Yes, so I mean that would have been helpful in the beginning of your presentation to say that even though today you're not asking regio that's, why we're reviewing this project and then it would also be helpful like to receive the details that pertain to the euler A lot of those details aren't determined yet and when we have everything ironed out, then we can present information to the community board and it will be done in advance that you have time to review it.
Undeveloped, okay, so basically the current situation would give you less square footage, and so is there any way in which, in this euler process that you get this waiver, you know because the waiver doesn't put any cap So what protects the community from future additional far the regulation like We at no point does the far for the site change, because that would actually require a separate europe action and that's not what we're pursuing the euler action.
You know I reached out to valerie's house before the meeting and also linda reach out to henry street settlement, so that the neighboring organizations are aware of the this development plan and I'm going to open up to the public.
My question is about the retail space you said: has anything been determined yet There was some mention of a preservation plan for the church other than restoring that gothic window and the wall in that area, where you're removing the one-story building So we haven't conducted a historic needs assessment report.
so I think you may have seen in the diagram the areas that were shaded in green, so there'll be two You know after we have a more developed plan, we'll have much better looking renderings and details to share, but just conceptually there's two outdoor recreation areas that are proposed There'll be a second exterior outdoor recreation space on the sixth floor of the building that would be for use by the residents and then that actually leads to some interior recreational spaces as well and just to add to because we're proposing using errors, which is the acronym for senior housing in the zoning code.
One more comment for your next presentation: I understand that you said that you're gonna have some public space amenities, but it sounded like they're gonna be restricted to either the tenants of the building or the congregates So, especially I mean beyond the henry street settlement.
I think it's mentioned when we're talking about funding the community groups that do the community based organizations that kind of provide services that protect tenants against that type of behavior in the in the first stated need build to preserve, affordable, housing, and- This is for the city budget right, the gym , Yes it's for the fiscal year, 22 budget, so shouldn't we maybe make basically an open remark about how we're disappointed about the cuts that they gave to hpd and about all the services that they cut and how this is very alarming.
