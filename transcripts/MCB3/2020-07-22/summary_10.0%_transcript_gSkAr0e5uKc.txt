I want to start by thanking you, jackie and the community board and land use committee, as well as the local elected officials, that for their support over the past six months, and I also want to acknowledge the five tenants of 70 mulberry for the continuing commitment and working with dcas over these past couple of months as well.
The second, was to actually help the vendor actually identify stakeholders in the community, such as the preservation group, such as businesses such as residents to be able to engage in this process, and the third was is to actually receive the final report from the vendor.
Thank, you lisa, and do we have other committee members want to ask questions?
The word choose the phrase push back so that we are able to open one lane on bayard street that will allow traffic or at least open up and also give space for the area businesses, so that, yes, that is the plan.
I would like to support what the community members have been saying: The community board members in terms of getting some kind of preservation assessment of this site.
I do feel like that to have a public discussion of what the community wants to do with the site.
Like I would put my kind of personal support behind preservation, but I also think that to do it, you need to do it in an informed way and understand its implications and really make that part of that community outreach process that I'm that I'm very glad to see you doing.
I think it's outside of the community envisioning process and the information that would be gained from a preservation assessment is really critical to the discussion.
While I can't go into the details of exactly what is going to transpire once we get to the third floor So there are no kind of safety issues or site security issues with the building, and I just had a other question which is in terms of the facilitator So the are the scope of work or the Or I'm, calling it the scope of work.
This is through mwb, small purchase and the two requirements for a vendor to be eligible to present or put forth a proposal on for this project are one you have to be a certified mwbe with a small business services department for the city as well as you must be registered in passport, and If you are registered in passport and you met the criteria, it already went out to you, but if you would like to see, I, don't know, I'm, not sure if, if you know of an actual business or nwb that meets those criteria and has not gotten that.
Church is a landmark and developer plans to build 100, affordable units, and this is going to be their first time to provide the details of their plan to cp3 and the presenter I I spent about 10 years or 12 years on the lower east side, representing representing chelsea and also working for the community board and also had the the honor of being on the on the cb3 commit subcommittee, which it was an honor for me, but I'm here tonight, representing st augustine, and thank you for letting us present now.
Thank, you, father nat, and just to the really While the church does need an infl, an influx to their resources and into their finances, they want to do that through the development of affordable housing and and so that it's not just financial resources for the congregation, but that it's an asset for the community, and that was an important part when the vestry was.
It's a very tightly constrained site, and so a height waiver will allow the future affordable housing building to use all of the as of right floor area on the site.
Our goal here was to take all the available floor area for the site and create a massing, a building that would allow us to fully utilize the number of affordable housing units that are available, while also taking advantage of errors, which is an acronym for senior housing.
The program is 130 units with about 5, 000 square feet of ground, floor, retail and 4 000 square feet of new community facility space that would be used by saint augustine church, and you can see the two massing studies on the left and to the right are just the typical floor plates for how the building would lay out on the various stories- We can't read: it.
The road in the shorter term, there's going to be there's an allowance for restoring the church and as part of the project, we're proposing 4 000 square feet of new community facility for the church, and that would be deeded over to them at no cost.
In order to fully utilize the available floor area for the affordable housing, it ends up being 21 stories, and what I want to understand is because you said the rule is that you cannot, you cannot add far, but you may need to just go higher up.
You know everything we've been working on in the last three months has been delayed, so once we have that needs assessment, report, it'll include items like repairing gutters, doing any masonry repair that might be needed, but overall we don't anticipate any large scope of work, be beyond restoring the window as we're proposing, simply because the church is in fairly good shape.
There been discussion about any level of community engagement around you know the retail space and also are there any additional amenities that you all might be considering for the building and Then last, but not least.
There'll, be a second exterior outdoor recreation space on the sixth floor of the building that would be for use by the residents and then that actually leads to some interior recreational spaces as well and just to add to because we're proposing using errors, which is the acronym for senior housing in the zoning.
One more comment for your next presentation: I understand that you said that you're gonna have some public space amenities, but it sounded like they're gonna be restricted to either the tenants of the building or the congregates.
So, it would be important to understand if you have amenities for the overall surrounding neighbors, who will be impacted with the additional 10 floors, right, so you're correcting to clarifying that the amenities spaces are specific for the residents and the congregation we currently are not proposing any amenity spaces that would be open to the general public It's part of you sounds, like you probably know, through the euler process.
I just want to echo what people have been saying and say that the AMI of all of community board 3 is 58 and in this area I think there may be some programs that are higher so just keeping in mind that that's twice what the full district is just really stressing and urging to try as much as possible to deep skew the rent and get the lowest levels of affordability, possible.
You would have to do that anyway, but it would be helpful for us to get an understanding before that in and also next time, when you come back to cb3, please send us your plan prior to the presentation, so I could share with them the committee members for them to read before the meeting.
I did not receive any emails from the committee members since the June meeting, so I just assume we will not be adding new items to the DNS We want to finalize it this month and also the DNS will be loaded together with the budget priority in October , You know the budget that comes when a lot of this impact will already be felt.
I think it's mentioned when we're talking about funding the community groups that do the community based organizations that kind of provide services that protect tenants against that type of behavior in the in the first stated need build to preserve, This is for the city budget, right, the gym.
A, it's a kind of an introduction for the entire community, board, And I, suppose that that's probably this year, maybe the best place to address the budget cuts because they do the work of so many different committees.
