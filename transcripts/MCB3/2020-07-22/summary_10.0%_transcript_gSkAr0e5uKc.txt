I want to start by thanking you, Jackie and the Community Board and Land Use committee, as well as the local elected officials, that for their support over the past six months, and I also want to acknowledge the five tenants of 70 mulberry for the continuing commitment and working with dcas over these past couple of months as well.
As you know, on July 2nd, the mayor and Dcas announced the allocation of 80 million dollars to help rebuild this site and that the city would prioritize options to preserve what is salvageable from the remaining structure.
The second was to actually help the vendor actually identify stakeholders in the community, such as the preservation group, such as businesses such as residents to be able to engage in this process, and the third was is to actually receive the final report from the vendor.
I would like to support what the community members have been saying: The community board members in terms of getting some kind of preservation assessment of this site.
I do feel like that to have a public discussion of what the community wants to do with the site.
Think that it Without, that you know the potential costs and benefits of preservation versus other options are going to be hard to determine so also just as a as a as a member of the community.
I would really feel like I would put my kind of personal support behind preservation, but I also think that to do it, you need to do it in an informed way and understand its implications and really make that part of that community outreach process that I'm that I'm very glad to see you doing.
While I can't go into the details of exactly what is going to transpire once we get to the third floor So there are no kind of safety issues or site security issues with the building, and I just had a other question which is in terms of the facilitator : How will the RFP be distributed and what is the field of consultants that would be considered sure?
It is going to be the development plan for 290 Henry Street, affordable housing at the Annex office in Augustine's church on Madison, Street, Side and St. Augustine church is a landmark and developer plans to build 100, affordable units, and this is going to be their first time to provide the details of their plan to Cp3 I I spent about 10 years or 12 years on the lower East side representing representing Chelsea and also working for the Community Board, and also had the the honor of being on the on the CB3 commit subcommittee, which it was an honor for me, but I'm here tonight, representing St Augustine, and thank you for letting us present now.
We're not here asking for a resolution or for any approvals, but just as we as the church is developing their plans, they wanted to keep the community board informed and part of the process of the the application's already been shown to the council.
So, two jacks, but light father, Nat. You could tell us a little bit about the state of the church, the state of the congregation, and then you know how Covid-19 has made things.
Thank, you, father Nat, and just to the really While the church does need an infl, an influx to their resources and into their finances, they want to do that through the development of affordable housing and and so that it's not just financial resources for the congregation, but that it's an asset for the community, and that was an important part when the vestry was.
If the historic, very old and very beautiful church was not there, then a fully efficient, affordable, housing building could be built on the site, pretty easily, but because we're preserving the church and then building around it.
It's a very tightly constrained site, and so a height waiver will allow the future affordable housing building to use all of the as of right floor area on the site.
In order to build the affordable, housing, we're posing this portion will be demolished, but the historic church will be preserved and restored.
Our goal here was to take all the available floor area for the site and create a massing, a building that would allow us to fully utilize the number of affordable housing units that are available, while also taking advantage of errors, which is an acronym for senior housing.
The program is 130 units with about 5,000 square feet of ground, floor, retail and 4,000 square feet of new community facility space that would be used by Saint, Augustine church, and you can see the two massing studies on the left and to the right are just the typical floor plates for how the building would lay out on the various stories- And I think this is actually a good transition point for Jack Esterson with think architects to talk a bit about the thought process that went into the massing that's being proposed and specifically, as it relates to the historic church.
It allows the church to finally stand on its own independently, and there would obviously be a restoration required at that corner with the cornice, and we do not really know what the stone is like underneath Then the undertaking really part of a preservation program for the for the church, building.
It's, a one- story, rather a good size, commercial space with frontage on Madison and the roof of that would be a garden for the residents of the building the new building and would provide breathing room, of course, to the back of the church, which is currently has the annex connected to it.
There would also be preservation in the back of the church, which would be now newly revealed- Yes, of course, because it would, it would be accessible from their new space, which is we're kind of representing.
The lens of how does it relate and work with the historic church, building, and I.
Some of my questions were asked, but I guess I'd like to understand a little bit more how the church is benefiting from this proposal.
The road in the shorter term, there's going to be there's an allowance for restoring the church And As part of the project, we're proposing 4,000 square feet of new community facility for the church, and that would be deeded over to them.
What, does the church need and what is planned in terms of preservation?
Report, it'll include items like repairing gutters, doing any masonry repair that might be needed, but overall we do not anticipate any large scope of work, be beyond restoring the window as we're proposing, simply because the church is in fairly good shape.
You know even 10 years after the building is built that the church's preservation is right, been accounted for, so So it actually would affect our ability to get a cfo or a permit for the new building.
There been discussion about any level of community engagement around you know the retail space and also are there any additional amenities that you all might be considering for the building and Then last, but not least.
Yes, so I think you may have seen in the diagram the areas that were shaded in green, so there'll be two You know after we have a more developed plan, we'll have much better looking renderings and details to share, but just conceptually there's two outdoor recreation areas that are proposed.
There'll be a second exterior outdoor recreation space on the sixth floor of the building that would be for use by the residents and then that actually leads to some interior recreational spaces as well and just to add to because we're proposing using errors, which is the acronym for senior housing in the zoning code.
One more comment for your next presentation: I understand that you said that you're going to have some public space amenities, but it sounded like they're going to be restricted to either the tenants of the building or the congregates.
So, it would be important to understand if you have amenities for the overall surrounding neighbors, who will be impacted with the additional 10 floors, right, so you're correcting to clarifying that the amenities spaces are specific for the residents and the congregation we currently are not proposing any amenity spaces that would be open to the general public It's part of you, sounds, like you probably know, through the euler process.
I did not receive any emails from the committee members since the June meeting, so I just assume we will not be adding new items to the DNS We want to finalize it this month and also the DNS will be loaded together with the budget priority in October, So we can still add it to a DNS, yep.
I think it's mentioned when we're talking about funding the community groups that do the community based organizations that kind of provide services that protect tenants against that type of behavior in the in the first stated need build to preserve, affordable, housing- This is for the city budget right, the gym.
I have to work on that sometime between now And October likely next couple of weeks, But I'm, just I'm, going to note that at least as kind of one of the ideas for the for the for the big theme of the Intro paragraph is addressing the budget cuts specifically So I want to ask committee members : Do you have any questions more questions on the DNS?
