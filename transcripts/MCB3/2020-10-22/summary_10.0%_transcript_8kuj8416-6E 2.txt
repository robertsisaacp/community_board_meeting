I. Think one of the challenges that we've had during this process sort of beyond construction and the challenge of actually building in this context is how to do things like this, and this is very new for NYCHA to have these kinds of meetings and exchanges, and so we're also trying to use the technologies as best we can to get word out and information out with the same challenges.
All over New York City And we're getting a lot of interest from the other agencies, because we've awarded every major contract, we've spent almost two billion dollars, acrosss, the five boroughs, and this investment has meant that we actually now have sites that have both passive and deployable flood protection for the season.
These projects look different at every development, so in this case the mechanical electrical plumbing equipment, the generators they're in external buildings, but you've probably seen other developments where they're on rooftops Smith houses, as it is substantially complete for phase one.
If needed, and the new play area is, you know, complete and awaiting some punchless work with Dad's knee to to open both play.
Campus plaza is a small development, but even here with just two buildings, we have some flood protection, that's passive We have some flood protection that requires logs to be deployed, And. So we worked with other departments in NYCHA emergency services, emergency management operations to come up with the strategy for how we would do that.
Alicia has a hand I just wanted to make sure that the residents in the NYCHA developments are getting proper notification and, as you just explained, joy that you've been sending out emails and flyers and and text messages to the residents.
We really strive to 72 hours before an electrical or a water, shutdown, minor, George door of the building impacted, as well as to phone calling to the residents.
What and it's something I deal with all the time explaining where strictly the recovering resilience work and some of the[ _ _] down to ours, but some of them are niches, What I try to do and what we do is if a resident feels like she has not been notified as we let our nature conduct know right, away, and I was I was on your webinar.
I think when it comes down to outages that are truly going to impact the resident right.
Well, I have a big concern because I live in baruch houses, one of the largest construction plants going on the city.
I, know that dust and dirt was a real concern for residents and we work really hard with that contractor and we still do a lot of responsive, a responsive feedback contractor whenever they are not doing the appropriate dust.
You might not be able to see right now, but you know each development was each development, had a scope of work negotiated with FEMA on a side, by- side and a building by building basis, and I say this, because the reason this two- pager has so many bullet points and all the two pages for all the sites of so many bullet points is because there were certain things that FEMA explicitly funded at particular sites due to the visible or recordable damage from the storm.
They also work in a blackout a hot summer day, but when it comes to some of the grounds, restoration and some of the improvements like community centers, they were either explicitly funded by FEMA or not as part of this program, which is not to say that there is not future funding.
Is there how nature made decisions on where community centers went in the past We are just investing in the infrastructure of the building sometime in the near future, though, I would like to be invited back to the board We do have a plan in place to which would allow us to get additional capital money and would allow us to do things, invest in community centers and stuff like that and maybe even construct them, but there's a very new deal plan which I would need about 45 minutes to explain right.
You know any measures related to Covid-19 Now, right, now, Damaris were talking about recoverancy resiliency, so the sandy work The first thing I'll say, is that It's really overwhelming as much construction as there is, and it also feels relatively unsafe, because there's so much fencing and covering, and these new you know, walls that are being put up.
And I'm very concerned not only about this moment in time, but what the future is going to look like, as I walk through the development which I try not to do alone, which you know my whole life.
Fourth point that I wanted to raise just to say is that you know I do appreciate that we get these calls to notify us about certain outages, though they're not always consistent, and so sometimes the water is getting turned off because of the construction, and I'm, not getting a call for that.
The reason I want to talk about collaboration is because we have requirements in our contract, our contractor to do certain things within the construction area, but we also work with other parts of NYCHA.
You know no hot water that was being shut off due to construction, because we were not going outside.
I'm talking about how that has exacerbated or made the situation worse, so that you know- And I, do want to say that so much construction on the development, ground.
So I have been working remotely from home, and most people who know If you're depressed and feeling trapped at home And you walk out of your building and you are surrounded by construction and blind spots and garbage and rats.
Actually I, just wanted to see if we can focus on this sandy recovery and resilience first and then, because later we have another topic, that's going to be talking about services and also and also Covid-19 response.
She brought that up, but you said that you communicate your agency communicates the resiliency issues and the construction issues to NYCHA, but it does not seem like Nige is really talking to you because with Tariq's, for example, Tariq's water outage today, Right now, can you answer why he does not have water today?
We want it fixed, so the residents do not have flooding and we want to fix the construction, and so, while there's impacts of schedules, we're working closely with the departments to keep the projects moving as fast as possible.
I do not live in NYCHA, but I am concerned about the flood plan for the entire community and I was a little concerned because I've been attending the Parks Committee meeting and the last time they presented a program on the interim flood protection.
We have designed the projects that that NYCHA is working on to protect the buildings and the campuses that were funded by the female 428 program.
First of all, NYCHA defers to New York, City, emergency management for all evacuation requirements like any other property owner in the city, so The city, the mayor's office, probably, So, whether or not a structure or infrastructure has flood protection does not in any way change the fact that if a neighborhood is an evacuation, zone, people should evacuate.
I do not know what your conditions are like when you go home, but they're, probably not the same as me, living next to a Con, Edisonison plant and also dealing with construction.
If, we decided to do a NYCHA platform, because we know that there is more more things coming down the pipeline than just the resiliency.
We also have to tackle the fact that we have governance issues and a president that may be exiting or staying in office, and we need to prepare for what that's going to look like as well.
So Tariq I'm, going to take you first And I appreciate your transparency, appreciate your authenticity and wish that more meetings, we had more people like you doing that when they're talking to residents because you've called me a little bit, but I do Wanna You know any conversation, anything that I've joined.
Coming to this meeting joining this committee, John, I appreciate your recommendation for the Community Board to host a public hearing, and I will make sure that we do that, but I also want to.
I think it's crucial that your team prep and know who you're speaking to right, because this is a committee we're a body of people that live in this community Right know our community We are a body of people that could support the work that you're doing right and 's, not our job.
It was a waste of my time because I really wanted to go to see the community members that were present And, so we're here to support that work, And, so I think, moving forward if it's berut, if it's compost, reese Smith, whoever that those meetings are open, one to the public and they're able to see each other right, because also even the comments it was hard to understand.
Tonight, but I think that Covid-19 has been rougher than sandy in a lot of ways just because it is hit NYCHA and the city in so many different ways.
We also know that NYCHA can do everything and nature needs to look to partner where we can, and that means with other city agencies with other elected officials with you know with in you, know, and many of the Tenant Association presidents include and- And, you know, like Camille, for instance, has been amazing, with food distribution at baruch, and and without that, I do not know what the residents of baruch would be doing.
We also know that people are getting hit really hard economically and we want to make sure that they take advantage of a program that we also put in place and that the Fed is one of the few things that the federal government did right.
Is, you know, is safe and working safely to you should maintain social distance as well You know at that time, too, as a resident, you have every right to say.
But my real question is: If NYCHA, let's say you know, a resident does not pay their rent because they lost their job and they are not aware of the rent hardship program or by the time they apply for the rent, hardship, program.
It's something that where we're aware of is the situation and that we would, we would love to be able to do because I think there are people who fall into that category and This is a crisis in many different ways, including economic, and if you can't pay what you do not have you know, The chronic rent delinquency, issue, right?
A lot of people are going to find themselves in this situation, whether they lost their job or just the extra income from staying home, and you know, feeding your kids when they're, usually at school- And, we'll probably have to cross that bridge when we get there, but I wanted to put it on your radar, because that's how these sort of sneak up on us, but I guess the other point is.
And, so I'm not sure if NYCHA is thinking about how to deal with this, because we do not know how much longer You know we're going to be in this situation.
I know we're technically on like a phase of reopening the city, then we're also hearing from a lot of health issues that a second wave is coming So. If that is the case, you know, how are we going to deal with some of those issues like the garbage collection?
Until we know what that happens, it will be difficult to determine what nature's final budget will look like, but as projected right now we will We. Will we run on the calendar year, so our next budget will be due by the end of the year If you want, we could do a budget.
I do not live in NYCHA, but I know a lot.
More of a question like what is during Covid-19 NYCHA, considering an emergency Just recently I had a resident Mr Royo lives in 50 Colombia on the 10th floor.
Think that case actually even came my way, which I sent I sent in, but it You know like your refrigerator or stove would be an emergency, and Okay, and can you just clearly state what is NYCHA, considering an emergency during Covid-19 as far as maintenance issues in an apartment per se might be sure, so anything that's a health or safety related.
