All right folks, good evening and welcome to the December meeting of the parks and Waterfront Resiliency Committee.
You are a member of the public, If you can use the chat feature to sign in for attendance purposes, we ask for your name and any affiliation if you are affiliated with an organization or community group, if you're not, you can just put your name and neighborhood.
Trevor Holland is that after each presentation by the city agency, there will be a time for question and answer from community board.
The members of the community board that are on the Parks committee.
Then after Community board member question and answers, we will open it up to the public for questions and comments.
As Michael has stated, We will take the questions in the order of Community Board Committee members.
I, live on Essex and Delancey, and I noticed this week that Seward Park was closing earlier than it typically has since I, don't know.
There had been any issues there to you know predicate closing the park earlier than normal and Susan told me that she asked the district services and the seventh precinct didn't have any particular complaints about the park, and there were no three-on-one calls and.
Just, you know, especially during this difficult time when so many of us are struggling to meet people in public spaces, when we don't have outdoor spaces of our own.
6 P.M is really tough for somebody who works until 6, p.m, and I really don't think closing the park early is like in the best interest of the community.
It serves I, think that you know I when I am there past 6 p.m. Usually, when I'm seeing our groups of people taking laps people playing basketball, potentially people walking their dogs.
Thank you, Kimberly Michelle, for keeping that to a minute, I appreciate that Michael Wendy and then Val. It's, two years from now, December 2022, you decide to go for a walk and head over to the East River.
This draft prioritizes health and equitable access, along with shaded benzes and a toilet, I included some cost-effective amenities suggested at recent public meetings like low-cost or no cost court access for prioritized, Les, resident, tennis, players, a water play area, barbecues, a shed for park, stewardship, etc.
We recently were at a community public meeting, and there was much good expressions concerning the tennis, courts, basketball courts and whether this was the best use of space.
One of the things that was said at the meeting was that the cause for attendance permit at East, River park.
Thank, you, Tommy, I'm, going to ask you to refer that to the Community Board office.
And we're going to monitor the heavy drug use in the homeless issues we have around the playground, sewer, park.
I'm just trying to get an idea of how you're able to close all these parks within a reasonable time if you're, So we they start at five o'clock in the evening.
You know we give people assume enough amount of time to utilize the park in the evening hours.
There's no readily available place to put them, and I'm hearing from people that some of the workers who are encountering them who are working on the MTA project are burying them in the soil, which is probably not a good idea.
You have some opinions about the closure or opening of that park, because you afford it to the community, Board or Susan.
There's supposed to be a meeting tomorrow to get some more clarity, they're saying that from the FARi division, that areas are supposed to be blocked, off, so I haven't got a I, haven't gotten a really concrete answer, or what they're going to do.
The system of keeping it clean on the green areas of plantings that are along the antecedent are actually now becoming collectors of dirt and garbage, and so I don't know if that's the responsibility of parks or if that's D.O.T, but I want to just make a note of that.
I am here with a limited team tonight, some of our parks and EDC representatives could not make it, So they were the ones that would answer some of the questions that are typically asked.
Once that process is completed, then the mass mailing will be sent to elected officials and community boards, and then the Ccl will on board early next year for project area.
Again, The mass mailings for pa2 have been sent to elected officials on the community boards and we have our Ccl many Dean on board, which I'm sure again, If you've been on the site up at Aster, Levy and then north end of Zykov, Park, you've probably seen her out there for a parallel conveyance, again.
We will, you know, do our best to communicate and advance the closures in that area.
But right now we are looking to maintain pedestrian access through Steicov Park past that solar one area and to continue connecting to the greenway to the north and again pedestrian circulation will be detoured starting in fall of 2021, when the main portion of Stuyvesant cove park takes place so for the Greenway detour.
The safety of the community of our contractors of the work area is first and foremost, and this is a this- will be an active, a very active construction site up here in project area.
I know you had asked this at the last meeting and unfortunately, parks is not with us, but.
You know, basically, We have presented on this before, but we did just want to bring it up again, because we have been receiving several questions on the environmental monitoring so for Pa1 again.
We are actively working again to bring some of the ideas that we had presented again in previous presentations to fruition now with the contractor on board and when we hope to have a better understanding or when we will have a better understanding of what his needs are on the project, and you know just to reiterate.
Let me just start by saying there is an additional community advisory group meeting which is open to everyone where they go into a little more depth about these questions, and I'm.
It says: I should go to the next community board meeting for an update on the lower East side, ecology, center.
It's not gone unnoticed with the composting community that there this parks department is attempting to close another compost yard in Queens, and it starts to look like.
It looks to us the parks, department, unbelievably, in the middle of a climate emergency, you know, I mean all this is swell, but we're doing nothing that actually pushes back against climate change.
That has been entirely successful by any measure in getting community engagement in Parks, Department staff has been slashed, This brings people volunteers into a park to help care for it, and we don't have the luxury of turning away volunteers or dissing community groups that have done their very best to make this community a better place and a resilient one, and one that's actually forward thinking and considered a pilot for other cities across the United States.
So, you know, love the presentation, but I feel it isn't answering any of the questions that I certainly have.
What about outdoors and nature parks, because you know we're going to be in mask and whatnot.
If there's any way to you, know, I mentioned it to Q2 that you know, Please don't think that you know Stuyvesant cove people just in that area, should get a notice that everyone.
You know before you answered Robin, I'm gonna, ask the question.
Yes, because we got a notification and I'm getting a bunch of notifications, so I think if they can start with that either Q&A Desiree or how she needs to sign up to get those notifications, It's not very clear on the website how to sign up, for that should be the first thing on the website saying sign up for email, blasts.
That says: like click here, So if I'm an informed community member on the community board on the parks and Waterfront, Committee and I, you know.
You know it's just really hard to plan anything for your future as a group as an organization and not have any answers for any assistance and the way forward, so especially for our composting program, which is a very important program for this for our organization and for this city, and it's very disappointing that we're not seem to get any movement there.
You still bidding out the construction work for the area for East River park, thanks sure, hi Christine.
First of all, I want to let people know at the Cag which would we had.
She repeated that several times so I think it's time that the community board put some pressure on the local elected officials who all made commitments on the composting to put some pressure on the city, because that's what she said.
Secondly, they didn't put up the slide of the temporary bike lane detour, which I find interesting because the community board six, You know all bike traffic is going to be rerouted on Houston, Street and then up first and second avenues and they for some reason, didn't show you guys that slide.
There's no direct negotiations going on with the contractor and then to your second point with the bike lane that there's no reason why we're not hiding anything that bike lane that by detour that you're referencing is on the community board, six presentation that we provided to them on Monday.
I, Don't want another lesson in the procurement process, but we just need to know where this project is.
It lends credence to the idea that this parks department, your partner, You know you're the city you're.
You heard Jamel talking about the shape of that park, So we keep getting ignored for the things that we know.
What I like to do, because we've written a number of resolutions on this side of and I, don't know how much more we can do as a community, board.
You know different things to do, but I'm not going to suggest other action, but I think that might be necessary.
We have now entered the final year of the initiative, comes with a maintenance fund of 600,000, which means that when the pitch is used, we draw down on these funds repair and maintain the fields per the request of the city agency partner or the school in which the pitch sits.
And I want to pass it up for a few minutes to talk a little bit about their programming, the stuff they've been doing in the community and their impact.
No, So through our foundation, we've been delivering free in-school after school programs for over 10 years and through this initiative, I know that there's a desperate need for safe spaces to play in creating those spaces enabling other local community based organizations to deliver their programs.
We came and presented to your community board for Ps184 Shuang Wen, there's a little issue with showing when, because there was a capital project already in process, The capital project is done and therefore we can resume our work and our goals to finish showing when this year we've got the green light, In, 2018 or 2019.
You know we want to get your support in order to move forward with this, but just to give you a description what's happening on the ground.
Look forward to working with you guys, Thank you for that and for that presentation, Just a couple of things: I, don't know.
I know we talked about going to the schools and getting information from the schools on the kids and the after-school centers.
How about the kids that play in that park from the community.
I know on the weekends that park is heavily used by the local community.
What he's saying or asking is, if there can be outreach done to the community there, you have outreach and support to the school.
Oh yeah, yes, and the programming for just local youth who might want to use it because sometimes it appears that this is only for the school children.
That's a great question: We would love to connect with the community board and any other organizations in the area that you we should work with to recruit those kids and Paul, and his organization could also lead on that.
And actually I'm glad that you raised that, because, if you've got any thoughts and ideas about what programming and for what age groups and at what times and days, we'd love to design something that is really tailored for that community.
Well, I think there's a connection right there with Troy, but if you could send all also your information to the community board.
I, missed the first minute of your presentation, but this the soccer field pitch, is going to be open to the public, all right outside of school hours, and it's going to be.
Parks department always leases out the leaks which kind of takes away from community use who do not play soccer.
That is a definitely a price department question for us, it's a gift, and we know that at least for the limited hours that the school has access to it.
So I want to change the topic a little bit, because what I'm concerned about is the loss of the track and the fact that the what you're relying on to decide that track is not usable, is the school and not the way the community is using that track.
This is a proposal to propose things that I know could conflict with other amenities in the area, But what our hope is that you can see that, based on the people on the ground, not us, We learn from the people on the ground, which is the school that uses it.
If there is letters of support, it's really hard to say no to something they want to put in our community, which it doesn't I mean it affects the space, but it gives the kids in that and that school an opportunity to have a different type of field.
If, it's just for school, If Ron are you I mean we can do a conditional type of resolution based on you getting support from the local community.
It was received well principal and, The kids wanted it and the community was in support of it.
That's, not your particular area, but it is a concern of the neighborhood that this soccer pitch is installed and that the school locks it for just private use.
I'm going to go to the two questions from our community members.
Several times a week going to East River park.
And I know it's going to be someday restored, but people have no green space and.
So I want to say that if there can be some planting that comes along with it, so shade will be important for soccer players in the future, and you know make it is make it a green space as well.
And I went to the community meetings about a green space right next to the school that has never been completed, It's, never even been started, so.
What's going to happen to my future, I'll be honest, I, don't know what's going on, but I do know that if the time that I have I want to move quickly and get the job done, that's why we did 37 fields in four years and we're going to get 15 more done to hit 50, I'm going to make sure they're all programmed, and you guys are happy with the end.
I'm, just trying to think of a better way to say that the program needs to be for local youth in the neighborhood for all children.
There's limits on budget and funding that you work with local partners, such as choice, group, to not only look at programming, but also to find ways to green that area.
They want to add I, don't know whether you said this Trevor, but I do think that the fact that this school is a 50 or so young people I think that's a really important point for us.
You know we don't want what they call permanent play to dominate that space, so they should limit it to maybe two or three hours in the mornings right, Maybe we should add something in there.
I, don't like to see parks that are completely programmed to your point Carlin, because then they can't use them, but I.
Think in districts like this, especially when 50 percent of the population is homeless, that I know growing up that I needed some program.
You, know who is in the parents association, but anyway, You I, think you've got it.
I think it really depends on what the community wants and the needs if the school has an existing after school program or there's an existing CBO that would love to utilize.
The community says, look we'd love to have after school problem there, three times a week from 2:30 to five.
