I want to thank Clint, Meltzer and Joe currents for their help in getting us situated with this technology that we're using and their help in putting together the little guide that we sent out yesterday to you all and a new, a new way of us doing business, and we don't know how long anyway, we don't know how long it's going to last We will get better at it and work out any kinks and bumps along the road.
So with that being said, I'm, going to read the first bit of public testimony that comes to us from Wendy Brower, who says with Corona bicycle usage is soaring and it will be the key to the city's recovery.
Yes, for the hi Andrew, thanks for that, report, I'm curious about what's happening or what the city is doing to follow up with parents who maybe don't have the technology to get their kids online or to even know that these meals available I, don't know, what's happening with that population of people who maybe are not clued in electronically to all the things.
I just want to go first, But I really appreciate you taking the time to meet the people and virtually and talk about so many important issues that are going on.
It's, not a good time, but it's a real situation with the revenue falling apart You know not sure what the next incomes coming out of extending the filing dates for taxes, which is important to do.
There's, a lot of help, that's needed, and if you hear about things, just get it to us and we will figure out how to make sure that someone who is our whether it's food insecurity people afraid about the rain people, commercial business, is not sure how they're going to be able to keep their employees going or how they're gonna pay.
I know the bill was made public yesterday about the federal bailout people who I mean New York is full of gig workers that apparently are not covered by any unemployment and they're desperate they're desperate.
You know, hopefully people's our my letter last week, And Brad's letter last week tried to create leadership on this around getting a moratorium going that we got 90 days.
What City dollars are available to people who need help with rainy weather, there's a rent subsidy available Now there are things called one-shot deals and people have rent arrears, they lost their job and They can and they've now got a new job.
Once we get past this, the second thing about making sure gig workers, it's something that we've been talking to the governor a lot about I know not just me, but I'm sure every city and state elected official has been saying.
Let's move on to Michelle Coopersmith's hi I, said a question if the Assembly is considering raising the 2% austerity cap in order to deal with this, and if there are any creative solutions about raising taxes on certain folks in order to try and compensate for the budget hole that you described, that I think people.
So I think there's gonna lot of people who've been talking about revenue both in both houses, Groups and I, hope that we will get it, but I'm, not optimistic it'll, be in the budget.
Think, you know things like rent you know, holding off on rents of course, makes sense in the mortgages as well, which is where I am, and a lot of people in the community are So the heating company can't have money all this that whole that whole thing, but you just mentioned not having money for our electricity We just have to come from the feds like how does that work?
We said we're going to see how many, how much federal dollars are gonna be put on the table, especially on health, care, I, think the biggest problem we have is right now in health care, And we're seeing the need for additional hospital services.
You know how do we have bonding authority to make this the financing work better for all of us and that's the question that no one has an answer to today, but we will have a need to have an answer by the end of the week.
You know, if you lean, we've all been trying to push this message out for our community I'm, just not clear it's coming through across the state, because there are lots of other districts that aren't like ours.
The board could say we want to put policy out of the budget a lot of things that board could do to help our state elected officials and then in the end, will help the city elected officials.
But I do know that the governor is pressing the feds for us to actually shift to testing I've heard him discuss that as really the next step, because we think there are a significant number of New Yorkers who have been somewhat sick but have recovered and may have had kovin 19, and that would be very important to know, but you're right at the moment, they're not doing test widespread testing unless you're.
So we've been working, but you know just like all the other electives and all of you, we've been answering hundreds of phone calls with a great staff from the top to the bottom of Manhattan, and one of the things that I focus on over the weekend was because I have contacts when we save the garment Center.
And I just want to let you know how great they are on the Lower East Side, because they're all working together for when the deliveries come in and that's incredibly fantastic, we're also.
We have brought those to the attention of the city, but there are websites where you do need to make sure that people know about them.
I'm very focused on making sure that people food- And we have gotten you I-- have to say a lot of support from the mayor's office, we're giving them a lot of support.
Think I've spoken at this board about the need for additional resources for permanent housing, for people who are facing eviction or experiencing homelessness and I.
Think that need has obviously been you know, magnified massively by the public health crisis.
There's been a lot of focus recent on this question of how people are going to deal with the fact that they can't pay their rent because they've been displaced but I, think it's an appropriate response to the public health situation to be trying to find ways to prevent people from having to live in congregate, settings and live in public places.
And I continue to advocate for to address that either through the you know, through the standard budget process or through what I expect to be very substantial amounts of emergency funding that are going to come.
The housing courts so and again, I, just must say: Our office has never going quick mentioned and Harvey we're all functioning everybody's remote, but our phones are routed to somebody who can actually answer the elected officials, including all the folks on this call, have really been coordinating closely and staying in touch and doing conference calls, in addition to being on the state why the City, Health Department calls were also coordinating with each other to make sure we're getting the best response and we've been surveying our senior centers in our educational institutions and our homeless providers and our hospitals and everybody to make sure that we are getting identifying issues they're.
So, if you had particular issues and I, know on the small business front, which was the fifth thing I wanted to mention.
You can call I would like to mention that there has been a spike in hate crimes against the asian-american community and the Attorney General Tish James has set up a specific hotline in connection with that, and we should all you know make certain that she be informed of any information in connection with that kind of absolutely outrageous and unacceptable response to this public health.
In addition to the senior hours that we've question, is to ask grocers to prevent courting, you know The last thing you want to see if you're in a market and your senior is the guy in front of you, like you know, 35 year old with you know a case of paper towels right And, but people are panicking.
There was a lot covered on housing and small business and taking care of you know the remote learning challenges that are happening in our Department of Education in our schools.
There have been a couple things going on in the council that we're trying to work on, as you know, we're a little bit limited in some of the things that we can do in terms of you, know: executive orders, especially at the at the governor's level, and even at the mayor's level.
We are trying to be really receptive in terms of what we're hearing and people's needs, You know things that we're trying to do in terms of my office.
It's is stressful, but for all of our small businesses or cultural institutions or cultural workers that are taking a very big hit, we will be negotiating a budget that will look probably a lot different than last year, but I will be making all of these organizations and all of the things that I know we need a priority.
Also out of PPE Looking, larger donations go to the office of emergency management headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, but as I'm getting smaller donations, you know I'm just trying to make sure that they are taking care of our neighbors, who aren't necessarily gonna.
People outside congregating is incredibly frustrating, and you know as I look at the hospital system and what it's going through already have facing that deficit.
I just wanted to just say that we are dealing with so much more than what everyone is aware of coming from the inside of stupids and just making sure that people are aware that they're also frontline workers working in these kitchens.
That is because the people that I have spoken to and thank you so much for your work, I-- think that you know for all of our Are, like do-e and employees who are going in and still working every single day from 7:30 to 1:30.
Thanks letting me know the issue It's one of remind people that question during this section or reserved for a community board members.
I. Guess I want to try to figure out what we can do as a community board to support using facilities like the former revention house to be able to get there's a couple hundred feds that can be done.
So all of these spaces that people have recommended I want you to know that we have sent them to the mayor and the governor everything from Rivington house to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel buildings that are there two large gymnasiums.
People are taking volunteers at some of the larger organizations that distribute meals to go like God's love, we deliver, but we can connect you to those opportunities as well that that's you know pretty much supporting our local cultural, institutions.
If you want to do that, our local businesses, if you can and just letting us know, if you have a line to resources and we'll try to or like really coordinate interagency wise, has the mayor's office in the governor's office been kind of working in tandem?
Some of that relief is going to be, but we really feel like it's our obligation to think of how we're gonna be able to send cash into people's pockets, which is what they're gonna need after this is a public health crisis and an economic crisis all rolled into one and we are drastically behind and where we need to be to kind of to stop the spread.
All right, Carly, no, we've got four more questions for you, so I'm going to ask people.
I, guess my main question is: Do you know what the hospital capacity is in New York, City, right, now?
This I am wondering if we could ask those construction workers and those unions and those luxury developers if they would offer their employees in this crisis, to help us build these sites that we need, like Rivington house Wherever.
Doctor's note I, think that was put up by do HMH because they now realize that people are not going to be able to get tested, but they could still be sick, so that could be helpful for a lot of people.
Obviously, a lot of people are not going to know that note.
And I really think everyone for kind of just bringing up things that we have maybe been working on, but we haven't been able to really relay A lot of written reports that the electeds are providing to the office will be posted on our website.
The, Manhattan borough advocate for the New York City public advocate's, office, Manhattan born and raised, and I worked with community organizer Lila maiya, who also lives in the Lower East Side and was in the Bowery mission.
Her last week, volunteering around food in the Lower East Side very touched by what's going on, and the participation in this board and I will make a commitment to make sure that at least you I'll try to do my best to get the public advocate to see.
City Councilman Rivera, who we're working closely with her office and her chief of staff talking to the hospitals checking in with them getting updates so that we can reinforce the messaging.
Major thing that the public gap gets also been publicly discussing and putting out there and pushing for is also pushing and supporting the rent moratorium, because we understand for everyday working people.
He checks in with us every single day to make sure that we're doing our job and people know about what we're doing and just yesterday, I'll also send this over.
All right, we're gonna, move to nitty of last classes, office, links, wha We can hear you go ahead way to get my camera on my computer work, a galleon on the phone You know, I'm, very touched by the enthusiasm and how this community has worked together in to pass this critical, time.
Okay, and should we assume the community boards are going to be included in that You know once we get more of a clear idea, right, now, all of the budget hearings I, think if there was any you know, clear-cut plan being articulated by the administration, we'd, be hearing a we're hearing them at the budget.
We are we're already two hours in right, but thank you all for coming out tonight and online as we are getting used to this new technical type of communication for our board.
You know still stay there for a long period of time, because they don't want us going into close proximity of people also, if there are any single mothers or single fathers that are struggling with having their children home all day.
Both title committee board three requests for immediate economic help, small businesses, whereas New York City, is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen and in over a century.
And I have already typed it, and it comes out of the recommendations that I said earlier with you that a lot of the community development organizations that deal with small businesses have said- And that is you, can read it in the chat.
Think in the public meetings She's, the chair of the committee, so it's people are going to defer to her anyway, but Olympia wanna.
So, we need I think to add one sentence towards the end of this resolution and Say you know the smallest proximal businesses, are, of course, independent contractors, et cetera, and for that community.
If, that's the case, I do feel like it doesn't really fit in this resolution that maybe we need to do something separately about independent contractors and They say that 1099s are also businesses right, but they work in a different way.
And, so I think I would want to wait until the whole bill comes out to talk about like how do we help them like different groups of people?
I. Would like as much you know, conversation to be happening about this horrible problem that people are gonna be facing in six days from now, and so.
I think what we have to be calling for also is for relief to be given to all those institutions, because, as you will believe, one and two see another one hurts, and so what we need to be doing is asking both the state and the federal government to make sure that, in whatever relief packages come to New York moving forward- You know a rent freeze, but if they lost their job, that doesn't mean they're not going to face eviction later on And equally I didn't understand, suggesting that we're not doing this right now, because we have this resolution on the table and we need to deal with this particular resolution and for the sake of time, And I think that a bunch of people did not intend on being on this zone for more than a couple of hours.
, don't know how long it's going to take, but I don't want to go too late for two agenda items and that was it okay, helping Human Services, We have a resolution for you to vote.
Think the biggest news, though, if people haven't heard, is that the Grant Street settlements, grandma cafe, unfortunately, is going to be permanently closing at the at the end of the month, which is really too bad, but in the current climate, I think they were having a tough time to begin with, but in the current climate, there's their business model Just doesn't make sense so they're, looking at potentially you know it, making it a community resource center and a single stop for people that they have will relocate there.
You, know I, think that is something that needs to go to your committee to come up with the resolution for to bring to the board For some reason the committee doesn't meet this month and I'm, not sure Let. Her tell us what the calendar is, but you know, then, and possibly the exec can work on it First of all.
