We do have two people who submitted public testimony I'm going to be reading that when we get started but I'm also copy and pasting it into the chat section right now.
I want to thank Clint, Meltzer and Joe currents for their help in getting us situated with this technology that we're using and their help in putting together the little guide that we sent out yesterday to you all and a new, a new way of us doing business, and we do not know how long anyway, we do not know how long it's going to last We will get better at it and work out any kinks and bumps along the road.
So with that being said, I'm, going to read the first bit of public testimony that comes to us from Wendy Brower, who says with Corona bicycle usage is soaring and it will be the key to the city's recovery.
You just fill me in on or fill us in on, what's happening with that population of people who maybe are not clued in electronically to all the things, The city's doing It's my understanding from Chancellor Carranza's report with the mayor that they have also been doing telephone calls with the students at all the public schools, and they can also call 3- 1- 1 to find out more information about both this and where they can pick up some technology.
I just want to go first, But I really appreciate you taking the time to meet the people and virtually and talk about so many important issues that are going on.
Last Thursday, the governor's office had Medicaid redesign team proposal that would cut 2.5 billion dollars out of healthcare budget, so the lots of cuts that are going to be really hurtful over the next months and potentially years to come, It's, not a good time, But it's a real situation with the revenue falling apart You know not sure what the next incomes coming out of extending the filing dates for taxes, which is important to do.
The, president So I think all of us are going to be working as a team, but everyone's can be a point person on different issues.
There's, a lot of help, that's needed, and if you hear about things, just get it to us and we will figure out how to make sure that someone who is our whether it's food insecurity people afraid about the rain people, commercial business, is not sure how they're going to be able to keep their employees going or how they're going to pay the rent.
I know the bill was made public yesterday about the federal bailout people who I mean New York is full of gig workers that apparently are not covered by any unemployment and they're desperate they're desperate.
Talking, a lot about at the state level to figure out how we can protect as many people as possible on the rent, side, I think?
What's good about the moratorium, You know, hopefully people's our my letter last week, And Brad's letter last week tried to create leadership on this around getting a moratorium going that we got 90 days.
What City dollars are available to people who need help with rainy weather, there's a rent subsidy available Now there are things called one, shot deals and people have rent arrears, they lost their job and They can and they've now got a new job.
A lot about I know not just me, but I'm sure every city and state elected official has been saying.
So, let's move on to Michelle Coopersmith's hi I, said a question if the Assembly is considering raising the 2% austerity cap in order to deal with this, and if there are any creative solutions about raising taxes on certain folks in order to try and compensate for the budget hole that you described that So, it's a really good, question, I think people.
Think, you know things like rent you know, holding off on rents of course, makes sense in the mortgages as well, which is where I am, and a lot of people in the community are If, landlords do not get their rent and they can't pay their bills and so on and so on and so forth, So the heating company can't have money all this that whole that whole thing, but you just mentioned not having money for our electricity We just have to come from the feds like how does that work?
You know how do we have bonding authority to make this the financing work better for all of us and that's the question that no one has an answer to today, but we will have a need to have an answer by the end of the week.
If we cut back to the city in the city, we're just telling the city that they'd be able to turn the lights on So I think this is a real crisis overall facing, and my answer is always if we can find new revenue sources and that's going to be the message.
Well, I think that they, because the availability of tests is so reduced thanks to the slow response and actually the federal government saying no to the World Health Organization's offer months.
But I do know that the governor is pressing the feds for us to actually shift to testing I've heard him discuss that as really the next step, because we think there are a significant number of New Yorkers who have been somewhat sick but have recovered and may have had Kovin 19, and that would be very important to know, but you're right at the moment, they're not doing test widespread testing unless you're.
Thank, you again, I'm wondering if you support Senator Sorry Assembly Member Yulie News bill to suspend rent payments for 90 days for residential and small business.
This is an emergency, I agree with the bill, but if it's not rolled into the budget, we're not going to be taking up individual bills, including my piet√† tare tax, which Brad hoylman and I have all right: You want to do your report, now?
So we've been working, but you know just like all the other electives and all of you, we've been answering hundreds of phone calls with a great staff from the top to the bottom of Manhattan, and one of the things that I focus on over the weekend was because I have contacts.
They have that EDC is doing the bedding And, then they're, sending those that are vetted to the Department of Health and to the OEM Office of Emergency, I think there's still a problem because departments that are working with the seniors that are now going delivery.
We have brought those to the attention of the city, but there are websites where you do need to make sure that people know about them.
We are going to hold a virtual meeting with Pratt center there, of course, the facilitators of the community advisory group for the part before the end of the month, and we are continuing to make sure that the Lower East Side, ecology, centers compost yard.
The city has postponed all you, libs I could go on and on because there are so many calls coming into our office, but I think those are the issues that I wanted to be bring to.
I know this whole county initiative thing came on for census, but since Kelowna just wanted to see what the update is with that I know some extra money trying to see the update Later I have not heard how we're going to handle April first and how people are going to handle going.
Think I've spoken at this board about the need for additional resources for permanent housing, for people who are facing eviction or experiencing homelessness and I.
Think that need has obviously been you know, magnified massively by the public health crisis.
There's been a lot of focus recent on this question of how people are going to deal with the fact that they can't pay their rent because they've been displaced but I, think it's an appropriate response to the public health situation to be trying to find ways to prevent people from having to live in congregate, settings and live in public places.
And I continue to advocate for to address that, either through the you know, through the standard budget process or through what I expect to be very substantial amounts of emergency funding that are going to come.
The housing courts And again I just must say our office has never going quick mentioned and Harvey we're all functioning everybody's remote, but our phones are routed to somebody who can actually answer the elected officials, including all the folks on this call, have really been coordinating closely and staying in touch and doing conference calls in addition to being on the state why the City, Health Department calls were also coordinating with each other to make sure we're getting the best response and we've been surveying our senior centers in our educational institutions and our homeless providers and our hospitals and everybody to make sure that we are getting identifying issues.
One of the things that we've learned is that people over 60 or who have pre- existing conditions, probably should not be going out, and food shopping, at least without taking dramatic precautions to protect themselves.
My second point is that I sent a letter to the CEOs of all the largest grocery chains in the city and urge them to Institute senior hours, which number of them have already I'm happy to say, including Whole, Foods and Kips Bay. And I, think other grocery stores are following suit.
We might see something like that in the budget we had obviously sent a letter as Bryan alluded to and got some action from the governor and the Office of Court Administration, but I've also I've, also written to the governor, seeking that he pause statutes of limitations for civil and criminal matters, because the courts are basically shut down and no claims can be filed unless there You know of the greatest urgency.
So, if you had particular issues and I, know on the small business front, which was the fifth thing I wanted to mention.
You know people talk about loans, they do not want lungs And They may That's not going to be helpful, so we really have to push federal aid and state aid that gives these struggling.
I know that my colleagues are going to be working on that with me and then finally wanted to just mention or Caroline Might just kill me that we, you know you can contact our office or the governor's office.
The hotlines, you can call I would like to mention that there has been a spike in hate crimes against the asian- american community and the Attorney General Tish James has set up a specific hotline in connection with that, and we should all you know make certain that she be informed of any information in connection with that kind of absolutely outrageous and unacceptable response to this public health, crisis.
There was a lot covered on housing and small business and taking care of you know the remote learning challenges that are happening in our Department of Education.
There have been a couple things going on in the council that we're trying to work on, as you know, we're a little bit limited in some of the things that we can do in terms of you, know: executive orders, especially at the at the governor's level, and even at the mayor's level.
We are trying to be really receptive in terms of what we're hearing and people's needs, You know things that we're trying to do in terms of my office.
You know, we've called for a ton of things for the state in the city.
It's is stressful, but for all of our small businesses or cultural institutions or cultural workers that are taking a very big hit, we will be negotiating a budget that will look probably a lot different than last year, but I will be making all of these organizations and all of the things that I know we need a priority.
You know I'm just trying to make sure that they are taking care of our neighbors, who are not necessarily going to go to the hospital I mean you should not go to the hospital You're supposed to stay home.
I just wanted to just say that we are dealing with so much more than what everyone is aware of coming from the inside of stupids and just making sure that people are aware that they're also frontline workers working in these kitchens.
That is because the people that I have spoken to and thank you so much for your work, I- think that you know for all of our are like do- E and employees who are going in and still working every single day from 7:30 to 1:30.
Thanks letting me know the issue It's one of remind people that question during this section or reserved for a community board members.
I. Guess I want to try to figure out what we can do as a community board to support using facilities like the former revention house to be able to get there's a couple hundred feds that can be done.
All of these spaces that people have recommended I want you to know that we have sent them to the mayor and the governor everything from Rivington house to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel buildings that are there two large gymnasiums, two even just open fields that we could potentially put a tent, which is what they're doing outside of many hospitals.
When someone knows someone who has a factory in China like I've, actually called people and said, how is this connection?
Maybe watching Fox News is not the best idea right now, so we're just making sure that people understand where they can go and get a meal.
People are taking volunteers at some of the larger organizations that distribute meals to go like God's love, we deliver, but we can connect you to those opportunities as well that that's you know pretty much supporting our local cultural, institutions.
If you want to do that, our local businesses, if you can and just letting us know, if you have a line to resources and we'll try to or like really coordinate interagency wise, has the mayor's office in the governor's office been kind of working in tandem?
Some of that relief is going to be, but we really feel like it's our obligation to think of how we're going to be able to send cash into people's pockets, which is what they're going to need after this Is a public health crisis and an economic crisis all rolled into one and we are drastically behind and where we need to be to kind of to stop the spread.
All right,, Carly, no, we've got four more questions for you, so I'm going to ask people.
I, guess my main question is: Do you know what the hospital capacity is in New York, City, right, now?
Second observation: is, there's a lot of luxury housing with construction workers going on all over I am wondering if we could ask those construction workers and those unions and those luxury developers if they would offer their employees in this crisis, to help us build these sites that we need, like Rivington house Wherever, we know, homeless people congregate with just basic information, because some of them are undocumented.
You want to feed your family Doctor's note, I, think that was put up by do HMH, because they now realize that people are not going to be able to get tested, but they could still be sick, so that could be helpful for a lot of people.
Obviously, a lot of people are not going to know that note.
The Manhattan borough advocate for the New York City public advocate's, office, Manhattan born and raised, and I worked with community Organizer Lila maiya, who also lives in the Lower East Side and was in the Bowery mission with her last week, volunteering around food in the Lower East Side Very, touched by what's going on, and the participation in this board and I will make a commitment to make sure that at least you I'll try to do my best to get the public advocate to see.
Major thing that the public gap gets also been publicly discussing and putting out there and pushing for is also pushing and supporting the rent moratorium, because we understand for everyday working people.
He checks in with us every single day to make sure that we're doing our job and people know about what we're doing and just yesterday, I'll also send this over.
This is just a pilot right now, with only a few centers in each borough that are opted in who have that kind of capacity who had the refrigerators to keep the food, for example, and the man's I know that Bronx as a borough started yesterday, Manhattan this today and all of the other boroughs are going to be piloted.
You know still stay there for a long period of time, because they do not want us going into close proximity of people also if there are any single mothers or single fathers that are struggling with having their children home all day.
Economic relief and immediate in the immediate, near and long- term, therefore be resolved community board for the recommends the following actions: to provide immediately for all small businesses affected by the Covid-19, crisis, suspension or forgiveness, of all funds and associated payment for a period of six months, and make sure that there is no admission of health.
Think in the public meetings She's, the chair of the committee, so it's people are going to defer to her anyway, but Olympia.
Are we defining a small business because you know let's the same, is what the Senate the Congress is going.
We can open up to businesses that have up to ten employees, but I do not think the city has the funds for it, they're going to have to find it This amendment is going to be added to this resolution.
If they are rent stabilized, if they have it and history of organizing and that landlord dislikes them So, we need I think to add one sentence towards the end of this resolution and Say you know the smallest proximal businesses, are, of course, independent contractors, et cetera, and for that community.
So I think I would want to wait until the whole bill comes out to talk about like how do we help them, like different groups of people?
You know conversation to be happening about this horrible problem that people are going to be facing in six days from now, and so.
I think what we have to be calling for also is for relief to be given to all those institutions, because, as you will believe, one and two see another one hurts, and so what we need to be doing is asking both the state and the federal government to make sure that, in whatever relief packages come to New York moving forward- It's not that there be additional resources that are there targeted specifically for things I, rent, You know a rent freeze, but if they lost their job, that does not mean they're.
Not going to face eviction later on and equally, you know if the landlord is not receiving any rent, how do they pay for operations, and so that goes not only for smaller landlords, but bigger ones like NYCHA, so I do not think we could be just calling for these things.
This is the first time for many of us using this to practice to read some manuals or our parks meeting, because it will I do not know how long it's going to take, but I do not want to go too late for two agenda items and that was it: We have a resolution for you to vote.
But in the current climate, But in the current climate, there's their business model You know it, making it a community resource center and a single stop for people that they have will relocate there.
Just following up I know, it's been a question for the community board as far as how many is they were 40 days, hires I'm, not sure if you were able to get some information on that or Not yeah, I.
I. Think, that, basically, as David was saying you know, we, the exec committee, took on some resolutions on an emergency basis at our exec meeting last week, because committees did not meet because of what was happening with people sheltering at home and not wanting to go out and all the uncertainty that was happening.
You, know I, think that is something that needs to go to your committee to come up with the resolution for to bring to the board and For some reason the committee does not meet this month and Let. Her tell us what the calendar is, but you know, then, and possibly the exec can work on it First of all.
That right, The issue is that you know somebody emails the office with an issue we're not going to schedule the meeting just for that issue.
