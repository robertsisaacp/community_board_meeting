Before we get started, I want to thank Clint, Meltzer and Joe currents for their help in getting us situated with this technology that we're using and their help in putting together the little guide that we sent out yesterday to you all and a new, a new way of us doing business, and we don't know how long anyway With that being said, I'm going to read the first bit of public testimony that comes to us from Wendy Brower, who says with Corona bicycle usage is soaring and it will be the key to the city's recovery In turn flood protection is a must, especially around nitric acids where and resilient infrastructure is already under construction.
Alright, you want to get I'm going to let you go first from the mayor's office to give you a report so go ahead I know you same goes for my fellow community board members Thank, for having me to your first virtual, full board, So I just want to recap a few things that are coming out of the mayor's office.
Clint is Olympia can explain it if you click on participants, you're going to find several icons underneath the names of the people participating, The first icon is a blue hand and it says raise hand Thanks for that report, I'm curious about what's happening or what the city is doing to follow up with parents who maybe don't have the technology to get their kids online or to even know that these meals available I , don't know what's happening with that population of people who maybe are not clued in electronically to all the things.
The controller's office got that resolved today, There's a lot of help, that's needed, and if you hear about things, just get it to us and we will figure out how to make sure that someone who is our whether it's food insecurity people afraid about the rain people, commercial business, is not sure how they're going to be able to keep their employees going or how they're gonna pay the rent and it's a half climb with family Wonderful, but just be careful and be mindful, as you do, the things you need to do to keep your life successful shelter-in-place means you're going to feel like it was all for nothing and you'd be right, but nothing means that nothing happened to your family and that's what we're going for here.
Those things are still going to be available and we're just going to need additional funding in those one-shot deals, and once we get past this, the second thing about making sure gig workers , it's something that we've been talking to the governor a lot about I know not just me, but I'm sure every city and state elected official has been saying: We need to ensure that whatever happens on the federal level, we protect Unfortunately.
I said a question if the Assembly is considering raising the 2% austerity cap in order to deal with this, and if there are any creative solutions about raising taxes on certain folks in order to try and compensate for the budget hole that you described, that I think people We know that the governor has proposed a self-imposed 2% spending cap on all new revenue, and the idea was that we're trying to be fiscally responsible, Less spending will have a lot less revenue, but I do think if we should just ignore the camp and push the governor on that on the revenue side, I have lost the bills to add new revenue and millionaires, billionaires tax, mezzanine debt, tax fraud, captivator tear tax We've, heard the line from the governor's office The page.
We have 220 of one other choices to vote, no on the budge, so I think there's gonna lot of people who've been talking about revenue both in both houses, groups and I, hope that we will get it but I'm, not optimistic it'll, be in the budget Just, because he's been saying unequivocally that he does not want to seek new revenue sources in this year's budget.
it's from Robins hotel, hi, Harvey You know, holding off on rents of course, makes sense in the mortgages as well, which is where I am and a lot of people in the community are If landlords, don't get their rent and they can't pay their bills and so on and so on and so forth, and so, if they don't pay their heating bills, so the heating company can't have money all this that whole that whole thing, but you just mentioned not having money for our electricity, and we said we're going to see how many, how much federal dollars are gonna be put on the table, especially on health care.
, so I think this is a real crisis overall facing, and my answer is always if we can find new revenue sources and that's going to be the message I will continue to forth at Albany , Deborah's been a leader, you know if you lean, we've all been trying to push this message out for our community I'm, just not clear it's coming through across the state, because there are lots of other districts that aren't like ours.
We have bled a tremendous amount of money and will continue doing so in order to provide health care to New Yorkers and within a day it'll be tens of thousands So we've the more testing we do, the more people we find and the more people who find themselves being sick So. The first thing we need to do is eliminate both federally in a state.
Those are things that should be immediately waived, but I agree that we should where we, you know, if you don't have people cooperating, I agree with the bill, but if it's not rolled into the budget, we're not going to be taking up individual bills, including my piet√† tare tax, which Brad hoylman and I have all right: You want to do your report, now?
So we've been working, but you know just like all the other electives and all of you, we've been answering hundreds of phone calls with a great staff from the top to the bottom of Manhattan, and one of the things that I focus on over the weekend was because I have contacts when we save the garment Center and we got contracts for people in the garment Center and they, the last manufacturer in Manhattan, to make facial shields.
Twelve community boards are now virtual I, don't know if that's true in all the borough's, Manhattan and I want to congratulate you and just finally, just some very local we're getting a lot of calls for I have space, because obviously the hospitals you heard earlier may be that the hospitals have to expand either fifty percent or a hundred percent So we've gotten some suggestions for Rivington house and basketball city and performance space.
We are going to hold a virtual meeting with Pratt center there, of course, the facilitators of the community advisory group for the part before the end of the month, and we are continuing to make sure that the Lower East Side, ecology, centers compost yard his return to the park As does the mayor when he was asked about it, I could go on and on because there are so many calls coming into our office, but I think those are the issues that I wanted to be bring to your attention.
I know the issue very well that public charge- and you know this time when everybody's so dependent on the government responding well and not only to provide service and resources for all, but also information, I, think Debra and Harvey gave you a pretty good sense of where we are with the biggest item at the state level, which is the budget.
I did my view, although I would just add that you know, as the housing chair I had already spent a lot of time and I Think I've spoken at this board about the need for additional resources for permanent housing for people who are facing eviction or experiencing homelessness and I.
There's been a lot of focus recent on this question of how people are going to deal with the fact that they can't pay their rent because they've been displaced , think it's an appropriate response to the public health situation to be trying to find ways to prevent people from having to live in congregate, settings and live in public places and I continue to advocate for to address that either through the you know, through the standard budget process or through what I expect to be very substantial amounts of emergency funding that are going to come.
The housing courts so and again, I just must say: Our office has never going quick mentioned and Harvey we're all functioning everybody's remote, but our phones are routed to somebody who can actually answer the elected officials, including all the folks on this call, have really been coordinating closely and staying in touch and doing conference calls in addition to being on the state why the City, Health Department calls were also coordinating with each other to make sure we're getting the best response and we've been surveying our senior centers in our educational institutions and our homeless providers and our hospitals and everybody to make sure that we are getting identifying issues they're having and making sure resources are available.
You know people talk about loans, they don't want lungs and they may That's not going to be helpful, so we really have to push federal aid and state aid that gives these struggling.
It goes out to mention that, like you know at times the delivery for chicken, for example, I've noticed, isn't there at those early hours it doesn't get set up to later The other thing, in addition to the senior hours that we've question is to ask grocers to prevent courting you know the last thing you want to see if you're in a market and your senior is the guy in front of you, like you know, 35 year old with you know a case of paper, towels right and but people are panicking So. There was a lot covered on housing and small business and taking care of you know the remote learning challenges that are happening in our Department of Education in our schools.
It's is stressful, but for all of our small businesses or cultural institutions or cultural workers that are taking a very big hit, we will be negotiating a budget that will look probably a lot different than last year, but I will be making all of these organizations and all of the things that I know.
We need a priority and I'm very worried about our low-income families and our seniors and making sure that we have our schools up and running in our senior centers up and running community-based organizations are stretched very thin and they they're worried about deliverables and their contracts First question comes from Olympia Ozzy, hi Karina, so you know a satellite of the hospital's committee You, remember that they were like they didn't want to close the public schools etc.
Also out of PPE Looking, larger donations go to the office of emergency management headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, but as I'm getting smaller donations, you know I'm just trying to make sure that they are taking care of our neighbors, who aren't necessarily gonna right , you're supposed to stay home and I think that people are not respecting that message, and that is a part that I think frustrates me and angers us the most that you know today.
It, probably will take less time to be able to mobilize that space and, from my understanding from a couple of press reports that I've read that Mount Sinai Beth Israel is amenable to using that So all of these spaces that people have recommended I want you to know that we have sent them to the mayor and the governor everything from Rivington house to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel buildings that are there two large gymnasiums, two even just open fields that we could potentially put a tent, which is what they're doing outside of many hospitals.
All of these suggestions to the mayor in the governor's office, please feel free to send them to district 2 at Council DOT NYC that govt, even if you think all they probably thought of that already It cannot hurt and as a follow-up, what can we, as a community board, do to help support trying to gather as much resource as we can to help create spaces for treatment?
People are taking volunteers at some of the larger organizations that distribute meals to go like God's love we deliver, but we can connect you to those opportunities as well that that's you know pretty much supporting our local cultural institutions If you want to do that, our local businesses, if you can and just letting us know if you have a line to resources and we'll try to or like really coordinate interagency wise, has the mayor's office in the governor's office been kind of working in tandem?
Some of that relief is going to be, but we really feel like it's our obligation to think of how we're gonna be able to send cash into people's pockets, which is what they're gonna need after this is a public health crisis and an economic crisis all rolled into one and we are drastically behind and where we need to be to kind of to stop the spread , all right, Carly, no, we've got four more questions for you, so I'm going to ask people: okay, Carlina!
Full people are looking actually for alternative sites to do drop-in centers because they don't have the capacity and some of the existing facilities and I and as I as I mentioned I was outside earlier on and I did see that the groups of homeless individuals, maybe they're under a scaffold I, just know that what I, how I contact my individuals at these agencies to let them know what our problems are, because I would just I need to tell them like what I need and what to do, and sometimes we just have to go above the mayor's head and go straight to the governor's office, because they're not being the most responsive, hey I, guess my main question is: Do you know what the hospital capacity is in New York, City, right, now?
The mayor has no interest in stopping any of this, so I think that's a very big problem, especially I think the city had a very great art, a very good article published today about how these day workers which, by the way they are part of the gig economy, and they have no security financially They- do not want to go to these construction sites, but they are forced to because they need the money and because they just haven't been told to go home.
So I, don't know if Lila from the public advocate's office is on the call I see The Manhattan borough advocate for the New York City public advocate's office, Manhattan born and raised, and I worked with community organizer Lila maiya, who also lives in the Lower East Side and was in the Bowery mission With her last week, volunteering around food in the Lower East Side very touched by what's going on, and the participation in this board and I will make a commitment to make sure that at least you I'll try to do my best to get the public advocate to see City Councilman Rivera, who we're working closely with her office and her chief of staff talking to the hospitals, checking in with them getting updates so that we can reinforce the messaging The public advocate joining Williams can reinforce the messaging around make So, please bar this, but making sure that the messaging is out there to the public around what they should be doing at this moment in time, because, as everyone has heard on, this call not to overwhelm the hospital system that is already strapped, with PPE, etc.
Margot is continuing to aggressively promote social distancing in social isolation, and we are discouraging people from seeking testing or visiting the ER and I just want to make sure that you all get the latest on the senior services front, with Margaret being chair of the Committee on Aging You know these are the folks who are interacting every single day with the most high-risk populations to kovat, but many of them are in desperate shortage of supplies, hand, sanitizers, PPE, gloves and even to-go boxes, since all the senior centers are now being asked to provide to go meals to all seniors who come in every single day.
The stairs are going down the elevator to pick up their food, so we're asking for clear-cut guidance from dibs on that, and if you can do it no contact, then we certainly should, but just to clarify grab-and-go meals at all senior centers So. It is first come in first herb, but we are aggressively distributing that opportunity on the small business relief front, we're working with community organizations to get the word out and help businesses apply for the to small business relief programs at SPS Has, the new york city, employee retention, grant program specifically for businesses with four or fewer employees and the new york city's small business continuity loan fund, which is a zero interest loan for businesses who are experiencing a decline in sales of 25 percent and more, but that application is not yet a pre-application to put in your information is online on SBS's website.
Both title committee board three requests for immediate economic help:: small businesses, whereas New York City is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen and in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of the cold Add 19 virus, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, whereas required aid and support programs for countless small businesses and employees will be substantial, whereas all levels of government must work collaboratively to provide needed.
but again, I think that this should be something separate, because tonight we're just dealing with the small business So, let's just still with the small business That's a fine idea for people that have problems The only issue I, don't know what the outcomes gonna be, but when next one comes in just from a management perspective, Milano landlords perspective, we have no idea what income is going to come in and from that income If there is a further resolution down, the road or I would just ask that if there is a relief rent that there is some type of relief on the real estate taxes on a landlord side, for example, which has already been mentioned here, so that can kind of offset, and then landlords can continue to pay for the essential services the buildings and for attendance and be able to take care of everybody.
We have Jackie Wong now and I also, don't think the contract issue of fitting resolutions that we are discussing tonight and also since Union news office representative, mentioned a little bit earlier that there going to be some amendments about the view and so I think I would want to wait until the whole bill comes out to talk about like how do we help them like different groups of people?
I think what we have to be calling for also is for relief to be given to all those institutions, because, as you will believe, one and two see another one hurts, and so what we need to be doing is asking both the state and the federal government to make sure that, in whatever relief packages come to New York moving forward, because you know you can ask for you could give somebody.
You know a rent freeze, but if they lost their job, that doesn't mean they're not going to face eviction later on and equally I didn't understand, suggesting that we're not doing this right now, because we have this resolution on the table and we need to deal with this particular resolution and for the sake of time and I, think that a bunch of people did not intend on being on this zone for more than a couple of hours right now tonight we cannot vote on AB during the resolution tonight.
This is the first time for many of us using this to practice to read some manuals or our parks meeting, because it will I, don't know how long it's going to take, but I don't want to go too late for two agenda items and that was it okay, helping Human Services We have a resolution for you to vote on.
I think the biggest news, though, if people haven't heard, is that the Grant Street settlements, grandma, cafe, unfortunately, is going to be permanently closing at the at the end of the month, which is really too bad, but in the current climate, I think they were having a tough time to begin with, but in the current climate, there's their business model you know it making it a community resource center and a single stop for people that they have will relocate there.
