Sandra sharing your screen, hey, Michael, I! Guess everyone should be on mute. You know you who's running the meeting. Okay, it's just going to be a three hour meeting like in that regular meeting. Oh yes, of course, okay. We perhaps asked that the elected to not do any self congratulatory stuff and just give us the most important material. Do you think that there dude gonna be self congratulating each other for what so I think we let them speak, how they speak I, actually think they will and I. Don't think that needs to be the purpose of tonight. Thank you, hi Michael, and this cool I'm excited. This is my first time. Hopefully it all goes well I'm going to keep meeting people as they join, so don't take it personally. No I'm gonna meet myself. Michelle I see that you're on so I'm assuming you're gonna be taking minotaurs Eric on yeah I'm. Taking minutes today is Erica on the do roll call do you know I see Erica's on. He said he would take roll call. All right, it'd be good to confirm you we'll get started in just a minute. In the mean time, we do have two people who submitted public testimony. I'm gonna be reading that when we get started but I'm also copy and pasting it into the chat section right now, so you can also read it for yourselves in the chat section. There's the Janet all right, so we're going to get started. I just put the two public comments into the chat section, I mean so I had to read them as well before we get started. I do just want to wish everybody well hope. You are safe and sound with your families and your homes. I want to thank Clint, Meltzer and Joe currents for their help in getting us situated with this technology that we're using and their help in putting together the little guide that we sent out yesterday to you all and a new, a new way of us doing business, and we don't know how long anyway, we don't know how long it's going to last so, hopefully, as we continue to use it more and more, we will get better at it and work out any kinks and bumps along the road. So with that being said, I'm going to read the first bit of public testimony that comes to us from Wendy Brower, who says with Corona bicycle usage is soaring and it will be the key to the city's recovery. That's not close. East River, Parks, Green Lane shared path as it's safe and healthy providers of all ages. In turn, flood protection is a must, especially around nitric acids where and resilient infrastructure is already under construction. Let's revisit completing FEMA's patchwork of walls and floodgates to meet the cdbg-dr demand that nature's needs be addressed. I look forward to seeing nature's barricaded green spaces reopened, the park preserved and all of CB threes well-being, the street tree canopy driving and the bike lane network expanded. Thank you and be well. Everyone wendy. Our second piece of public testimony comes from Henry Bevins from the Greenwich Village preservation, and he says, as we look for some continuity and inspiration in these times. I just want you to thank community board three and its members and staff for carrying on in the capacity you can to serve the neighborhood village. Preservation has some online resources that you find that you may find of interest and use while you work or educate or stay at home. For example, you can look at the history of every building in the East Village on our East Village building blocks web page at WWE. You can contribute your own stories about the building and its history in the comments section or submit photos. We hope tools like this can help pass the time, while also serving as an educational resource for students and researchers. Teachers are also welcome to contact me to explore ways to incorporate the tools in our research section at wwg, BS, h, p, org /resources in your online curriculum. I'm glad to see the executive committee passed a resolution to draw attention to the plight of small businesses and for the urgent need for action on every level of government. Village preservation stands with the community in these times and stands ready to help in any way. We can thank you for continuing your work and creative and unfolding ways: I'm Henry Bevins, East, Village and special projects director with village preservation. So, moving on now to the reports from electeds, we asked many of the electeds to. Let us know ahead of time that they'd be joining us so that we knew who to look forward to unmute, so I know. I can only see a few of your faces. I can see clearly now hi Carlina, but I know that there are many of you elected to were planning on joining us. So what I'm gonna do is we heard from Andrew from the mayor's office Assemblymember Glick assembly, member Epstein, senator hoylman, senator Cavanaugh, councilmember chin, who told us they were going to be I, mean I, councilmember, Romero, who or who told us that they were going to be on the meeting? If there's anybody that didn't call, if you can either shoot me a chat or raise your hand and we raise the hand function so that I can see that you're here, that'll be great and Brian. If you are on, if you can raise your hand, so I can unmute you I'm sorry Brian from the mayor's office longer. What was that Brian I'm? Sorry, that's right! Andrew from the Andrew! Sorry about that! Andrew, hey, alright, you want to get I'm going to let you go first from the mayor's office to give you a report so go ahead, and if I could just ask all of the electives and reports, I know you. We all want to talk about anything. So let's try to not be repetitive and repeat things that have been set by somebody else same goes for my fellow community board members. If you want to ask questions, we I know we all have a lot of questions and we all have a lot of the same questions so we'll try to get to everyone's questions. But if your question has been answered already by somebody else asking it just feel free to, let me know and we'll skip you and go to the next person all right and your dad yeah. Thank you so much for having me to your first virtual, full board. This is very exciting. Wonderful that you guys put it together so quickly, so I just want to recap a few things that are coming out of the mayor's office. Any student can pick up three meals a day for free at over 400 New York City school buildings. Grab-And-Go food is available Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. till 1:30 p.m. and I'm gonna include a link in the chat in just a moment where you can find some more information. I'm an update from the mayor's press conference this afternoon alternate side. Parking rules will be suspended tomorrow, Wednesday March 25th, through Tuesday March 31st meters will still remain in effect, and we just want to remind everybody if you haven't done already to text kovat, two, six, nine to six. Ninety two to get important cove in nineteen related updates, it's and straight to your phone, and you can text kovat ESP to get updates in spanish. The most important thing you can do right now for your family, for your neighbors in your community is to stay home and that's how you can stop. The spread of clove in nineteen is by practicing social distancing. I will continue to send nightly, updates to Galician Susan with information that may be helpful to the community and I. Want you guys to continue to reach out. If you have any questions or CERN's we're here to help and we're doing the best, we can to get answer this seat as quick as possible. Thank you. So much. Thank you. Andrew. Are there any questions for Andrew before we move on to the next person? If you have questions, please use the raise hand feature where is that raise hand feature raise hand feature if you go into at the bottom of the screen and open the participants section you will see in that section. You'll have the option to raise your hand or lower your hand. Is it the yes button? No that's for something else, because I have a different screen than you have. So do you want to jump in you want me to explain. Clint is Olympia can explain it if you click on participants, you're going to find several icons underneath the names of the people participating. The first icon is a blue hand and it says raise hand. If you click on that, then you would be raising your hand. Oh I see it now, so you can ask your question: well, can you try to unmute yourself? The system will, let me unmute, oh hi, can you hear me now? Yes, for the hi Andrew thanks for that report, I'm curious about what's happening or what the city is doing to follow up with parents who maybe don't have the technology to get their kids online or to even know that these meals available I, don't know, I know that the city was emailing everybody, but is there you just fill me in on or fill us in on, what's happening with that population of people who maybe are not clued in electronically to all the things the city's doing yeah? It's my understanding from Chancellor Carranza's report with the mayor that they have also been doing telephone calls with the students at all the public schools, and they can also call 3-1-1 to find out more information about both this and where they can pick up some technology. So they can access the virtual learning, I guess. My final question is: what about all the homeless kids what's happening with that population community? We are doing our very best to are being taken care, the three meals a day, the technology for virtual learning. For further details, I'm going to have to loop back to you and I'll follow. Thank you. You're very welcome. Thank you. Okay. So there was a another call, another raised hand from Eric I'm, not sure, because there's no last name I'm, assuming that's Eric, Diaz. Yes, good question. Have you heard anything back from charter schools as far as giving back yields any plans there and I haven't been in contact with charter schools about food, but I have been in discussions with a few charter schools about them donating some of the supplies that they have their sanitation supplies as well as some of the main glasses and gloves and whatnot. That could be used for first responders and people on the front lines and there's someone who raised their hand who I sent a message to, but they haven't responded. I, don't know who this is galaxy s 10 plus. Is that a community board member? Oh? No! That's! That's me. My name is Raymond Lewis I'm, just a new member here, just figuring out this meeting I'm a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, incorporated we serviced, New York City area, particularly the Lower East Side, so we was attending me and on my chapter, four president was attempting to go to the meeting before this co vid crisis, but we just wanted to join in on a meeting just to see exactly what goes on in this area. Hopefully we can be a part of okay. Thank you very much I'm. Just for your knowledge. Just so you know. Usually public session is open to everybody. We did it a little differently this time around because of the burglar so next time around, if we're still meeting virtually. If you want to make any announcements or anything like that sign up for public session. Normally during the elected section and during the business session, it's reserved only for board members to ask questions or make comments. So just so, you know that okay, not a problem, all right so I'm. What we're gonna do next is since there's a lot of electeds on we're. Gonna do the electives! First and then we're going to backtrack and do to people who are representing electives who couldn't join us so I know that Assemblymember Glick and Epstein we're planning on joining us either on it. So please raise your hands, listen! I'm! You yeah, we're here all right! Harvey! Do you want to go ahead? Yeah I can go I, don't know. I just want to go first, but I mean I, see b3, it's good to see you all and I know it's a little odd that we're all doing this way, but I really appreciate you taking the time to meet the people and virtually and talk about so many important issues that are going on I mean the states in a mess. We all know that right now we're about a week away from the state budget being finalized, and hopefully, if Congress resolves something in the next day or so we can get an agreement. We'll know what dollars are coming to our state. But you know it's a mess. Just be honest, the state budget- it's at least you know a seven billion dollar hole- is what we're thinking. Rob Bromley eCos, talking more about a potentially 15 billion dollar hole. I mean it's the impact that I'll have on the city budget. Last Thursday the governor's office had Medicaid redesign team proposal that would cut 2.5 billion dollars out of healthcare budget. So the lots of cuts that are gonna be really hurtful over the next months and potentially years to come so I think just it's not a fun time. It's not a good time, but it's a real situation with the revenue falling apart and you know not sure what the next incomes coming out of extending the filing dates for taxes, which is important to do New York is gonna, really suffer. We don't want New, York, City or New York State to fall apart, but it's a real potential, so I think the message everyone wants to be a great job, I, think social distancing in New, York and everyone. But a lot of us are doing a good job. I think that's really important to keep that up. We had to keep up as much as we can how we can help our friends and our neighbors. We hear people who have problems obviously reach out to my office. You know on the assembly side you lean and Deborah on the Senate side, Brad Brian Liz on out Liz, Brad, I'm Brian, of course, Carlina. We are really lucky in our neighborhood to have such amazing leaders that said you're, seeing that I'm being taken care of we're hearing a lot of nonprofits who are or just having funding issues. If there's things that any of our offices can do, we can be helpful with it. I know, control was really off helpful for Michael I see you there an issue earlier: I have forgiven them. Employees the controller's office, got that resolved today. The president so I think all of us are gonna, be working as a team, but everyone's can be a point person on different issues. So obviously, there's a lot going on. There's a lot of help, that's needed, and if you hear about things, just get it to us and we will figure out how to make sure that someone who is our whether it's food insecurity people afraid about the rain people, commercial business, is not sure how they're going to be able to keep their employees going or how they're gonna pay the rent. Those are all are gonna, be real issues that I'm not sure we're gonna get solutions for, but we're gonna try some of the solutions. Gonna be grand, some of them gonna be loans and some we're gonna be you know we do mean to figure out, but the more we hear the more we can all figure out together. So that's the message that we need to do we're all in this together. We all need to figure it out together, and the hope is that if we keep communicating and keep talking, keep sharing information we'll come up with solutions, that'll be better for most of New York, but thanks everyone and I hope everyone can do the best they can with social distancing and it's a half climb with family. That's wonderful but just be careful and be mindful, as you do the things you need to do to keep your life yeah. You know it's really hard to feel like you're saving the world when you're watching Netflix from your couch. But if we do this right, nothing happens. You're successful, shelter-in-place means you're going to feel like it was all for nothing and you'd be right, but nothing means that nothing happened to your family and that's what we're going for here. Harvey I, think Colleen way to go hold on all right while we figure out what's going on with. Are you able to speak you're, unmuted? Okay? So let's go to Olympia hi everybody hi Harvey. So my question is about the two main concerns that we share from most people, that is, the rent is due on April, 1st and I know. Senator Organa is introduced a bill yesterday, but what can we do? Is there something cb3 can do? It is very important that says: mortgages have been. You know, freezed. The eviction moratorium is not really protecting people who are gonna either to find the money in 90 days or face eviction in 90 days. So this is one question and the other one is I know the bill was made public yesterday about the federal bailout people who I mean New York is full of gig workers that apparently are not covered by any unemployment and they're desperate they're desperate. So what can we do to help for the push for this emergency unemployment benefits the birria, because the what we hear from the heel etcetera is that these benefit. Some of them are going to be tax rebates, but these people lead to it today, nothing how many months are going to get their tax rebate, the left, kids and they the gig workers, many of them, especially artists. The gigs were cancelled already like weeks ago because of the international outbreak. So these are the two main issues that I'm very concerned, because everybody around me is very concerned about those yeah and just Olympia I. Don't think we have really great answers for any of these questions. I do think it's a we're talking a lot about at the state level to figure out how we can protect as many people as possible on the rent side. I. Think, what's good about the moratorium, you know hopefully people's our my letter last week and Brad's letter last week tried to create leadership on this around getting a moratorium going that we got 90 days. Is we got a little time very one to breathe, so I know Ryan's coming do a professor a lot of folks, but luckily there's not no court case can be started as a moratorium on evictions and hopefully by eight ninety days or before ninety days we will be out of the crisis and won't be able to figure out what federal dollars available. What City dollars are available to people who need help with rainy weather, there's a rent subsidy available right now there are things called one-shot deals and people have rent arrears, they lost their job and they can and they've now got a new job. Those things are still going to be available and we're just going to need additional funding in those one-shot deals. I, don't know because we don't know how long this is gonna last, whether that's gonna be sufficient or whether the city will have enough dollars, so we're gonna have to we're going to play that a little by ear and once we get past this, the second thing about making sure gig workers, it's something that we've been talking to the governor a lot about I know not just me, but I'm sure every city and state elected official has been saying. We need to ensure that whatever happens on the federal level, we protect. People who have a gig economy is unlikely in my mind, to be included in the federal package. Unfortunately, so we're gonna have to figure out whether the state and city who are both going to be fiscally in deep trouble, can do anything. I, don't a simple answer, because I'm not sure we can we're going to have the resources to keep the lights on at this point and that's really the question, and so, if we don't have the resources to keep the lights on, you know and then we're gonna have to start following more state employees or making the situation worse. Not better and that's the answer. I think one big solution which we're talking about is this bonding authority. Whether we can just basically borrow money now and bond it out, so we can pay it back over the long term and that may be the solution, but that comes at great risk. So that's something where we're definitely discussing and within the next couple days, well to figure that out all right, Thank, You, Harvey Carlin. Are you able to ask your question? We still can't hear you Carlin, we you're unmuted on my end, [Laughter] Carlin, try to unmute yourself and talk. Maybe you could type it type it the chat you can type it into the chat. I can ask it some reason: you're not able to speak to us. I, don't know why. So, let's move on to Michelle Coopersmith's hi I, said a question if the Assembly is considering raising the 2% austerity cap in order to deal with this, and if there are any creative solutions about raising taxes on certain folks in order to try and compensate for the budget hole that you described that yeah. So it's a really good question. I think people. We know that the governor has proposed a self-imposed 2% spending cap on all new revenue and the idea was that we're trying to be fiscally responsible. It's not a real spending habits, it's not anywhere in the statute and it not required anywhere and there's something that we in the assembly and I know in the Senate have been pushing back on it. I think the reality is based on the current spending. We're gonna see a lot. Less spending will have a lot less revenue, but I do think if we should just ignore the camp and push the governor on that on the revenue side, I have lost the bills to add new revenue and millionaires, billionaires tax, mezzanine debt, tax fraud, captivator tear tax. We have lots of sources of new revenue that would not hurt individual New Yorkers. We've heard the line from the governor's office. The page we not want to put new revenue streams in the market and I. Don't really understand why, especially since we could even say that they don't apply now, we could start them in January next year in people with special millionaires and billionaires won't even feel the 1 or 2 percent an increase in the income tax, but you know he's the driver in the budget in the state budget. The governor sets the budget and, under a case called silvery Pataki he's the only one who can amend it. So we can't get him to agree. We have 220 of one other choices to vote, no on the budge. It so I think there's gonna lot of people who've been talking about revenue both in both houses and we've been pushing hard and long. Let's see, groups and I hope that we will get it, but I'm, not optimistic it'll, be in the budget. Just because he's been saying unequivocally that he does not want to seek new revenue sources in this year's budget. All right. We have one last question for you: Harvey, it's from Robins hotel, hi, Harvey, I'm, Robin, I. Think you know things like rent you know, holding off on rents of course makes sense in the mortgages as well, which is where I am, and a lot of people in the community are but I guess, I'm, assuming that you all are thinking about the domino effect of that right. If landlords don't get their rent and they can't pay their bills and so on and so on and so forth, and so if they don't pay their heating bills, so the heating company can't have money all this that whole that whole thing, but you just mentioned not having money for our electricity I'm wondering if there's I mean are the utilities being spoken to about this as well? You know! No, we just have to come from the feds like how does that work? Well, yeah, a good question. Robin I think the federal bailout is what's going to help us figure. This all out, I! Think both on the Senate and we said we're going to see how many, how much federal dollars are gonna be put on the table, especially on health care, I, think the biggest problem we have is right now in health care and we're seeing the need for additional hospital services. So I hope that we're not looking at cuts. If we get those health care dollars, then we will be able to allocate those and then question will be. You know how do we have bonding authority to make this the financing work better for all of us and that's the question that no one has an answer to today, but we will have a need to have an answer by the end of the week. I assume we're gonna be up there. I think Brad thinks we're going up earlier than I do. But you know I think, probably by the weekend we will be back up in Albany and hopefully have a sense of what it looks like, but I don't have high expectations that we're gonna have enough resources. So it looks like a budget that would be a cutting budget. So you know how do we manage in those terms and what the impact will be on the city budget? If we cut back to the city in the city, we're just telling the city that they'd be able to turn the lights on so I think this is a real crisis overall facing and my answer is always if we can find new revenue sources and that's going to be the message I will continue to forth at Albany and I know that my colleagues will do that. I know: Brad's been a real leader, Deborah's been a leader, you know, if you lean, we've all been trying to push this message out for our community I'm, just not clear it's coming through across the state, because there are lots of other districts that aren't like ours. So the hope is that you can continue. You can help us. Oh the board could write resolutions in support of additional funding. If we could do it quickly, the board could say you know we want to make sure that this is happening. The board could say we want to put policy out of the budget a lot of things that board could do to help our state elected officials and then in the end, will help the city elected officials. You know in this really difficult fiscal time and I hope that that's what CB 3 will continue to do because TV three has been a leader on these issues: Thank You Harvey. So thank you and sorry take up so much time. That's quite all right, Assemblymember, Glick I'm, not seeing you your hand or assembly member clicked she's here, she's just on mute. If you could unmute her, maybe I need her raise her hand, so I know who to unmute I'm doing my raise, never raised my hand there. She is I! Think I'm speaking am, I speaking, can I be here. Yes, okay, I'm on the air, look I! First of all, I apologize! You know. Technology has not been my first strongest point and it took a while to get done with cb1 anyway. First of all, I hope everybody is well and that their families are well and that you're taking care and taking advice from medical experts and not the fool at the top. First of all, the most employee, our V said that it will be very helpful once we have a federal response, and that is absolutely true. The budget is going to be really made up at this point. We have bled a tremendous amount of money and will continue doing so in order to provide health care to New, Yorkers and within a day it'll be tens of thousands. So we've the more testing we do, the more people we find and the more people who find themselves being sick. So the first thing we need to do is eliminate both federally in a state any eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance. That is an existing system that can drive money into people's pockets right away and having false barriers is not helpful. We have a lot of folks who are freelancers. We have folks who I've worked in restaurants. They lost their jobs, they need money right away and the best way to do it. The fastest way, is through the unemployment system. So that's number one number two schools are working remotely. It is possible that there are students that still need devices. There is a website coronavirus, DOT schools, DOT NYC, slash remote learning devices that is to the do-e, so that people can get those devices for their kids with IEP s are going to have their families reached out to so that they can discuss how they can continue their plans. Obviously, food is available at hub schools from 7:30 to 1:30. Folks can sign up for alerts from the city and the state if they have device our phones for this. For this city, it's texting, Co, vid to 692 - 692 for the state, its texting, New York to eight one three six most of our not-for-profits are actually providing their monitoring, their phones as and emails. Just like we are. Our offices are working responding to calls emails. We are on the phone calls with the city with the state. Manhattan Chamber of Commerce had a very interesting webinar yesterday. They are having a couple more this week that are targeted to businesses to figure out. You know what support is available. More support will be available in the coming weeks. The budgets going to be a mess. I think the two percent is kind of Adams out the window, but it's all going to be focused on health care, I, think and I. Don't know what more one can say about that. The state also has a website ESD, NY, DOT, gov or that will have and will continue to have more Covid-19 nineteen disaster relief information as it becomes available and the AG, if you have an employer that is not following any of the appropriate rules as we go forward, whether it's unemployment pave leave. The AG has a hotline at two one, two, four one, six, eighty seven hundred and, of course, any additional questions that people have we're gonna try to get answers. We don't have them all yet and I apologize for being slow to get on to this Thank You Assemblymember. Are there any questions for the Assemblymember? Please use the raised hands function, so I can see I think. So. Let me ask so many questions today, your last one girl. No thank you mentioned tests. We mentioned testing Deborah, but you know NYU hospital isn't testing anyone any longer unless you're admitted. So what do you order? The plans for what's happening on the testing ground well, I think that they, because the availability of tests is so reduced thanks to the slow response and actually the federal government saying no to the World Health Organization's offer months. You know a month ago. They are again in hospitals in the city. They are reserving those tests for people admitted to the hospital and I believe health care workers outside of the city. They are still doing in some locations, drive-in drive-through testing, but it is again by appointment and it is totally only for people who are symptomatic so I think if you're not symptomatic you're not going to be have tests available to you. But I do know that the governor is pressing the feds for us to actually shift to testing I think it's serial serology tests, which indicate whether you have antibodies, which would indicate that you have been infected but have recovered and have the antibodies. I've heard him discuss that as really the next step, because we think there are a significant number of New Yorkers who have been somewhat sick but have recovered and may have had kovin 19, and that would be very important to know, but you're right at the moment, they're not doing test widespread testing unless you're turning up with some symptoms at a hospital. Thank you again, I'm wondering if you support senator sorry assembly, member yulie news bill to suspend rent payments for 90 days for residential and small business. Tenants a thing yeah III think that would be an appropriate thing to do. I know I've heard from a couple of my small business folks that their landlords have voluntarily suspended for two months, they'll revisit at that point. One of them said that they have their landlord as the MTA, who is completely unhelpful and is requiring them to stay open, even though there's no foot traffic or very little, and so they are feeling the pinch, and there are some business taxes that should be waived at this point that have not yet been our income. Taxes have been moved from April to July, both federal and state, but business tax, as many of them have not been waived and the commercial rent tax is the stupidest text to begin with, and that should be immediately waived. The city has been slow to step up on water and sewer taxes, commercial, rent, tax. Those are things that should be immediately waived, but I agree that we should where we, you know, if you don't have people cooperating. This is an emergency, so you know we I agree with the bill, but if it's not rolled into the budget, we're not going to be taking up individual bills, including my pietà tare tax, which Brad hoylman and I have all right: Thank, You Assemblymember. We appreciate it. Thank You, Gail I, see that you're on. Do you want to do your report now? Do you want me to keep moving on to the state senators? Whatever you want, I would have to go somewhere else, but it's up. Why don't you go ahead and then we'll move on to the state senator? Thank you very much. I want to just mention some good news on the center. Manhattan is number one we're at 19.5% response. Staten Island is that 19% they're moving very quickly. We got to keep beating them. The Bronx is at sixteen point. Three Queens is at fifteen point nine and Brooklyn. It's fifteen point one. So thank you. Everybody who filled it out and keep filling it out so we've been working, but you know just like all the other electives and all of you, we've been answering hundreds of phone calls with a great staff from the top to the bottom of Manhattan, and one of the things that I focus on over the weekend was because I have contacts when we save the garment Center. In there we got EDC going and we got contracts for people in the garment Center and they the last manufacturer in Manhattan, to make facial shields. So those contracts are, of course, now hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of companies around the world or sending information to EBC about that. They have masks and they have this and they have that. Edc is doing the bedding and then they're sending those that are vetted to the Department of Health and to the OEM Office of Emergency, Management I think there's still a problem because departments that are working with the seniors that are now going delivery. As of today, as opposed to grab-and-go, all the senior centers are being delivered for their meals when they are part of the senior centers that dipthongs and I'll talk about the elders in a minute, so I'm concerned about the senior center deliveries not having enough materials and I got a call today from a big senior hospitals, not an H and H, and not a private hospital, but a one, that's independent that they are desperate for masks and gowns, and so on. So I put a lot of focus into making sure that the health care workers have what they need and I think the city still needs to step up. So just so, you know we're focused on that. We're also focused on food, as we always have been, and you should know that Fresh Direct to their credit, is delivering five days a week in Manhattan for free. We pick the night location so we're going to start today at we did at Dyckman houses, which is a nicer development in Inwood and we're working our way down to the Lower East, Side and Harlem along the way. So we'll make sure you know the locations on the Lower East Side. We have that the tenant leaders know and I just want to let you know how great they are on the Lower East Side, because they're all working together for when the deliveries come in and that's incredibly fantastic, we're also. We have really I think we put a lot of time into a daily newsletter. Yesterday's newsletter, for instance, included that's available from the Bloomberg foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Robin, Hood, Foundation and I know. Goldman sachs also has money so for the organizations you need to apply. You also need to apply if you're small, to the small business services, everybody is swamped, but there are actual grants available for nonprofits and small business and I also urge you to apply. We will continue to put that information into the newsletters. Obviously, today we had another one and it's chock full of information, and one of them is just after noon. You'll see it in our newsletter. The city has posted a website where you can actually apply for food, and that to me, is you know, between food and shelter and having a job. Those don't have jobs right now. Awful lot of people and food is so important. Food bank is also looking for volunteers. That's on our information list. Along with much other information. We have got some essential businesses added to the list. We got the bike shops added to the city list, because obviously many of us are riding around on our bikes and we need those shops to be open and I also got the dry cleaners added to the governors list because they are often cleaning the uniforms of the first responders. The laundromats are on the list and they wanted to be on it also and I think they actually have reason to be, and they have tailors. There are 2,000 tailors working in dry cleaners in the city of New York I'm. Also, we will continue to work. We are working with all the council members on appointing community board members, obviously for the new members, where you're not doing individual interviews, but we are all focusing very highly very strongly on working with the any kind of technology which were very familiar with. We also purchased for all 12 community boards, a very extensive and expensive zoom package. I think you know that it could list to 300 people together and then 500 to listen, and so we're very glad that so many community boards are using it and we're very glad that a hundred percent you should be very proud all twelve community boards are now virtual I, don't know if that's true in all the borough's I know it's true, Manhattan and I want to congratulate you and just finally, just some very local we're getting a lot of calls for I have space, because obviously the hospitals you heard earlier may be that the hospitals have to expand either fifty percent or a hundred percent. So we've gotten some suggestions for Rivington house and basketball city and performance space, New York. We have brought those to the attention of the city, but there are websites where you do need to make sure that people know about them. These are particularly ones that I think would make sense or I have brought them to the attention of the mayor's office. But anybody else you need to go to the OEM share your space website. It's called actually that Oh, a I'm sure your space survey and then put that information in also with regarding ESC, are in the park. We are going to hold a virtual meeting with Pratt center there, of course, the facilitators of the community advisory group for the part before the end of the month, and we are continuing to make sure that the Lower East Side, ecology, centers compost yard his return to the park I feel very strongly about that, as does the mayor when he was asked about it. So we're already focused on that and I think you know that we have. The city has postponed all you libs you're, very aware that, and we opposed the three st. marks last seems like a hundred years ago, but when you lips were still on paper, we submitted our you love recommendation on three same parks to a post, a TVR. We feel very strongly about that. So I think you know I could go on and on because there are so many calls coming into our office, but I think those are the issues that I wanted to be bring to your attention. Obviously there are many more, but congratulations on what you're doing and we look forward to being as supportive as we possibly can. We have gotten quite a few requests for food from residents and buildings in community board three and we have been responding to them I think satisfactorily, but let us know I'm very focused on making sure that people food and we have gotten you know- I- have to say a lot of support from the mayor's office, we're giving them a lot of support, but we are making sure that every single person who contacts us gets an answer. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gail we've got one question for you from Olympia Kazi hi Gail. First. Thank you so much for your newsletters they're, extremely helpful and full of resources. One thing about the small business grant that you mentioned Barry ports, we're hearing from many people, is that the requirements are still too much. People don't qualify and the fact that they make them actually available to. They say it's up to four, but up to five, but it's for employees. It's problematic. Many small businesses have a lot of part-time people, etc. So the people have been pushing for improvement on those small business grants and the united small business and I see Cooper square called me, ta, inmate, snitch, I, guess you see, all the good people are working together have put out recommendations about it. So, if you can, you know with your connections at the city, let them share the small businesses that are suffering most. What kind of grants they need from my speech would be great. I will absolutely do that. Thank you. So much okay, there doesn't seem to be any other people raising their hands. To ask you a question Gail. So, thank you very much wait. One more Eric, Diaz good hi, Gail I just wanted to follow up. I know this whole county initiative thing came on for census, but since Kelowna just wanted to see what the update is with that I know some extra money trying to see the update later yeah I, haven't heard I, mean I, think we're all just trying to fill it out. I haven't heard how we're gonna handle April first and how people are going to handle going door-to-door I mean I'm, hoping this. As people are home, they will either mail in call in use their technology, but we haven't heard anything definite yet about how the census in general, but we'll keep you up-to-date. Thank you again. Gal we've got another question from Megan joy, hi, Gayle guilt just for the employees that are working for us. We have a couple that are dreamers right: their work either in the process of getting their green card or their citizenship, and they have been advised by their immigration lawyers not to apply for unemployment benefits because of a Trump's rule that if you apply for benefits it may halt the process of your green card. Is there any reprieve for these people? I know the issue very well that public charge and I won't use a bad word, but I will find out for you, I, don't know the answer, but I certainly know what you're talking about. So let me get back to Meghan. Thank you. Next question is from Alicia hey. How are you girl, I? Have a question. I know they saw that they're giving food to the night redevelopments, but was there any offering for some of the section 8 developments? We only had you know Rangel or whatever. So what you and I can do is talk offline. We have identified other sources of food today. Awesome. Thank you so much hi. Can you hear me? Can you hear me reason? This is remarkable. Ok, thanks! Thank you all. First of all, you know I just want to say I gal said it well, but you know really is great, that the board is convening- and you know this time when everybody's so dependent on the government responding well and not only to provide service and resources for all, but also information. It's really great that you're, you know providing this forum for everybody, so I think Debra and Harvey gave you a pretty good sense of where we are with the biggest item at the state level, which is the budget. I would just note that you know Debra's characterization, that it's mostly going to be about healthcare and emergency resources, for people as to kur is correct. I did my view, although I would just add that you know, as the housing chair I had already spent a lot of time and I. Think I've spoken at this board about the need for additional resources for permanent housing, for people who are facing eviction or experiencing homelessness and I. Just think that need has obviously been you know, magnified massively by the public health crisis so and I think I want to emphasize. There's been a lot of focus recent on this question of how people are going to deal with the fact that they can't pay their rent because they've been displaced but I. Just there's a separate but related thing, which is, we really do need I, think it's an appropriate response to the public health situation to be trying to find ways to prevent people from having to live in congregate, settings and live in public places. So I think that need is more urgent than ever and I continue to advocate for to address that either through the you know, through the standard budget process or through what I expect to be very substantial amounts of emergency funding that are going to come our direction. The state we've also taken a few specific steps. In Albany that haven't been mentioned, we did expand unemployment, benefits and sick leave to make them easier for people to access by eliminating some of the restrictions on getting them, including you know, normally sickly, if you have to actually because if we sick to get it, but we made it clear that people who are you know, quarantined or otherwise, isolated also and as a result of that can't work could also get it get those benefits, and you know we made it easier for people to get unemployment, but again, I agree with Deborah Glick that we have a lot more to do to reduce barriers for those kinds of programs. Now that and again, this is a moving target when we did it when we did that last week, I think we hadn't seen quite the level of displacement that we've already seen. You know it's accelerating, even in the nine six days, so there's a lot more work to do there. We also did pass this legislation that clarified that the governor's, the pre-existing emergency powers of the governor include situations like the one we find ourselves in where infectious disease is causing an emergency, and that is the thing. That's given him some of the power to act decisively in the manner that he has. We also did expand the range of things he could do in response to an emergency. You know I'll say that is something that one should do carefully. You know giving executive kind of unilateral authority, but many people thought that, in the midst of a crisis, it was important to do that and again I think you have seen the governor acting decisively and in ways that a lot of people I think appreciate that power. The new power expires next April first, so you know it's limited in that way. We also passed a bill to address the fact that people were still petitioning to get on the ballot to run for election, and we ended that process and required that petitions be submitted by this previous Friday and again there was a direct response to the public health situation. Where you know you just don't want people on the street approaching each other with clipboards and pens, and so we you know that we close that out and on the housing stuff. We also played a role in pushing for the moratorium. That was, it was alluded to earlier, but there was a moratorium on evictions on residential evictions and on foreclosures it kind of happened in phases. First, the courts announced that addiction orders wouldn't be enforced and eviction proceedings would be stayed and then it was followed up with an executive order. That makes it clear that the base of that made it clear that the statutes of limitations were being told, and so the courts are not even accepting filings, except for emergencies. The housing courts so and again, Brad hoylman I think might be on the call who is chair of our Judiciary, Committee and I, worked closely on that and I think it's a very positive step for leadership house No. Thank you and just sorry, you know I know. I'll have you know I'll take questions. I, just must say: our office has never going quick mentioned and Harvey we're all functioning everybody's remote, but our phones are routed to somebody who can actually answer the elected officials, including all the folks on this call, have really been coordinating closely and staying in touch and doing conference calls, in addition to being on the state why the City, Health Department calls were also coordinating with each other to make sure we're getting the best response and we've been surveying our senior centers in our educational institutions and our homeless providers and our hospitals and everybody to make sure that we are getting identifying issues they're having and making sure resources are available. If you need us, our phone number email or the same as always and they're on our website and other than that, I think I'll end there and just say everybody can also please stay home if you can at the station. Thank you very much. Is there any questions for Senator Cavanaugh, all right? Why don't we move on? Thank you thanks for having me history in the making here with your first zoom. As far as I know, zoom conference call and just wanted to echo all of my colleagues they've, been doing a terrific job, Deborah Harvey Brian, the borough president, you lean. It's been a real group effort. I just wanted to mention a few things that haven't you know that haven't been catch on exactly for my office. First I'm, responding to the crisis. My team is responding to the crisis and Caroline's on the line here by signing up volunteers. One of the things that we've learned is that people over 60 or who have pre-existing conditions, probably shouldn't, be going out and food shopping, at least without taking dramatic precautions to protect themselves. One way around that is to get you know younger folks who are willing and able to do grocery shopping for them. So I'll share a link right now to a Google Doc that we've collected, you know close to 200 volunteers who are working and working with groups like God's love. We deliver and housing complexes, for example, and helping folks do that kind of shopping speaking of shopping. My second point is that I sent a letter to the CEOs of all the largest grocery chains in the city and urge them to Institute senior hours, which number of them have already I'm happy to say, including Whole Foods and Kips Bay. The Morton Williams has done it and I think other grocery stores are following suit. In that vein, I introduced a bill a couple of weeks ago that would clamp down on price gouging during a state emergency. Our state has a very vague statute when it comes to what retailers can charge of certain items during and during such a state of emergency, it basically defined as unconscionable, which is really for a court to determine and obviously could take a long time to hash out, as well as not give retailers or consumers any guidance. What I'm, proposing and I hope we get it in the budget, as both Harvey and Debra alluded to along with Bryan. Almost everything we do get done is going to get done in the budget this year we would set a 10% cap at for an item that was a household medical-supply items such as hand, sanitizer wipes or Tylenol, so I'm hopeful that we can get that bill raised for the attention of the Senate and as they discussed these issues in the coming days on the budget. Fourth item is, in my capacity as judiciary, chair I work very closely with Senator Cavanaugh on the foreclosure issue and an eviction one. We introduced a bill together on that front. We might see something like that in the budget we had obviously sent a letter as Bryan alluded to and got some action from the governor and the Office of Court Administration, but I've also I've, also written to the governor, seeking that he pause statutes of limitations for civil and criminal matters, because the courts are basically shut down and no claims can be filed unless there you know of the greatest urgency, so I'm hopeful that we'll see directive on that front during this crisis period and another bill that I've worked on. Some of you know called the child victims act padding one year, look-back window for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. Well, now you can't even file a claim as an adult survivor in terms of taking advantage of this child victims Act. So we basically cut the one year look-back window off by seven months, unless we extend the child victims act further, which is what I've been campaigning for even before this crisis, because states like California and New, Jersey and Hawaii of all extended their stats. They're look back windows for adult survivors of child sexual abuse. It's now more urgent than ever that we do so and then I want to just to mention a couple of other things. I've been working on the face mask front, -, believe it or not. There are offers of face masks, as Dale mentioned you know being made in the and the garment district, which is pretty cool, but I received an offer to redistribute a 10,000 face. Mask, for example, I've received I reached out to the FDA on behalf of another individual who wanted to donate face masks, but they were stuck at them at the border in Mexico and had to get FDA clearance. So we're doing this kind of stuff like on one-offs, but it's been, it's been very successful. The governor and the city have daily or almost daily calls and we've been able to communicate with them directly. So if you had particular issues and I know on the small business front, which was the fifth thing I wanted to mention, a lot of our small businesses are struggling. We have not yet seen a directive, as Debra mentioned in Harvey mentioned on sales tax, and but it is being forgiven, there's nothing official at the moment, but the deadline is being extended, but we hope to see something clear for our small business owners on that front. Small businesses. You know people talk about loans, they don't want lungs and they may it's. That's not going to be helpful, so we really have to push federal aid and state aid that gives these struggling small businesses. You know a leg up during this difficult time. I know that my colleagues are going to be working on that with me and then finally wanted to just mention or Caroline might just kill me that we, you know you can contact our office or the governor's office if you're, retired, medical professional, a lot of those individuals are being recruited to serve in hospitals and then I issued a letter recently to the FDA. The feds are calling for blood donations because of the national shortage and the blood supply. But you know a lot of us who are LGBTQ cannot donate blood unless we're abstinent for a year, which is a really steep. You know, challenge I, think for anyone and unnecessary, given that scientific evidence that HIV can be screened through and in blood, that's donated. So hopefully this is an opportunity to strike one for civil rights and equality while we replenish the nation's blood supply at the same time. So those are my main points rather than that, we, you know Deborah mention the calls. The hotlines you can call I would like to mention that there has been a spike in hate crimes against the asian-american community and the Attorney General Tish James has set up a specific hotline in connection with that, and we should all you know make certain that she be informed of any information in connection with that kind of absolutely outrageous and unacceptable response to this public health crisis. Thank you so much happy to take any questions. Otherwise, I'll just be listening in the comfort of my living room thanks bad. We do have a couple of questions for you: the persons from Meghan joy, I bred. You had mentioned something about sales. Tax forgiveness, I, didn't hear anything about sales, tax forgiveness, maybe forgiveness on the penalties or fines for pain lee. Is that what you meant as far as I know, the governor's office and Carolina feel free to jump in the governor's office has basically has extended the deadline, isn't that right, Caroline, but without any official directive, correct they're, not charging any penalties as of right now, but they're not being super clear about when the new deadline is. But if you weren't able to pay it on the 20th and then they're not going to penalize you but we're pushing them for something more concrete yeah on our daily calls. In fact, we signed a letter with I think almost all of our Democratic colleagues. In connection with that all right. Our next question is from Robins hotel, okay, hi thanks Brad, you mentioned something about the senior hours at the grocery stores. I think is a great idea. I have heard a couple stories where there are there aren't still aren't you know appropriate items in those stores during those times I, don't know how. Obviously it's not your job to monitor that, but maybe there's a way that can be monitored or when there's a requite. It goes out to mention that, like you know at times the delivery for chicken, for example, I've noticed, isn't there at those early hours it doesn't get set up to later. You know yeah, that's a great point. The other thing, in addition to the senior hours that we've question, is to ask grocers to prevent courting you know the last thing you want to see if you're in a market and your senior is the guy in front of you, like you know, 35 year old with you know a case of paper towels right, so we've asked them to limit certain necessary items as well. We haven't gotten official responses back. We are seeing some summers, some responses. We will continue to monitor and Robin if you have specific examples, we'd love to have those as a way to follow up great. Thank you thanks a lot awesome. Thank you! So much Brad. We appreciate it. We're gonna, hear from carly. Never ever next hi, I'm gonna hear me. Okay, good great. My colleagues did so well and updating you all I'm glad I was here to listen to each and every one of you. It has been incredibly caring. It's been challenging, it has been heartbreaking and uplifting, and you know you hear great stories, and but people are panicking. So there was a lot covered on housing and small business and taking care of you know the remote learning challenges that are happening in our Department of Education in our schools. Just generally just earlier today, I assisted an organization to give out laptops, because some of the laptops that the do-e has given out are not working, so there are nonprofits that help with technology and so we're making sure that people have functioning tech while they're at home. There have been a couple things going on in the council that we're trying to work on, as you know, we're a little bit limited in some of the things that we can do in terms of you know: executive orders, especially at the at the governor's level and even at the mayor's level, could really support and change a lot of the things that are happening right now. We could, there could be an executive order to suspend the commercial rent tax. There could be an executive order to deal with our park situation and how people are congregating. However, you know these are all things that we've seen kind of unfold in the news and we are trying to be really receptive in terms of what we're hearing and people's needs, but you know things that we're trying to do in terms of my office. As you know, I have an incredible staff of about six people. We have organized dozens and dozens of volunteers. We have made hundreds and hundreds of calls to some of our elderly neighbors to some of our seniors. We've received a ton of calls as well and we are making sure that we are pushing for those senior hours. We do have a number of supermarkets that are participating that we're posting to let people know we also. You know the bike shops, making them an essential business. That was something that we were especially passionate about, making sure people are still completing the census and also talking to some of our local manufacturers. I had I've been working with the Navy Yard on even just local production, some of the organization's, the companies that are there. They are taking great risks and probably risking bankruptcy, and they are, they have converted their manufacturing because they know it's the right thing to do and they're hoping to have citywide level production of things like face shields and gowns and hand sanitizer, and they even developed a prototype for a do-it-yourself ventilator. So this is where people are considering how dire the situation is as you've seen. Our Hospital situation is getting exponentially worse every single day. That is because there has been inaction from the federal government. There has even the city the mayor's office has been I, think slow to move. There's just so many things. I think we have to do now at an urgent level that we haven't been and I feel like our city, especially our hospitals. They will be at capacity very soon and we will be ending up more and more field. Hospitals, as time goes by, you probably heard about the Javits Center they're, looking at larger facilities. Looking at we have them look at Mount, Sinai, Beth Israel for the building that was empty they're, just any large spaces where we can put additional beds. You know about the capacity issue, but we have hospitals like Elmhurst and Queen's Hospital. Acting is basically just large I see use, it is very serious. Lincoln Hospital is also pretty much at capacity, and every single facility is getting worse and worse, so we're trying to just be responsive to our constituents, and a lot of you have been really amazing in terms of small business. You know: we've called for a ton of things for the state in the city. To do I wrote a letter to the mayor and the governor that was in the New York Post. Sometimes you know they cover good stories. They also cover at a local doctor, who's amazing at Mount Sinai, Beth Israel. His name is Ian Kwok. They just did a tweet and they picked up the story so we're trying to stay positive, but it will get a lot worse before it gets better, and you know again, everyone is doing their best. This is unprecedented. It's is stressful, but for all of our small businesses or cultural institutions or cultural workers that are taking a very big hit, we will be negotiating a budget that will look probably a lot different than last year, but I will be making all of these organizations and all of the things that I know we need a priority. Food is probably our biggest issue right now. I think that we're going to have a serious food shortage, I mean we have some of our larger organizations that distribute via pantries and buy wholesale now competing with larger companies and corporations and getting out bidded on food, and so things are getting more and more expensive and I'm very worried about our low-income families and our seniors and making sure that we have our schools up and running in our senior centers up and running community-based organizations are stretched very thin and they they're worried about deliverables and their contracts, and so they're doing their best to make it work and I just want to thank everyone. Who's been who's been helpful and supportive, and with that I'm just gonna take questions. I think that's enough. Thanks. First question comes from Olympia Ozzy, hi Karina, so you know a satellite of the hospital's committee. You have such a difficult position right now. Unfortunately, what we see right now we're already at 14,000 cases. You remember that they were like they didn't want to close the public schools etc. Half of my family's in Italy right now and the other half is in Greece, as you know, so, from the lessons that we learned from there is a lot that we need to bear in mind and I'm wondering whether you have already started looking at the possibility of following Italian France and asking private health care facilities that may be needed very soon, because the peak is fire is 1020 days away from here and we're already at 40,000 people idiots. It's gonna, be tough choices for many, and so, if there is any private facilities that need to be used for ventilators and treatment, if you can at your capacity, you should do it. Sorry, it's okay, it's okay, I think we're all tired and we're all sad and that's it is okay, so they absolutely have to step up I. Think most of them are trying to. They must double their beds. I also think that we're going to be looking at unconventional spaces to expand the bed capacity I think that we are going to have to essentially look at private, open spaces to put field hospitals. Fema sent an additional 5/10 along with supplies. You know not all of them are necessarily compatible, but we also have to support the clinics and the people that are providing hyperlocal services. I mean from the doctor, Velazquez on Houston Street to the Ryan Dinah's of the world, they're also out of masks there they're also out of PPE and I'm. Looking larger donations go to the office of emergency management headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, but as I'm getting smaller donations, you know I'm just trying to make sure that they are taking care of our neighbors, who aren't necessarily gonna. Go to the hospital I mean you shouldn't, go to the hospital right, you're supposed to stay home and I think that people are not respecting that message, and that is a part that I think frustrates me and angers us, the most that you know today. I had to take a bike ride to run an errand for one of my neighbors, and you know there are still people outside congregating is incredibly frustrating, and you know as I look at the hospital system and what it's going through already have facing that deficit. It is, it is going to take some serious federal intervention that should have been here weeks and weeks ago. We knew this for weeks and, to be honest, the federal government continues to fail us every single minute that help has not arrived. So it's a it's emotional and all the doctors and nurses. That text me and the CEOs of these of Mount Sinai in north well and Presbyterian and as I get the stories with people who are, you know, they're worried about giving birth and their partners being banned from the room. These are stories that are that I'm constantly hearing, so you know we're trying our best and we tweak. We absolutely expect private institutions to do their part and we plan to hold them accountable, and they know this is an all-hands-on-deck situation. This is, this is going to be thousands and thousands and thousands of cases. There is no doubt you've already seen it sorry, I mean or go on. We actually have a number of questions for you: okay, Councilwoman, but okay, the next one's going to be coming from our Board Chair, Alicia, hey Carlina. How are you thank you so much for the hard work that you have been doing. I just wanted to just say that we are dealing with so much more than what everyone is aware of coming from the inside of stupids and just making sure that people are aware that they're also frontline workers working in these kitchens. Many of our workers are getting sick. We don't have protective gear as they open and close these doors. We're exposed, and no one is talking about that. Quite a few of the workers have had to call out sick and in doing that, many of them are being told. If you call out sick, you have to have a doctor's note and a lot of the doctors in the area are not providing doctors, letters, they're, saying: well, we can't provide you the letter and you haven't been tested yet. So what do we do with situations like that, because you have clinics like the Tanja's and why Amina and dr. Velazquez is not even there he's quarantined, so I have a couple of workers that have already reached out to me and they basically said to me. So what are we supposed to do when we work for the city and the city is telling us we have to have doctors notes in order to be out of work, but yet, if we display symptoms, we can't get a note. You know. Let me that is because the people that I have spoken to and thank you so much for your work, I- think that you know for all of our are like do-e and employees who are going in and still working every single day from 7:30 to 1:30. Who are actually look. You know interacting with families and students constantly. All of these frontline are essential workers that grocery store workers, who don't have the equipment as well in terms of being able to call out sick I mean that is your right, and if there is this, weird kind of you know like cycle that they're putting you through that doesn't allow you to take yourself. That's completely unacceptable, so let me just look into why they would do that for you and Alicia. You could follow up with me even via text or if you could call me, and let me know, kind of what happens and I won't have to name anyone, but I could say this is happening right now and someone isn't feeling well. They have to stay home because they could spread the disease. Everyone knows is highly infectious highly contagious and you know you can easily get handfuls of people sick just by being close to them. So thanks letting me know the issue and I will bring it up. I appreciate you Thank You Carlina, before we move on to our next question. It's one of remind people that question during this section or reserved for a community board members. So there are some people raising their hand, are not community board members, so it will be just lower in your hands internally. If you want, you can use the chat function and send your send your questions, your Carlina that way or you can send it to me and I'll, make sure to get it to her. The next question is going to come from Debra Jeffrey's hi. Thank you for Lena. So I know that, given the numbers that are coming out here in the city and in the state, my question is this: so I know that there's conversation about trying to mobilize Javits, Center and large-scale centers create beds for folks who are in need of treatment and services. I guess I want to try to figure out what we can do as a community board to support using facilities like the former revention house to be able to get there's a couple hundred feds that can be done. It probably will take less time to be able to mobilize that space and, from my understanding from a couple of press reports that I've read that Mount Sinai Beth Israel is amenable to using that. So what can we do to help get a couple hundred beds online more quickly than trying I could do a thousand beds of jabba. Thank you and she's, referring to the comfort, the USNS comfort, which is the u.s. naval ship that has a thousand beds and supplies on it that we're very excited about. It does not get here until April, but at least it's on the way. So all of these spaces that people have recommended I want you to know that we have sent them to the mayor and the governor everything from Rivington house to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel buildings that are there two large gymnasiums, two even just open fields that we could potentially put a tent, which is what they're doing outside of many hospitals. They really want to keep these alternative locations as close to hospitals as possible, we're actually pretty close, so I've. Given all of these suggestions to the mayor in the governor's office, please feel free to send them to district 2 at Council DOT NYC that govt, even if you think all they probably thought of that already. It's okay just send it to us anyway. It cannot hurt and as a follow-up, what can we as a community board, do to help support trying to gather as much resource as we can to help create spaces for treatment? Well, that's a great question and it's really nice to hear that what we can do to try to is just collecting the information. If, even if you know we have gotten a lot of inquiries like I know, someone know someone who has a building and sometimes it works out, and sometimes it doesn't. We try to follow up on every inquiry we get. Even when someone knows someone who has a factory in China like I've, actually called people and said how is this connection? Is it something worthwhile I will send it to OEM I will send it to the mayor's office. So if you have recommendations great, if you have lines - getting supplies, I mean the mayor's office and the governor's office I think are trying their best. We need thousands and thousands of everything. As for what maybe you can do, we do have volunteer opportunities. We are calling many people who we know don't necessarily have internet who aren't watching the news as often and quite frankly, maybe watching Fox News isn't the best idea right now, so we're just making sure that people understand where they can go and get a meal. If you're interested in volunteering, you could reach out to ivy Rosado. That's iris, Otto, I counseled on NYC that govt there are also some violence. People are taking volunteers at some of the larger organizations that distribute meals to go like God's love we deliver, but we can connect you to those opportunities as well that that's you know pretty much supporting our local cultural institutions. If you, if you want to do that, our local businesses, if you can and just letting us know if you have a line to resources and we'll try to or like really coordinate interagency wise, has the mayor's office in the governor's office been kind of working in tandem? Are they always on the same page? No, you can see that clearly, but the council is trying to do what they can to organize on a very hyper local level and also working on whatever we can do legislatively to support the city. I mean we put out a twelve billion dollar plan. We would love for the federal government to pay for it, that's to help small businesses and create a universal based income on a hyper local level. But if the federal government's not going to pay 12 billion dollars, you know, maybe we can issue bonds, it's not the same economy, post, 9/11 and so that same might maybe active patriotism in buying bonds and funding. Some of that relief is going to be, but we really feel like it's our obligation to think of how we're gonna be able to send cash into people's pockets, which is what they're gonna need after this is a public health crisis and an economic crisis all rolled into one and we are drastically behind and where we need to be to kind of to stop the spread all right, Carly, no, we've got four more questions for you, so I'm going to ask people. Ask those questions to be as brief as possible and I'm gonna cut it off after these four before our shoes and Stetzer Kay Webster Michael, pearlescent, Dominic Erb, so we're going to start with Susan. Okay, can you hear me yeah, okay, Carlina, thank you for following up to stop the cleanup that was scheduled for a homeless, encampment I'd like to know what is the status? Is this continuing and also there are groups of homeless people who large groups who are and once a large groups, but certainly six, seven, eight that are in close proximity and nothing seems to be happening, and my last part is how is it that DHS is able to put out a printed notice to these homeless? People saying you will be asked to move when it is illegal to do that so based on Thank, You Susan for your question so based on your you know, guidance and recommendations. I have contacted NYPD and DHS to whether it's you know stopping some of the meal distribution or the cleanups I really tried to let them know you know, what's doing more harm than good. There was a call with Commissioner banks, I believe it was Friday. When I tried to bring this up, they said they would follow up with me. As you probably have heard, the shelters are. Full people are looking actually for alternative sites to do drop-in centers because they don't have the capacity and some of the existing facilities and I and as I as I mentioned I was outside earlier on. My bike, running errand and I did see that the groups of homeless individuals, maybe they're under a scaffold. Maybe they were by the park- I, don't remember, but they're really I, don't think at least not that I've heard a real plan for outreach. I mean Commissioner. Banks is really doing his best, but I. Don't really have I can't give you a direct answer right now, Susan, because I haven't received one from DHS and HRA. I just know that what I, how I contact my individuals at these agencies to let them know what our problems are. You know they're pretty much being very reactive there there's there are. There have been many announcements and few actual things implemented on the city level. So let me I'll follow up with you and try to figure out. Maybe we can just give them some recommendations and I hope you can help me with that, because I would just I need to tell them like what I need and what to do, and sometimes we just have to go above the mayor's head and go straight to the governor's office, because they're not being the most responsive, hey. Thank you. Okay, Webster! You up! Next I Thanks Carlina, really appreciate everything, you're doing I guess my main question is: do you know what the hospital capacity is in New York City right now? That's my first question. My second observation is: there's a lot of luxury housing with construction workers going on all over I'm sure. You've heard this I am wondering if we could ask those construction workers and those unions and those luxury developers if they would offer their employees in this crisis, to help us build these sites that we need, like Rivington house but I'm sure there are other ones and then lastly, I just want to say on the last bit: we've posted signs in our Park. Wherever we know homeless people congregate with just basic information, because some of them are undocumented. They don't go to shelters, so I think it's time a little bit for asks from folks who could come through and also for us. We can do our own guerilla postings. You know so that at least people are informed. Thank you. So thank you for your question. I just realized I was just like trying to look at the chat, for example anyway, I try not to get caught up in that. But, okay, let me answer your questions. So I can tell you about how many staff beds are available right now, which are beds that are open with the staff to assist the patient and then about how many ICU beds are available. There's only about 4,000 staff beds available I mean ICU beds a little over 300 we're nowhere at the number that we're going to need we're nowhere at the number that we are going to need in the next couple days. That's data that I've kind of requested across all hospitals, and so that is you know, that's what that's a very big challenge: that hospital beds are a very big challenge and in terms of what you're mentioning about construction, so we have called for an end to non-essential construction. The speaker actually has been very vocal on that. The mayor does not want to he's not interested in actually limiting non-essential construction I. Think that not only could those workers be, you, know coordinated to do an effort of actually obstructing I mean constructing, like tents and things that we need to create these hospitals, but if not, they also have a ton of protective equipment that I think that our hospitals can use so I reached out to multiple unions about this and said: if you have just extra equipment, can you please send it to the hospitals? They haven't really heard back and construction continues. I could tell you that, on my block, I've actually funded three projects on my block to affordable housing could projects and then there's one supportive housing building coming down and then in the luxury, when everything is going, everything is going and I have my own definition for essential construction. I do think. Affordable housing is essential, but, as you can see, all over the city, purely luxury development is going on and I to me. The mayor has no interest in stopping any of this, so I think that's a very big problem, especially I think the city had a very great art, a very good article published today about how these day workers which, by the way they are part of the gig economy, and they have no security financially. They do not want to go to these construction sites, but they are forced to because they need the money and because they just haven't been told to go home. So what do you do? You want to feed your family I'll? Try to get you more information about the beds, but that's pretty much. What I have it's pretty bad? Thank you. It looks like one of our questions dropped off, so our last question for you, Carlene, is coming from Dominic burger, hey there. How are you hi, hey so I just want to follow up on Alicia's point before I posted in the chat. I put the link to a forum. Doctor's note I, think that was put up by do HMH because they now realize that people are not going to be able to get tested, but they could still be sick, so that could be helpful for a lot of people. However, obviously a lot of people are not going to know that note. Is there and won't know to use it? So one thing Carlene I was thinking. You know it may be worth it to look at whether or not the city which is grant sick leave to people no matter what during this period, you know right now, as a city worker I can get two weeks not deducted from my leave, but because everything's so complicated and trying to prove it may just be better to have a blanket. Any sick leave is not going to be deducted from your regular leave right now. That's just an idea that I had I think an expansion of paid sick leave and family and medical coverage is absolutely essential. I also think that the universal based income and we can kind of debate over whether we put an income limit on that I. Just think it's going to be essential for individuals, I think you're right about granting sick leave. It is again I've called for it. The speaker has called for it. We are waiting to hear back from I guess leadership at the top and I just you know, there's something in the chat here. Heidi I just want to thank you for bringing up laptops and Wi-Fi for our children in the shelter system today. This is why I was helping an organization give out laptops. It's because you know for our low-income families, our families in the shelter system, who don't have access, I'm, really trying to be responsive to that. We just generally have a broadband issue. This is one problem with the Census I think it's like 29 percent of New York City households. Don't have access to Internet. So you know the field operation is critical and again that's been delayed two weeks but I'm asking for a postponement indefinitely. You know, PS 188 is a school that was open for four meals. It's been closed. Now the distribution sites are very limited. I have been checking in with the Chancellor to make sure that we're not I understand. We have to streamline things, but he says that our district is served. Meals, wise I have people that disagree with that. So if you do see things again, I'm always open to feedback and notes and constructive criticism. I'm really trying to stay on top of everything and I and I really think everyone for kind of just bringing up things that we have maybe been working on, but we haven't been able to really relay so I'm gonna. Take a good look at these comments. As what I'm saying: okay yeah, that was our last question. We're gonna cut questions for you for now, so that we can keep moving on. I will say that we are going to be posting. A lot of written reports that the electeds are providing to the office will be posted on our website tomorrow. So keep that in mind as well, but we are going to move on I, don't think, there's actually any more elected officials on the poll. So what I'm going to do is now move to the representatives for the electeds that weren't able to be on the call if you're a recluse elected, was on the pole, I'm not going to call on you unless you need me to for some reason but I'm, considering that, since you represent the call, we were told everything we needed to know from your rep, so we will just hear from the reps whose electives were not on the call. So I don't know if Lila from the public advocate's office is on the call I see. Philip is all right, bad look good. Can everyone hear me? Yes, we can hear great, and can everyone just want to make sure as I have notes here? Can everyone also see me at this moment of time? We can see you but your throat. Well now we can see you, okay, wonderful, I'll, be brief. This is a hell of a time to have an introduction to the board I'm. The Manhattan borough advocate for the New York City public advocate's office, Manhattan born and raised, and I worked with community organizer Lila maiya, who also lives in the Lower East Side and was in the Bowery mission. With her last week, volunteering around food in the Lower East Side very touched by what's going on, and the participation in this board and I will make a commitment to make sure that at least you I'll try to do my best to get the public advocate to see. If you can join one of the board meetings and also want to give a shout out to all of the electeds who some of who I know. Personally I've met over time recently, - miss -, City Councilman Rivera, who we're working closely with her office and her chief of staff talking to the hospitals checking in with them getting updates so that we can reinforce the messaging. The public advocate, joining Williams can reinforce the messaging around make. You know telehealth staying inside. If you have symptoms not going and overwhelming I'm, not sure how you could see me what I look like. So please bar this, but making sure that the messaging is out there to the public around what they should be doing at this moment in time, because, as everyone has heard on, this call not to overwhelm the hospital system that is already strapped with PPE, etc. So shout out to the councilman to mr. Epstein Glick and all of the electeds that are doing an acting job. I've personally checked in with many a city council chief of staff's and seeing what's going on all throughout Manhattan, and while it's really disheartening and challenging I also, our office is very heartened as we've seen the borough president with the fester recognition, we've seen the calling seniors, etc, and that's really exemplified by the community. That's an Lower, East Side. A couple of things are the public advocate's office. I think is. It is important you can see. The public advocate addressed the city on his Facebook or his Instagram. If you look up jovani d williams, you'll find our page, and the public advocate is speaking once or twice a day. Our office was working with the borough presidents to push the shelter in place early to make sure you know the you know following the ubers lead and even trying to push the governor to really hold true and sheltering in place understanding to flatten the curb in promoting social distancing. We did have a webinar, that's happening right now, at the same time as community is built and in jails. So that is amazing. Major thing that the public gap gets also been publicly discussing and putting out there and pushing for is also pushing and supporting the rent moratorium because we understand for everyday working people. The issues that have been on this call, the Public Advocate, is a big proponent and supporting people like Harvey, Epstein, etc. On that basic on element and just closing the ending, the Department of Buildings and the construction as some of the things that the public advocate's office and Johnny D Williams has really been advocating. There's a number of things that our deputy public advocates are doing. But as we gather and move into this next month, I will make sure that I have some reports from our different W public advocates that are relative to the community. To share with you all, and if you have questions please reach out, I will give share my information with cb3 afterwards as well, so you have Lila Mejia the community organizer from the Lower East Side. You have me. The Manhattan borough advocate Philip Ellison, willing to I'll, take questions I'm. Really. As a native Manhattan person and hearing everything that's going on it is. It is very challenging because I I'm seeing a lot of the pain, but if we could, if our office can be helpful in collaborating or championing anything that is as meaningful to the community, we are very committed to do so. Thank you very much. Philip appreciated there any questions for the Public Advocate office. Before we move on Michael Stinson. Yes, I'm ready for you hi everybody I know we're all disappointed. We couldn't be in PS 20 s auditorium with those very comfortable seats tonight, but I have just have a couple, quick announcements on behalf of the comptroller's office. Last week we were hearing a lot of. We got a lot of calls from nonprofits that are right, they're scared to death right now, because they feel like they're, losing all their money. They feel like they're not going to be able to survive even after this coronavirus goes away. So there are certain requirements and the city contracts that may no longer be achievable because of this virus due to decreasing client participation, program, suspensions and other factors that are beyond the control of these nonprofits. So we sent a letter to City Hall last week and I'll send this letter to your board that asking that nonprofits be held, harmless firmness, contract deliverables, their direct directly attributable to kovat 19, and that immediate attention be paid to the fiscal stability of the sector. I know the councilmember is also working very hard on this, so she mentioned that during her report. So we're happy I know I, think of Eric first off in this Eric Diaz. But if you have any contracts that are about to be with our office feel free to reach out to us, we are still working at home. We are registering contracts, we are accepting claims. Our office has not stopped. You know Scott. He checks in with us every single day to make sure that we're doing our job and people know about what we're doing and just yesterday, I'll also send this over. We released a new, an updated forecast for tax revenue losses for New, York City and again the coronavirus is impacting our economy, as we know, through CNN and every other major news network, but our fiscal. Your forecast for 2021 is now four point: eight billion to six point: 1 billion in total loss for tax revenues. So this is a huge loss for New, York City and it's a huge impact on our economy. It's going to take a while to recover from this. But again, unlike the president, the most important thing for us is the health of New York City residents in the world's residents. So we we're gonna renew our call for immediate mandatory city agency savings program and for fiscal relief from the same local governments and the federal stimulus bill, including direct cash assistance and paid sick leave. So I have a couple other things, but they were touched on I'll, send them over as part of the board report. So you don't to listen to me anymore tonight, thanks Michael, any questions for the controllers office. All right, we're gonna, move to nitty of last classes, office links, wha, I'm, gonna, see. If I can find you there, you are alright. We can hear you go ahead way to get my camera on my computer work, a galleon on the phone yeah hi, everyone yeah and thanks. You know, I'm very touched by the enthusiasm and how this community has worked together in to pass this critical time. As someone who has somebody says sometimes in a crisis, we see people's true character and I have to admit that this week and last week I have oh, you know. Ii might work with the community. I've been very touched by how some a lot of ordinary people stepping up and taking up heroic, grows to volunteer and to help those in need, just like probably all the elected office right now have been connecting with groups of volunteers. You know help connect, volunteers to senior centers and help facilitate mask and PPE donations, and my office is not an exception. Just like colleen sa, we have also been touched. One of the bottleneck is it's getting there are, they are masks right now. China is the biggest producer and in fact, during the cry during their crisis, they boost a lot of manufacturers, their boost, and you know, boost the mask production by even car makers. There were are making masks now and then the problem of, and then was there pandemic getting under control. You know they do have the capacity to sent maps to the United States, but one of the bottlenecks is the is the certification, because our certification system and their certification system is up is quite different and only factories mask factories who were already producing masks before the pandemic. That already had the FDA approval could export here. A lot of a lot of the production capacity they have over, there were boosted like just in the reason month. Like you know, car makers, you know, clothing factories, making the masks and those do not have FDA certification and so there's a problem, and we have, we have been connecting with matrons I guess you know talking to everybody and to see how we can get around that, but in the meanwhile, oh well, you know we have in our in our district, not just Lower East, Side and Brooklyn and Queens and Lower East Side. They are ordinary citizens, stepping up and don't even ask, and we have been connecting them with hospitals, some of the hardest hit hospitals. There was yeah and I guess I liked. All I gotta say is a lot of those people are they are hard? Some of the donors are lost the job themselves, they're hard hit by the virus, but they're stepping up to volunteer to donate whatever they could find and in the meanwhile and businesspeople who was in touch with our off - with the congresswoman's office -, to see whatever means that they could bring more masks into the country, we're not only lacking our hospitals, not only lacking n95, even regular, surgical masks, there's a big black for a tube from and a mask aside the congresswoman. Needless every part, everyone probably knows the House and the Senate are in negotiation on the to get the deal passed on coronavirus, a package. The reason why the Democrats voted down we were against the previous version proposed by the Republicans. Is it doesn't take care of the middle class and the working class enough and that the house is working on a more fair version. They will ally. They will reveal soon more a more fair version - to bring to the Americans and office all right, I, don't think, there's anybody on from carolyn maloney office. If so, you can use the raised hands function so we're going to skip to Shivani hi. Can you hear me okay, so, first of all I'm, the biggest thing is that you lean introduced the legislation for a 90-day rent freeze. She is also releasing tomorrow a amendment to the bill which works to better protect small landlords and small businesses in Chinatown. So people look out for that. Additionally, she has been active in sending governor Cuomo letters. The first one is for to provide at-home testing kits. This would really lessen the risk to health care workers, as well as the people taking the test if they were immunocompromised or had other health risks that wouldn't be safe to like be going into a hospital, or something like that. She also sent a letter to Governor Cuomo, asking for priority testing for 911 survivors and responders, often times 911 responders, have lung disease or respiratory illnesses that are a pre-existing condition when considering kovin 19. So that is really key, as well as removing the waitlist time for 911 health care programs, which would ensure that everybody is has the insurance, but before they get hit with the crisis, hopefully they don't, but if they do, she also sent a letter to the Nitra CEO on cleaning protocols. Nature has been sending out updates on their cleaning protocols and how that's changing in the face of Copan 19, but the residents still haven't really seen it. So we are continuing to push for that and ensuring that nature residents are clean and disinfected so that the virus does not spread easily there. That was really quick, but I think that was our basic update. Also, oh sorry, one more thing: we have been sending out a daily newsletter which compiles information from the governor's office from the mayor's office. Anything else that's relevant. It can be like very exhausting and time-consuming to try to follow, along with every single thing going on the ball moving so fast. So we we've been sending out those newsletters I will put my email and like the chat on the side here, and if anyone wants to subscribe, who hasn't subscribed, you can shoot me an email and I will make sure that you are on that list all right. Thanks Shivani, we actually have a couple of questions. First, one: okay, Jackie Wong! Thank you! So much for the update I'm, just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on the protections for the there's more properties owners in Chinatown. Was that about? Can you share a little bit more information on that at this moment? I can actually because her amendment is coming out tomorrow and so once that is fully finalized and public, then we definitely can but I'm. So sorry, at this moment, that's the only information I have okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Mei. Do you want to ask your question? Oh yes, so my question was regarding the assistance bill that was passed. That's the house, but there was some immigrant groups that were excluded from it and I think there had been a letter about it sent out to. We include them back. So are you aware of that? Or are you aware of that? Make sure that question is for you lingsha she's, still on the call and she's unmuted? So, okay, you might not have been listening closely, though so many I would suggest. Why? Don't you reach out to them privately with an e-mail or something all right, thanks Lani, so we are now going to move on to Marian from councilmember Kim's office. Everybody marryin here hope, you're, all safe and well so sorry that councilmember ton cannot make it I think once we all is in office get zoomed together. She will be part of future meetings, so taking a little time, but our office is still open. Both our legislative and district office lines, the can be routed to a living person. So our 2 +, 2 7 88 number and our 2 + 2, 5 8 7 number are still are so active. Margot is continuing to aggressively promote social distancing in social isolation and we are discouraging people from seeking testing or visiting the ER. So it's not to overload the healthcare system unless you have serious symptoms or over 50 years old and I know that a lot of the offices have been sharing agency updates. We've also been trying to do our best to compile agency updates on our newsletter and our website, but from our and I just want to make sure that you all get the latest on the senior services front, with Margaret being chair of the Committee on Aging. So over the last few weeks, we've been getting questions and concerns from providers on the ground. You know these are the folks who are interacting every single day with the most high-risk populations to kovat, but many of them are in desperate shortage of supplies, hand, sanitizers, PPE, gloves and even to-go boxes, since all the senior centers are now being asked to provide to go meals to all seniors who come in every single day. So last week, Margaret sent a letter to the mayor and the Department for the aging to provide emergency supplies in PVE to these folks reimburse them, because a lot of them are dipping into their own already very scarce budgets, - to make amends and also not penalize service providers if they don't meet contract deliverables. I know that last week the mayor's office of contract services sent a system-wide letter to all providers about their leniency on meeting any deliverables utilization rates, as well as a commitment to provide reimbursement and I'm happy to share that letter with anybody here who is working very closely with a CBO that is concerned so senior centers. We all know that they're close to all programs, except for food, pickup and delivery seniors, can pick up any meals at this time at any Senior Center, that's closest to them shout out to the borough president, who compiled a really handy Manhattan list of all Senior Center locations and their current hours and as the borough president alluded to earlier, difft adjust piloted a new program to assists to centralize their meal deliveries. I think this is something that they want to transition towards, just to make it easier, more efficient and safer for seniors to get access to their food. So this is just a pilot right now, with only a few centers in each borough that are opted in who have that kind of capacity who had the refrigerators to keep the food, for example, and the man's I know that Bronx as a borough started yesterday, Manhattan this today and all of the other boroughs are going to be piloted tomorrow. So we are right now trying to get more information on how that's going. You know whether seniors can be enrolled, as the borough president mentioned right now. It's focused on the seniors, who are currently clients at these senior centers. We're also curious about whether or not there's going to be protocol for safe delivery and residential buildings. We've also had a few seniors in senior buildings asked for that sort of four ask for that guidance, and some of them are not even comfortable with going down. The stairs are going down the elevator to pick up their food, so we're asking for clear-cut guidance from dibs on that, and if you can do it no contact, then we certainly should, but just to clarify grab-and-go meals at all senior centers. While this pilot is going on is still continuing. So if seniors are worried, hey I'm, not part of any Senior Center, they can still grab a meal at a Senior Center, that's closest to them so separate from dip this program. We just share that the New York City, Taxi and Limousine Commission is currently recruiting TLC drivers to deliver feed to seniors. So this is different to offset lost revenue from missed trips, and the city will also pay those drivers $15 an hour and reimburse fully for gas tolls and mileage. So it is first, come in first herb, but we are aggressively distributing that opportunity on the small business relief front, we're working with community organizations to get the word out and help businesses apply for the to small business relief programs at SPS. Has the new york city, employee retention, grant program specifically for businesses with four or fewer employees and the new york city's small business continuity loan fund, which is a zero interest loan for businesses who are experiencing a decline in sales of 25 percent and more, but that application is not yet a pre-application to put in your information is online on SBS's website. We're also part of a council wide push to expand financial relief to more kinds of businesses, so as sole proprietors the gig economy workers, the street vendors, who normally do not qualify for a lot of these programs, we are continuing to urge the mayor to announce more relief programs to fit them and just lastly, in putting my budget director hat on the budget cycle is still ongoing. Deadlines I remain. The only change right now is in light of circumstances. We've gotten any word from OMB that the deadline for non city capital applications for council members specifically has been delayed. It was originally March 24th today, but now it will be April 1st at 5 p.m. sadly the burb has even said. Lane has already passed, but if there are any non city organizations nonprofits that are interested in getting funding from City Council, the deadline is now April 1st at 5:00 p.m. but that is the last deadline. You know we've been hearing where that pegs may be part of the conversation coming down for fiscal year, 21 negotiations which we're really worried by so these are programs to eliminate Greg gap procedures. Basically, you know equivalent to potential cuts to agencies, so we are keeping an eye out on that Margaret as part of the budget. Negotiating team will be fighting against that I think what all these providers need right now is just reassurance that they will be made whole and you more than that cash advances and commitments that you know, contracts that they were promised for fiscal year, twenty or even fiscal year. Twenty, not twenty from nineteen, that funding will be dispersed to them as soon as possible. Thank You Marion. We have a couple of questions for you, the first one's going to be coming from Diaz, hey, hi, Marion I wanted to ask about the pilot program again. If you could peep goofy about that program, is it's essential eyes our locations for all senior centers receiving news, or is it too centralized senior centers? So it's a logon or senior supplying, so the pilot program is separate from the grab-and-go meals program. That gift is currently mandating. All providers to do its we've only gotten just really rudimentary information from distich, because they're just starting this week, it was only a few centers that have opted in that Divya has determined, has a capacity to do Coombs delivery. So if you were not part of I, know Joss as part of it in the Bronx we're trying to get a full list of the senior centers that are doing this. So we'll share that list with you right now. There aren't any plans to expand that program even more, because I think we're just waiting to see how it goes so, we'll let you know how it goes for me up: Thank You. Our next question is coming from students. That's it okay! Thank you. Did you say the pegs are for the current fiscal year fiscal year, twenty one little beer is a possibility. So not current fiscal year. Okay, and should we assume the community boards are going to be included in that I think just right now, they're whisperings and you know once we get more of a clear idea right now, all of the budget hearings I think if there was any you know, clear-cut plan being articulated by the administration, we'd be hearing a we're hearing them at the budget hearings, but I think we're just taking this one day at a time once we get more information, we'll definitely keep you up to date. Thank you all right, Thank, You, Marion appreciate it all right. So that concludes our reports from the elected officials. A long one I am going to read now another piece of public testimony that had come in that was not forwarded to me prior to reading the other two. So I just want you to give this third person their fair shot. So this public testimony comes from Tommy Loeb and it says on November 12th councilmember Rivera, along with mayor de Blasio, announced an agreement on a wide range of issues regarding the Eastside coastal resiliency project, including interim storm protection. It is now four months since this agreement was reached from the release from the released New, York City. Emergency management and coordination with the mayor's office of resiliency will conduct further feasibility evaluation to understand whether there is potential for interim flood protection measures along the project area. The results of the analysis will be shared with the community. That was a quote from the press release. The community has seen no evidence that such a study is actually taking place. I hope they are not proceeding with conclusions without input from local from the local community who actually experienced Sandy and witnessed the destruction we have local knowledge. That would be critical to such a study. I would like to remind you that the outside expert consultant hired by borough president Brewer and councilmember Rivera, recommended interim flood protection and his final report. It is up to community board three to make the city and our local elected officials live up to this commitment and hold a public session where they update their work and get input from the local community. Thank you for your attention to this matter. So again, that was another piece of public testimony that should have been read earlier this evening, but came in a little bit late to me. I will copy and paste that in the comments as well as we proceeding to rope halt, so I am going to unmute everybody right now. You have the ability, you should have the ability to mute and unmute yourselves once they do that. So, if you don't need to say control Paul, you can just yourself.

I was I. Think I actually had muted myself twice because I unmuted on the screen. But I'm here got you okay, Kathleen Webster, yeah yep and got you and then Jackie Wong here. Oh all right! Thank you Eric! So I am going to stay on running the technical side of the meeting, but I'm passing me moderating the meeting off to Alicia. Now, oh okay, Wow, it's been a very long first part of the meeting. We are we're already two hours in right, but thank you all for coming out tonight and online as we are getting used to this new technical type of communication for our board and I just want to just give a quick personal thanks to Susan and the office staff and Clint and Michael. They have really been stepping up and really helping out a lot with the technical stuff learning how to do zoom. That was very interesting. So it's a whole new way of communication really quickly. Just thank you all for doing your part for staying indoors. During these times these uncertain times did we're. Dealing with I would like to encourage you all to take care of yourselves and take care of the elders. Many of them are home alone, and many of them are shut-in and are not really knowing what to do and don't really have family around them. As for the most part, no one can really go to their apartments, but we can all stay in contact if you have an email or if you have a phone number of a neighbor, and you could still knock on the door and just say I'm just checking in on you. That's all you have to say you don't have to. You know still stay there for a long period of time, because they don't want us going into close proximity of people also if there are any single mothers or single fathers that are struggling with having their children home all day long. This is a hardship for many people, they're not able to go out and get food to get groceries and also those food boots. Those meals that they're offering any adult can go and get those meals and bring them to a family in need. If you know someone that can't get out, you could definitely do that. You don't even have to give the family's name to just say I'm picking up or a child or two so be mindful of that. Please check on the community board website on a regular basis, check their emails, I'm thinking that maybe we have a few board members that did not know how to get on zoom' or don't have technical savvy in order to do this, so maybe we can check in with those people that didn't get on I know, maybe one person or two people can have access to you know this type of technology, just maybe were unavailable. I have assigned Clint to be our tech care, as they say, he's going to be dealing with all of his technical stuff and he'll assign one or two other people to help him out as he leads them so be mindful of that. If Clint asks you to help him, please step up and help him where he's going to need some support. Hmm, let's see also just wanted to let everyone know if you have any other families that are leader food on the weekend on Saturday there's a church on East 11th Street, the Father's heart ministry, they're still providing breakfast to go and they're having meal bags for people that are in need, or if they're there, just someone that you know a family that may need something extra for extra mouths that they're having to feed in their homes, because the kids are needy are normally at school during the daytime, so they're not used to having to feed them three meals per day. So that's it for me. As far as that report now we're going to ask season four, her district managers report. Okay, thank you. The office is the is totally closed starting this week, then all the staff is working from home, but I want to ask if you want to leave a phone message, please leave it on the office phone because that is sent to our email, so we'll get it by email. Please don't leave it on well for me for my personal phone, because the email is just easier, we're still trying to prioritize issues as they come up. We're still learning a lot, we're making contact with all the agency liaison so that we can continue working with them. They are all everyone we're working with is also working at home. Do tea seems to be kind of most on the ball, as has already started, regular check-ins just want to mention the census. A couple of people have brought it up. Everybody should have completed their census form by now. If you haven't the link to submit the form is on the community board website, you do not need a letter, you don't need a coat. The only thing you need is the link in your social security number. It's going to be more important than ever with the budget cuts we're all going to be seeing I've had one nonprofit tell me they're expecting a probably 25% cups next year, so the census, funding and representation is incredibly important. All permits is I'm going to just give you some agency updates. All permits have been suspended. There are no composting drop-off sites, those are all closed. All traffic studies are suspended because there's no traffic playgrounds parks asked me to make sure everyone knows. The playgrounds are not sterilized. So when you use the playground should be wearing gloves and just be aware to you know, to use sanitizer and soap when you get home, social distancing is required on the playgrounds. It's not happening. I just saw this afternoon. People are playing team sports, which is not allowed rec. Centers are closed. All publicly out of the rings are canceled most kind of surprised. It was a concert in Tompkins, Square Park on the weekend, I don't know of a Saturday or Sunday one of the blogs picked it up. This is the reason the police are now being asked to break up groups. Community gardens are open only to members and not to the public and at the discretion as far as being open to their members. That is the discretion of each garden. But tomorrow the district managers are having of zoo meeting with the state open. Meeting law. Director and assistant director is set up by Brad holmen's office in Gale. Brewer's office, that's very needed so I'm sure we'll be getting a lot of information from that. We have two projects that are still in the works of very much affects our board. Our two parks projects, atop and square one and the Brooklyn Bridge, examine I, forget the new name, but the waterfront project will need resolutions from community board so that they won't be delayed. I also want to mention you know. In the office. We had a lot of learning to do in how to use how access city websites there's generally interagency websites so that we can use them as tools and even for our timesheets and I want to just give a shout out to Information Technology, because no one ever hears their talks about. Do it one of the people we work there at calls Saint Joe, because they say he's the most important man in my life, so I just want to be sure to think do it in their staff for helping us be able to continue to do our work and that's it unless their question I have a question for may Susan. You had mentioned that this is about the census. You had mentioned the social security number mm-hmm, you don't need a social and you shouldn't give your social security number for the census, but I you're supposed to get a letter, but I think that if you don't have the letter, you know the letter has a pin. But if you don't have the letter with the pin, there's a number, you can call to get a pin or you could. But you need a pin. You don't need a pin because I never I didn't use a pan aye. I I submitted it the first day. I just went online and that's because I didn't have a pin is probably why they asked me for my social security number, but I did I, did it without a pin? So if you have a pin, that's fine, you want to call and get one, but it shouldn't stop anybody from filling it out, because you can just use the website. That's enter the link on our website, which is what I did. Okay, just because there were. Some stories are not here in our area about scams where people were calling people asking them to answer the census and asking proactively asking for their social security number. So people should be aware of that right, so it would be. You know, certainly don't give it to anybody that calls you yeah all right. Thank you may at least you're up. Okay, any other questions from anyone. I'm sorry bear with me: I have terrible lighting in my mat. Okay. So now we're going to go into the executive report. So we had this resolution for the epic immediate economic help for small businesses. Did everyone get an opportunity to read? It was sent to me by clenched, so if I don't need to read it, I don't want to have to read it, but if I need to read it, I will as a bunch of yeses in the comments. I can also share my screen and bring it up on the screen. If you want me to oh, that's awesome, thank you! Mike there you go, you should be able to see it now, okay, so all the members of the public that are online and the elected officials. You should also be able to see it, but I guess I'll just go ahead and read it for the sake of those that didn't get a chance to look it over. So the executive committee to approve a bequest for immediate economic health of small business, both title committee board three requests for immediate economic help: small businesses, whereas New York City, is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen and in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of the cold. Add 19 virus, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, whereas required aid and support programs for countless small businesses and employees will be substantial, whereas all levels of government must work collaboratively to provide needed. Economic relief and immediate in the immediate, near and long-term, therefore be resolved community board for the recommends the following actions: to provide immediately for all small businesses affected by the Covid-19 19 crisis, suspension or forgiveness of all funds and associated payment for a period of six months, and make sure that there is no admission of health culpability. Is that Trappist I don't know? Maybe he thinking? Okay, automatic nah, no feed renewal of all city and state operating permits and businesses filing for this period of six months, suspension of state sales tax filings for a period of three months, suspension of commercial rent taxes for a period of three months. Immediate expansion of na no interest loan program provided by the city and increase of the loan amount up to I thought we change that amount to two hundred and fifty thousand okay further, be it resolved community board three request: the city Department of Finance analyzed appropriate property tax relief measures for a period of one year. That will allow small merchants to do splint and operating for us, while also allowing small property owners to stabilize their buildings in countries further be resolved. Community for three request: the state, the Department of Financial Services, ensure the businesses interruption related to the public health emergency. He considered and coverage event for insurance purposes. Further viet resolve community for three requests: funding for economic and community development organizations. He strengthened and maintained to ensure support services for small merchants and continuation of community-based efforts that will prepare they sustained republic. Okay. So I'm gonna stop sharing my screen, so I can manage the hands that have been raised. First, one is Olympia hallelujah, so I have two amendments, one that is simple and I have already typed it, and it comes out of the recommendations that I said earlier with you that a lot of the community development organizations that deal with small businesses have said- and that is you- can read it in the chat. I said it: it's expanding the grants that are currently up to four people to up to ten people, because most small businesses, they have part-time, several employees or up to ten they're, still very slow, small and the second amendment that I want to offer. It should I give them both together for a facility, or what do you want me to do? I'm, okay, with that First Amendment, so I should go ahead and tell you. What is my second idea? Well, why don't we do this? Why don't we have if there's anyone opposed David I know you have your hand up. Is this about processed? You want me to unmute, you I, wonder: yeah I can understand it's not about the process. It's about the amendment, okay, about what right. Why are? Why do we want to be so specific and I'm gonna pose this to Macon, because I oppose putting any limitation on it, such as up to 10 employees? Let them figure that out. It would be my position but Meghan. You thought this was fine. I can add. If you want I'd rather hear bacon, can you guys hear me? Okay, yeah I mean I you're, asking why I'm okay, with the limit being ten correct? Well, it's better! So what they originally proposed was one to four employees was which is so few businesses, but I heard from the borough president was that even within that group there was over in the first few days there was oh they're over 400 applications to that. To that particular grant, so raising it up from four to ten employees opens a huge threshold, a way bigger number of businesses. Why not just say raise it? Why say raise it to ten I? Actually, don't know. What's wrong with me originally proposed. Okay, I think I'm not allowed to explain this. Is the problem would be allowed to explain it? I just preferred hearing it for making, but go ahead. I mean usually I. Think in the public meetings, you're not supposed to call one person say. Why do you agree with that? It's not proper conduct, I think well. She is the one who accepted it and if this is to be a friendly amendment, it has to be done without objections she's, the chair of the committee, so it's people are going to defer to her anyway, but Olympia wanna. You make your comment about what the question of the question seems to be: nobody I, don't think anybody disagrees with the fact that it needs to be raised, but why do we need to put a number on it at all? The reason for which we need to put a number is because we don't have infinite funds. I wish we could give grants to everybody right now right, so I think it could be incrementally right now. The problem is that the guidelines in order to apply with these, for these grants are too strict and people don't qualify. They have to jump too many hoops. Some don't even apply and that's a pity, and so we need to raise it first to ten, and if this doesn't work, maybe we can go higher but fundamentally, I. Think if you just lift the cap, it would be possible and you wouldn't be helping the one most lady, you know the most needy ones: okay, Rob and I. See you have your hand up. Also. Is this in relation to what Olympia has already suggested, or is it something different? Yes, it was a question really about. You know I think we have an opportunity, you know about what: how do we define small businesses, and so it's very general and I- don't have an amendment but I wanted to ask that question to the committee. You know yes, wait, one at a time, please. How are we defining a small business because you know, let's the same, is what the Senate the Congress is going through. You know we, you know. As long as you know, somebody comes with 30. Employees might think that they're, a small business so I think if we're talking about our district, our community, maybe we can be more specific. Okay, thank you Robin! So Olympia do you want to answer that question now? Yes, that currently, basically there is the city law that defines what is a small business. However, the small business services administration that gives these loans and gave these grants, they have the discretion to make them available to small businesses that fit to certain categories. So, in this case they're using how many employees you have in other cases, they may use whether we are immigrant or women-owned or whatever, but the definition of a small business exists illegally. There is no discussion at the state level and did the federal there may be slightly different, but they have already established legislation about that. Okay can I talk about this. Yes, please do Megan, I, just I. Think one thing that we have to realize about the these particulars, so one is a grant right and that's to cover 40% of your payroll for small businesses with one to four employees. The other thing that they're offering is a up to seventy five, knowing up to $75,000 no interest loan for four other small businesses, look even larger than that which the application isn't even live. Yet the difference in these two is that the grant money is money that the city already has secured, and it's money that's immediately available like these people that applied for it last week are already getting funds this week to retain their employees and I agree with Olympia, like that's it's a very limited fund. If we I mean I would like to say yes, we can open up to businesses that have up to ten employees, but I, don't think the city has the funds for it. They're gonna have to find it and it's something: that's very time-sensitive, so just putting a no threshold on it saying like any businesses, I, don't agree with, but I still think it's kind of a pipe dream, but I'm willing to go up to like I'm, okay, with the amendments to say up to ten employees. Okay, so any other discussion that anybody wants to have on this one particular amendment hearing: none is everyone, okay, with this amendment, if your easiest way to do that is if you're opposed raise your hand if I don't see any hands raised, I'm going to assume everyone's okay with it all right, there are no hands being raised. So this amendment is going to be added to this resolution. Olympia, do you want to say your second Amendment now? Yes, so my second amendment I haven't written as I did the previous run because I just realized it where I lightly say what was reading it? It's, as you know, I work. A lot of small pieces is so great that we did this resolution. However, the people who are hurting most right now in our neighborhood are the gig workers and for them, what will make a huge difference is either because a lot of them are 1099 independent contractors. I did the expansion of unemployment benefits to them, or the other thing that will make a huge difference is the rent suspension bill, because that janet is introduced yesterday, a new Lane introduced today, because fundamentally, if they don't have the money to pay on April 1st, they would be liable to eviction in 90 days and, yes, god, if they are rent stabilized, if they have it and history of organizing and that landlord dislikes them they're, gonna sure for sure evict them. So we need I think to add one sentence towards the end of this resolution and say you know the smallest proximal businesses are, of course, independent contractors, et cetera, and for that community board. Three believes that rent suspension as long as the murder victim returns last thing should also be enacted, or something like that. I can work on language when I focus later, but I wanted to raise it because before we vote on it I don't know I mean. Should we discuss that further, because I'm feeling like that, might need to be a separate I, don't know what does everyone think leer soap? Is the amendment intended to refer to residential rent of independent contractors not to not to commercial rents? If that's the case, I do feel like it doesn't really fit in this resolution that maybe we need to do something separately about independent contractors and they're very unique issues, but I, don't think it really fits here. So the businesses also wanted the reason for which I brought it up here is because, in the advocacy level, independent contractors they say that 1099s are also businesses right, but they work in a different way. My concern is I'm happy for us to have a separate, a separate thing for the independent contractors. However, there is the urgency of the fact that the Senate needs to vote on it within the next few day, so it should need to pass today. Is there a procedure by which we can introduce a new razor now and accept it, or should we just go with that narrative in which we talk about that independent contractors as the smallest businesses of all who are now at zero income? And thus they cannot, you know they cannot provide for anything many of them, unfortunately, not all of them. Thank you. Well, Olympia. We don't do resolutions like introduce new resolutions at full board, not that I know of but again I think that this should be something separate, because tonight we're just dealing with the small business. So, let's just still with the small business. That means we're not gonna ever deal with this right, because it's Olympia I didn't say we were never going to deal with it, but I'm saying that right now we're dealing with what's going on hands the one the one being presented to us tonight that came before us tonight, okay, I didn't say that we weren't gonna deal with it Alistair did you still have a comment you wanted to make yes I know. I was just responding to Olympia's comment and I. Think that's! You know. That's a fine idea for people that have problems. You don't have to pay the rents. The only issue I, don't know what the outcomes gonna be, but when next one comes in just from a management perspective, Milano landlords perspective, we have no idea what income is going to come in and from that income. What expenses we will be able to pay. So if there is a further resolution down the road or I would just ask that if there is a relief rent that there is some type of relief on the real estate taxes on a landlord side, for example, which has already been mentioned here, so that can kind of offset, and then landlords can continue to pay for the essential services, the buildings and for attendance and be able to take care of everybody as best we can. That's all. Thank you, Thank You Alastair. We have Jackie Wong now and I also don't think the contract issue of fitting resolutions that we are discussing tonight and also since Union news office representative, mentioned a little bit earlier that there going to be some amendments about the view so I, actually don't I, feel like I, don't know enough about how this rent freeze and also how that would have fat at the Leno's. So, like Robin talked a little bit earlier, this is going to be a domino effect how the Lando's are going to pay their mortgage in and so I think I would want to wait until the whole bill comes out to talk about like how do we help them like different groups of people? That's what happened. Thank you. I'm gonna go to my capper list next I'm wondering if we could just discuss rent suspension bill at the next Housing Committee and then bring it to the full board. Next month seems like it's. What we need to do. I'm, not I, know that we have limited meetings coming up next month because the genders have already to be put together, but let's continue the conversation with Olympia. Hey so I mean I already put in the chat, the fact that the for the landlords and the single families, what do we call them homeowners? There has already been a 90 days moratorium on mortgage payments right, so you knew that this is. This is the there is the it has been announced from all the banks, and so you move in your head. I can send you the information, but my concern here is my understanding and if there is anybody who knows better than me, the state I'm more familiar with City Council, but the state the session is ending in six days and if we have any representatives so this legislation that has been introduced by January annually new, even if there's gonna, be amendments, they're gonna be done like within the next four or five days so I mean, of course we can discuss it. Theoretically, whenever you want. But fundamentally we do want to help these people right now. We should find a proper way of either doing a separate, reso or creating a bubble there, but if there is no, if others feel that this is not as urgent and important I mean, of course, I can to democracy I'm happy to withdraw this suggestion. All right, let's go on to our next hand, raised from Robin yeah as an independent contractor. I think that this should be a resolution discussed at a community level because I think to add it in as a as a line item in this resolution to me doesn't give us a importance that it needs to so III think it needs to be discussed. The housing meeting, or maybe that it could be economic I- could want to get a part of the cultural arts and cultural committee. Also, so I don't think it's just. This I think we're not yeah. That's right, Thank, You, Robin, so Olympia hearing all this discussion. Do you want you withdraw or do you want us to vote on it hold on you're, muted, Olympia I was wondering. Basically you didn't mean them. You didn't mean so I was gonna say my thing is I. Would like as much you know, conversation to be happening about this horrible problem that people are gonna be facing in six days from now, and so, if you think that's supporting it and being voted down, it gives it some air, let's vote on it, but fundamentally I. Just I really believe this is this is this is tragic, I mean among all the tragedies. This is also more tragic, I'm trying to figure out the zoom thing here, hang on so I thought. What could be helpful to the conversation is to know that there are major efforts happening all around the city, including housing, justice for all, which is asking for not only a red freeze but red forgiveness and so I think, there's a few things to be noted here. I think everyone, that's gonna, be hurting, including the landlords and landlords like NYCHA. If they were red forgiveness, one to two months of not receiving rent for an institution like Nitra could be devastating, so I just wanted to add for folks to think about. Whatever position we're gonna take be that we're gonna, you know, add on an amendment to this resolution or compose a second resolution. I think what we have to be calling for also is for relief to be given to all those institutions, because, as you will believe, one and two see another one hurts, and so what we need to be doing is asking both the state and the federal government to make sure that, in whatever relief packages come to New York moving forward- and maybe this is a pipe dream- maybe it's not that there be additional resources that are there targeted specifically for things I rent, because you know you can ask for you could give somebody, you know a rent freeze, but if they lost their job, that doesn't mean they're not going to face eviction later on and equally, you know if the landlord is not receiving any rent, how do they pay for operations? And so that goes not only for smaller landlords but bigger ones like NYCHA, so I don't think we could be just calling for these things. I think we have to be responsible and our call for this and say all around. We need a freakin bailout. Thank you, I want to say thank you very much. Thank you, I'm suggesting to add language or two. What are you suggesting? I didn't understand, suggesting that we're not doing this right now, because we have this resolution on the table and we need to deal with this particular resolution and for the sake of time it is already 9:30 and I think that a bunch of people did not intend on being on this zone for more than a couple of hours. So we need to just be mindful of that and I do agree that damaris there's going to be so many other situations that are going to pop up one at a time so and I do respect what you're saying Olympia I'm, not disregarding anything that you're saying I'm just saying as of right now tonight we cannot vote on AB during the resolution tonight. Okay, yeah but I. Think David. Crane can correct me if I'm wrong I think that, because she has suggested an amendment, we need to vote on it. One way or the other in order to move on so I'm withdrawing it you're, the driver is going to help all right all right. So the amendments withdrawn, thank you, but only the second one, not the first yeah the first one has already passed so moving on. I am going to make from the amendment as well to the last bullet point where it says increasing of the loan amount to 150,000, as Alicia mentioned. That was indeed supposed to be 250,000. So I would like to make that amendment, so that amount is increased to 250,000. So any discussion on that by anyone all right that doesn't seem to be any. There is a feature Thank You Dominic for reminding me about it in the just above the chat window. There's a yes/no feature, so we're going to use that to vote for this amendment. So if you are for the amendment of increasing the amount, 250,000 click, yes, if you're against it click no go ahead and do this. But in for other things where you really believe it's a friendly amendment, you can just ask if there is an objection. Okay, like you, did that with my hands earlier, I just may be interesting to see if we can actually count 50 votes this way. Officially, it's 19 to 1 22 to 1 keep people what, if you don't feel qualified or a Dominic, suggested raising your hand to abstain, Dominic's full of good suggestions tonight, all right, so we have one abstention and 27 yeses currently and no nose family, whoever loaded, no change too much so I believe we can say that has passed David. Are you good with that? I am I'm, reviewing things and I'm just curious on. How are we preventing non-members from voting by this method? I mean I, don't not to do any of this over I'm just pointing this out as a thought. Okay, thank you. So we have. We have a social media policy that we need to vote on tonight as well. Can you pull that up? Michael yeah sure? No, we don't, we don't I, don't think we need to see it so I'm going to give everyone an opportunity if you haven't read it because Edie also emailed this to the members of the board, but there are non members of the board. You guys should be able to read it, and so this is what we're going to vote on tonight and I. Don't know that we do need to do this whole thing, because it is quite lengthy. Yeah I mean I can give everyone a synopsis. So basically we had a policy that was in place already. That was very strict about what we were able to post on our social media with. Basically, what the only thing we were able to post was our calendar of meetings, so this is still sort of very based on that policy, but it opens it up a little bit more to allow us to post other items that are of importance to members of the community. You know we're not going to be promoting events or anything like that unless we're co-sponsoring an event, but it also gives the further guidance on who needs to approve posts before they are able to go on to any of our social media. So both Alicia and the district manager Susan have 24 hour lead time before we post anything to say yea or nay to it. So and I will tell you that we have been using this 24 hour process already and it has been working. There have been a couple of things that we've been told not to post and for the most part everything else has gone through without incident and other than that, the you know, the only other big changes are again opening it up to the types of other types of postings that we can put on Facebook and Twitter. That are that aren't just about our meetings. So you know, as you probably seen if you're following you do one of those platforms. Right now, we've been posting things about the census. We've been posting, some updates about covered 19 resources. You know we've been, we posted some pictures of some of our meetings and things like that. So this just lays out the roles and responsibilities of what we can account outpost, so we're going to move. If there's no me the screen share per second and check because I see that they're ours, but they're around conversation. Okay, so then, we've also had another vote for two to approve a block party for assembly member Epstein and so cd3 approved a block party for assembly member Harvey Epstein. It's gonna be May 9th in 7th Street between having a dlc. Anybody opposed this okay and they'll put it in their boat. The final vote: Michael. Is there anyone at folding it back from the screenshare to show you guys that no there are no hands raised yeah. This I understand this is in May, but I would put a caveat that it was depend on Kovac 19. Oh absolutely I mean that's a given yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Kay, no Heidi. We got the same comment, so you lower your own hand. Yeah I was the same exact comment that may seem a bit: oh okay and lastly, we have the bylaws task force Lisa. Yes, we've heard about this for two months now: I'm hoping it doesn't come as much of a surprise to anyone. It was in your boat sheet, also the track change version of the sections of the current bylaws they're being amended not to really change any provision, but just to make things a little clearer. We I think there's been a general consensus on the part of executive committee that there's were positive changes and I would look forward to a anyone. Have any population around us. Please raise your hand. If you have a comment or question about the bylaws change. There does not seem to be any okay and then last thing. Okay, now we're going to go into the development of committee reports, so economic development, we read the resolution- is there anything else? Maybe we need to say, and the creation just to remind a committee, that we will hear Tompkins Square renovation of the bathroom this month, along with the Brooklyn Bridge lower Manhattan coaster goes into project, with extension, Brooklyn Bridge to Montgomery, Street I, don't know, Susan is still on. Have we confirmed the date on that yeah? No, we haven't I'm still waiting dear from people, okay, so just to remind the park members that we will meet to vote on two resolutions. Hopefully we'll have some information about those resolutions before we get to the meeting and I would also advise all the committee members to I know. This is the first time for many of us using this to practice to read some manuals or our parks meeting, because it will I, don't know how long it's going to take, but I don't want to go too late for two agenda items and that was it okay, helping Human Services, no hello. So we have a resolution for you to vote on. It is on page six of your vote sheet. It is we talked about this before it is a resolution to send the letter to HPD request extension of the school. The land for this at site. Five SS crossing for the new school is because we have new factors and new information. The deadline is 2023, which is coming soon. That's why we need the extension to continue advocating for the new schools. The text of letter is in the resolution and the resolution is to send a letter. Any questions I, don't believe that let me switch back to the other screen. Nope no hands are raised, man, okay, thank you. The question I was surprised that the letter doesn't state that was deliberate, and could you explain that? Can you repeat sure I was surprised to see that the letter doesn't suggest a new date beyond 2023? Maybe you could explain why you decided not to do that. We just want to a request. An extension I think we would talk to them about it. We did not discuss a date. It seems odd to me, but it's fine, if that's the committee's preference, any other questions, multi, no man, okay, SLA, so nothing to report from our two meetings. We had them both in the coming months. We're gonna have a virtual meeting and I'll send out information to my committee members about that. Thank you. One have any questions about these assembly items when you see them by going. Anybody lays in the hey names are in Fortune No awesome, so that all being said man mark didn't transportation. Are there any questions? I was not therapist. I will defer those to Michelle if Michelle's willing to step forward yes being raised great now we're gonna, leave sure I believe you still have a sixth passing subcommittee. It's not on my watch. I'm. Sorry and I'll make this quick, so I this month. Of course, we didn't meet, but I had I gave a bunch of questions to the different members of the task force and had everything compiled and I shared a file with you all. So that has some raw notes. I would normally share a file like that, but I just basically took the email and the responses that we had shared with each other within that are. Some is some information about. What's going on with the commercial spaces in SS Market and around Essex Crossing, so related to tick, Ovid, I think the biggest news, though, if people haven't heard, is that the Grant Street settlements, grandma cafe, unfortunately, is going to be permanently closing at the at the end of the month, which is really too bad, but in the current climate they I think they were having a tough time to begin with, but in the current climate, there's their business model just doesn't make sense so they're, looking at potentially you know it, making it a community resource center and a single stop for people that they have will relocate there. So people can go in and get information on entitlements sign up for benefits, tax prep as well as potentially making it a youth and senior drop-in center. The other thing that isn't really spelled out in the in the document that I shared is around the Community Health Network. They have another project, that's going on in Brooklyn, which they got a really nice tax credit for or sorry that was the big tax credit for that which is going to enable them to reallocate funds so that they can afford to pay for the facility to cover their rent they currently have in for the new rent and their new facility here on the Lower East Side. So from what I understand, everyone is really happy about that and it works out very well for the Community Health Network. So you know I just want to thank everyone, especially Susan, who you know really kept the pressure on, and you know, try to get EDC to be. You know very responsive to you know, helping them out. I think it was definitely one of those things that was, you know, an oversight on our part as we negotiated Essex crossing and spur so I'm, really happy that you know this is that this is worked out. Well, so I think the rest of it is in the is in. There are some follow-ups that, from the last board meeting some questions, such as a question from Michelle about events and marketing and in the space there's responses in there. There's responses about bike racks. So if you're really interested, you know, go ahead and open up the file and peruse the responses. Sorry I was muted in talking with hands raised. First one is Erik Diaz hi Dominick, just a question: I perused through the file, the 12 new construction hires that were done in December. Just following up I know, it's been a question for the community board as far as how many is they were 40 days, hires I'm, not sure if you were able to get some information on that or not yeah I, don't think I can ask them, but I don't think that they are they're tracking local versus outside the community, but I know that sometimes they do now like they're told and they they'll learn that and they may pass on that information, but I can find out if they do know about this next question is from Olivia. So it's not about this ex crossing is about the new business that I raised on the chat and David wrote that there is a specific way in which we could call a meeting if a Covid-19 19 think arises in the next few weeks, and we wish to have a meeting if you want to explain as this David if the executive is not the best way to resolve it, what should we do if there is some issue that we need to support as community board? Are you asking me? I was just throwing out the options that are there that are they're obvious to me. The one is let the exec deal with it, which we, which we actually have language in the bylaws saying emergency. You know whatever irreparable harm those kind of languages, the exec would be the committee that would hear it. That's probably suitable for most things. Then we do have a clause where members could initiate calling a special meeting. I, don't know that there would be something in my mind or kind of say this when we have bylaws task force meetings that I've attended. This is our they've declared martial law option. You know where we might want to object to that right away, I, don't know, but you're talking about more normal things and I'm, not sure if we were to schedule a meeting. This is not me as parliamentarian I believe that if we were to schedule a special meeting right now, it would be not very well attended if we just set up as a meeting that is going to happen for an eventuality, it's not going to be attended. Well, that's a be affirmative, so my suggestion was not for a full board meeting, but basically, since we are really fretting an uncharted territory, unfortunately, the copied, 90 and because daily I speak constantly with various politicians, and they do ask for our support, like it really matters at this time that they can point to public support when they push for certain things. So if there is an easy way in which you think, maybe, for instance, if you think that the XF can act quickly, what we can do is if something like that arises. We sent an email to the chair and asked that sicko means the exact and we can all participate, the ones who can listening in on the exact votes. That's what you suggest. Yeah I'd have to review the bylaws. If the exact votes on something it doesn't it's not the full board that has done that. I think it would be just like every other committee, for instance, we will say well. The Land Use Committee has said this about the Euler, but we're still waiting for the full boards position and it's likely to be in line right. That kind of a yeah I'm, sorry I'd, raise my hand and see it go up so Alip. You said they're asking for our support, but nobody reached out to the board for support. So I, don't I'm, not clear about who is a Sweden for what yes, so I was not referring as to their asking for our support as cb3, but every politician when you're working on the various issues, rent and employment, etc. They ask for public support and what a better way for public support becomes through the form of a community board, etc. So it was nothing that I, because I know how much you care about these issues. I never represent seriously. When I do my work, that's not what I was referring to it all. They are asking for our support, but nobody we work with the elected officials all the time and no one reached out to us and said they want our support, she's speaking about a hypothetical if there were to be something for which they want, doesn't work, I didn't realize we're just talking about a hypothetical, so I think I mean I think to wrap this up so that we can move on. I. Think that, basically, as David was saying you know, we, the exec committee, took on some resolutions on an emergency basis at our exec meeting last week, because committees did not meet because of what was happening with people sheltering at home and not wanting to go out and all the uncertainty that was happening. So there were some resolutions that we did last week that theoretically should have been done by their committees, but they were brought to be exact because of that in a normal situation. The ideal is that the committee does the work on whatever resolution that they're bringing to the full board, so the issue I believe in Libya that you know the second amendment that you wanted to make to that resolution about independent contractors and gig workers. You know I think that is something that needs to go to your committee to come up with the resolution for to bring to the board and if, for some reason the committee doesn't meet this month and I'm, not sure I, don't know the calendar, it's not in front of me, Susan's raising her hand so I'll. Let her tell us what the calendar is, but you know then, and possibly the exec can work on it Susan do you want to clarify two things? I want to mention. First of all, what you I think might have been left out is that you've got to be sure an email, the issue in to get it out in committee. So just you know, I don't want that to drop off. We don't let it! You know, I, didn't understand what you said. Can you repeat please yeah? If you want to get it, you know what Michael said is it should it should go out in committee agenda and I just wanted to add that, in order to do that, you need to send an email to put it on the agenda. You know so that it gets scheduled on the agenda as far as a calendar for this month we don't have one. What we kind of loosely decided is that we would meanings toward the end of the month and deal with it. You know you know it deal with it a little bit later and see what we needed to do and what needed to be what meetings needed to be called so it takes the open meeting law requires one week, so I don't know when the decision will be made. I would actually suggest that maybe the exact might want to consider having some extra meetings this month to kind of consider how to proceed forward. We don't need to decide that tonight. So I think that I think the message is allows the Seder that there might be a need for more meetings than we have currently scheduled, and that's something that we should probably look at so Michael. To summarize, what we decided is that if an issue arises as long as we send an email- and it is publicly on us for one week- then the exact we decide whether there needs to be an exact convening or some specific committee convening to address that right, yeah I mean technically. The issue is that you know somebody emails the office with an issue: we're not gonna schedule the meeting just for that issue. They you know it's a matter of whether or not that issue is going to be brought up at the exact or whether it will be handled at the next committee meeting for the committee that it makes the most sense to handle that issue. You know that the small business resolution that we did last week was done under you know an emergency situation, because land use of our economic development couldn't do it in their meeting that make sense Dave. If you want to add something yeah, just a very tiny clarification about the one we king, the law says that we have to give a one-week public notice of the when and where how to participate in the meeting. The law does not require us to publish an agenda. We always do, and we always will I. Think, though, that on this one thing, then, if you were to find something Olympia, that youth really thought the exact needed to consider- and it was just days before the meeting we could put it on to the you know. You know, you know the board chairs discretion, put it on to the agenda and we would discuss it at the executive meeting and if it was not a full week. That's my thinking about if Alicia and Susan, who has to do with all that are cool, no I. Don't you know, there's I could say I, don't see any reason for that Olympia could send in the email next, you know the next few days and we would have it on the agenda. You know if something comes up at the very last minute. That's another situation, but why not? You know why not just take care of it. Now. Absolutely I am talking about the thing that comes up two days before the meeting. Okay, so that has always been the law and it's just it's never been one cb3, but cv3 and it's I believe policies has not done that. But you know it is an emergency. It's something the exec committee can discuss. Yes, Alicia your night pone is really bad I! Think if you need to hold it closer to now. Okay, can you hear me now? Thank you. Okay, sorry, are we done with discussion? Yeah I, don't with discussion on this, because it is now ten o'clock. Okay, so that all being said, I think that is, are the last comments for our reports for tonight for the vote sheet, and so now we are going to go into our roll call vote. Eric. Are you there, hello? Yes, David, hello, David, Adams, rooster long, you must have dropped out: okay, Iran altman, yes, good night, everyone good night! Yes back! Yes, Dominique bird, yes, Lieberman, yes, except no!
