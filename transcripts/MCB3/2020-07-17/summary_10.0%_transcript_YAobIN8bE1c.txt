One of the things we're probably going to discuss at the August meeting is to Brooklyn Montgomery close to resiliency project, the community that we discussed - the exact last night briefly, but basically the projects along the waterfront and two bridges, or also known as a Brooklyn montgomery coastal resiliency project was a had some issues with funding, but it appears now it's back on track and that construction should start at the end of this month, a community board, along with a number of other neighborhood groups for letters, and we received a response that they were going to continue.
This They are coming to the board in August to talk about the project as we left off at design and we're going to restart that community engagement sometime in August There is a committee member who wants to speak so that, if you want to unmute yourself, we're gonna, give you two minutes to speak, say yeah On behalf of the Lower East Side power partnership, we wrote a letter to council member Brandon and we wrote in support of the Brooklyn Bridge Montgomery Street Coast resiliency project Kaden for the City Council to support the project in every way.
This is one of as I said, 11 sites, but it's certainly one of the ones in again the most dense residential communities- You know they're in Flushing they're on the Upper West Side, there's a large one in Kingsbridge in the Bronx As we all know, our neighborhood has narrow streets right and you may have seen in the early days of the pandemic through perhaps April or May taxi drivers lined up because they wanted to get this work in the morning right and more at this site than at any other So based on community feedback, we instituted a number of new policies that I think have largely eliminated.
Definitely don't want that to happen, and that's its TLC police You know I, think that the program will continue long term because, as we reopen, our seniors are going to be the last people to get back to normal this site.
But that's also a large space for the community and I know that the city is looking for ways to keep kids socially distant, and that is one space that could handle a lot of kids, especially if we're going to be talking about daycare or summer cubes or other things.
In the past few months, That we haven't really provided too much details and we're hoping to give you folks a better understanding of what's going on with the project and I'm with EDC the coastal resiliency unit and the infrastructure division at BCC Here, with a host of my colleagues within the agency and our others, city partner agencies and our consultants from the HM TV Lee ro team, That's, a joint venture that has come on board to help us Shepherd the project through the construction phase for the next several years for the next five years.
That's the facilitator, we'll talk about that, a little bit, and obviously through elected officials and the community board committee members here too happy to discuss that afterwards, too But overall, we've received a lot of questions about the current project status and what the timeline is where the project is so far in the past several months what's been going on, will the Park East, River, Park and all the other parts in cv6 area?
Due to at the request of the community, we were able to defer that to the spring, so we could have that area open and working with a lower Eastside ecology Center later in fall instead of spring, and that's that has that has not been impacted by covert and just because we received questions on that.
The early package is that's what was plans for Springs I got deferred to early fall sometime in September rain and we're coordinating with the city team, with our deputy mayor's office dias and there's a big group behind that to help with relocating the lower Eastside ecology, centers compost yard operations to the new site We can start the project construction after that and, as part of that is another small piece of that is tree.
We'll definitely come back and inform the community here through the community boards media community board meetings through the elected officials, offices and the community advisory group, all the avenues that we have Obviously the website and other methods and let everybody know well in advance before construction starts on any area of this project Once there was the perceived issues, the projects with for the project to the contractor.
Two and hasn't been We haven't word that project area One is a couple of steps behind in the procurement phase from project they're here to and that's currently targeted for late fall, and the fourth component of that is the parallel conveyance that includes the sewer and drainage improvements through them throughout the whole project site, which incas the whole project, footprint and community board three and six, and that's the final one that will come after PA, one the timeframe hasn't been determined yet and where we think we're estimating sometime in the late fall to early winter time, While we move along with our sort of behind the scenes, pre-construction activities every time.
It's like peeling, an onion every time that we reach a mini milestone behind the scenes, we'll be able to provide more details on construction timeframe and the specific construction areas for the project, and they also, we might want to remind everybody Back.
We need to have the contractors on board, and one of the very first deliverables by the contractor is for them to propose or issue their projects, get their construction schedule to us, and once we get the construction schedule, we do our review, there's meetings and discussions and from that point we will be able to determine exactly the date for the start of construction Everybody knows before anything happens in the area.
All of that is, although that is always a concern for any residents and any project team, regardless of the location or the project type, and we want to be sure that everybody understands that we are will be following all the regulations and local laws and codes that we have to require, and we want to we'll be sure to provide the information and these plans once there once they're developed to the community, so everybody's aware of what is required from the contractor and what they need to comply with and ongoing.
Regular report updates to the community with our monitoring plans with regards to noise and air quality and our dust control plans with that he's one of our project managers from HM TV on our consultant on the consulting side, So, just briefly going through a few bullets here, as we get ready for construction to start in the fall, the contract is required to submit a site safety plan which would include Co bid, as well as a bunch of other things like noise quality and air quality.
We also have sites project specific specifications in the contract to monitor for noise and air quality, as well as maintain dust control, So we're really the ones overseeing to make sure the contractor doesn't make too much noise create too much dust we'll have plans for each of those from the contracts and finally, and the proper emissions for air quality In. Some cases we need to do work at night because they were closing lanes of the FDR Drive, for example, but we're gonna be monitoring that so as to keep that to a minimum.
Successful projects that have been going on in New York many people have found a news load to be very helpful, so feel free to give us some feedback on that I think That was summarized all the information that would be presented at the CAG meetings or at the community board.
Some individual elements that serve critical functions within the flood protection system, These signs they're also intended to provide information or the independent flow protection components and how the systems function as part of the unified approach to this coastal resiliency project and, like I mentioned the scope, is on a separate design track and will present the conceptual design at one of the upcoming community board meetings right now, our design team, that many of you are familiar with the a krf team and their consultants are working on this and we're hoping to provide a separate presentation at some point within the next few months before we finalize design Looking at the goals for this program, we've identified three general areas where we can maximize opportunities for MWBE firms, section three firms and also local hiring opportunities, and it starts with the program management team with each end to being Lyra JB, which they already brought into the program with over a dozen MWBE firms, including myself and we'll look at where the staffing needs and the supp insulting opportunities might be for the program as it evolved once the general contracting teams are in place.
The goal here is to so we've been assessing available commercial spaces in the project area, so the space the center could be used as a hub for project information and for in-person community engagements Our goal is to have a staff by at least two locally hired administrative folks and the CCS will be available there in person either by appointment or through a rotating schedule, also wanted to mention that privately before I forgot, the CCS will be based on the project sites.
We were hoping to reach out to the schools and partner with the local schools for field trips and use this space as an educational center, with exhibits and posters screens and whatnot and, after all said and done, and set up develop some sort of a system that we can offer this space back to the community Corvo, no, obviously for any monthly membership meetings or community meetings that the community organizations might need and will hostel figure taxes amount to the sort of criteria for finding this space was to look in an area that's halfway centrally located halfway between Community Board, six and community board three to be fair to all the residents and this project stretch and we landed on Alphabet City area, We narrowed it down to a few options and got a lot of good feedback from partners and the elected officials.
The community boards We kept assessing the vision and the use of this space and with the current Cobras in person, researchers that we all have and the unknown ahead of us and for the foreseeable future We may not be able to open this space before construction, and we may delay it until we have a better idea of how the next few months of this Covid-19 time is going to unfold So to make up for that.
This point the canopy itself we're hoping to secure funding for this canopy very soon, which will be finalized and installed on a separate project, not necessarily holding up the amphitheater design, and we have those funding that funding available will reach back out to the amphitheater working group and Trevor Our committee board.
We're gonna spend a very short time on a Q&A portion because we really wanted to bring DBC back to the committee So I'm gonna start with committee members First, I just have one question: If you know anything about you know we're hearing the East, River, compost, facility, reconstruction and wetland construction is canceled and anything you can say about that So I know that there were a number of questions about the law, reset, ecology, Center Now. There are a number of new people on this call.
Think I recognize most of the folks here from many years of community 3 and eser meetings on the Laurie side, ecology, center I think there are actually a couple issues, but I'll answer the compost, one first So, as you mentioned, part of the early, the package work will be the relocation of a compost facility.
So I think one of the things that the city has been pretty committed to all along and that we continue to be committed to is ensuring that the compost operations can continue during esker construction So we are making progress on the site, preparation for the alternative location for the composting and we're also making progress on preparing Seward Park house, which will be the alternative location for Laurie sod, ecologies educational programming during the esker construction, I Think, one of the questions or inquiries that we've gotten from the community board previously, as well as Laurie, said, ecology Center has been about the ability for the compost facility to remain at its current site for as long as possible or until we actually need to put the flood protection in.
There is just the sheer complexity of a project of this scale and so having an active compost operations within a large scale, and so I think one of the things that we want to make sure people understand It's, just how much is going on in that area, around the compost yard, and so many of you folks may be familiar with it You know if we're thinking from south to north the entrance for the construction vehicles for this project, a lot of them they'll all be coming from Montgomery Street, which is the only particular access, and so when we think about Montgomery Street, there is the pier 42 site, which is just south of the existing complex art.
It would be really great since you can't open a community center to have some kind of you know this video set up that we can actually see they couldn't see the construction as it as its unfolding, but I guess We have our own construction site safety and qa/qc team within the agency Lehrer, who are very well experienced in this area, Speaking from my personal experience with articles and my little research, but it seems, like some other contractors had to slow down their schedule because of incorporating the six feet or other guidelines that they have so right.
Quite a few people I know have just been laid off right now, I totally understand and that's a little over my out of my purview We just have to wait to see how the next few months are going to unfold and how Council and the mayor are able to navigate through these times, and this is one of those items that on it, just happened to be on this track that we just have to wait for it and I'm sorry, but we have to wait to see how we can secure funding for this Can I just ask one thing:: we are you looking for the funding, because that's how we would advocate city, state or federal Definitely contact!
Okay phase one and phase two and open during each phase, and also there was talk of the third phase, which is the parallel conveyance system, which was referred to as phase 3 That information got it to the community, I think those maps we just pulled out during the call for conversation to use as a reference Those maps are not ready to be shared publicly because again, these are phase construction maps that are correlated to the timeline and until the timeline is not verified and discussed with the contractor, we can't commit to that No, not construction for the whole project site.
So with our engineering team we and the mayor's office a resiliency in City Hall we've gone through a planning process that started last year and we were wrapping up right around the time of coal bed You know we were asked to look at the Eastside coastal resiliency project area and determine if it would be feasible to design and implement an IFP M project, while those long-term measures are being constructed.
We just asked for this study to be done, so we could take a look at whether the area could get Internet protection, so this is separate from a lot of the work that's going on in NYCHA for the whole city masasa says val has said also at 82, Rutgers and Lyons in - they have the Hesco barriers and some in some cases they put up jersey, but if we have a coastal storm and we are told to activate, we will come out and fill in the gaps that are left for access at those sites with Tiger dams generally.
I know that some people are just finding out about this, but it just and I could probably speak for a lot of committee members who have too many evenings of meetings of community engagement and for quite some time Maybe we need to do more as a community board, but this project is going through and q This people will walk out their door with their children to go to the park and there will be bulldozers and they won't understand what's happening, and all of you have a civic responsibility to acknowledge that and to know how many lives and heartbroken sorry Jennifer we've, given you giving you your time to speak.
Michael can provide my contact information if you need it and I think you have answered it is that we do have funding for these trees and they will be planted, but when I try to do other things, what I'm running is you're meeting my computer and I'm going to ask for questions from the committee but I'm showing you all my queue: public schools, The fifth of happiness, : Is there anyone from the community?
