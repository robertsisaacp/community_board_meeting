One of the things we're probably going to discuss at the August meeting is to Brooklyn Montgomery close to resiliency project, the community that we discussed- Basically the projects along the waterfront and two bridges, or also known as a Brooklyn.
Montgomery coastal resiliency project was a had some issues with funding, but it appears now it's back on track and that construction should start at the end of this month, a community board, along with a number of other neighborhood groups for letters, and we received a response that they were going to continue.
Just want to provide an update on what's going on at basketball city I know.
Our neighborhood has narrow streets right and you may have seen in the early days of the pandemic through perhaps April or May taxi drivers lined up because they wanted to get this work in the morning right and more at this site than at any other.
I know: We've got the chat on private mode, but I would love to leave my contact info because we've had an issue where sometimes we'll hear from a community member on you, know: You see a problem on the site, I'm right here in the neighborhood.
And I know that the city is looking for ways to keep kids socially distant, and that is one space that could handle a lot of kids, especially if we're going to be talking about daycare or summer cubes or other things.
Let me know about any problems in real time, really pride myself on being a good, neighbor So I had mentioned this at the beginning of the meeting that we really have not heard a lot about the ESC our project since it began, and we were obviously moving along pretty swiftly with this and covered- has changed a lot of things not with not just this meeting.
There will be opportunity to ask questions, but since we have not heard from this team in quite some time, we are really going to limit this to a presentation and some general questions where we can get an understanding of where this project is right.
They are going to give this presentations with presentation which does not include the ESC our project itself, as well as the Emergency Management intern flood protection presentation.
It's been a while considering Covid-19 and the project process in the past few months that we have not really provided too much details, And we're hoping to give you folks, a better understanding of what's going on with the project, and Trevor mentioned, we'll be coming back regularly now from now on, to get more information out there and be able to be available for questions and move on for moving towards the construction.
I'm with EDC the coastal resiliency unit and the infrastructure division at BCC Here, with a host of my colleagues within the agency and our others, city partner agencies and our consultants from the HM TV Lee. Ro team: That's a joint venture that has come on board to help us Shepherd the project through the construction phase for the next several years for the next five years.
We've received a lot of questions about the current project status and what the timeline is where the project is so far in the past several months what's been going, on, will the Park East, River, Park and all the other parts in cv6 area?
They remain open for the summer season to have access to the additional open space, considering the coated restrictions that we all have for dealing with right, now, which the answer is yes Also, will give you an idea or presents a little more details about our outreach and engagement strategies for the next few months, until construction, and also for the next five years of construction phase and after I'm done, our colleagues at the emergency management will be presenting their interim flood protection.
We still need some time to understand the overall impacts of Covid-19 on the city's major construction projects such as this ESC, our project, to be able to figure out what that really means for our project.
Due to at the request of the community, we were able to defer that to the spring, so we could have that area open and working with a lower Eastside ecology Center later in fall instead of spring, and that's that has that has not been impacted by Covid-19 and just because we received questions on that.
A number of trees are currently being assessment identified to be transplanted into the community from the East River Park into the community, and we'll be able to provide more details about that to project area to is essentially Cv6 community Board, six area of the northern piece of the project.
There's a lot of legwork, a lot of mobilization, a lot of coordination that has to happen before we actually start construction, And, that's a collective decision with DBC and our city agencies, our partners and our consulting team, and once we determine that exact time frame for each one of these areas.
Obviously the website and other methods, and let everybody know well in advance before construction starts on any area of this project.
Just yet, but the overall sort of targeted time frame for project area, 2 and Community Board Six area is early fall and moving on to project area, one which is right behind project area two and has not been.
While, we move along with our sort of behind the scenes, pre- construction activities, every time, it's like peeling, an onion every time that we reach a mini milestone behind the scenes, we'll be able to provide more details on construction timeframe and the specific construction areas for the project, and they also.
In December and January, we presented general construction phasing diagram to both community boards and residents in the area that was prepared by our consultant team.
We need to have the contractors on board, and one of the very first deliverables by the contractor is for them to propose or issue their projects, get their construction schedule to us, and once we get the construction schedule, we do our review, there's meetings and discussions, and from that point we will be able to determine exactly the date for the start of construction.
My name, is John Lynch with HNTB Lera, we're the program, manager and construction manager for each of the four projects Q just went through so while providing Resident, Engineer and inspection services to oversee the contractors on each of the four contracts.
Just briefly going through a few bullets here, as we get ready for construction to start in the fall, the contract is required to submit a site safety plan which would include Co bid, as well as a bunch of other things like noise quality and air quality.
So covent has really made us rethink and reassess our engagement strategies that we had in mind for to kick off construction prior to fall construction and also during construction, whether it was street fairs or So we're taking a look at our overall strategy and trying to come up with creative ways to still deliver our strategy and tasks that we had in mind without having to sacrifice the quality or sacrifice any of our engagement efforts, so that sort of mentality has worked its way into the following bullet points that I'll talk, about.
Currently, the web site covers the design phase predominantly and we're expanding the website to include additional tabs and dropdowns and sections that we could utilize during construction, we're adding a little more background and history to the project.
Our goal is to roll out our new website and our social media accounts with our first round of social media posts at some point during this summer, in advance of construction, so bear with us we're still coordinating the website, update with our IT departments and the rest of the city team and going through that coordination and step by step, update and we'll be back, and we can give you a demonstration on in one of the upcoming community board meetings.
That many of you are familiar with the a Krf team and their consultants, are working on this and we're hoping to provide a separate presentation at some point within the next few months before we finalize design.
We could also do outreach in those areas promoting local businesses to help you know, staff or supply services and equipment to the construction and the program management, team.
The next bullet point is the community construction liaisons, as we first met of CCOs. This is a project component.
We need to add more CCS, we'll look into that, but for the time being, we're starting with two and we'll definitely be sure to we're bringing on details that are bilingual to be able to communicate with a wider group of residents.
That I've been working with this tool for a number of their past construction projects, and it seems it's been very successful and seems to be a very helpful tool for our project here Essentially, it's a inquiry, management and response management system, and it helps us better, manage and organize questions, concerns and increase that come in.
It has multiple languages that you can choose to translate and as a be able to have the ability to either just open the site and pop in your question or concern and a couple of fields that may it may or may not be required and submit that You can create an account and have that saved under your account and every time you need to access that you can log in and pick up where we left off.
We were hoping to reach out to the schools and partner with the local schools for field trips and use this space as an educational center, with exhibits and posters screens and whatnot and, after all said and done, and set up develop some sort of a system that we can offer this space back to the community, Corvo, no, obviously for any monthly membership meetings or community meetings that the community organizations might need and will hostel figure taxes amount to the sort of criteria for finding this space was to look in an area that's halfway centrally located halfway between Community Board, six and community board three to be fair to all the residents and this project We landed on Alphabet City, area.
We may not be able to open this space before construction, and we may delay it until we have a better idea of how the next few months of this Covid-19 time is going to unfold.
We'll come back again in the next couple months with more details as we move along and the last item I have here is an art program that we would like to roll out to the community for the construction.
However, we've had a number of projects in the past that have been very successful with soliciting a artwork from the community members and the social occasion displayed on these construction.
I. Think I recognize most of the folks here from many years of community 3 and eser meetings on the Laurie side, ecology, center I think there are actually a couple issues, but I'll answer the compost, one first.
The package work will be the relocation of a compost, facility, so I think one of the things that the city has been pretty committed to all along and that we continue to be committed to is ensuring that the compost operations can continue during esker construction.
Center has been about the ability for the compost facility to remain at its current site for as long as possible, or until we actually need to put the flood protection in there.
And I think put the schedule for delivering flood protection, which is definitely the city's priority at risk, So I think one of the things that we want to make sure people understand It's, just how much is going on in that area around the compost, yard, and so many of you folks may be familiar with it.
You know if we're thinking from south to north the entrance for the construction vehicles for this project, a lot of them they'll all be coming from Montgomery Street, which is the only particular access, and so when we think about Montgomery Street, there is the pier 42 site, which is just south of the existing complex art.
We want to make sure that they're there construction vehicles can get in and are an unimpeded way, but also that you know people are safe users of the park pretty shortly after the ser on pier 42.
Or, so our assistant commissioner Sam Peter men, will be reaching out I think we're finally at a point where we're certainly still responding to Covid-19, but as we get more details about what the Seward Park house looks, what the relocations that looks like we can actually start talking about details, so I do not have more than that right now.
We're going to be having conversations with the Loess on ecology, Center and all the thanks for covering that And I just wanted to add to what Aldo said about the construction operations, which is very thorough thanks for that also, the construction phasing plan that we have up on the website and that we presented several months ago over there, this year.
Co Vid, are you putting together a covent plan for the community so that people know what the rules are for the construction, workers?
It would be really great since you can't open a community center to have some kind of you know this video set up that we can actually see they could not see the construction as it as its unfolding, but I guess.
We have to comply with the mayor's restrictions, mayor's guidelines and this and the governor's guidelines, so whether they're on our construction sites or part of this project or not, there's just as a citizen as someone in the area they're required to comply without that all those required requirements, so we'll be sure to include all that in any sort of guideline or documents or requirement sets that we put in place with the contractor, but it would, it will be universal for all of them.
Everyone I would like to ask about what Mr. Lynch was talking about closing lanes during the during the night time and that he said that they are going to be closing lanes and doing nighttime work.
We will, at that point, be able to come back and give you more details why this nighttime work needs to happen.
Getting in You can bring back to the Community Board for safety access, because that was a really seemingly minor thing, but it stood out to me because for my understanding, that really is the only way to go in and out of the park during construction.
You want to type in your questions to the community board, I'm, going to go with the next presentation, I'll see if I can work him in some way, but up now is the internal first.
What I want to do is I'm going to work in you , It's just that we really have a lot of other items, but I will try and work you back in depending on how long the flood protection is I, know you shot through this, but there's still other things.
You know, as we've been working in speaking with the community over the last year.
We were asked to look at the Eastside coastal resiliency project area and determine if it would be feasible to design and implement an IFP M project, while those long- term measures are being constructed.
You know this could be happening during the coastal storm season and we would possibly be not be able to protect during that season and then during a coastal storm activation, the multi block and the site level would likely see very large traffic and pedestrian impacts, and you see some estimated costs at the bottom.
It seems like a very minimal cost, but you have to compare the benefit that you'd be getting for that First thing that we look at and in any site, so this image shows you again: the 15 year return level in blue that a very conceptual line of AI fpm protection would be addressing, and if you can see the sort of green lines, this is again a very preliminary idea of where the engineers thought you might be able to put some AI fpm measures.
You, know capital, construction or any addressing of things like the drainage in a way that is going to be a permanent solution for that NYCHA?
Okay, a quick question about the image that you showed for the Stuyvesant Cove area and the interim flood protection, because the bulk of our water that came during Sandy came straight, down, Avenue, C straight from the East River, and it was like between four to eight to four feet, depending on where you were in the neighborhood.
What I'm really asking, because I think what Carol tried to ask in a certain way is that what we need to understand is that this type of interim flood protection plan really only that goes up to about four feet: any storms over that, even if you're going to deploy them the water's going to overtop the barrier If you have a low- lying area or high area, that's above a certain height This system may or may not work.
I know that some people are just finding out about this, but it just and I could probably speak for a lot of committee members who have too many evenings of meetings of community engagement and for quite some time.
Maybe we need to do more as a community board, but this project is going through and q.
We, really think that everyone knows about this project, because just at the time we invest every single night on Thursday after I can assure you they do not, but we're going to make the community aware, because we do not trust you all right.
I've heard about this since last fall and men talk to residents and everybody thinks this work is being done right now around the night.
Are you going to walk into the park and talk to people who do not come to meetings?
Thank, you, Michael, I, think third, entry presentation or task force We were asked by the Community Board to give a presentation or an update on the tree.
We plan and ask questions and provide suggestions, and this helped us kind of focus in on what the community wants to see.
We would like to get our next meeting on the calendar for early September ahead of the fall planting, so that I can hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive update by then and just You know, if you have any questions about street tree planting or you want to attend the tree.
Have, a map of that I provided our last task force meeting of all the trees that have, and that did so far for this project We can well have it sent to the district office and Thanks, and one day you raise your hand late, but I'm going to give you the opportunity to close us out, because we really got to talk about district needs.
We gathered a lot of feedback based on what types of trees won't want to see, go in and where the community thinks they should go, and we got a lot of feedback that tree canopy should be going in closest to surrounding East River Park.
I do not know if he's on, but did you want to see if the park manager is on the do bridge before it first Are you going to put the district needs on the on the screen?
So it says reopen for community use , You know, there's a action going forward, got it conversation I would suggest we take that whole thing out, because everything's either done or funded or under construction.
We can clean up this and get this as close to completion as we can, and this is for the committee members You know looking at the inequities that have been emphasized by Covid-19 and the need for our communities.
