Things first, that we have a new member 12, allez It requires a lot of work because he has to pay attention to all of what is going on in the chat and who needs to get on and then phones in addition to pay attention.
One of the things we're probably going to discuss at the August meeting is to Brooklyn Montgomery close to resiliency project, the community that we discussed - the exact last night briefly, but basically the projects along the waterfront and two bridges, or also known as a Brooklyn.
Montgomery coastal resiliency project was a had some issues with funding, but it appears now it's back on track and that construction should start at the end of this month, a community board, along with a number of other neighborhood groups for letters, and we received a response that they were going to continue.
Our neighborhood has narrow streets right and you may have seen in the early days of the pandemic through perhaps April or May taxi drivers lined up because they wanted to get this work in the morning right and more at this site than at any other.
I know: We've got the chat on private mode, but I would love to leave my contact info because we've had an issue where sometimes we'll hear from a community member on you, know: You see a problem on the site, I'm right here in the neighborhood.
And I know that the city is looking for ways to keep kids socially distant, and that is one space that could handle a lot of kids, especially if we're going to be talking about daycare or summer cubes or other things.
Let me know about any problems in real time, really pride myself on being a good, neighbor We're gonna move on, and if you could mute that I can hear the background noise Our project, since it began- There, will be opportunity to ask questions.
But since we have not heard from this team in quite some time, we are really going to limit this to a presentation and some general questions where we can get an understanding of where this project is right.
They are going to give this presentations with presentation which does not include the ESC our project itself, as well as the Emergency Management intern flood protection, presentation, I'm gonna, ask -:: are you on?
We haven't really provided too much details and we're hoping to give you folks a better understanding of what's going on with the project, and Amiri I'm, with EDC the coastal resiliency unit and the infrastructure division at BCC Here, with a host of my colleagues within the agency and our others, city partner agencies and our consultants from the HM TV Lee ro.
They remain open for the summer season to have access to the additional open space, considering the coated restrictions that we all have for dealing with right, now, which the answer is yes Also, will give you an idea or presents a little more details about our outreach and engagement strategies for the next few months, until construction, and also for the next five years of construction phase and after I'm done, our colleagues at the emergency management will be presenting their interim flood protection.
We still need some time to understand the overall impacts of kovat on the city's major construction projects such as this ESC, our project, to be able to figure out what that really means for our project.
Due to at the request of the community, we were able to defer that to the spring, so we could have that area open and working with a lower Eastside ecology Center later in fall instead of spring, and that's that has that has not been impacted by covert and just because we received questions on that.
The early package is that's what was plans for Springs I got deferred to early fall sometime in September rain, And, we're coordinating with the city team, with our deputy mayor's office, dias, and There's, a big group behind that to help with relocating the lower Eastside ecology, centers compost yard operations to the new site.
A number of trees are currently being assessment identified to be transplanted into the community from the East River Park into the community, and we'll be able to provide more details about that to project area to is essentially cv6 community board six area of the northern piece of the project.
Obviously the website and other methods and let everybody know well in advance before construction starts on any area of this project.
One is a couple of steps behind in the procurement phase from project they're here to and that's currently targeted for late fall, and the fourth component of that is the parallel conveyance that includes the sewer and drainage improvements through them throughout the whole project, site, which incas the whole project, footprint and community board three and six, and that's the final one that will come after PA, one The timeframe hasn't been determined yet and where we think we're estimating sometime in the late fall to early winter time.
It's like peeling, an onion every time that we reach a mini milestone behind the scenes, we'll be able to provide more details on construction timeframe and the specific construction areas for the project, and they also.
In December and January, we presented general construction phasing diagram to both community boards and residents in the area that was prepared by our consultant team.
We need to have the contractors on board, and one of the very first deliverables by the contractor is for them to propose or issue their projects, get their construction schedule to us, and once we get the construction schedule, we do our review, there's meetings and discussions, and from that point we will be able to determine exactly the date for the start of construction.
Currently, the web site covers the design phase predominantly and we're expanding the website to include additional tabs and dropdowns and sections that we could utilize during construction, we're adding a little more background and history to the project.
Our goal is to roll out our new website and our social media accounts with our first round of social media posts at some point during this summer, in advance of construction, so bear with us we're still coordinating the website, update with our IT departments and the rest of the city team and going through that coordination and step by step, update and we'll be back, and we can give you a demonstration on in one of the upcoming community board meetings.
And, like I mentioned the scope, is on a separate design track and will present the conceptual design at one of the upcoming community board meetings right, now, our design, team.
We would also try to find opportunities once the community engagement is underway and depending on where kovat takes us, we could also do outreach in those areas promoting local businesses to help you know, staff or supply services and equipment to the construction and the program management, team.
We need to add more CCS, we'll look into that, but for the time being, we're starting with two and we'll definitely be sure to we're bringing on details that are bilingual to be able to communicate with a wider group of residents.
That I've been working with this tool for a number of their past construction projects, and it seems it's been very successful and seems to be a very helpful tool for our project here Essentially, it's a inquiry, management and response management system, and it helps us better, manage and organize questions, concerns and increase that come in.
It has multiple languages that you can choose to translate and as a be able to have the ability to either just open the site and pop in your question or concern and a couple of fields that may it may or may not be required and submit that You can create an account and have that saved under your account and every time you need to access that you can log in and pick up where we left off.
We were hoping to reach out to the schools and partner with the local schools for field trips and use this space as an educational center, with exhibits and posters screens and whatnot and, after all said and done, and set up develop some sort of a system that we can offer this space back to the community, Corvo, no, obviously for any monthly membership meetings or community meetings that the community organizations might need and will hostel figure taxes amount to the sort of criteria for finding this space was to look in an area.
We'll come back again in the next couple months with more details as we move along and the last item I have here is an art program that we would like to roll out to the community for the construction.
If, you want to open up for questions- and after me, we have our colleagues from Emergency Management that will talk about the Garbled noise Is the site designed the actual.
I. Think I recognize most of the folks here from many years of community 3 and eser meetings on the Laurie side, ecology, center I think there are actually a couple issues, but I'll answer the compost, one first.
Center has been about the ability for the compost facility to remain at its current site for as long as possible, or until we actually need to put the flood protection in there.
And, so I think one of the things that we want to make sure people understand It's, just how much is going on in that area around the compost, yard, and so many of you folks may be familiar with it.
You know if we're thinking from south to north the entrance for the construction vehicles for this project, a lot of them they'll all be coming from Montgomery Street, which is the only particular access, and so when we think about Montgomery Street, there is the pier 42 site, which is just south of the existing complex art.
As part of the first phase of this site as well- Just, in terms of how much is going to be going on in terms with construction there's also the ferry stop, which the city is committed to keeping open, but that's just another sort of logistical challenge and making sure that people can access that safely.
We want to make sure that they're there construction vehicles can get in and are an unimpeded way, but also that you know people are safe users of the park pretty shortly after the ser on pier 42, the Honorable.
You know that they have some maintenance work happening for the underside of the unit's word for age, and so they will also need to be accessing that portion from Montgomery, Street and We want to make sure that you know you can proceed with all these really important infrastructure.
Are you putting together a covent plan for the community so that people know what the rules are for the construction, workers?
It would be really great, since you can't open a community center to have some kind of you know this video set up that we can actually see they couldn't see the construction as it as its unfolding, but I guess.
We have to comply with the mayor's restrictions, mayor's guidelines and this and the governor's guidelines so whether they're on our construction sites or part of this project or not, there's just as a citizen as someone in the area they're required to comply without that all those required requirements, so we'll be sure to include all that in any sort of guideline or documents or requirement sets that we put in place with the contractor, but it would, it will be universal for all of them.
In terms of noise and the funding just speak to that, because I think people do want to know no Because it was an add-on to the actual design to the actual amphitheater.
They were working group.- Maybe Genet may be November It was back then, but it's think of it as going on temporary pause until we can secure the funds required for this canopy and the fun day for the two finalizing the design and also going to construction for it.
Quite, a few people I know, have just been laid off right: now, I, totally understand, and that's a little over my out of my purview We just have to wait to see how the next few months are going to unfold and how Council and the mayor are able to navigate through these times, and this is one of those items that on it, just happened to be on this track, that we just have to wait for it.
What I want to do is I'm going to work in you , It's just that we really have a lot of other items, but I will try and work you back in depending on how long the flood protection is I, know you shot through this, but there's still other things.
You know, we were asked to look at the Eastside coastal resiliency project area and determine if it would be feasible to design and implement an IFP M project, while those long-term measures are being constructed.
You, know capital, construction or any addressing of things like the drainage in a way that is going to be a permanent solution for that NYCHA might be doing, but I have no knowledge of what NYCHA is doing.
I know that some people are just finding out about this, but it just and I could probably speak for a lot of committee members who have too many evenings of meetings of community engagement and for quite some time.
Maybe we need to do more as a community board, but this project is going through and q.
We, really think that everyone knows about this project, because just at the time we invest every single night on Thursday after I can assure you they don't, but we're gonna make the community aware, because we don't trust you all right.
I can assure you also that the community is not aware and also I, think you need to work on not only addressing I'm.
This interim flood protection study be available to the public so that we have time to look it over absorb it, and you know: ask follow-up.
Are you going to walk into the park and talk to people who don't come to meetings?
I know that there are a lot of questions about trees or, if next time it is today we're speaking specifically about the tree planting times worse, I work with NYC parks in the tree, planting, program, I'm, managing all of the tree plantings in response to es CR and all related community correspondence, including the tree planting task, force.
We would like to get our next meeting on the calendar for early September ahead of the fall planting, so that I can hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive update by then and just You know, if you have any questions about street tree planting or you want to attend the tree.
Have, a map of that I provided our last task force meeting of all the trees that have, and that did so far for this project, so I'll have that sent out again We can well have it sent to the district office and Thanks, and one day you raise your hand late, but I'm gonna, give you the opportunity to close us out, because we really got to talk about district needs.
We gathered a lot of feedback based on like you know what types of trees won't want to see go in and where the community thinks they should go, and we got a lot of feedback that tree canopy should be going in closest to surrounding East River Park.
I, don't know if he's on, but did you want to see if the park manager is on the do bridge before it first Are you gonna put the district needs on the on the screen So, the first actually, the first section, Trevor I think, because we, the two of us what's going on, and so the first section under Parks Recreation, the bullet, points, I, don't believe there.
So it says reopen for community use , You know, there's a action going forward, got it conversation For the rodent, Section, I sent Trevor today a chart of the number of girls in each Park which I send that to the committee.
I think we need stronger, language, so I'm going to have to volunteer to come up with some language for that We can clean up this and get this as close to completion as we can, and this is for the committee members If, you don't seven and about you, know the need for our community to have well-maintained open space and the need for public space in our community.
