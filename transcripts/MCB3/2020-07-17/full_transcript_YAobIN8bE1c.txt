Oh I got alright we're gonna go ahead and start tonight's July 16th meeting of Parks Recreation Waterfront Andrew zane seat for July. We have a very long agenda, so we're gonna have some ground rules so that we can get through most of the material, but first wouldn't handle a couple of committee. Things first, that we have a new member 12 allez I see him on the screen. So let's welcome what Roy he's now a full board member for Parks and waterfront. Welcome. Troy, don't be interesting meeting but nice way to get your feet wet, also like to thank Michael who is running production on loosen meaning he has done it for every meeting and it requires a lot of work because he has to pay attention to all of what is going on in the chat and who needs to get on and then phones in addition to pay attention. This is trying to pay attention to the meeting itself, as he mentioned, we're using chat box for attendance and not for comment that those comments in the chat will go to me and Michael, or we can take attendance if you have not signed in. We ask you do to do so in the chat box. Also, I want to thank Bryan Gilliam, who is a secretary. She will be taking notes this time, I'm introduced in there and giving I gave her a little bit of warning, but I appreciate it right. We do not have any resolutions plan, although there's a lot of information, that's going to be presented first thing I'd like to do is approve the minutes from last month, and this is the way we take attendance for our committee members Michael. You probably need to unwind, so she can ask for people to say yes or no to the minutes. I asked everyone to respect that, so only those who are being called, please don't meet yourself. We want to try and keep this meeting as smooth and easy as we possibly can so Ryan. You can call the names for the committee members grab a melon, yes, okay, Webster yep, maybe Adams David Adams your own Altman, yes, Carlene sham Carlene, Chan, yes, yeah, Bryan, Gilliam, here, Valentina, Jones, palutena, Jones, yeah, sorry, yeah, Michael, Moreno, yes, Carolyn, Ratcliffe, I, see you unmute wanna stay here. Great Robin should tell Robin, should tell Josephine, be less here and troy bayliss yeah Dave Adams you're on your phone, which you usually join us by phone at star six to unmute yourself. It should be able to David Adams. You might not be here because he usually joins by phone and Orion was anyone else. We may have missed from maybe on the phone and not able to unmute themselves. I just have David Adams and Robin should tell okay, so we're gonna continue. First, some comity issues. There are a lot of things going on, obviously along the waterfront. So for Kitty members it is likely that we will meet in August to handle a couple of items just for meeting purposes. The link is provided on the calendar just like. If we were looking to see where our meeting is the same. Information is provided on the cd3 website and it's also the most update, because things tend to change, so it always recommend going to the website to get the information about the meeting. One of the things we're probably going to discuss at the August meeting is to Brooklyn Montgomery close to resiliency project, the community that we discussed - the exact last night briefly, but basically the projects along the waterfront and two bridges, or also known as a Brooklyn montgomery coastal resiliency project was a had some issues with funding, but it appears now it's back on track and that construction should start at the end of this month, a community board, along with a number of other neighborhood groups for letters, and we received a response that they were going to continue this. So it's pretty good news. They are coming to the board in August to talk about the project as we left off at design and we're going to restart that community engagement sometime in August. The first thing we're going to discuss. Well, there is a committee member who wants to speak so that, if you want to unmute yourself, we're gonna, give you two minutes to speak, say yeah. Yes, okay, someone going in terms of what you said in terms of I'm. Speaking on behalf of the Lower East Side power partnership, we wrote a letter to council member Brandon and we wrote in support of the Brooklyn Bridge Montgomery Street Coast resiliency project Kaden for the City Council to support the project in every way. The Hesco barriers places Smith houses and lands into both within boundaries of Brooklyn, Bridge and Montgomery is a constant reminder to the residents of the present protection and that more needs to be done. Our understanding is that work on BC our project has been paused. As of April le SPP advocates utilization of every measure possible for work on BMC our project to zoom, and, as you stated, we got a response back to discuss with the community and communicated updated schedule after that we resumed in design work. Thank you. Thank you. Now for those who have looked on at the agenda on the website, we're going to change things. Just slightly first I want to make sure that we have the teams that are ready to present available, so the first team that would go up with the department sanitation to talk or give an update on the staging, the TLC staging at basketball city, I, don't know who's here for that Joshua Goodman. How are you okay? How are you doing? Thank you very much for me, you're ready for me to go ahead, or are we continuing through the roll first? Yes, you can go ahead great well. Thank you very much, sir I appreciate the opportunity. As always, and just for those of you, I haven't, had the chance to work with before I'll just quickly introduce myself I know, we've got a full agenda, but I'm here really in three capacities. The first is as an assistant commissioner, at the Department of Sanitation. The second is as a public affairs official on the city's emergency food operation, and the third is as a CV. Three resident I live at the corner of market in Madison. I, see many of you, while I'm not walking my dog every morning, so intimately familiar with the issue. Just want to provide an update on what's going on at basketball city I know. Some of you are very familiar with this, and some maybe not quite as much so give a 60 second overview of where we're at now, where we've gone over the last few weeks and what to expect going forward at basketball city we're staging one of 11 sites from which we're delivering meals to homebound New Yorkers. This is the program that you may have heard about we're about. 18,000 taxi drivers are coming to these 11 sites around the city, picking up meals for people who can't go out due to the pandemic and delivering free food from the city right to that the site at basketball city just past 7 million meals this week delivered. So this is a really interesting program. It's a really cool program. It's the kind of innovative thing that we're excited to be doing during a challenging time because it gets food to people indeed, people who can't go out, but it also provides work for the taxi drivers right and nobody's taking a taxi right now. So this is kept. These taxi drivers employed and paid for the work of helping people. That said what challenges that we face. This is one of as I said 11 sites, but it's certainly one of the ones in again the most dense residential communities and they are all over the city. You know they're in Flushing, they're on the Upper West Side, there's a large one in Kingsbridge in the Bronx. But you know, as we all know, our neighborhood has narrow streets right and you may have seen in the early days of the pandemic through perhaps April or May taxi drivers lined up because they wanted to get this work in the morning right and more at this site than at any other. We had drivers lining up at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning because they wanted to make sure that they got one of the routes. There's a finite amount of work and I certainly understand that. So based on community feedback, we instituted a number of new policies that I think have largely eliminated the problem and then I'll talk about what challenge is still remain. I, don't want to act as if it's completely resolved. The first thing that we did was we had an outside vendor build an entirely new scheduling, app for the drivers. The drivers previously was first-come first-serve. So you know in the spirit of competition they started getting there in the middle of the night to make sure they got a route. We built this app that the drivers used to sign up where they sign up for a specific 1 hour time slot and if they're not able to sign up died before they don't have a route at the site, so there's no reason for them to come down. This is something that made a huge difference where the drivers, still you know, occasionally someone will show up at five in the morning and TLC police say to them. Why are you here? You either signed up already for a route or you did there's no reason for you to be here this early and we've gotten rid of this issue where there were hundreds and hundreds of cars lining up to try to get work, not knowing if they wouldn't have. We also moved some of the loading sites from pier 36 to pure 42 to try to create a little bit of additional capacity. We added about 80 additional cars at pier 42 at a time, so that gets several hundred off the street over the course of the hours. This program is active. We reconfigured what's happening at pier 36. We opened up an additional part of the south side of pier 36 to get another 40 cars in there at one time, so all told we were able to get additional cars inside the facilities and off the streets. We also we're very fortunate at this program to have the support of the National Guard. They do a lot of the loading of the food into the cars. We were able to work with the National Guard to increase capacity, so they can get the cars in and out faster. So that said, we've still had a couple of challenges. The site is closed on Saturdays, because this is maybe more information than folks needed, but the basketball city site handles a lot of the almost all of the kosher meals delivery around the city. If you sign up for this program- and you say, I need kosher food, it comes from basketball city, so that means it's not open Saturdays, because we don't do kosher food deliveries on the Sabbath, and so, as a result of that, we sometimes have a little more capacity. Friday and Sunday. It's closed Saturday. So we got to make up a little bit of the extra. So we've added extra enforcement agents, it's TLC and it's New York City emergency management enforcement agents, who are there early making sure that the drivers are not idling, making sure that they're not blocking traffic, making sure that if they are there lined up they're in their cars they're, not hanging out on the sidewalk making noise we've also opened restrooms for the drivers. I know it has improved some of the local sanitation issues. So that's where we're at now and I appreciate that you know a handful of community members have let us know in real time. Whenever there is an issue. I know: we've got the chat on private mode, but I would love to leave my contact info because we've had an issue where sometimes we'll hear from a community member on you know: Thursday, hey I was out there last Monday and it was pretty bad there's not a lot. We can do at that point, although we do appreciate the feedback. I'd love to give folks, my cell, an email. If you see a problem on the site, I'm right here in the neighborhood. Let us know in real time and we will take care of it right away, so I'll post it for you privately in the chat mr. chair and, if you'd like to share with everyone, please feel free if we could post that now and Michael can send it out we're gonna go with some questions and I certainly have a few, because one of the folks who witnesses those cars at 5 o'clock in the morning and seen a whole bunch of fights and a lot of other issues is generally calm down. But there's still some issues and what I'm gonna give the committee members a chance to speak on this I think I saw Tory's can raise I, don't know if that was for this issue is for this issue. Okay, go ahead. Troy I have a couple of questions. I have two questions. One is I'm, not sure if you take care of this issue Josh, but the issue with the box is being left in buildings in the lobby of buildings that that's a problem in night, sir and I can speak to that. Certainly so for folks who may not be familiar, this is separate from the drivers lining up, but the issue is when the food was delivered. We had a problem with drivers, not taking it to the door, and this was particularly a bad problem. You're absolutely right, sir. In NYCHA and the drivers would sometimes say to us: look I want to deliver it to the door, but the Bell doesn't work know which of course, we know, is a significant problem in nature. So what we've done is we've added cell phone numbers to all of the orders, and we've made it clear to the driver that unless you can provide a cell phone photo proof that you dropped it at the door, your deliveries, incomplete and you're not getting paid. So the problem has improved significantly once in a while I hear from someone who says: hey, I'm attendance Association president at you know any development anywhere in the city I'm here in the lobby, and they just left a bunch of boxes, but now we've instituted better tracking, so we can immediately say back about ta president or that manager. Give me the number that's written on the box will tell you what store it's supposed to go to. So that's it. It's still supposed to go to the door that shouldn't be the building management's problem. It shouldn't be the TA president's problem, but because we've told the drivers that they won't get paid for incomplete deliveries. We think it's mostly gotten better, but again, you've got my contact info. If it ever happens, let us know we'll handle it right back. Just one other question: Trevor: is there any opportunity for summer some of the youths from the Louis side to go and participate in this program? It's a great question. I know that the deliveries have to be done by people who have a TLC license. I can use whatever vehicle they want, but they've got to have a license. I wonder what other opportunities there might be. I mean we would love to include local youth in the extent that we can I'm not sure whether there are I don't want to say whether they're Union rules involved. Any reason I mean at the distribution sites. It's lots and lots of city staff, plus the National Guard I'd be happy to reach out to the emergency management leadership who are running the site and say: do you have used for weather it's either volunteers or seasonal workers, hands. Okay, I'm, just gonna. Ask a couple: questions and I appreciate you leaving the information in there, so we can get real-time complaints and responses back. I guess I'll start from where we are today and work on the way back, since it's a little easier to discuss the program. How long is this expected to last, because obviously there are still situations where we see cars wrapped around and the issue still is that they don't have a bathroom. So you have to you know hundreds of cars wrapping around a block with no pass, and so they tend to leave urine and other things outside the car low trash, and you know that some mornings, they all have their cars running. No one turns her car off, so there's still exhaust fumes and, as you know, it's been covered, 19 neighborhood. The last thing we want to see so I understand that the good that's doing the feed, but when the good sort of has it bad to it, people don't view it that way. Okay, completely and I think both of those are unacceptable situations. So there's a few questions in there, so there is a bathroom as actually to open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. we're, hoping that if folks are not there overnight, there's no reason for them not to use those restaurants right yeah. Maybe someone shows up at 5:30, but they can wait until 6 a.m. when we gotta lock the restaurant and I will say you know, would welcome the board's thoughts on this, we're actually totally open to making that restroom 24 hours, but we don't have staff capacity to supervise it overnight. So obviously, there's risks involved in that right. If we leave it unlocked at night, there's nobody there to check anybody could go in and use it. If you decided that's worth the risk, we're completely fine, leaving it open overnight, but we've decided so far for security reasons to lock it from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. but you know, hopefully, drivers are only there during those hours, the idling. We have told them that we will issue tickets, and that was a great example of something where, if you see it, let me know in real-time: our enforcement agents will walk right down the block and say turn the car engine off or here's a ticket. Obviously we hope it doesn't come to that and the city has a large anti-idling campaign. So definitely don't want that to happen and that's its TLC police. It's an emergency management and if precinct is obviously aware of this, but so far it's been handled in a seventh I'm. Sorry I live in the fifth and then on your last question about timing. You know I, think that the program will continue long term because, as we reopen, our seniors are going to be the last people to get back to normal this site. It's hard to say you know we had actually closed to as demand has sort of evened out. You know we had one large one at Thomas Jefferson rec center, which is at a 112 Street and 1st Avenue that site we were able to close it down as capacity picked up elsewhere. Basketball city is a good site because it's so large I mean you know. Of course, every story in New York is ultimately a real estate story. Where can you put a couple hundred cars at a time? Certainly, I would expect it to continue operating through the fall, and if these problems are not resolved by then you know which I know they mostly are. But if we continue to see this, we can talk then about whether it makes sense to ship some of the capacity elsewhere. Okay and I'll follow up with you in a separate conversation, because I'm really wanting to keep this as informational, but that's also a large space for the community and I know that the city is looking for ways to keep kids socially distant, and that is one space that could handle a lot of kids, especially if we're going to be talking about daycare or summer cubes or other things. So we had a way. You know. How are we going to use this space, especially in a space, starved neighborhood like ours, but we'll talk about that in another time? Great well, just say: I really do encourage anyone to. Let me know about any problems in real time, really pride myself on being a good, neighbor and I'm being responsive to the board members, so anything I can do. Let me know at any time sure Michael did you say anyone else, I, don't see anyone else, all right, Thank, You, Josh, well, I, don't know if you're gonna stay on for part of the ESC I, don't know if there's another rep from Sanitation I'm, not sure but I whatever I think whoever's supposed to be here is gonna be here, but thank you for giving us the information on that and if you have any updates, we'd surely like to know you can email us in real time. Also put the information in there we'll pass it or something else. You're unmuted, you just muted yourself. It started six again and unmute yourself here you can we hear you on the touched on, but we can hear you speak in alright Michael we're gonna move on and if you could mute that I can hear the background noise so we're gonna, mute and lower that hand all right. Next up. We have a series of presentations that are gonna consume a lot of time. So I had mentioned this at the beginning of the meeting that we really haven't heard a lot about the ESC. Our project since it began- and we were obviously moving along pretty swiftly with this and covered, has changed a lot of things, not with not just this meeting, but you know in the world itself, so this is mostly for information, so we can get as much information as we can there's a lot to digest here. There are a lot of questions that are going to be answered, I'm going to ask for everyone's patience, so we can get as much information as we can. This is not going to be the only meeting about this topic. We've been had been meeting about eser every single month for what seems like it had to be at least a year, maybe even longer than that, and we will continue to do so. There will be opportunity to ask questions, but since we have not heard from this team in quite some time, we are really going to limit this to a presentation and some general questions where we can get an understanding of where this project is right. Now so I'm gonna give the ESC our team or DBC a chance to introduce themselves. They are going to give this presentations with presentation which does not include the ESC our project itself, as well as the Emergency Management intern flood protection presentation, I'm gonna, ask -: are you on? She was on and he's been given co-host ability, so he can share the screen, show the slides, aq hi. Everyone can hear me. Yes, okay, great mic. If you want to mute my name on my computer, that's fine I'm talking through my phone! So great. Let me share my screen for those of you or follow me that yes yeah, you just one quick question. This is the same one, that's on the website, yeah! So for folks who are on their computer or on your phone or a tablet. You could pull up the same presentation on your computer by going to the cd3 website and looking under the calendar, go to parks, waterfront and resiliency committee, and you could pull up the exact same presentation -. You can play great Thank, You Trevor, Susan Mike, all other members. Thank you so much as Trevor mentioned, it's been a while considering ovid and the project process in the past few months. That we haven't really provided too much details and we're hoping to give you folks a better understanding of what's going on with the project, and it's Trevor mentioned we'll be coming back regularly now from now on, to get more information out there and be able to be available for questions and move on for moving towards the construction. So just for anybody who doesn't know me, my name is cue: amiri I'm, with EDC the coastal resiliency unit and the infrastructure division at BCC I'm. Here with a host of my colleagues within the agency and our others, city partner agencies and our consultants from the HM TV Lee ro team. That's a joint venture that has come on board to help us Shepherd the project through the construction phase for the next several years for the next five years. So I'm going to go through the presentation, hopefully I'll, be able to preemptively answer a lot of the questions that we received so far from many different avenues, but I think Trevor said we'll have a general or maybe a short Q&A at the end that we can discuss. If we don't get say any questions as usual, please feel free to reach out to me or faily directly, have our contacts you can reach out through the website. A number of you folks are a member of the Community Advisory Group, the CAG, and you can reach out through Crabbe Institute. That's the facilitator, we'll talk about that a little bit, and obviously through elected officials and the community board committee members here too happy to discuss that afterwards too. So what we've heard so far in the past several months, especially since Kovac, has started. Unfortunately, I just wanted to give an idea and I'll talk about these bullet items during the presentation. But overall, we've received a lot of questions about the current project status and what the timeline is where the project is so far in the past several months what's been going on, will the Park East, River, Park and all the other parts in cv6 area? Will they remain open for the summer season to have access to the additional open space, considering the coated restrictions that we all have for dealing with right now, which the answer is yes and I'll? Talk about that also will give you an idea or presents a little more details about our outreach and engagement strategies for the next few months, until construction and also for the next five years of construction phase and after I'm done, our colleagues at the emergency management will be presenting their interim flood protection measures. Analysis, that's you've all been waiting for and then we've been able to coordinate so jumping right in this is just an introductory overview slide I'll skip over and talk about it here. So I do want to say first thank you to all the community members, everybody being patient with us working with us. I know this is a major project, there's a lot of unknowns in the future, especially with the current circumstances. But as of now just so everybody knows, the project has not been impacted or delayed sychov it by, as of today, the project's design, the procurement activities, the engagement efforts, the construction timeline. All of that is still moving forward as we had plans. That said, we still need some time to understand the overall impacts of kovat on the city's major construction projects such as this ESC, our project, to be able to figure out what that really means for our project schedule. So, as we all know, this pandemic has been extremely disruptive and unpredictable. So as we stand today again, everything is on schedule on budget and we're moving forward and we'll keep be sure to provide detailed update moving forward. So construction is going to commence. This fall I'll talk more details about that on the right side of this column. They see on the screen, but we had planned to start our pretty much substantial construction info. There was a little package, a smaller package of early package that we named did suit. That was planned to commence and spring. However, due to at the request of the community, we were able to defer that to the spring, so we could have that area open and working with a lower Eastside ecology Center later in fall instead of spring, and that's that has that has not been impacted by covert and just because we received questions on that. I wanted to be clear that was deferred proactively by the project team by DBC at the request of the community, and we were able to accommodate that without having to impact the rest of the project schedule that comes after that. So on the right side of this page, just the general overview, the project is broken up into four different packages: different packages. We you often hear us saying PA, -, PA, one PC, so I just want to give a quick explanation of what these are and timelines that are associated with these. The early package is that's what was plans for Springs I got deferred to early fall sometime in September rain and we're coordinating with the city team with our deputy mayor's office dias, and why parks there's a there's, a big group behind that to help with relocating the lower Eastside ecology, centers compost yard operations to the new site. So we can start the project construction after that, and as part of that is another small piece of that is tree transplants. A number of trees are currently being assessment identified to be transplanted into the community from the East River Park into the community, and we'll be able to provide more details about that to project area to is essentially cv6 community board six area of the northern piece of the project and I put this in this order. Because of the timeline right now, we've gone through the procurement process and just to clarify that -. Since January, we started the pre-construction procurement process for this project and that's partly why we've been a little more on the quiet side for the past several months, because there really hasn't been major project activities. It's all been constructed contract development and reviewing and approving the specifications working with our program management, team agency, newly ro and I'm, trying to get these packages out. So this is where we are today. The project area - has been set out. The bids the lowest bidder was selected and the process for these packages, typically just to give everybody an idea, is that once these packages are prepared and released to for bidding and all the bids come in, but lowest bidder is selected for review by DTC, with the help of our agency Villeroy consultant team. After that, a bid, analysis and verification is done, which goes into a pre-award meeting and from there. If everything lines up and the lowest bidder is actually selected and verified, then we award the contracts we read to the contract and a notice that preceded issued. The notice of proceed I also want to explain. There's might have been some confusion in the past, with this Notice to Proceed letter that DDC issues to contractors- and this goes for any project out there- not just specific to our project. The Notice to Proceed is a statement to inform the contractor that they are approved for this specific scope. For this specific timeframe, that doesn't mean they can start at any time that they want they their first start date. Shovel in the ground still has to be coordinated and authorized by DDC. So if you hear or see any notice of proceeds out there, that the dates may not line up with what your what we are saying here, that's because that's just an author, that's just a green light to the contractor to inform them. That they've been a proof. There's a lot of legwork, a lot of mobilization, a lot of coordination that has to happen before we actually start construction and that's a collective decision with DBC and our city agencies, our partners and our consulting team, and once we determine that exact time frame for each one of these areas. We'll definitely come back and inform the community here, through the community boards media community board meetings through the elected officials, offices and the community advisory group, all the avenues that we have. Obviously the website and other methods and let everybody know well in advance before construction starts on any area of this project. So once there was the perceived issues, the projects with for the project to the contractor, we go into a pre-construction meeting after that. Cdc gives the authorization to the contractor. A date is determined and construction starts from that point and because right now we haven't reached those steps. Yet at this point, we're just four project area: two we're just at the sort of pre award meeting step right now and we haven't ordered the contract, the this scope to the contractor. Just yet that's why we can't provide an exact timeframe or date for start of construction for any of these packages. Just yet, but the overall sort of targeted time frame for project area, 2 and community board six area is early fall and moving on to project area, one which is right behind project area two and hasn't been. We haven't word that project area. One is a couple of steps behind in the procurement phase from project they're here to and that's currently targeted for late fall, and the fourth component of that is the parallel conveyance that includes the sewer and drainage improvements through them throughout the whole project site, which incas the whole project, footprint and community board three and six, and that's the final one that will come after PA, one the timeframe hasn't been determined yet and where we think we're estimating sometime in the late fall to early winter time. That might be breaking ground for that piece and again just bear with us. While we move along with our sort of behind the scenes, pre-construction activities every time, it's like peeling, an onion every time that we reach a mini milestone behind the scenes, we'll be able to provide more details on construction timeframe and the specific construction areas for the project, and they also, we might want to remind everybody. Back in December and January, we presented general construction phasing diagram to both community boards and residents in the area that was prepared by our consultant team agency. Being liro and they've been able to determine that level of detail, however, to take it up, take it to the next step. We need to have the contractors on board, and one of the very first deliverables by the contractor is for them to propose or issue their projects, get their construction schedule to us, and once we get the construction schedule, we do our review, there's meetings and discussions and from that point we will be able to determine exactly the date for the start of construction. So we'll come back with more details as we move along and again I'll be sure to provide well advanced notice, and we have a host of different avenues that we be able to communicate with folks that I'll share in the next slides. So everybody knows before anything happens in the area this slide. This is also a general overview, not many details still available for this subjects, but I wanted to talk about a little bit and I'm going to turn it to our consultants agency, V Leo, here to quickly speak to this slide. This has been just has any other construction project: construction operations, noise, air quality site safety, construction, States, the construction site safety- all of that is, although that is always a concern for any residents and any project team, regardless of the location or the project type, and we want to be sure that everybody understands that we are will be following all the regulations and local laws and codes that we have to require, and we want to we'll be sure to provide the information and these plans once there once they're developed to the community, so everybody's aware of what is required from the contractor and what they need to comply with and ongoing. Regular report updates to the community with our monitoring plans with regards to noise and air quality and our dust control plans with that. I'll just give this for a couple minutes to John Lynch he's one of our project managers from HM TV on our consultant on the consulting side, John I, don't know if you were able to mute yourself or if Mike has to do that. No I was able to eat myself Qi. Can everybody hear me yeah? Okay? So good evening, everyone, my name, is John Lynch with HNTB Lera, we're the program, manager and construction manager for each of the four projects. Q just went through so while providing Resident, Engineer and inspection services to oversee the contractors on each of the four contracts. So, just briefly going through a few bullets here, as we get ready for construction to start in the fall, the contract is required to submit a site safety plan which would include Co bid, as well as a bunch of other things like noise quality and air quality. So we have to be compliant with New York City's codes for those. We also have sites project specific specifications in the contract to monitor for noise and air quality, as well as maintain dust control. So we're really the ones overseeing to make sure the contractor doesn't make too much noise create too much dust we'll have plans for each of those from the contracts and finally, and the proper emissions for air quality. Eight and then the last bullet here talking about overnight construction, we're going to minimize nine work as much as possible. In some cases we need to do work at night because they were closing lanes of the FDR Drive, for example, but we're gonna be monitoring that so as to keep that to a minimum I, don't know if there's anything else, you want me to go through the queue, but I think that's pretty much. It thanks. John yeah again, we'll come back. Definitely with more details on this with the night closures, with all these plans once they develop so another requirement for the contractors suitable to submit there to develop these plans and submit it to us for review collectively with DDC NHIN cz0 will be reviewing and approving, and at that point these sort of cracks the criteria requirements will be set and we'll be able to share more details at that at that stage. So again, please bear with us. This is keep in mind. It's like an onion where we're Keeling every layer as we as we move along and if we, if we don't have them Meishan available I, just ask that everybody needs it didn't just please be patient with us, and once we reach that juncture, we'll be happy to explain and provide more details. So moving on, that was our sort of projects, status, updates and if there is any specific questions after this, we can take that. But I want to move on to our community engagement strategy for the next five years of this construction. What we have in store. This is a high-level summary list of what we're working on right now that we wanted to share with you. A lot of this is still under development and I just wanted to let everybody know. What's going on and I'll go through every single one of these and explain more so, like I said with Coe vids, we haven't really had any direct impacts to our overall construction, but at our overall project construction, our project funding is still committed in place. We still have our funding in place for Community Engagement scope, the timeline, the schedule. Everything is business as usual, just as we had planned, everything is moving along between January through early fall. Mid fall has always been our sort of estimated timeline for procurement phase, which we are in sort of halfway right now and the only sort of at this point, the only kovat impact that we are sort of assessing is our public engagement activities and efforts, and here we are virtually via zoom. Otherwise we would have been in person at the community board meeting under normal circumstances. So covent has really made us rethink and reassess our engagement strategies that we had in mind for to kick off construction prior to fall construction and also during construction, whether it was street fairs or in-person meetings, one-on-ones, community board or whatnot. So we're taking a look at our overall strategy and trying to come up with creative ways to still deliver our strategy and tasks that we had in mind without having to sacrifice the quality or sacrifice any of our engagement efforts. So that sort of mentality has worked its way into the following bullet points that I'll talk about. The second bullet point on the left is the community advisory group I'm sure many of you know some may not be aware of this, but Community Advisory Group was formed recently in the recent few months and a number of residents. Representatives of a lot of complexes, housings and businesses are on the membership list of this tag, as we call it in the advisory group. The kickoff meeting for this group was in January 17th. We per the mayor's commitment letter. We have committed to funds all the expenses with regards to this community advisory group. Part of that is to have a facilitator, who wears who is proud: innocent Pratt Center to help us with, and the CAD group, navigate through the construction phase with regards to our engagement strategy. So kickoff was in June 17th just about a month ago, and we provided a high-level presentation more or less what you're, seeing here, not anything less and probably not anything more, but a little more details have become available since then. That I was I've, been able to I'm able to share with you folks today and we'll make sure to loop in the rest of the CAG members. If you have any questions with regards to that, I would defer everybody to Pratt, Center and happy to put you folks in contact, and our goal is to still maintain our presence with the community boards and other avenues that we had during the design as well in the cat group. So please feel free to reach out whether through Pratt center or other avenues, we are updating our web sites. Currently, the web site covers the design phase predominantly and we're expanding the website to include additional tabs and dropdowns and sections that we could utilize during construction, we're adding a little more background and history to the project website. The website address the link, the overall layout. Everything will remain the same, there's still a contact box, a contact area that you can reach us. It will be connected to an online web-based tool that I'll talk about in the next couple minutes and we're goal is same thing with social media, as promised. Our goal is to roll out our new website and our social media accounts with our first round of social media posts at some point during this summer, in advance of construction, so bear with us we're still coordinating the website, update with our IT departments and the rest of the city team and going through that coordination and step by step, update and we'll be back, and we can give you a demonstration on in one of the upcoming community board meetings once we go live with that communication materials just as any other project at DVC, we'll have a wide range of communication materials. It's a big package of different public published materials were hoping to establish a newsletter for this project, most likely quarterly newsletter. We've looked at many other projects. Major infrastructure projects spoke to a lot of those project teams and came up with this sort of what we see here is some of it was inspired by others. Successful projects that have been going on in New York many people have found a news load to be very helpful, so feel free to give us some feedback on that I think. According to newsletter, that was summarized all the information that would be presented at the CAG meetings or at the community board meetings on the website with some pictures and stuff. It might be helpful to the folks and there will be advisories and notifications. All of these would be translated to multiple languages and we'll show you an example of the documents once we get to that point and we're ready to share that in the next few months again, another item with the goal of rolling out at least rolling out a templates before construction. So it's ready to be used once we once we hit construction phase interpret of resiliency signage. This has been on a separate design track since late fall early winter last year, we're working on designing a system of dedicated interpretive signage, the bead installs throughout the project footprint. The goal here is to provide information on the resiliency infrastructure as a whole. Also, some individual elements that serve critical functions within the flood protection system. These signs they're also intended to provide information or the independent flow protection components and how the systems function as part of the unified approach to this coastal resiliency project and, like I mentioned the scope, is on a separate design track and will present the conceptual design at one of the upcoming community board meetings right now, our design team, that many of you are familiar with the a krf team and their consultants, are working on this and we're hoping to provide a separate presentation at some point within the next few months before we finalize design. So we can collect feedback and get everybody's thoughts on that. So to the right side of this list are going to really quickly talk about our MWBE section, three goals. We have our consultant here. Our that's joining us I want to refer to her defer to her to give us a quick, two minute introduction. But again, this is another item. That's currently under development, we're working on hashing out the details and we'll come back with more details to explain what the goals are. What the criteria is, what we're trying to do and all that training are you on the call you unmute it? Can you hear me that would be? Oh, yes, yep this is train. Can you hear me? Yes, oh okay, great, thank you for the opportunity to give you a quick overview of what our plans are for the outreach on this program. So a little bit about me, I'm trained three from Bowie studio and we're an MWBE firm and also a section three firm and we're based in the Lower East Side. Looking at the goals for this program, we've identified three general areas where we can maximize opportunities for MWBE firms, section three firms and also local hiring opportunities, and it starts with the program management team with each end to being Lyra JB, which they already brought into the program with over a dozen MWBE firms, including myself and we'll look at where the staffing needs and the supp insulting opportunities might be for the program as it evolved once the general contracting teams are in place. We will also start working with those contractors and also with the program management team, to see where subcontracting opportunities can be utilized to work with local community groups and see what local resources are already there in place to hire locally and both individuals and firms and then, finally, working with the community outreach team. We would also try to find opportunities once the community engagement is underway and depending on where kovat takes us, we could also do outreach in those areas promoting local businesses to help you know, staff or supply services and equipment to the construction and the program management team. So, where we'll be working with you and any other local partners that are already on the ground to really leverage and cultivate the existing relationships, we already have on the ground. Great. Thank you trying and again we'll come back with a lot more details on that, but I just wanted to share high-level information to let everybody know. The next bullet point is the community construction liaisons, as we first met of CCOs. This is another item that this program is being developed right now and just trying to define the step by step and day-to-day process of the CCL. This is a project component. That's a standard practice for a lot of our DBC projects and I. Think it's self-explanatory. They're meant to be liaison for community for the community. During the construction phase, we will definitely have at least two CCS to start with, for the whole project, footprint and I'm. Sure many of you know, construction project construction is typically a gradual process, as time goes by the operation of the intensity of it increases. So for the first several months of or maybe few months of, the project, we may not need as many CCS or as much support, but as we get closer to that sort of intensity, we're gearing up to be prepared for the. If we need to add more CCS, we'll look into that, but for the time being, we're starting with two and we'll definitely be sure to we're bringing on details that are bilingual to be able to communicate with a wider group of residents. So we'll come back and provide more details on that as well and explain what the rule is when and how they can they'll be available to everybody and how they can be reached and well we'll present all that the third, the bullet here web based public inquiry tool. Also, the next two I have a separate slide, focusing on these three, so I'm going to jump ahead to the next slide and I'll talk about these three bullet points. The web based public inquiry tool is. This is actually a very exciting tool that we're all at DVC very happy and excited about our program management, team, H, amtv and Lear. Oh I forgot to mention you actually see their logo down below on the right side of the slide. They have this. They have developed this that I've been working with this tool for a number of their past construction projects, and it seems it's been very successful and seems to be a very helpful tool for our project here and essentially it's a inquiry, management and response management system, and it helps us better, manage and organize questions, concerns and increase that come in. Take it through a pipeline behind the scenes to make sure it's reaching the right person, collect the information and responses and then go back through that pipeline to go reach the individual. So we can respond to everybody in the timely matter in a more organized manner. To this tool is currently being developed. There's it has a wide range of features and capabilities and we're trying to tailor it and customize it specifically to the needs of this project and our community and our relation and our community relations. Here it will be available at the community information that I'll talk about in the next slides. The CCL will have it on their tablets or phones. The community at large anybody could access this on any Android or iPhone iOS phone any tablet. It has multiple languages that you can choose to translate and as a be able to have the ability to either just open the site and pop in your question or concern and a couple of fields that may it may or may not be required and submit that or you can create an account and have that saved under your account and every time you need to access that you can log in and pick up where we left off. It's also going to be linked to our website. So once the new website, the updated website is done and rolled out you'll see a link to this tool, we'll be using this with our social media posts and responses. It has the ability to set up virtual meetings and an event sort of like a 3d virtual reality space, that's pretty cool, so we're looking into that as an alternative to the in-person meetings and events that we had in mind early on this year. Multiple languages I mentioned, and one of the biggest features is obviously you can opt in to receive communications via text message or email or you can opt out of it and those communication materials that I mentioned earlier part of that package of notifications and advisories free closures. Anything like that all of those or any reports. All of that could be issued through this tool as well. So anybody who opts in to communications through this tool will be able to push out advisories and through mass emails or mass text messages to be sure we're reaching a wider net of the community members. We'll come back in the next few months, couple months, few months before construction, to provide a demonstration of this tool and to walk everybody through it. It's fairly simple and intuitive, but stay tuned and we'll come back to show you how it works before construction starts, so everybody's familiar with how to navigate through it. Another item that we're very excited about that kind of had a curveball with kogas right now is a comedian from pids the comedian formation center. So we were hoping to open a sort of a community center prior to construction at some point late summer, before construction mid to late summer, that kind of hit a little curveball with Kovac, nonetheless, we're still working on it. The goal here is to so we've been assessing available commercial spaces in the project area, so the space the center could be used as a hub for project information and for in-person community engagements. Our goal is to have a staff by at least two locally hired administrative folks, and the CCS will be available there in person, either by appointment or through a rotating schedule, also wanted to mention that privately before I forgot, the CCS will be based on the project sites construction sites behind the sense which is not obviously open or accessible by the public. However, we want to make sure we want this effort was one of the goals with it was with. This was to make sure these CC ELLs are accessible to the public and in person, and this Center could become a hub for that matter. Also, this would serve as a space for us to host our stakeholder or community meetings or tag meetings as needed any information center. If information says session, we were hoping to reach out to the schools and partner with the local schools for field trips and use this space as an educational center, with exhibits and posters screens and whatnot and, after all said and done, and set up develop some sort of a system that we can offer this space back to the community Corvo, no, obviously for any monthly membership meetings or community meetings that the community organizations might need and will hostel figure taxes amount to the sort of criteria for finding this space was to look in an area that's halfway centrally located halfway between Community Board, six and community board three to be fair to all the residents and this project stretch and we landed on Alphabet City area. That's what you see on the screen. We've looked at a number of spaces in February and March right before kovat. That search efforts went on has gone on for the past few months. We narrowed it down to a few options and got a lot of good feedback from partners and the elected officials the community boards. However, we kept assessing the vision and the use of this space and with the current Cobras in person, researchers that we all have and the unknown ahead of us and for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to open this space before construction and we may delay it until we have a better idea of how the next few months of this Covid-19 time is going to unfold. So to make up for that, we're looking at alternatives that are temporary spaces in the in the area or either one or multiple spaces, on a rotating base that we could at least have some posters and exhibits educational materials, some smaller it would be a smaller space, but from Center or some hub that folks can pop it in and pick up a pamphlet or a one-pager than the advisories. That I spoke about that. We printed anything like that, so this is also in progress. The timeline is still being determined, we'll come back again in the next couple months with more details as we move along and the last item I have here is an art program that we would like to roll out to the community for the construction cents. So I'm sure many of you know, I've noticed throughout your life living in any neighborhood walking by construction sites. Typically, behind the construction fence, you'll see a green mesh fabric that covers that fence. Sometimes in the more recent years you would notice that instead of a green, boring mesh construction projects, print out their renderings or company logos on those fabrics and at DVC we have our standard company, our southern Asian, si logo and standard project renderings that we are hoping to use for the construction fence. However, we've had a number of projects in the past that have been very successful with soliciting a artwork from the community members and the social occasion displayed on these construction fences. So we're very excited about this and working on this program to tighten up the details. This is another item. That's targeted to be wrapped up before construction, so we can hand it off to the contractor for prints and installation. So stay tuned. I just wanted to give a quick overview on this item, and so we reach out into near few weeks month or so with more details, and the goal is to have contests throughout the project site project footprint for kids of all ages. Student adults are local artists, local photographers. Anybody that wants to join, to apply and submit their artwork will provide more details on what that artwork criteria is in terms of size or medium and material and how they can get it to us and with the detailed RFP sort of program that we're working on. So that's what I had on my list here, I hope, I answered a lot of the questions that we received, but Trevor Mike I'll turn it to you. If you want to open up for questions- and after me, we have our colleagues from Emergency Management that will talk about the I am just a question because I know we sent some questions beforehand and I. Don't know those were answered. Procedurally, is someone from parks here going to sort of give me that give a answer, those questions or do you want to ask? We have colleagues from parts of the you want -? Are you needed? Garbled noise I think we just lost I heard her say she was going to reconnect she's in the waiting room. Ah, yes, she's gonna reconnect. So what was she does that Trevor I fail to mention an update about the amphitheater, so maybe I can start with that, and then we move on to the other items and apologies for that. So the amphitheater, that was a question that that's been received, is the site designed the actual, an theater design. That does not include the canopy itself, because that's these two components aren't separate design tracks because of how they unfolded throughout the design phase. The amphitheater design is included in the contract for project with area one for the project, so it's being built and included. However, the Antikythera canopy itself is on a separate design track and we've done some design work on it with. There were workshops for the actual amphitheater and towards the end of the design. We had another workshop that included the end, the actual applicator design, as well as a sort of preliminary design for the canopy, and then we were sort of in the midst of that design, coordination from the canopy before kovat head, as we still owe the community or the amphitheater working group, another work session for that canopy design. At this point. So this goes back to what I was talking about earlier with Kovan impacts. At this point, the canopy itself we're hoping to secure funding for this canopy very soon, which will be finalized and installed on a separate project, not necessarily holding up the amphitheater design. It's the amphitheater itself so once where the city is able to secure the funds- and we have those funding that funding available will reach back out to the amphitheater working group and Trevor. Our committee board three will be sure to inform view folks as well. So we can schedule a workshop prior to finalizing that design. So I hope that answers that question. Just one point in that, because I heard she cured the funding by understanding that this was the amputated Southwest funded the even though it's on a separate son track, the amphitheater itself is funded and included that the canopy, because it was added on as a separate as added scope later, was not included in our in our funding. So we as at that point also it's not a covert impact, but we had to secure funding for that because it was added on later for the canopy itself. Okay, it's just so folks can understand. We're gonna spend a very short time on a Q&A portion because we really wanted to bring DBC back to the committee. So we can get some information, but we're gonna take a couple questions because they still have internal protection up theirs. So I'm gonna start with committee members. First Carol and I see your finger and I'm gonna go Kate first and I'm gonna ask the commemorative iver econ census at the time at 7:43. We have district means we'll be doing at ten o'clock, but we're gonna have an opportunity to speak with them again. So I'm gonna encourage too many members to be priests. Okay, thank you for the presentation. I just have one question: if you know anything about, you know we're hearing the East, River, compost, facility, reconstruction and wetland construction is canceled and anything you can say about that or if someone from perks is here, can you hear? Oh yeah I tried calling itself? Okay, so yeah, sorry about the previous audio issues, so I know that there were a number of questions about the law, reset, ecology, Center. Now there are a number of new people on this call. So if you could just introduce yourself- oh yes, all the community parks, I and the part of the project team I think I recognize most of the folks here from many years of community 3 and eser meetings on the Laurie side, ecology, center I think there are actually a couple issues, but I'll answer the compost one first. So, as you mentioned, part of the early, the package work will be the relocation of a compost facility, so I think one of the things that the city has been pretty committed to all along and that we continue to be committed to is ensuring that the compost operations can continue during esker construction. And so we are making progress on the site, preparation for the alternative location for the composting and we're also making progress on preparing Seward Park house, which will be the alternative location for Laurie sod, ecologies educational programming during the esker construction, I. Think one of the questions or inquiries that we've gotten from the community board previously as well as Laurie, said, ecology Center has been about the ability for the compost facility to remain at its current site for as long as possible, or until we actually need to put the flood protection in there. One of the things that we do want to flag and I'm sure DDC can speak to this in more detail is just the sheer complexity of a project of this scale and so having an active compost operations within a large scale. Constructions would be something that would be very disruptive and I think put the schedule for delivering flood protection, which is definitely the city's priority at risk, and so I think one of the things that we want to make sure people understand and I think. Maybe next time we can bring a map or an aerial view. It's just how much is going on in that area around the compost yard, and so many of you folks may be familiar with it. But you know if we're thinking from south to north the entrance for the construction vehicles for this project, a lot of them they'll all be coming from Montgomery Street, which is the only particular access, and so when we think about Montgomery Street, there is the pier 42 site, which is just south of the existing complex art. There is going to be an Economic Development Corporation projects there to build the pier 42 Park, both the upland as well as the deck. So that is going to be another construction project. That's happening concurrently with eser, just north of the accomplice chart is the corner of bridge, and that is going to be constructed. As part of the first phase of this site as well- so that's another thing to think about just in terms of how much is going to be going on in terms with construction there's also the ferry stop, which the city is committed to keeping open, but that's just another sort of logistical challenge and making sure that people can access that safely. We want to make sure that they're there construction vehicles can get in and are an unimpeded way, but also that you know people are safe users of the park pretty shortly after the ser on pier 42, the Honorable. We also will be getting to a point where the Williamsburg Bridge will need be, and so we're coordinating D-O-T. You know that they have some maintenance work happening for the underside of the unit's word for age, and so they will also need to be accessing that portion from Montgomery Street and so just from last year, construction logistics perspective. We want to make sure that you know you can proceed with all these really important infrastructure projects. You understand that composting is something that's really important to this community. So do you want to be supportive of it, and so we are definitely prioritizing and making sure that there is a site for Laurie site, ecology, Center, alga, I'm, sorry, this was all great information. But honestly you gave that to us before my question is simply about the guaranteed return of the compost yard. When the river project is done, that's it so one of the things is I know that I keep saying the same thing. We are still in the same place in terms of what we're committed to you. I, don't know Christine, maybe on I, don't know if she I don't see her, but we are hoping to start the actual discussions about a license agreement for the use of Seward Park house, which is where they'll be going for the educational program and, as part of that also start good face negotiations about what an agreement will look like with Valerie sod called you Center for returning to Easter Park. So we want to. We haven't had that discussion yet I think within the next week, or so our assistant, commissioner Sam Peter men will be reaching out I think we're. Finally, at a point where we're certainly still responding to kovat, but as we get more details about what the Seward Park house looks like, you know what the relocations that looks like we can actually start talking about details, so I don't have more than that right now, but you know we are committed to this we're going to be having conversations with the Loess on ecology, Center and all the thanks for covering that and I just wanted to add to what Aldo said about the construction operations, which is very thorough thanks for that also, the construction phasing plan that we have up on the website and that we presented several months ago over there this year. That again, I just want to remind everybody. That's a high level plan that has not been taken to the next level of details without the constructed, without the contractor being on board. So with looking at that plan at first glance, it might look like this particular piece of the puzzle with the compost area could be delayed to 2022 or 2023 for the next phase. However, like oldest said, it's all about the Opera, the construction operations that whole area is going to be intensely under construct under construction with multiple different contract and there's only one service road that serves that whole area. So it's more about that and the construction site safety then having access to that piece of the park. I just want to clarify that I. Thank you, I see three more committee members and then we're just gonna take a couple questions from other committee members, but I really want folks to understand it. We're just gonna keep this action brief. We still have some important agenda items and typically at these meetings, I tend to let everyone speak if you ever Menace eb-3, meaning we have stayed they're both very late, but under this new reality we're facing let's get as much information as we can. If you have questions you can always contact the ESC, our team or you can send it through the chat, and we will try and get an answer over the next three months because we're going to be meeting every month going forward- and this will be a recurring agenda item. So I know I, see Robin and Val and I know Carolyn raised her hand physically, so I see Carolyn, let's go to Robin hi thanks Trevor I'll, be brief: hi q, thanks again for the presentation. I just have two questions. One is you know, I feel like we haven't seen the design at a long time and I know that that's sort of going through I. Guess it for me for to talk about that in the future. Be great to see that again as a reminder, I guess we'd go to the website, but you know the southern end. I've been talking about the southern end between Delancey and the firehouse is a lot of natural pathways and that's something that I brought up. It's been part of, but a lot of meetings. I know that's been addressed and the other question is: if it's ours, co vid. Are you putting together a covent plan for the community so that people know what the rules are for the construction workers? So people would feel a sense of safety in the community and just one little brief thing. It would be really great, since you can't open a community center to have some kind of you know this video set up that we can actually see they couldn't see the construction as it as its unfolding, but I guess. My big question is about the Kovan right, so you guys putting a plan together that we can all see. Okay, thanks Robyn, and they are good to see you so cold it. Yes, so DD see we have as a construction agency. We have our own construction site safety and qa/qc team within the agency and of course we have a wide, a very large group of experts behind us, supporting us being hn t, v-- and Lehrer, who are very well experienced in this area, so both of these units, both these groups are currently looking into the kovat impacts on construction operations and what that means. Some there's some chatter out there in the industry that some contractors have been able to accommodate the co vid guidelines, whether in New, York, State or other states in the country some contractors have mentioned might have mentioned and I'm. Just speaking from my personal experience with articles and my little research, but it seems, like some other contractors had to slow down their schedule because of incorporating the six feet or other guidelines that they have so right now we're working on all that. This is a major aspect that is currently just behind the scenes for now until we get the contractors on board one by one for each of those four scopes. That I talked about three scopes early on to have that discussion with them hear what their plan is, what their experience has been in the past several months and we'll be able to come back with more details and show you what that criteria is or what that means and if it's going to have any scheduled impacts. So that's one of the unknowns right now, but so far we're not anticipating any impact, our schedule, but we'll let you know the details of covert operations thanks for persons on the cold quickly, I'm talking also on a personal level. You know a lot of construction workers when they're taking their breaks. They wander into the communities, they don't wear, masks and things like that. So that's just something I wanted to mention. That would be helpful to know what kind of rules of you know etiquette. Why did my face so Thanks? Well, yeah I mean the project site or not any of us living in New, York, City and New York State. We have to comply with the mayor's restrictions, mayor's guidelines and this and the governor's guidelines so whether they're on our construction sites or part of this project or not, there's just as a citizen as someone in the area they're required to comply without that all those required requirements, so we'll be sure to include all that in any sort of guideline or documents or requirement sets that we put in place with the contractor, but it would, it will be universal for all of them. Thank you. Let's go to foul and committee members before a value start, because the running a screen is this: is a challenge Michael this I'm trying to figure out I'm getting a test message. If there's a community move ahead, their hand raised and I don't know who that is right background. So I'll go ahead. Sorry, though, we start reminding the committee members this again we can't see everybody's video. You know we limited number of screens that we see, and so, if you go to the participants tab at the bottom of your toolbar, that's where the raised and function is for the committee members. If you're on a phone you hit star nine okay, I'm, not sure we covered interim flood protection, that's the next okay, so, okay! So then I just have one question here. You said that the money is not quite clear about the amphitheater, the Kissimmee, the issue there for people was the issue of noise, so I guess I just want to understand what does this mean? Because that was a big issue for people that live the amphitheater I can hear every city. My house, like this in my house, so I guess that's the question is: what does this mean that you don't have the funding? Cuz I? Don't think that's what people thought about this whole issue. So what does that mean? In terms of noise and the funding just speak to that, because I think people do want to know no I actually understood again, it's an existing condition. We committed to providing a canopy over this amphitheater towards the end of last year and because it was an add-on to the actual design to the actual amphitheater. It went on a separate design track because we couldn't hold up the rest of the project design and not finalize everything else because of the canopy component. So the canopy went on a separate design track, which means it needs its own, separate funding, and it's only if you think about think about it. As a like a multi layer point of view, this is just one layer that got added on to the project, among many other layers. To that we tried to accommodate and coordinate, and a lot of them are moving forward, so the canopy right now again, it hasn't been cut from the project, the canopy we started the preliminary design we presented that earlier, the early earlier this year or I think it was December when we had that granted they were working group. Maybe Genet may be November I can't remember it was. It was back then, but it's think of it as going on temporary pause until we can secure the funds required for this canopy and the fun day for the two finalizing the design and also going to construction for it. I think that's a concern, because we've all heard that the City Council is very, although the city is very much because of kovat, very much looking at possibly having to cut their budget. So what is the light hood? You know it almost sounds like what is the likelihood of getting the funding for the canopy in this cozy and environment when the City Council is talking, the city is talking about cutting funding for all kinds of city agencies. I can tell you I'm a nurse and happen. Quite a few people I know have just been laid off right now, I totally understand, and that's a little over my out of my purview but again Cove. It is such a big, unknown and disruptive events right now that this is where we are. So we just have to wait to see how the next few months are going to unfold and how Council and the mayor are able to navigate through these times, and this is one of those items that on it, just happened to be on this track that we just have to wait for it. So, unfortunately, I don't have a better answer for that and I'm sorry, but we have to wait to see how we can secure funding for this. Let's do this obviously needs some advocacy and probably a discussion at a future cb3 meeting, since we still have some time on that I mean that's one of the notes that we have to make sure we follow up along, but I'm gonna go to Carolyn next I don't want to keep it on me. Can I just ask one thing: we are you looking for the funding, because that's how we would advocate city, state or federal I have to get back to you on that all right! Well, I got your card I'll! Definitely contact! Okay! Can I speak now, hello, yes, town you're on okay, can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you're Carolyn, okay, thank you, Trevor, okay, when we were on the art fence, I had asked questions about the phasing and two maps had been shown. Those maps were not included with the PDF that was sent out after that. Would you please provide the maps that show the phasing as to how you plan the construction for yes, CR I would really appreciate it. I went to the BBC website. I cannot access those maps they need to be made available to the community. Let me take a look at that might have been an oversight. I apologize again, we're not actively holding back information from anybody. If you, if we present it to you on a call, we will be able to send it to you and you can have it so it might have been an oversight or it might be, it might have been just a map. I have to go, look back and see what is it, but it might have been a map that was just a just an example to show something. So let me let me circle back with you on that one: okay phase, one and phase two and open during each phase, and also there was talk of the third phase, which is the parallel conveyance system, which was referred to as phase 3. That information got it to the community. Absolutely it needs to be I agree with you, but I get so those maps or not. Now I'm remembering I think those maps we just pulled out during the call for conversation to use as a reference. Those maps are not ready to be shared publicly because again, these are phase construction maps that are correlated to the timeline and until the timeline is not verified and discussed with the contractor, we can't commit to that just yet so give us a little time. Let us tighten that up and in the next month or two or whenever, if we can finalize that, will definitely share those maps with you and more details on each of those construction phases. No, not construction for the whole project site. Our construction is a phase is a step by step. Every piece has a little timeline attached to it. So September is only the lower east side, ecology, kind of relocation and some trees being transplanted after that we go into mid, fall for pa2 and cb6 area construction. After that we come to your districts for cb3 district for project area, one area, that's towards the end of fall. So as we get closer to those timeframes every time we have to have the contractor on board before we even had construction and before we can even provide a week or a date of shovel to shovel in the ground. So right now, it's July I'm optimistically hopeful that within the next couple months, we'll be able to slowly provide that information as each one of these contractors come on board one after another, all right. Let's do this because I understand what Carmen is saying is that we need those phasing Maps or q. When do you think you'll have those ready again as soon as contractors come on board the discussions meetings are held and finalized, then we'll share it with you. Okay, thank you and we'll follow up with that, but just to everyone on the committee we are taking notes. Ryan is feverishly. Taking all these comments and questions, but we will have follow-up on that I think that was it for committee members, so there's a clock up, but I'm really going to ask for folks because I know there. A lot of people here will see the interim flood protection presentation, so in Michael I can't see everyone and I apologize. If I can't see everyone who's on my screen. Right now is Frank I. Don't me see if I can scroll over and see if okay I know, thank you, Mike I. Don't have that so. Okay, yes, hello! Everyone I would like to ask about what mr. Lynch was talking about closing lanes during the during the night time and that he said that they are going to be closing lanes and doing nighttime work and I do not understand why you are not doing work during the day and closing work. Closing lanes during the day. I think we need to consider community over cars and to be thinking about changing that program and I'd like cb3, to be thinking about that and advocating for that and also he talked about dust monitor and I'd, really like to know how they're going to monitor and what they're you know are they going to say on a windy day they can't put in fill which would delay the project indefinitely because it's always a windy day along the river. So things like that, I would really like more clarification on those kinds of things. Q before you answer just one thing, because I've the two minute also applies to the answer. So if we could just stick to what she asked, we're gonna go a little bit over that time, because I know you have to go into detail, but we're gonna limit the question and answer the two minutes. So those who are asking questions be conscious of that. Thank you sure, really, quick, so nighttime work definitely community over cars. Our priority. We agree with you just as any of you guys living in this area. We live in different areas and their neighborhoods as well, and this is what we would want for our neighborhoods. So there is a limited, a little amount of work that needs to happen during the night time. I'll. Let John explain that a little bit on high level, but again when, as we get closer to that time, with contractors coming on board and verifying the work, the scope that we had set forward, the schedule that we have set forward, we will at that point, be able to come back and give you more details why this nighttime work needs to happen. Can it be? Is there any other alternative, creative way to reduce it more than what we already have, or in any question like that John? Do you wanna jump in yeah, so just real quick? This is John Lynch again to address the two questions. First, when I was referring to closing lanes, that's on the FDR Drive, where it's further north from this community boards area, it's up by 15th, Street, 15th Street north by coned. That's the control, the flawed walk! That's right, adjacent to their parking lot. Regarding dust, you know where we're gonna, oversee material storage and stockpiling, make sure it's covered will have wash down stations to make sure it trucks, aren't bringing dust onto the streets and manage it that way. So it's part of this site safety plan and the contractors and operations. Thank you and I know we're not going to be able to get go into detail for every answer and you can always submit to the folks who have presented Michael who's. Next, there's a number of people already putting their questions in the chat box, so we will borrow it questions that we can't get you to the DDC, so please feel free to keep putting questions in the chat box, Amy I'm, doing birkoff Amy, yes, so I'm, Amy, Birkhoff and my question is about the early closure of the compost yard and originally the rationale that we had was that this was going to be transformed into a temporary lawn for passive recreation. Now it sounds like the rationale is to make life easier for the construction people, and my question is why you would expect that it would be a worse obstruction to construction, to have a small professional operation going on than to have a temporary lawn full of people that have no particular training. It seems like that would be more obstructive than to have a small professional operation. Thank you, I think one of the things I would flag is that the early package with the lawn relocation, as well as the tree transplant, was originally slated for this spring, and so the idea was that there would be an entire season, one to have the open space lawn established, but then also just to have that space open for spring summer and fall, and so there was an idea that there was like a useful type that the other thing to think about is how users or wood access that site, and so, if you think about the access that pedestrian or cyclist would use in order to get you if there had along there, that was the original plan. It would be similar to the phasing plan people most likely becoming- we've been looking at access from the Delancey Street bridge, for example, so that there are alternative ways, but it for a truck. For example, the only way to get in is Montgomery Street, and so that's the real challenge here, particularly now that we have deferred the early good package to the fall. That window of time is just one in which all the construction is anticipated to ramp off later this year. If you want to jump in for about 15 seconds pretty much. What, although said, and the passive lawn space is still on our list, we have to confirm that with a contractor to make sure lines up now that we deferred it to fall. We have to figure out the studying and the planting season so aiming to you're back to your question, I get where you're saying, but it's a lot easier for a contractor to manage groups, small groups of pedestrians walking over the bridge to access the salon, space versus active, highly active construction sites. Like all the explained, with multiple different groups of contractors that are not necessarily part of the same group. We have different agencies that each project has its own contractor so to have another operation mixed in with that, it's one added layer of complication that and risk that we have to consider. So it's more about providing that space temporarily until that piece of the part of the piece of the puzzle that piece of the park has to be closed down and we're still looking at the passive long stage. Thank you. We just take one more question. I know there are two hand raised and I hate to do this, but I really think we're 12 minutes over this one topic. So if you could Michael can give you the task of choosing one person, Thank You, Stevie, three parks and thank you, everyone, DDC, etc. It's just a very quick. Maybe it's more about think point out, because I just want that you guys to make sure you guys are thinking of this on July 7th about 9:15 p.m. right in the enkarans going from pier 42 into the park. There was a weird phenomenon which just pointing out for safety access reasons. You had a incident in the park and I know what it was. But there was a cop I'm, sorry an ambulance trying to get out, but at the same time you had fire engines and police cars getting in and it was a weird little dance because they were confronting each other and they had to back up. So I just want to make sure that you guys have a plan. You can bring back to the community board for safety access, because that was a really seemingly minor thing, but it stood out to me because for my understanding, that really is the only way to go in and out of the park during construction. Thank you. Yeah thanks Frank, that's actually a very good flag. We do have an emergency access plan and this has been tightly coordinated with DLT and other city agencies. God, like you, said that service road is very narrow. It's essentially just a one-way or maybe a very highest narrow type, two way street. If you can squeeze trucks and cars in and there's a there's, a bottle, necking effect there, like you mentioned, so we do have a plan that has been all hashed out and finalized during the design phase last year and the year before that and I'm happy to follow up and provide details. I'll try to pull this out as its own separate item and we'll upload it on the website to focus the community's reference. All right. Thank you. - I see Jennifer and Diane. If you want to type in your questions to the community board. I'm gonna go with the next presentation, I'll see if I can work him in some way, but up now is the internal first protection. This is jennifer, rocha, I'm, sorry, but you're some person set the expectation. If we waited patiently, we would be able to ask a question well. I appreciate. There was a lot of information to go through. I. Do not feel it's fair for those of us who have attended this patiently to be cut off I. You ask please that you would take more questions if hands are raised because you set the expectation in the beginning, we would have it and I. Don't think it's fair for us to have sat through all of this and not have the opportunity to ask a question. Jennifer I'm asking you to type in your question I. Actually you said it was a question or comments, and mine are comments with an end, very small question. Jennifer, please I'm gonna have to meet you if you can type in your comment. What I want to do is I'm going to work in you and I an somewhere in this presentation, but I want to get the next presentation or the next presentation up. It doesn't mean I'm not going to come back to you. It's just that we really have a lot of other items, but I will try and work you back in depending on how long the flood protection is I, know you shot through this, but there's still other things we have to talk with, and this is all eser stuff. So that being said, let's begin the presentation- I'm not gonna, forget about you. Jennifer and I am Mike I, believe you have to unmask Rosen, correct she's all set to go so yes, hi, it's Susan, Rosen I. Think Heather was gonna. Kick us off I'm, just trying to share my screen. Sure Heather are you okay? Maybe she was not able to be on right at the moment. Are you seeing the presentation? The first slide? Okay, that's not interesting! Okay! That was earlier today. Okay, why is that I think Heather's just trying to yeah I'm on? Are you able to hear me? Yes, what okay Susan pulling this up I can get started. We know we're all here for this at the time, so my name's Heather writer and the Assistant Commissioner for risk reduction in recovery in New, York, City, emergency management and joined by Susan who's. Our program manager, I know some of you have us put that before. So as she's pulling this up, we are so we will be presenting on our feasibility analysis for the interim flood protection measures program. You know, as we've been working in speaking with the community over the last year. You know we had heard the request identify if there was a feasible option for the ispm measures along the eser corridor. So with our engineering team we and the mayor's office a resiliency in City, Hall we've gone through a planning process that started last year and we were wrapping up right around the time of coal bed. So we've completed our feasibility and we are here to prevent our findings today and then I think when Susan gets this up and we will walk through the deck. Okay, sure I'm, really sorry. I tried this today with another zoom and it seemed to work but I'm, not that good. So I'll just ask you to skip through the slides, so my name is Susan. Rosen I am I work at a New, York City emergency management, managing the interim flood protection measures program. As you know, we were asked to look at the Eastside coastal resiliency project area and determine if it would be feasible to design and implement an IFP M project, while those long-term measures are being constructed. So first I'm going to provide you with a very brief overview of the IFP M program, we'll look quickly at the ESC, our flood plain compared to a potential IFP, M floodplain and then move into the results of the analysis. So the next slide, please, the IFP M program was established in 2016. The goal, as you see, was to reduce low-level high reoccurrence coastal flood risks, while New York City continues to advance its longer-term coastal protection needs. Our focus has always been on protecting critical facilities and some low-lying neighborhoods. The timeline typically takes approximately 24 months from initial analysis to construction completion. Ifp M provides flood risk reduction for the Overland surge from lower intensity, higher frequency, tropical storms or hurricanes. It does not mitigate against rainfall. Flooding, protect against severe events like sandy or fully eliminate flood risks. We're also not able to activate for other types of storms such as nor Easter's, as it says, due to limitations in forecasting I really want to stress. Ifp M is not a life safety program. The intent is to protect infrastructure so that residents can get back into their home's faster and city agencies can continue to operate. All residents are expected to follow evacuation orders issued by New York City, even in areas protected by I of p.m. we are not about life safety. Evacuation orders still apply at all. I F p.m. sites next slide. So as I'm sure many of you are familiar with. This is a slide showing the ESC our project area with the blue, shading I'm. Sorry, the next slide I think you're yeah there you go so I'm right there. As you know, the blue shading shows the extent of the flooding that the eser project will prevent when it's completed. So the next slide. Please, then this is an image of the flooding that a potential interim flood protection measures project might reduce if it were to be deployed in this area next slide. So whenever we look at a site, we have to look at. We looked at, we do looked at different solutions along this entire alignment. Right we looked at the whole project area. We looked at a smaller sort of multi block level and at the slight site level, whenever we look at any of our projects, we have to take many factors into consideration so and any one of them can be a block to the feasibility. So first we have to look at the drainage. Where can the water enter a site from outside an IFP M alignment? Is that can anything be done to stop it and is it feasible within our program? Then we have to look at the timeline for facilities such as a wastewater treatment plant or a firehouse, or something like that. They take an average of 18 months and neighborhood sites, as I said before often take at least 24 or more months, and then we have to look at how many coastal storm seasons will we be offering protection before the permanent mitigation is in place? We look at the risk reduction benefit, so what level of protection can we provide? What infrastructure is actually at risk in the area that we can protect and will we be protecting for multiple hurricane seasons? Again, the complexity has to be looked at. Neighborhood sites bring many complications, including traffic or pedestrian impacts, aesthetic concerns and other kinds of complex issues like that and in an area like the SCR, where there's active construction, that's also complex, but we sort of loop that into the operational impacts will the measures impede traffic or operations during an activation and possibly more critically, will we be able to deconflict between the IFP m measures and the ongoing construction for the permanent mitigation? If we were in a site like the SCR, as we've been in some other sites, we have to be constantly thinking about the re-engineering and accommodating changes due to construction. This would then possibly leave it open to vulnerability during a coastal storm. Then we have to look at the estimated cost of what an alignment would cost is the cost justified by the amount of the risk reduction provided and the number of seasons we can protect for next slide. Please, in all of these considerations, drainage is the primary consideration for feasibility. Our engineering analysis found that the drainage issues across the three levels were insurmountable, given the parameters and the interim nature of our program and I'll come back to that in more detail. In a moment, we looked at the timeline and, looking at this with the you know, estimated 24 months from concept to installation, your ESC, our project would be well on its way when we looked at the entire project area or the multi block level and on the site level. Other planned permanent mitigation projects are estimated to be completed within months of the same time frame that I F p.m. would be completed. Looking at the risk reduction benefit with the measures available to I F p.m. we can only provide risk reduction to the 15-year return level across the site or in a multi block, and much of the infrastructure within this flood extent is already elevated above the flood height or as mentioned at the site level will be completed about the same time as I F p.m. if not before, on the complexity across all three levels. An IFP M project would be a significant daily presence in the area, and these are all very complex and large alignments. In the operational side of things, we cannot place IFE m directly in the ESC. Our construction area, as there would be too many construction, conflicts and IFM would be subject to constant design, constant redesign again. You know this could be happening during the coastal storm season and we would possibly be not be able to protect during that season and then during a coastal storm activation, the multi block and the site level would likely see very large traffic and pedestrian impacts, and you see some estimated costs at the bottom. We compared those potential alignments to current sites and our portfolio to estimate those costs and just to give you a brief idea and I know that you know, when you compare that to you know the cost of a project like the eser, it's, it seems like a very minimal cost, but you have to compare the benefit that you'd be getting for that. The next slide, please. So, as I mentioned, I wanted to go into a little bit more detail about the drainage because, as I mentioned, that is the really the biggest roadblock it. The first thing that we look at and in any site, so this image shows you again. The 15 year return level in blue that a very conceptual line of AI fpm protection would be addressing, and if you can see the sort of green lines, this is again a very preliminary idea of where the engineers thought you might be able to put some AI fpm measures. But if you look at the purple lines on the diagram, that's the sewer infrastructure that leads underneath that line so and it would bring water in through this sewer infrastructure and into the dry side. The next slide shows this in a little bit more detail. So this image illustrates and I can't use my cursor, but you can see on the water side. You've got the pipe for the sewer system and about half in the middle of the page. You have this backflow prevention, so there's backflow prevention on this drain. But what would happen? Is the water would come up over land? Is it floods go past the location of that backflow prevention enter into the storm drains flow up through the rest of the sewer system and on the other side of what is a potential Hesco or I fpm measure in the green. There see the water coming up there. The next slide. This shows a very similar image where there is no backflow prevention. The same thing would happen with water coming up, both through the sewer system and over land, going back into the catch basins and again coming up on what we call the dry side of our alignment, and there are numeral placed numerous places along the esa, our coastline, where you have these open lines that would lead to this kind of issue. Next slide, we looked at the site level, so this is an example of the NYCHA borough houses. Again you see a line of a green, very potential alignment and you see inside the little red dots and that represents catch basins in that inside the alignment there 21 catch faison's that would need to be covered, at least to prevent water coming up and that's a huge number, the next slide. This is Wald. This is showing another potential alignment, and this site has 15 catch basins that would need to be covered or addressed in some way. So it's a huge number and our deployment I just want to mention that in most cases a fpm would have stopped evaluating a site once the drainage analysis was determined to be unmanageable, but in this case we took the next steps of looking at all those other considerations to be especially thorough and responsive to the concerns of this community. But in summary, an interim flood protection measures. Project for this area is not feasible. The most practical actions are for the community and the city to work toward implementing the permanent work as quickly as possible and I'm happy to take any questions. Those are annex, slides, I mean that's. This is really the heart of it and I'm. Happy I would refer to those if we have questions that you know bring those up, but those are also there for people to look at. If you know, I don't want to take up too much time here, I thought you were going to take a break. Okay. Michael. Can you tell me if what committee members have their hands raised? The Jonesville s? Do you know who was first Wow? Okay, in terms of like the Baruch houses, they have a bunch of fences all over the place and they have the semi temporary interventions and I. Think, like I said for the person for Lower, East, Side, Power Partnership said that you have those Hesco barriers outside like a Smith & Lansing, - and now. Luke has all of this going on that the people are very aware that they're low lying it's somewhat dangerous, etc. What kind of talks have you had with the people that are doing the interventions in houses now something that's a little less complicated for the people? You almost feel, like you imprison down there, you developed something a little simpler to explain to those people, especially the seniors Valentina, so hi we are not working at Borough. Emergency Management has no project there. That is the NYCHA permanent mitigation project that is slated to Beacon finished in the last quarter of 2021, so that project is well on its way and that's their permanent mitigation intervention. I, don't know what that article is. It's not our project, I think what they mean is that it's probably partially it's a it's a system of deployables, but that is their program and their plan for permanent mitigation at that development. Okay, yes, thank you. My question is similar to Valentina zone I'm from Baruch and we have flood walls going up. My question was about the drainage teacher report. Take into consideration that baruj has walls going up for drainage, because I seen that you said in baruj, they have 21 spots that guy you flooded, so you guys are not working in conjunction with them No. So the work that's going on. There is a nitro project and whatever they have done and their assessment and their engineers have had to do whatever is necessary for that flood protection. My point of dressing, that, for you, is it telling you that during an interim project like we would be putting out, we would not be doing any. You know capital, construction or any addressing of things like the drainage in a way that is going to be a permanent solution for that NYCHA might be doing, but I have no knowledge of what NYCHA is doing. Let me just add some context to this. One of the things that we resolved is that the city would take on or look at a feasibility analysis of internal flood detection to the area. So this is the results of this study. So there's no work being done. We just asked for this study to be done, so we could take a look at whether the area could get Internet protection, so this is separate from a lot of the work that's going on in NYCHA for the whole city. If you want to look at an example of what this protection provides or what it's been done, I would urge look, it's masasa says val has said also at 82, Rutgers and Lyons in - they have the Hesco barriers and some in some cases they put up jersey, but if we have a coastal storm and we are told to activate, we will come out and fill in the gaps that are left for access at those sites with Tiger dams generally. So that's what this analysis is about. It's separate from what nature is doing on its own for permanent flood protection. Let me go to I need to go to someone else tile, because really it's are they any other committee members. Okay, I could help with the responses, but yeah I, yeah I recognize them might be a little confusing. You know really. This is the effort of us sewing the night just about Lance is that we were trying to think at different scales. So you know in looking at I. Is there anywhere in the ESC our area that we could provide our temporary protection? So knowing the drainage was not, it wasn't was impossible. We couldn't, the drainage was not going to. Let us be able to find a solution for the whole neighborhood, so we said, can we do smaller sites and that's why we looked at nature as well, but unfortunately, in the two nights and developments that Susan spoke about, there's the drainage and in the sewer, Network, and so all the different sewers? It just creates other ways for water to get in that our program can't protect again next month. We're going to talk about that. So I know that Brian is cramping her hand, but she let's see if we can get him in or at least to the subcommittee, something quick yeah so that they know that yeah yep we've spoken to nature and they were part of our analysis and when we, when we looked at options for is p.m. at the engineers we included Mesa from the get-go, so they're doing their permanent work. You know our program, our hope was to see if there was an option for us to do something in the short term, but there fortunately they're moving fast and they're. You know they're looking and think they're gonna provide long-term flood reduction with their projects so and they have all the findings that we had it. A part of our study as well so I see thank you, Mike Lucy Carolyn, and that should be it okay, so we're gonna go with those for right now, after Carolyn yeah go ahead. Okay, a quick question about the image that you showed for the Stuyvesant Cove area and the interim flood protection, because the bulk of our water that came during sandy came straight down, Avenue C straight from the East River, and it was like between four to eight to four feet, depending on where you were in the neighborhood. So that was one of the reasons that we had been asking for interim flood protection, particularly in that area, to block the overflow from the surge of the river mm-hmm. So could you please explain why yeah I think it's go back to the to the presentation? If you could go to slides, 23 and I could start speaking about it, there I think okay, so these highlights are showing the low points of the alignment and I think you're talking about the area all the way to the right. That's the circle. Number three. Is that correct, you're? Okay, if you could go to the next slide? Okay, so this is an image. This is not necessarily that point, but this is showing you an image of you know the ser alignment and to illustrate the low point so the road there or the pathway they are sort of the low point between these two small hills with the trees. When we place Hesco barriers or tiger dams, we add four feet of protection. That's the parameters of our program. Can you go to the next side, so you can see where this is. An image of the four feet of the house goes in that space, and this is an approximate 15 year storm that would stop the water. Anything above that is gonna flow over the top of the house goes sandy with s'mores with certainly more feet than this then four feet of protection at this point, so anything above that is going to flow right in and as you sort of see in their illustration and I'm, not saying that this is an accurate depiction, but most of the buildings and the infrastructure at the level are already higher than this point. So in that sense, I, F p.m. is not going to provide that sort of protection. Does that answer the question? I guess it depends I, think this a little bit of backstory it has goes, and the temporary internal protection only provide for how many feet and for what type of storm so for above ground four feet of additional height to whatever the level of the ground is there? So you have to talk it. You have to start at the low point in your alignment. That's the own, that's the absolute height that we can achieve in flood protection, and if we were, if the error were to experience a sandy type of event which we've deployed surgery, so our plan for our coastal storm activation is to deploy at all of our sites, because when the forecasters give us their forecast four days out when we make a decision, whether we're going to deploy or not, we aren't sure what that storm is going to look like. They may tell us today. We think it's going to be an X kind of storm with this kind of direction and this kind of wind speed. But in the three days between the time we have to make that decision and the time we need to be fully deployed. That can change. So it could change and it could be the storm that we're protecting for or it could be lower or it could take a right and go back out to sea or it could be a sandy level storm. We don't know so our plan is to deploy everywhere. Guess what I'm really asking, because I think what Carol tried to ask in a certain way is that what we need to understand is that this type of interim flood protection plan really only that goes up to about four feet: any storms over that, even if you're going to deploy them the water's going to overtop the barrier, and if you have a low-lying area or high area, that's above a certain height, you can't necessarily install the or this mate this system may or may not work and I think just trying to make that clear. Yeah addition, our engineers, looked at the infrastructure in the area. You know and determined that for the most part, it's all you know above the level that we can give protection to. So we wouldn't be adding any benefit to be there. Yeah I mean how they're just and I expand on that. So we always. We always have to look at the low point, because water is going to come in from the lowest point so that you know we spoke about that. Avenue ce7 Sankoh area is a lower point. So in looking there we said. Okay, even if we could put something on the ground with our measures, I just want to go back to the key. Finding water will still come through the sewers underneath and make the what are those to the drives. I'd was so the water will still find ways to come around. Our barriers will come underground or it will come from other lower points in the area and come around our barrier. Thank you. I didn't yeah, so even at this storm that you see in this picture, but the drainage as it is water's going to come through. Thank you. I'm gonna go Mike. We still have four hands because that sands we're gonna well guess who goes first Jennifer and Diane. Well, Michael. You can own me: Jennifer, okay, hello, I'm, a Middle, East resident and I just learned of this project. Last night, I'm gonna speak very speedily, so I can exercise that first, two minutes. Most of my comments are comments. I will say, first and foremost in terms of the city presentation tonight, I am my own firm. A communications, firm, I teach communications internally at top corporations to top executives. I am awestruck at the amount of vagueness ambiguity. The theme of at a later date will fill you in on that we'll get there you're about to start a 1.4 five billion dollar project and you're still in the thick of figuring it out. It actually seems more like a strategy, then an actual answer. It seems calculated the fact that this is not being publicized to the public. Now it's wrong and immoral, because I believe it's a strategy to keep them in the dark, also just in terms of the city and what's going on, people might need to be sleeping in this park because they won't have homes. Your mayor, who you work for the city, is begging the federal government every day to give us more money, because people's homes are going to be lost and people won't be able to eat and to invest in a project at this time to spend 1 billion of taxpayer dollars. I do want this. Taxpayer dollars is absolutely egregious and inhumane, and for all of you who work on this and know you're collecting a paycheck, but there is a moral compass that I hope. All of you will think about because it's simply wrong. Our city has tremendous resource constraint because of koban 19. You are also creating a public health risk. This idea of containing dust, it's I'm, sorry, but complete and utter hogwash. You will not be able to contained us. You will infect these communities. This is also a socio-economic Lee challenge community. That is all simply wrong. I want to announce today that many of us who just learned about this we'll do everything in our power to enlist corporations. High-Level celebrities, we've already begun to work on it, as well as the community to educate them where you are all deliberately holding out on information, and my question is: has this ever been officially approved by the state legislature because all the materials I read say it has not? That is my most pertinent question. I, don't know parks wants to answer that, because that was a full two minutes. But if someone wants to briefly comment on that dirty deed, ect I, don't think we can follow up I'd like an answer and I'd like comments just in general, Jenna Jennifer, I'm, gonna meet you I'm gonna. Give them an opportunity to respond a bit, though, if they do I'm. Also gonna give a brief comment: hi. This is Minelli educate what the mayor's office. Can you hear me? Yes, hi, so to the first question. Yes, this project is funded with taxpayer dollars. This project is funded with federal funds from the sandy from the rebuild by design competition, as well as capital funds from the city which are funded through bonds I'm. Your second question: this project has not required state approval, but we have gone through all of the city level approvals and we're just completed this past year. Okay, thank you before we move on to the next speaker, I'm just gonna Jennifer I'm, not sure. Maybe you are that committee members we're all volunteers here and we've been working on this project for years. I know that some people are just finding out about this, but it just and I could probably speak for a lot of committee members who have too many evenings of meetings of community engagement and for quite some time. So maybe we need to do more as a community board, but this project is going through and q. You can correct me on how many years we've been doing. This people will walk out their door with their children to go to the park and there will be bulldozers and they won't understand what's happening, and all of you have a civic responsibility to acknowledge that and to know how many lives and heartbroken sorry Jennifer we've, given you giving you your time to speak. I was just trying to make a note that we might need to do more because I think that's get many members. We really think that everyone knows about this project, because just at the time we invest every single night on Thursday after I can assure you they don't, but we're gonna make the community aware, because we don't trust you all right so doing that. I can assure you also that the community is not aware and also I, think you need to work on not only addressing I'm. Sorry Michaels is the next speaker I hate to do this, but this is be aware that your question will include the responses. I live very near Carolyn, so I echo her questions and concerns particularly about inner, employ protection in the Stuyvesant Park area. I, listen to the explanation that you just gave her so I. Will you know, try to process that information, and so my question is the document that you showed tonight. Will that be made available publicly on the website like DVDs? Does their presentations every time they make them available to us? Will this interim flood protection study be available to the public so that we have time to look it over absorb it, and you know: ask follow-up questions. I, think it's out on the cb3 website to the park's meeting. The two links are right there. The second link is there now yeah? Okay, thank you. Michael. We have two more speakers. I mean we could be I, know Tommy. We have that two-minute timer for both the question into answer: Thank You, Trevor. First of all, I want to correct the mayor's office. There is currently litigation we're in court. The community is in court over 90 people are signed on as plaintiffs on the alienation case. There is a strong opinion by everybody, including our state legislators, that the city violated the state law regarding alienation. That case will be heard sometime in the near future and we don't know the outcome, but it's. It is not true that there is no litigation. Secondly, I'd like to know where any outside engineering firms consulted or used in your study, or was this all in-house but and let me ask my questions and then finally, because when we had an outside independent consultant review eser, he came up with several serious problems with the current plan, including the flood glades floodgates, the amount of fill the failure to consider a hundred year storm. So where was this all done in-house and my final part of it is you're telling us now that you know nothing about a 350 million dollar Nitra project that regard that is involving resilience and that now I even hear that project will be totally useless because the water is now gonna back up until you complete your project into those walls. That's what you're saying is saying you can't do the interim flood protection, because the water will back up is to the sewer. Sorry, though, sewers are in the middle of those projects, let's back up a little bit, I'll answer the questions about the 9jq. No I, don't know anything about that project because it's not in my scope of work to work with their permanent mitigation, their permanent mitigation and their engineers. I'm, assuming took all of those drainage issues into consideration within our program. There's nothing that we have in our parameters of our program that could address the drainage issues. That doesn't mean it can't be addressed. Those drainage issues, the drainage issues on the whole entire alignment are possible to be addressed, but not within our program. Those are major capital construction projects. Those are not part of an interim flood protection solution. So that's those questions, I'm. Sorry, you asked a few questions in there. I think yeah I mean yeah I, think that covers it. I don't want to speak for I. Don't think we can speak for nature. But again our analysis was what are measures, the feasibility of what the tools in our toolbox for our program and for our program, because everything is on the surface and it's these limited number of measures. It wasn't feasible and it's useful because water would come in also through the sewer because of the power of the way our program works in our tools work, but we can't speak on behalf of nature they're, not here so I. Think earlier in the in the conversation, I think that those questions certainly should be directed to them and have an opportunity for them to respond to their program. Where any engineer, all right. Yes, we've. We have on call maritime engineering, firm, BT, mi, with Maupin and Nichols, with our engineering for the furthest analysis, and then we worked also very closely with the ESC our engineers as well. So it was a sharing of information. Well, we have - this. The Citiz Tommy were over. No, we have access to that engineer's report. There's no formal report, so duty, Thank, You, Tommy, we're gonna, continue. I'm sorry, but Michael there, two more first, okay, so regarding I F p.m. you talked about all the engineering and the mechanical planning, but where is the social planning? I talked to I've heard about this since last fall and men talk to residents and everybody thinks this work is being done right now around the night. You says so they can shelter in place. They do not know. They're gonna have to evacuate. We have a very limited number of evacuation centers and with the need to socially distance. In a sense, we have even less space for people. So why are we working together now with people with local residents? Not just the night show but all affected buildings to make sure they have an evacuation plan. This could happen very quickly and, as you do, such as Senya, it's changed, I'm, really afraid that you are leaving people out and yet there's research that shows that communities where people know how to work together where they trust each other, where they trust government fare better in disruptions, save lives. This way so I'm very concerned that you not only have you left them out of the report. The entire ester is a top-secret to people in the park. We use it every day for their health and well-being. Deceit. When are you going to walk into the park and talk to people who don't come to meetings? Don't use social media may not read your little posters and it's really quite scary for me, as a local resident, to know that there's nearly 10,000 people who live right at the river's edge. We have no plan. What are you gonna do about that I'm, not sure if you're addressing that to emergency management and why fpm so as I said that I fpm projects, you still have to evacuate, that is for an if' p.m. project. Well, at all of our sites we have done, and you know numerous outreaches to the community. I went to Smith houses several times so everywhere that we have an if' p.m. project. We have communicated as we can and New York City. Emergency management is constantly working to educate the community across New York City about evacuations and how to prepare, offer presentation, we're happy to offer regions around coastal storm planning. We have a different presentation around educating the community around evacuation and hurricanes, and we are happy to come and present and continue our outreach. We, you know we do it every year and we will continue to do so and we're happy to continue doing that. So I hope you start tomorrow and you go door-to-door and get people get floor, captain's going Wendy, I'm, gonna I'm. Just let me speak because well said, but it's a strategy to keep the horrible. This your can and it's a shame. It's almost all right. We're gonna have to go with the all mute. I didn't really want to do that because I, no one wants to speak, like that. You mentioned that. Okay, as Michael mentioned this presentation and the previous presentation available in the cb3 website as a link you can download in the study. This is not the end of any discussion. It's just that we're trying to get back on track with this project, because we've been meeting on this for years and years of community engagement, so this is more of a check-up to see where our and I'm looking at the questions in the chat and we'll try and get him answered the next meeting or at another community engagement process. I. Think that that's the end of the presentation for the interim protection study, so I think I am for that presentation and we're going to move on to the next agenda item. Thank you, Michael I, think third, entry presentation or task force yeah out, are you also presenting or no I, can give a quick update, all the channels Parks I'm joined by my colleague, Haley Hicks who's with parks, forestry. We were asked by the community board to give a presentation or an update on the tree planting task force. This is related to the east side, coastal resiliency project, specifically the a thousand Nearpod tree plantings that we have started to do already. This was a recommendation. Great idea by Wendy that we've taken on and started I know that there are a lot of questions about trees or, if next time it is today we're speaking specifically about the tree planting times worse, Haley's gonna give an update on where things are. We don't have a presentation, it's just a quick apology. Okay, so I'll go ahead for those of you that don't know me, my name is Haley Hicks and I work with NYC parks in the tree, planting program, I'm, managing all of the tree plantings in response to es CR and all related community correspondence, including the tree planting task force. You know it's a late night, so I'll be very brief in my updates. So for those of you that don't know we are planting 1,000, strict trees and the area surrounding East River Park, just in an effort to bring more tree canopy back into this area. So couple quick updates. In February of this year we held two community walk throughs in cv3, which was just kind of an open forum for community members to learn more about streets. We plan and ask questions and provide suggestions, and this helped us kind of focus in on what the community wants to see with these tree plantings. Things like tree guards, flowers, tree tags in the tree beds. As for a planting update, so fall 2019 we planted 319 trees towards the SE. Are planting goal spring 2020. So, as many of you heard, our construction was paused this spring due to Cove at 19 and the stop-work order, and as a result, unfortunately, no trees were planted and cv3 this spring. However, for fall 2020 we do plan to get back on track with planting and we're planning about 150 trees for this fall, and the last update I wanted to give was regarding the task force, the tree planting task force. We would like to get our next meeting on the calendar for early September ahead of the fall planting, so that I can hopefully provide you with a more comprehensive update by then and just address. Whatever concerns you might have and I will email you the details for this meeting. So, lastly, you know if you have any questions about street tree planting or you want to attend the tree planting task force meetings, please feel free to reach out to me. Michael can provide my contact information if you need it and I'm also happy to stick around for some questions. If I need to thank you for that update and could be brief and just giving us what's going on one of the main questions and I think you have answered it is that we do have funding for these trees and they will be planted, but when I try to do other things, what I'm running is you're meeting my computer. It doesn't like that. So can you just put your email address in the chat box and then I'll dispose everybody yeah I will do that right now and I'm going to ask for questions from the committee. Although this is a brief update, we will have more information and at the September meeting, but it's anyone every question. There are no questions but I'm, showing you all my queue public schools. Thank you. Thank you for writing. The fifth of happiness that was okay: is there anyone from the community? Who would like to ask the question about the tree planting? Okay, thank you for that appointment. I see one hand we're gonna. Take that last one I don't know who that is. Hopefully you can identify yourself. This is Mary Jo Burke. Can you hear me? Thank you. My questions are the trees that have been planted so far. How many of them have died and what is the maintenance program in place for keeping the trees alive as many as possible going forward so out of the trees that we planted, which is a little over I? Think 400 and response to ESC are so far I, don't know an exact number of trees that have died within their two-year guarantee period, but when the trees died, we do like a completion inspection and we replace those trees within a couple of weeks after they have been reported dead. So all the trees that been planted so far should still be in good condition and they still are within the two-year maintenance period where, if they do die or fell or in poor condition, the contractor is required to replace them. So I hope that answers your question about maintenance. Do yes, is there a map or something that, in terms of where the trees have been planted, so we can actually check on them and yeah I? Have a map of that I provided our last task force meeting of all the trees that have, and that did so far for this project, so I'll have that sent out again and Michael? Can you tell us where that is I'll email it to you, Michael bird estivation yeah? We can well have it sent to the district office and we'll have it put on the website somewhere, Thanks and one day you raise your hand late, but I'm gonna, give you the opportunity to close us out, because we really got to talk about district needs. Mints 9 o'clock go ahead with the of its brief hi. Can you hear me? Thank you. Haley I just wanted people here to know that a thousand street-race that were originally promised to see b3 back in last spring I mean 2019 spring, are now being shared between c b, 3 and c b6. So they're there we're actually getting fewer trees in see b3. Then we had been promised originally and as a task force. Member I recall that earlier meetings, it was you or not. They stressed who said that the read those trees that were planted last fall, except for the two in Sarah D Roosevelt Park were actually part of earlier request that were being fulfilled by this tree planting program and not part of this 1,000 trees that those pointless well just start to this fall so which is correct. So those early plantings are a part of the 1,000 trees that were granting, but I would like to say during those community walk throughs that we did. We gathered a lot of feedback based on like you know what types of trees won't want to see go in and where the community thinks they should go, and we got a lot of feedback that tree canopy should be going in closest to surrounding East River Park. So we did come up with the plan that we would start our surveying right along the perimeter of East River, Park and kind of spread out from there. So the majority of the trees will be and see three I. Just can't I don't have like exact number to give you, but that is our plan to start closest to the park and extend out from there with our surveying. Thank you and there will be a task force meeting in September. We can go into depth about that another question so Thank You Kaylee Alda for that update glad to see those trees in our neighborhood so that ends our agenda item folks have questions at chat box. We remain open and we'll try and get them answered at future meetings. Thank you. We're gonna go into a discussion about district needs, so if any one who is not a committee member wants to sit and listen to some very dry stuff, you will do it hopefully think finish. This is about 3540 minutes. I, don't know if he's on, but did you want to see if the park manager is on the do bridge before it first you're? Absolutely right, Michael forgot about that Jimmy. Are you on I know sometimes you're on the phone hit star nine. To raise your hand if you're on the phone, he must not be hot. Okay, it's Susan on! Yes, she is okay! I'm here are you gonna put the district needs on the on the screen, I just downloaded it cuz Trevor. Just to me so give me two seconds not maybe more than two seconds and Ryan. If you could just take notes on this, I will do the edits. You know. Attract changes on a word program. Didn't have to worry about that and if you remember, we discussed this in our last meeting. So this is going over what we've already decided and gotten some answers on, but not all of them. So the first actually, the first section Trevor I'll, do this with you I think, because we, the two of us what's going on, and so the first section under Parks Recreation the bullet points, I, don't believe there. We request that anyone had requested any changes, or there was any decision for changes in that correct. So then we undergo parks buildings for each of those bullet points. Trevor is inserted answers, so I actually think a lot of this can be taken out on the bullet points. Okay, I'm, just gonna say something to Kate I apologize. I may not have gotten everything about Saturday girls of a park correct because it was a little confusing kisses. No I'm just saying there was a lot going on with that. So just make sure this sorry I just want to make sure, because I was trying to make sure that I got everything right about SDR Park. So if you're taking a look, I just want to make sure that, because I did change some stuff that, if anything, needs to change, no I, think you stuff quite a while ago and in the notes too so yeah. Let me come I'm correct. That's all I'm! Sorry, Susan I, don't know why it's servos well practiced in building it's used by Park workers. It's not under construction and the bathrooms have reopened a bit all right. So we'll change that and okay, but we'll change that so the first one is used only by parts workers except for bathrooms that are open for the public right. Is that correct? Kay, like your new, muted, you're me? Oh there we are. It wasn't letting me unmute, yes, correct. Okay, so I think that's how it should be changed. So, yes, STR, Street, Hester building that is used only by parks, workers, correct I'm. Sorry, okay, sorry, that's me yeah! Maybe we should just mmm anyway parks. The Hester Street building is only used by park workers. Yes, I guess I mean. What's that's corrected the arse feasto vendor. Do some wording to you know just change. You know change the wording. A little bit right, yeah, Seward, Park, Seward, Park, House bathrooms are now open and space is being used by the lower Eastside ecology, Center I, don't know if you want to put something in there. This space should be, you know, continue to remain as a community space or something like that. I, don't think the space is currently being used by the lower Eastside ecology center I thought it was being renovated, so it can be used by that slated for their use. Okay, so we'll change in lameness, just spaces beans- well, don't yeah I mean we've got. Maybe we should for this section kind of time dated because don't forget this is for July 2021. So maybe we should put in language the same after at the time of this writing or something of that sort. I think the same thing so same thing with LaGuardia for Baruch, bathhouses and I'm. Gonna hope that by the you know, we should make me make a note that by the time we actually vote in October to check on whether the RFP is released. Okay and Tompkins Square Park, I, guess what you have there. You know so, maybe where it says the building should be renovated, should all be renovated for use by the community, and you know after it says these properties are underutilized. The district maybe have a sentence there that you know we're asking for community used for all of these buildings. For you know some one sentence: if he knows same moment what we want to go forward Susan, let me back up a little bit. I just want to make sure Brian captures that, because she's taking notes so you're saying that we should rewrite this very coherent following the sentence where it says, according to a 596 acres study, the following properties are underutilized the district. They should have one sentence following that saying that we want all these properties to be fully activated for community use. Okay, so Susan you're just trying to separate that out, so it says reopen for community use and you want a new sentence. That's about yeah, so that there is an ask. You know, there's a action going forward, got it conversation, I would suggest we take that whole thing out, because everything's either done or funded or under construction. You say: take the comfort station out the hole, yeah the whole section yeah we got what we asked for okay. So let's take that out. I'm sorry, but oh I, guess that they are renovating the bathroom on Broome nevermind gotta, celebrate around recreational use. We left exactly the same. I, don't think no one's mentioned any need for any change there. For the rodent section, I sent Trevor today a chart of the number of girls in each Park which I send that to the committee. They might find it useful and I'd like to put it in the appendix of the district need statement. Okay, chance to look at it, but I will send it, and should we attach it to this document? That's fine can I. Ask you if the given the MTA dig, should that be in that section or since I haven't seen it? Is it already? It's not well what it does have a number of burrows in STR part, and it shows us the air park is one of the few parts that really needs still need maintenance and we're yeah. Just by the time. This comes out, that'll be in full swing supposedly but yeah Oh anyway. So let me there's a lot of cross outs here. So maybe, if I just read, what's left, it'll help us be easier. The rat reduction program implemented in 2017 has not shown success uniformly in cd3, but there has been sick some parts. The reduction of rat girls, continues to be at historic lows. The parks most in need of continued treatment are Allen, Street, Mall, one, the East River Park and STR Park, and then I have a table of about 15 parks with year by year. The number of girls which trip will send you guys tomorrow and will attach to this document right. Thank you. I have a question. This is Robin. It seems a little bit like your sink to thing. It's a little confusing that paragraph to me. It sounds like you're saying it's great they're at a historic low, but they're not great, because it's not working. So no. What I said it's not work in cd3. So if you're thinking at the whole community board, the overall rate of rat reduction is not good. However, in both night show developments and in parks, those two areas are very good. The private properties are where it has failed and the private properties are so bad that overall, the number has not gone down, but parks have gone down. And yes, when you see the table, you'll see that parks have gone down in a stunning manner, so the table will make the sense better. Okay for wireless access. We just got that information today and there's. Actually we should add one part to the so cd3 residents would greatly benefit greatly from free wireless access and public parks. Let me just see current currently available in Tompkins Square and Hamilton fish and there's one. Do you remember what the other part is pretty Smith's playground yeah, so we should add Hamilton fish, Park and Alfred E, Smith playground, and so where it says, still need update on this. You can take that out. The update is the Alfred E Smith Creek maintenance, we're not looking for substance change, but trevor's mark this for a stronger language, stronger language change for maintenance, which you'll be even more Sneed it by the time this comes out community gardens. We have no changes. There is increased illicit drug use here. Forty two I, don't think. There's any there's, no changes. There's nothing to update, really still needs money. Libraries or you want to handle that so I actually heard from them. Today. I sent the request they they're in the process of retrieving this information, so I should there they're on it. I should get it soon. So, yes, I'll just substitute the new figures. When we get it, that's what I do every year. Ok! So there is one and Michael if you could go back up from the maintenance section. I think we need stronger language, so I'm going to have to volunteer to come up with some language for that go back and we Susan just four bullet points. So we can clean up this and get this as close to completion as we can, and this is for the committee members also I know. Parks had talked to us about this. What are we really trying to say here? You know looking at the inequities that have been emphasized by kovat and the need for our communities. Are you so what's taking notes, so be good, we'll write it. If you don't seven and about you, know the need for our community to have well-maintained open space and the need for public space in our community. Something of that sort and yeah I mean I. Think there's. You know a ton of examples that we can give if we need to about you know overgrown lawns and parks that make them unusable. You know that provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes. You know, especially now that parks are seeing an increased usage because of kovaydin people. You know it's get into the parks trash is overflowing because it's not being picked up, you know regularly, or you know, or more regularly and so trash bins, even their big bellies or litter is everywhere. What we need, I think say is you know, learning from Koba talk about the inequities and instead of having improved conditions at the time of nee, they are worse and have an even stronger need for more maintenance, more workers, more proven well I, think it's programming won't vinegar, but more maintenance and more workers, yeah and I. Think also like this first sentence. I remember when we came up this last time. Front of us also was about you know wasting of funds where they would come into a park, and this happened at four layers. They came in with you know an $8,000 or small CPI grass and planted all these beautiful things, but then there was no maintenance plan, so nobody, a lot of times already died, I think so. Right me, plantings in and plantings in new construction without plans for continuing maintenance is just the loss of money. Ryan I know that was a lot to sort of absorb, but II feel comfortable. You took enough information, I think I captured what people were saying. Thank you. It's not any sentences, it's in phrases, but I think you can cover just to get the ideas how about if we write it up in the office and then I forward it to Michael. Since you had a lot of the ideas sure yeah I can help you with the maintenance part I'm happy to do that and Ryan I'll send you the transcript of the meeting tomorrow here that might help as well. If you really want to read all of this again, see I think she's got she's, captured, notes, pretty well, some peanuts, I think he's okay, I try and look at the transcripts. It's living hell twice totally off. Subject: I was in a nightlife advisory board meeting this afternoon that I walked out of I walked out and slam the door you zoomed out he's presumed that all right is there anything else beyond libraries, because that was the last section we left off all right, so you're done with this no bioswales tree-planting. So you're right s- and we probably should have asked that with the tree fat task force update because they included that they do have funding for it. So we're not exactly sure what it's going to look like, but there is funding for the tree and passwords fundings so d. Are you saying that there needs to be any change? I mean it doesn't sound like we're having an increased need? Well, that's not sold off on that. I know that there's gonna be a meeting in September and I. Don't know if we really talked about box was we really focused on tree plantings? So, let's see if we can get some information about the past, I know and Steve just put a note to check for update after an extra task tree task force, meeting, correct, I'm. Sorry, it was hard for me to follow, but at that time I couldn't see where we were in the schedule. So there's nothing to say: you've already identified, what's getting cut? Well, it's not necessarily getting caught. They did its. They still. It still needs fifty to sixty million dollars. I'm not sure why it's highlighted same thing, I think it was highlighted for us to check for updates, which we did do yesterday. So the highlighting should come out all right folks, we finished that portions I, don't think marks Michael. Can you check to see at the past managers on it? Sorry do we want to say anything in here about the return of the compost as it is sort of an institution on the Lower East Side, and in that Park in district needs, yeah I, don't I, don't I think that's kind of a separate thing. If you want to do a resolution on that, you should do that as it. Well, we've done, one I think Mandir sauna I hear you take I, don't know if it's part of district needs, but it may be. Didn't they get funding the compost program. I know it got funding I mean it doesn't, have some funding mm-hmm. You know as something that has pretty significant community support and I. Don't know if it's gonna require funding, but no I know I, guess that this is more of a question about the district needs. That's it goes into district needs, I would say that composting itself, yes, sanitation and that so that's under a different committee that deals with sanitation and you're right. It's something that's incredibly important to the community, but it's not the same kind of district need where we're seeing the amount of park space person, yeah I, hear you but I do think that it is in part under Sanitation, but it actually, the compost itself is used in parks and I. Think, given especially the commissioners pushed to try to get composting out of parks which, frankly I see, is probably the future of parks given resiliency and everything else, I mean I'm, not gonna, argue it forever. I just think it would be worth a question to me. It's worth possibly it to me. It is integral to parks or should be so something in the in the Seward Park house building, which is slated for Elias, ecology, Center, just saying our support for a composting program- and you know this being a leadership model. Just maybe in that context of the park house, the port for a program is not a district need. You can hit everything he says is a hundred percent true, but it's not a district need. You I'm curious after that presentation that the flood mitigate the temporary flood mitigation can't happen in the district that be a district need somehow food parks to get us some temporary flood mitigation, because a year from now this is for starting for FY 22 in July 21. So we're not talking about the next year at all, so we're missing the next hurricane season anyway, with this okay. So then that was it's not that we missed it. We dealt with that last year. You know, but I mean they were we. You know I'm just curious. If that would be some Amy I mean if nothing's gonna be done through their Office of Emergency Management and hearts. Do then you know to deal with, but you prompted that now, it's not in a district need statement for next July. Okay, let's do this since we're gonna close. This district needs you're, probably reading my message. Yes, I am sorry, probably pretty obvious that I am I'm just trying to figure out because I choose and raised a point about. It's actually being under sanitation, although it isn't a park and a lot of its gonna be a park. So let's do you want me to think about it and right yeah, let's think about it. Does it really belong in the transportation? I think it's the battle, that's going on right now, with parks and, frankly does compost really? Is it integral to parts? That's a yeah. It says who manages it sanitation, so let's think about that, so we're focusing on district needs. So if Christine you have a question about district needs because of with regards to what K is bringing up we're gonna think about it for a minute. But did you have a question about district needs, I'm, not so much a question but more like a comment. I would love for composting to somehow be included in that, because this district needs is about future capital investments, and you know we couldn't get it a straight answer from parks, whether the compost yard will be included in a new park, but there's certainly no design, and it is there's no money there right now to build it. So you know I think it should. It would be great to include it yeah and we'll think about I hear you as just that we gotta focus on the fact that we're doing a district need statement. This is much more general that will inform the budget priorities which we will vote on in October, and you know we could vote on capital need for composting for a composting facility in October great. But it end the case point I do think. Maybe one of the committee should look at overall composting, because the business annotation thing, but just overall composting and view it as something the community needs. Jamil I believe is not on his phone number doesn't show up as one of the numbers listed I texted em. If you can respond so okay support tonight, all right, so we're going to join the meeting, we're gonna, let Ryan take attendance.
