Last week, the council passed legislation to officially change the department of Consumer affairs name to department of Consumer and worker protection, and with that comes a bigger mission and in addition, the New York City Commission on human rights, issue, legal guidance on age, discrimination.
Let's work together to make sure new yorkers know what their rights, are, and I look forward to hearing how the department of Consumer and worker protection will be an ally to report any instance of discrimination and hold people.
We worked in the City Council to pass my bill on personal liability protections for small businesses, and we have pushed for legislation to be passed to give workers stronger rights during covent 19.
We do enforce the laws in New York City that protect both consumers and workers.
And I know that the focus today is about reopening and coming back to work in a safe manner, but all of the New York City Workplace laws are in effect right.
You know so important right now that we are all working together to make sure that in New York we continue to make progress in battling this disease, and we have a worker hotline.
The city has been putting a lot of resources into educating businesses and bringing them the tools they need to comply with these guidelines, which I understand it's a lot of information, there's a lot of requirements, but it is very important that we all work together on this.
Last week we were in council member chains district, and we saw a really high level of compliance, and you know street dining locations that look great If you see an issue, we will go out there and educate that business to make sure that again, we all continue to reopen in a safe manner and then.
A lot of them are related to people's concerns, going back to work rightfully There are some general guidelines that apply to all industries and there are some other more specific guidelines for certain types of jobs like construction like manufacturing, but in general, and every business is supposed to first affirmed to the state, by going on to the state website, to affirm that they understand what the guidelines are and that they will be complying with them and then post a safety plan in the workplace that tells workers employees.
Now, there's no specific requirement as to whether employers have to take employees, temperature or not, but there are some models, some guidelines that Department of Health has published, and this is just to prevent workers from coming to work.
Sick right Employees, who are scheduled to work, must answer three or four questions that are designed to capture whether anyone has any symptoms and employers have to keep a log of those records that they've asked those questions.
Another reminder is like: If employees are sick, obviously they must be sent home and there are laws that require employers in New, York, City and in the country to pay workers for time they use to take care of themselves or their families.
It requires the you know, if they have to take the face covering off Right so, depending on the industry, there may be more specific requirements: That theme of returning to work can employers, request, test results or proof of antibody testing by the employee in order for them to return to work.
I do not think that workers should be asked to waive any rights under these circumstances, commissioner, we're getting some questions about paid sick leave as well.
So I encourage people to call us and tell us about their specific situation, because we would have to do an analysis of how big the employer is, how many employees in place how much money the business is earning before we can better advise, but in general I would say right.
One of the you know the benefits of our New York City paid sick leave law again, is that it's very broad and workers could use that leave to take care of their children if the schools are closed or they're partially closed.
I believe that the Cares Act expanded the family, the one of the laws to provide additional benefits for parents who may need to stay home with their kids So under the first under the federal paid sick leave law, those 80 hours of leave that commissioner salus was describing.
It's super important that we are made aware of those locations again when we walk in to do some education or to do an inspection, we're not going to say that we're there in response to a complaint right, we are going to go And we're not just going to go to that business , we're going to go to the business next door and the other business, because this is again like I said this is about all of us working together to make sure that we continue to be safe and healthy.
Can somebody use their reasonable accommodation rules to request working from home employees certainly have a right to request reasonable accommodation from their employers and their federal state city laws that require employers not to discriminate against employees who and to be able to accommodate them as long as the job can be done, and it's not a burden to the employer.
As you know, New, York City was behind in the reopening compared to some other places in the state, and so.
That employee has a right to get that get paid for the time that they need to take care of.
There may be situations in which businesses, you know, say if you need more time than that, I can not pay you for that time, and you have to take the time and paid right.
