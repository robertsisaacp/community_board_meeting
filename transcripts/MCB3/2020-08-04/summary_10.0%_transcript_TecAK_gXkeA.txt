Last week, the council passed legislation to officially change the department of consumer affairs name to department of consumer and worker protection, and with that comes a bigger mission and in addition, the new york city, commission, on human rights, issue, legal guidance on age, discrimination.
Let's work together to make sure new yorkers know what their rights, are, and I look forward to hearing how the department of consumer and worker protection will be an ally to report any instance of discrimination and hold people.
We worked in the city council to pass my bill on personal liability protections for small businesses, and we have pushed for legislation to be passed to give workers stronger rights during covent 19.
We do enforce the laws in new york city that protect both consumers and workers.
And I know that the focus today is about reopening and coming back to work in a safe manner, but all of the new york city workplace laws are in effect, I mean.
Certainly, there's been a lot of interest from businesses in new york city to know what their obligations are and to do the right, thing.
You know so important right now that we are all working together to make sure that in new york we continue to make progress in battling this disease, and we have a worker, hotline.
The city has been putting a lot of resources into educating businesses and bringing them the tools they need to comply with these guidelines, which I understand it's a lot of information, there's a lot of requirements, but it is very important that we all work together on this.
Now, there's no specific requirement as to whether employers have to take employees, temperature or not, but there are some models, some guidelines that department of health has published- This is just to prevent workers from coming to work, Sick right Employees, who are scheduled to work, must answer three or four questions that are designed to capture whether anyone has any symptoms and employers The business also must be doing cleaning and disinfecting of the workplace at least once a day, preferably after every shift, and if there are certain surfaces that are used commonly by more than one person, they need to be cleaning those regularly.
So, another reminder is like: If employees are sick, obviously they must be sent home and there are laws that require employers in new york city and in the country to pay workers for time they use to take care of themselves or their families.
Don't think that workers should be asked to waive any rights under these circumstances, commissioner, we're getting some questions about paid sick leave as well.
So I encourage people to call us and tell us about their specific situation, because we would have to do an analysis of how big the employer is, how many employees in place how much money the business is earning before we can better advise, but in general I would say right.
So we always encourage people to call us and to tell us the specific specifics of their situation, Because just because someone is labeled a freelancer or was made to sign an independent contractor agreement, it's not what determines the status of the individual right, we would decide if there was they were improperly misclassified and that they should be eligible for basically benefits, but a true freelancer someone who's truly working for themselves and can control the terms of their of their work, wouldn't be covered by this law.
One of the you know the benefits of our new york city paid sick leave.
I believe that the cares act, expanded the family, the one of the laws to provide additional benefits for parents who may need to stay home with their kids So under the first under the federal paid sick leave.
We can do also, but an employer can call you back to work and if they are taking all the measures that the state guidelines require, then you know it should be safe to be to be going back to work.
Can somebody use their reasonable accommodation rules to request working from home employees certainly have a right to request reasonable accommodation from their employers and their federal state city laws that require employers not to discriminate against employees who and to be able to accommodate them as long as the job can be done, and it's not a burden to the employer.
As you know, new york city, was behind in the reopening compared to some other places in the state, and so.
I know that the city is trying to do what they can to make sure that everyone who needs food has access to that right.
