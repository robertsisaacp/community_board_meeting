Last week the council passed legislation to officially change the department of consumer affairs name to department of consumer and worker protection, and with that comes a bigger mission and in addition, the new york city commission, on human rights issue, legal guidance on age discrimination.
and I look forward to hearing how the department of consumer and worker protection will be an ally to report any instance of discrimination and hold people accountable I just want to thank you, michael of course, and community board 3 and my colleague councilmember chen, who I just can't wait to see in person sometime soon and, of course, commissioner salas for all the work that you have done.
You've been in my district multiple times, really trying to listen and reach out to people proactively, whether business owner or worker This know your rights, town hall, I'm very excited to share and also learn about all the city resources we have to support new yorkers and small businesses that are currently suffering.
We worked in the city council to pass my bill on personal liability protections for small businesses and we have pushed for legislation to be passed to give workers stronger rights during covent 19, but there are also a number of tools out there right now that may help you at your place of employment or may help you find employment during this pandemic.
Very important benefits so in terms of worker protection and I know that the focus today is about reopening and coming back to work in a safe manner, but all of the new york city workplace laws are in effect, I mean.
In collaboration with some of the council members and the business improvement districts bring bringing materials the state guidelines in different languages, door-to-door to businesses that really are trying to do the best they can to protect themselves, and we saw a really high level of compliance, and you know street dining locations that look great If you see an issue, we will go out there and educate that business to make sure that again we all continue to reopen in a safe manner and then, just generally, we are all operating.
There are some general guidelines that apply to all industries and there are some other more specific guidelines for certain types of jobs like construction like manufacturing, but in general, and every business is supposed to first affirmed to the state, by going on to the state website, to affirm that they understand what the guidelines are and that they will be complying with them and then post a safety plan in the workplace that tells workers employees Basically.
Those are required to be provided to employees at no cost, so just like any other type of protected equipment, employers are not allowed to charge workers for those face coverings So. If that is an issue, please reach out, and our colleagues from small business services will be helping the businesses to make sure they have those space coverings for free social distancing is another very important requirement.
If a city or a state inspector visits the business to do an inspection to check for compliance with the guidelines, they could be asking the business to show them those records right in certain cases again, So another reminder is like: If employees are sick, obviously they must be sent home and there are laws that require employers in new york city and in the country to pay workers for time they use to take care of themselves or their families.
It requires a minimum of up to five days a year for businesses to have five or more employees, and yes, five days may not always be enough right, but these five days can be taken not just when someone is sick to take care of themselves or take care of the children that can also be taken when there's a state of emergency that closes schools, for instance, and kids cannot go to school and parents need to stay home to take care of the kids Now. There are state and federal laws that protect workers now who are sick because of covert 19 Very.
I believe that the cares act, expanded the family, the one of the laws to provide additional benefits for parents who may need to stay home with their kids, so under the first under the federal paid sick leave law.
At that point to the business, it's more of a benefit that it's already available because of the insurance Add that for so for the city paid sick leave, law, If your workplace has five or more employees.
