Thank you Michael, and welcome to the October parks, Last month's meeting was a marathon at four hours, so I'm really not going to try and cut people off You want to speak on a topic which is on the agenda, I'm, going to ask for you to wait for that agenda item to come up.
A lot of them are not adhering to the guidelines at all for Covid-19., ferry, there's been an issue and All those things have changed since Covid-19 we're going to go into a discussion about the reduced number or the reduced data to reduce the service that the Corlears Hook stopped.
So, just to give you a background and a map of where the ferry system is so for those of you that may not thank you just because I know that a lot of times I get questions on where we are with the ferry as we head Actually, the Saint George row, which is going from staten island to Madrid City up to West 39th street.
We knew we could do while again still making sure that Corlears Hook and the other routes along or the other landings along the lower side route continued to have service, and in fact what we've noticed is that people use the ferry, often to get across literally acrosss the river to other boroughs.
Brooklyn route really opened up a lot of then new connections between the lower East side and areas of Brooklyn, including Brooklyn, bridge park, Et cetera, and so what we've seen.
We've continued to monitor, ridership since then, and while with the pandemic- And, you know a lot of people working from home and not sort of traveling in the usual patterns.
As we have handled every previous meeting, and that is that committee members will go first, And then we'll, if we, depending on the time that we have left, we'll, go with those who raise their hand, who are part of the public, and I, have a question just for clarification, those numbers that you have or that you showed If you could put that back, up, I think it would be helpful Michael, because I think we're going to focus on that that one particular shot of the ridership numbers.
I mean in normal times, people are taking it for work as well, I mean the tricky thing with building on the water front is depths and where landing could physically be sighted, and it's not always as ideal as you know, you might wish.
Okay, because right now, I'm going to obviously let the questions that are waiting right now, be we asked, but I, think in a future resolution, because I think we really have to think about the covenant environment we're in We do want to bring the ferry back to talk about ridership in the coming months, but that might have to that Might be something we want to put in our resolution to DOT, because it's sort of a weird mix of parks, EDC and DOT, with the CitiBike and the ferry and the park.
Who knows what's going to happen three months from now, but we're going to bring them back, but I do want to emphasize the point and that maybe this could be done sooner than later and then as adjusting the schedules for transfer, because if we lost northbound service, the lease that we could have right now is a schedule that fits So. People can go south and then get on a boat and transfer to other points.
So I'm, going to ask folks to be brief with their questions and let's look at the presentation and also understand that there's a community advisory group, which will also go over a large portion of the construction issues which are going to be touched upon, tonight.
Some leg work that they need to do with surveys, issuing a report to us issuing their project scheduled to us for our final review and approval of the environmental plans that we've all been talking about for a very long, time.
Started, and I want to reassure everybody that before we reached any of those points down the road of any street closures, any construction fence going up anything like that.
Until the end of this year, and I have a little note there, that first closures of the East River Park will begin early 2021 that again consider that a bird's eye view sort of tentative note, there, So, the construction phasing plan that we presented last month and all the details of the step by step in the process.
If the person has one question and it ends up being a back and forth sort of conversation for a while that history is documented there, when you log in you'll, see everything step by step lined up there, all right But I think it's important that people know there's another way to ask questions.
My question is on behalf of the lower East Side Power partnership, and we had asked about a community liaison speaking to the people that lived near Ps42, and so we wrote a letter because we did not know who is responsible for Ps42, whether it was you or EDC.
Last February lesbi came to this committee to let you know that we had applied to the state office of historic preservation, known as SHPO, to have them review the East River Park Track House and Tennis Center Comfort Station.
It is important to note that the Terra Cotta ornamentation on both these buildings was custom fabricated, locally in long island city in all, SHPO's, evaluation of the Track House Antenna Center Comfort station emphasized not only the historic links to the transformative period of the new deal, but also the connection to the earlier maritime history of the lower East side and SHPO also focused on their excellence as architectural resources.
The community see these very unique buildings restored and kept for use as long as the interiors were modernized, because I think that's a fair point and it sounds like You know when I was in construction.
We have another committee, member Ryan Given how much loss we're experiencing both of East River Park and in many ways of the lower East side, as you know as a whole over many decades, that being able to preserve something, that's specifically tied to our own history and our sense of place feels very important.
Okay, can I clarify one point: trevor, please sure, so I just wanted to just explain that you know that the environmental impact process has been going on for a long time.
Just briefly, I mean you all know that I chair the Landmarks Committee and although we did not choose to pass a resolution because we deferred to parks, we certainly feel very strongly that these are wonderful buildings , they're modest, the cost of re.
I think we can probably work with it or what your you have drafted, but I really want to make sure that we stay consistent with our resolutions, because what I'm, probably going to add, is the some form of that community outreach needs to be done in the resolution We can come later and say: you've done the resolution and you've reached out.
There are some formatting issues with the therefore be resolved, because some of that language should probably be in, whereas I go to the first page, Michael, I'm, going to ask the committee for comments and what I'm looking for some language that says that there needs to be some community outreach and changing the their force to be more direct and taking out some of the language there.
Whereas we understand that many community members want to see completely renovated, interiors new bathrooms, that goes into one of the whereases and that the second piece is that that there will be significant outreach by lesbi in the next period of time and maybe even some shot for people to come to this committee to if they have questions for disagreement.
The language would read pretty much like what you said, whereas Lesbian has promised to do outreach to the local community since and that's a good point, can't send something to parks and then be telling another group to do something: correct.
Alternatively, it would read, whereas many community members have requested that the office spaces comfort stations and other interior spaces, we renovated with all new fixtures and finishes you can say inside spaces if you want, And, it's close enough we'll clean up as we always do the language a bit later for the purposes of the zoo meeting and the timing, I'm going to ask for Michael to scroll up to the top So I'm going to assume all of our committee members have read this thoroughly.
I'll make this pretty short short 10 weeks out of the onset of the esker construction in East, River Park and the ecology center A 30 year old composting program which delivers access to composting educates and engages the public, creates green jobs and job training.
And I know there are some members of the public who had asked to speak, but first I'm going to go to committee.
I do not have the resolution in front of me, but I think christine had mentioned a specific language asking for a written guarantee from parks for compost like different programming.
We want to that parks is offering to us, and I would really like to have better more comprehensive answers to questions, because as an organization we need to, we have contracts with the city that won't allow us to perform certain work.
We need to try to stick to be able to deliver this protection project on time for this neighborhood and this community So, like I said, there's a lot of moving pieces and there's a lot of areas and entities that are working on all of this.
Our community is really important right now, And I'd like to see that it be prioritized the compost, yards location throughout construction and return to the park, be prioritized because they are productive and create so much positive activity by the community that we really need to have.
Let's make sure we get the relocation and return of the yard right and in writing, and we want the community board to work diligently to make this happen.
Thank you, and I want to thank the Community Board Parks Committee for supporting the ecology, center, so I'm Amy, Burkhoff 40 year resident of the East village and long- term friend of the Ecology center.
That one of the big issues right now in the city is exactly that as to why they're doing certain things as they want to make sure that people are not using bathrooms together to be specific, about Michael's point.
