Thank you Michael, and welcome to the October parks, Last month's meeting was a marathon at four hours, so I'm really not going to try and cut people off You want to speak on a topic which is on the agenda, I'm, going to ask for you to wait for that agenda item to come up.
A lot of them are not adhering to the guidelines at all for Covid-19., ferry, there's been an issue and All those things have changed since Covid-19 we're going to go into a discussion about the reduced number or the reduced data to reduce the service that the Corlears Hook stopped.
So, just to give you a background and a map of where the ferry system is so for those of you that may not thank you just because I know that a lot of times I get questions on where we are with the ferry as we head Actually, the Saint George row, which is going from staten island to Madrid City up to West 39th street.
We finished the environmental review phase and now we're looking to start permitting and construction to be able to launch St George by next summer and Coney island before the end of the year next year, and then now we're going to get into some where we are today.
We knew we could do while again still making sure that Corlears Hook and the other routes along or the other landings along the lower side route continued to have service, and in fact what we've noticed is that people use the ferry, often to get across literally acrosss the river to other boroughs.
So I think one of the issues that the lower side route had is that a lot of the stops were just within Manhattan, and that was not ultimately very appealing for people in terms of comparison to other modes that they were taking.
Brooklyn route really opened up a lot of then new connections between the lower East side and areas of Brooklyn, including Brooklyn, bridge park, Et cetera, and so what we've seen.
We've continued to monitor, ridership since then, and while with the pandemic- And, you know a lot of people working from home and not sort of traveling in the usual patterns.
And then we'll, if we, depending on the time that we have left, we'll, go with those who raise their hand, who are part of the public, and I, have a question just for clarification, those numbers that you have or that you showed If you could put that back, up, I think it would be helpful Michael, because I think we're going to focus on that that one particular shot of the ridership numbers.
If I talk about ons and offs, but people very well could be getting on going southbound and then taking it back northbound that would just be captured, in the say, the red hook or the the Brooklyn bridge park.
As we know throughout the city, the edges of the water are really the ones being served by transit, right, so just being able to serve a consistent service throughout this time.
Just talks about route ridership, so you did not get like what the old, lower East side route would carry on an average day versus what the Corlears Hook landings saw, but it does not break down north down south All right.
I mean in normal times, people are taking it for work as well, I mean the tricky thing with building on the water front is depths and where landing could physically be sighted, and it's not always as ideal as you know, you might wish.
Okay, because right now, I'm going to obviously let the questions that are waiting right now, be we asked, but I, think in a future resolution, because I think we really have to think about the covenant environment we're in We do want to bring the ferry back to talk about ridership in the coming months, but that might have to that Might be something we want to put in our resolution to DOT, because it's sort of a weird mix of parks, EDC and DOT, with the CitiBike and the ferry and the park.
Who knows what's going to happen three months from now, but we're going to bring them back, but I do want to emphasize the point and that maybe this could be done sooner than later and then as adjusting the schedules for transfer, because if we lost northbound service, the lease that we could have right now is a schedule that fits So. People can go south and then get on a boat and transfer to other points.
So I'm, going to ask folks to be brief with their questions and let's look at the presentation and also understand that there's a community advisory group, which will also go over a large portion of the construction issues which are going to be touched upon, tonight.
Some leg work that they need to do with surveys, issuing a report to us issuing their project scheduled to us for our final review and approval of the environmental plans that we've all been talking about for a very long, time.
That's there's a package of items that needs to be done and completed in the first couple of months, two to three months of their approval in order for them to finally reach the point of being able to put up the construction fences and start the closures and start bringing in their machinery and equipment and get the work.
Started, and I want to reassure everybody that before we reached any of those points down the road of any street closures, any construction fence going up anything like that.
We've also came to conclusion that we are able to keep the park open for the rest of this year, and that means our projects are its construction.
We're, very excited that we're able to accommodate the request and the considering the unfortunate Covid-19 crisis right now and the open space access and everything in the neighborhood and the community that the park itself East River Park will be.
Until the end of this year, and I have a little note there, that first closures of the East River Park will begin early 2021 that again consider that a bird's eye view sort of tentative note, there, So, the construction phasing plan that we presented last month and all the details of the step by step in the process.
This is just one piece of that, bigger slideshow that we had last time, but I wanted to remind everybody that this is our sort of umbrella process of community outreach during construction.
If you have any questions or can access the website or the zoom registration feel free to reach out to any of us, we'll be able to connect you with the right folks- This is the overall snapshot of our community Engagement Timeline of what are the sort of community engagement tasks and strategies that we have lined up that we're working on each of them Have a timeline associated with them on a separate track.
If the person has one question and it ends up being a back and forth sort of conversation for a while that history is documented there, when you log in you'll, see everything step by step lined up there, all right But I think it's important that people know there's another way to ask questions.
My question is on behalf of the lower East Side Power partnership, and we had asked about a community liaison speaking to the people that lived near Ps42, and so we wrote a letter because we did not know who is responsible for Ps42, whether it was you or EDC.
I also wanted to clarify Sorry trevor, there's a little thing that I need to clarify here and that's part of my job that multiple different groups have different technical languages, a construction.
It's been I'm going to say a hot topic for a lot of us from for a very long time, and just like any other of people.
Next on the agenda is a presentation by the lower East side, preservation, initiative, requesting support for the adaptive reuse of the Erp Track House and Tennis House in light of SHPO's determination of eligibility of these buildings.
Last February lesbi came to this committee to let you know that we had applied to the state office of historic preservation, known as SHPO, to have them review the East River Park Track House and Tennis Center Comfort Station.
Their endorsement underscores the significance of these buildings not only to community Board three district in the lower East side, but also to New York City.
As, a reminder, the East River Park Track House, is located near 6th Street and the Tennis Center comfort station is roughly between Rivington and delancey.
It is important to note that the Terra Cotta ornamentation on both these buildings was custom fabricated, locally in long island city in all, SHPO's, evaluation of the Track House Antenna Center Comfort station emphasized not only the historic links to the transformative period of the new deal, but also the connection to the earlier maritime history of the lower East side and SHPO also focused on their excellence as architectural resources.
The demolition of these outstanding buildings, clearly designed as part of an architectural group in East River Park, is very sad indeed and represents a substantial loss to the community.
We feel very strongly that the historic and distinctive track- House Antenna, Center Comfort station, specifically designed for the lower East side, should not be replaced with buildings.
We are pleased to have worked with davies, toes architecture, a local firm, to explore ways that these historic buildings can be adapted to fulfill the programmatic requirements of the new planned buildings, and this includes all areas for bathrooms: offices, changing rooms, storage and concessions.
What what's going to be happening to these buildings during the construction period, and are you also thinking about monitoring that that's a little bit beyond our purview as a preservation organization?
The community see these very unique buildings restored and kept for use as long as the interiors were modernized, because I think that's a fair point and it sounds like You know when I was in construction.
We have another committee, member Ryan Given how much loss we're experiencing both of East River Park and in many ways of the lower East side, as you know as a whole over many decades, that being able to preserve something, that's specifically tied to our own history and our sense of place feels very important.
Okay, can I clarify one point: trevor, please sure, so I just wanted to just explain that you know that the environmental impact process has been going on for a long time.
It was only two years ago in 2018, when the community became aware that demolition of the park was part of the plan and that's the point at which we started looking at the architectural resources.
Just briefly, I mean you all know that I chair the Landmarks Committee and although we did not choose to pass a resolution because we deferred to parks, we certainly feel very strongly that these are wonderful buildings , they're modest, the cost of re.
I think we can probably work with it or what your you have drafted, but I really want to make sure that we stay consistent with our resolutions, because what I'm, probably going to add, is the some form of that community outreach needs to be done in the resolution We can come later and say: you've done the resolution and you've reached out.
The next item is request for support for the lefcy college and it's complex art, Everyone know that unless the committee feels different, that there is overwhelming support for this, so we could spend a lot of time talking about our support or we can go over resolution and sort of get to the point of support, because we this has been on our agenda for quite some time.
There are some formatting issues with the therefore be resolved, because some of that language should probably be in, whereas I go to the first page, Michael, I'm, going to ask the committee for comments and what I'm looking for some language that says that there needs to be some community outreach and changing the their force to be more direct and taking out some of the language there.
Whereas we understand that many community members want to see completely renovated, interiors new bathrooms, that goes into one of the whereases and that the second piece is that that there will be significant outreach by lesbi in the next period of time and maybe even some shot for people to come to this committee to if they have questions for disagreement.
You know has promised to do this outreach because you do not want to say you have to do the outreach, because it's not going to the people that are doing the outreach, so maybe included that this group has promised that they would do it.
The language would read pretty much like what you said, whereas Lesbian has promised to do outreach to the local community since and that's a good point, can't send something to parks and then be telling another group to do something: correct.
According from what I heard from you trevor that you have heard community members asking for new interiors, And I, think that would be important to say, because that is right-.
That's part of what we're going to add just understand that looking at this, for the first time, I when we say new, interiors we're, including all that programming I'm, just trying to get as many comments from the committee as we can, because we have not adopted this.
Are there any other comments from committee members, since this is a bit of a hybrid type of resolution, which I know we're going to have to change in some format?
Alternatively, it would read, whereas many community members have requested that the office spaces comfort stations and other interior spaces, we renovated with all new fixtures and finishes you can say inside spaces if you want, And, it's close enough we'll clean up as we always do the language a bit later for the purposes of the Zoom meeting and the timing, I'm going to ask for Michael to scroll up to the top So I'm going to assume all of our committee members have read this thoroughly.
I'll make this pretty short short 10 weeks out of the onset of the esker construction in East, River Park and the ecology center A 30 year old composting program which delivers access to composting educates and engages the public, creates green jobs and job training.
We have not been able to get straight answers from parks about incorporating a fully funded and approved design for the compost yard, located in a one acre, lot, just south of the amphitheater in East River Park into the esker construction.
And I know there are some members of the public who had asked to speak, but first I'm going to go to committee.
You know, basically a green light to go ahead with this project Why can't we just try to pressure the tribal authority to give an answer before we have to go and or do approach while we go down this road, because if no response does not mean a no well, the mayor's office, the Department of Sanitation Parks Department.
I do not have the resolution in front of me, but I think christine had mentioned a specific language asking for a written guarantee from parks for compost like different programming.
We want to that parks is offering to us, and I would really like to have better more comprehensive answers to questions, because as an organization we need to, we have contracts with the city that won't allow us to perform certain work.
We need to try to stick to be able to deliver this protection project on time for this neighborhood and this community So, like I said, there's a lot of moving pieces and there's a lot of areas and entities that are working on all of this.
Our community is really important right now, And I'd like to see that it be prioritized the compost, yards location throughout construction and return to the park, be prioritized because they are productive and create so much positive activity by the community that we really need to have.
Involved, I think that community board three needs to be more strategic in its position and demand, and it should strongly support the yard remaining where it is until a suitable alternative site is identified and a, and we need a commitment by the city for its temporary home and its return to the renovated park.
Let's make sure we get the relocation and return of the yard right and in writing, and we want the community board to work diligently to make this happen.
We want CB3 to pass this resolution to relocate and bring back the composting yard to our park, and I understand.
Thank you, and I want to thank the Community Board Parks Committee for supporting the ecology, center, so I'm Amy, Burkhoff 40 year resident of the East village and long- term friend of the Ecology center.
Heard, and I just want to point out that this is really like a crystal clear example of the lack of transparency and the bad communication that we've had about escr from the city, Yeah, I'm, just bringing up the resolution.
I, do not know if we can say that, but what we can say is that as a community board that, if there's no place to move it to, it simply remains there and the project moves forward that it like.
Our committee members comfortable with the way it's written with the addition of the language that K is going to work on And we'll get that language before we take a vote on it and with David Adams suggestion that we move the that one of the therefore to therefore strongly supports the continued occupancy paragraph to number two Michael for responding, I'm, also happy to read.
, I think we have enough information from what val had said to offer that as a therefore be resolved, where we are asking to make sure that this particular resolution or the efforts or the support for the Ecology center and its composure does not prevent or delay the flood protection for the residents of NYCHA, including the ones mentioned, and for the other surrounding buildings.
The goal of voting on these priorities is to bring more services and money to community Board three for needs that we decide are the most important.
This information is on our website, also, and if anyone has other more detailed questions, or they want to know more about how it's research, you can, you can ask me, later after the committee's rank and vote their on their priorities.
Those are community board three items from last year that are not on the parks, list, they're things that we want to add or that we wanted to add.
I'm, not saying it's number one, but I do think it's important that parks have bathrooms to prevent people from using bushes and walkways and other areas to either urinate or defecate.
That one of the big issues right now in the city is exactly that as to why they're doing certain things as they want to make sure that people are not using bathrooms together to be specific about Michael's point.
I also think Kim Lao could go before number 19 SDR park, because that also is never going to happen until there's a whole lot of money.
