This is our zoning text, amendment, which is going, which is called zoning for coastal flood resiliency, and so the impetus for this text amendment is really to create a city that is better resilient to climate change and the risks of a rising sea.
A lot of these measures that I'm going to be talking about are already in place and they were put in place on an interim condition after Hurricane Sandy, and they were really meant to allow buildings to have the flexibility to meet the building requirements for building in the flood.
So in the future on which is the far right in this red is our projected sea level rises, which is kind of we're kind of extending that flood plain further and further into the island and further into the other parts of the city, and.
While it may not look exactly like a building that you might see, walking around, the rules are still going to be pretty much the same.
We're, just making zoning a little more flexible so that these buildings can meet those higher requirements in the flood, zone, all right.
We know that we're projecting that this is going to go further inland to allow for those buildings that are at moderate now, but maybe higher risk later to be resilient, and the third is to save money on flood insurance, costs.
The zoning for coastal flood resiliency is also going to lay out a framework for responding to disasters in the future, which I'm going to talk about a little bit.
You may not recognize being in community district 3 here on the left here on the right might look a little more familiar to us, and so all the residential spaces must be above that design, flood elevation and.
It's kind of a lower level, protection of flood proofing, dry flood proofing, which we can see on the right-hand side, is a little higher form of protection, and so that's really sealing the building off so that the water is going to go up to the building.
The second goal is to support long-term resiliency designs of all building types, so providing that flexibility to meet the building code.
So this area behind it is the point two percent, and so we're going to extend the applicability of these rules to not just the one percent annual chance flood plain, but the point two percent, as well, which is high risk and moderate risk.
We're, seeing the point two percent chance and, as most of you could probably guess, a lot of this is going to be just along the water, except here around Stuy, Cove or sorry, not around stuyco at the bottom of just north of pier 42.
The 2013 flood text allows maximum height to be measured from the design flood elevation that is currently called the frce or the flood resistant construction elevation in the zoning resolution.
This is only available for buildings in the one percent plane which have a designated DFE in the building code, so to allow the buildings in the 0.2 floor plan to take advantage of this rule we'll be sending a standard flood elevation of two feet for buildings in that area.
Today, building heights can be bumped to 9:10 or 12 feet, depending on the building's use and zoning district, which is making this kind of a highly complex framework.
Let's talk about ground floor regulations, so these sets of rules would help promote good, long-term resilient design and good neighborhood streetscape.
Current rules allow ground floor uses in existing buildings that are retributed or retrofitted to be wet flood proofed to be exempted from floor area.
You can see a provision that applies to existing buildings, which could exempt the drive flip-proof space, but had a hard time relocating the floor area to recoup the investment of making the building water tight on the right.
You can see a rule that applies to new and existing buildings, which allowed any space to be exempted from floor.
The proposal would modify these regulations to instead only allow the first 30 feet of space that is dry floodproof to be exempted from floor area.
As with a lot of text amendments, we realize that there might be a situation where a building can't meet any of these rules, and so there are, there is a possibility for discretionary actions.
So these are ones that would go through the BSA special permits, and these would ensure that these unique situations and hardships that are based on things like lot shape can get relief from zoning certain zoning provisions in order to allow them to meet those building code requirements in the floodplain, all right.
Commercial uses a lot of commercial overlays, don't allow second floor commercial uses, and so this is just making sure that we're not having underlying taxes prohibiting buildings from becoming resilient.
These are flood protection measures, and so these are different measures that could be installed and be allowed as permitted obstructions within within required yards or open spaces, and so these are just two images that are showing where a building owner has taken steps to help to flood proof.
His, building, I believe here on the left, there's a window well down here and instead of allowing the water to flood through the building owner put in this knee wall here that protects against that on the right.
A storm's effects are not just limited to where our lines are drawn on our flood maps, and so it makes sense to then elevate different power systems throughout the city higher so that they can kind of be resilient to different coastal surges, and so we've seen that this is like raising mechanical spaces.
That goes even further past the 0.2 percent, but we don't want to have rules that don't allow these power systems to be elevated, just because our current projections are not are saying that you're safe beyond this point.
We want to make sure that all areas of the city can easily provide ADA access, and so the proposal would classify both ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions in all required.
We, don't want to be locating these things when, when storms come through, then you're, isolated and you're not able to get out of these areas, and it could be disastrous, as we've seen when there's different types of electrical outages that are shutting off power to different life support systems, and so we want to make sure that nursing homes can no longer be cited within these floodplains.
Second, one would support businesses that do not conform with zoning use regulations by allowing them more than two years, the current limit of discontinuance to return to operation this, and so this is everything we have about the proposed changes, and so now, I'm just going to talk a little bit about the timeline.
I work on a lot of land use and planning items for the district, so I just wanted.
I know, I talked to you about this earlier, but I just want to confirm when we're looking at this new section proposed section of the zoning resolution right this article six chapter five in the case of like a disaster happening in you know three years or something, and the city wants to propose a text amendment here into it, to provide for, like certain exemptions.
We will be kind of putting in in this framework kind of a list of things we know currently and have kind of researched through our kind of efforts with Hurricane Sandy and also the kind of Covid-19 research that is going on that we think will be able to you know kind of turn on in the case.
What I'm pressing at is, you know when an emergency order, an executive order, happens right I like significantly change certain regulations or procedures in the community, district.
You know if you have the emergency order from the mayor, that's like establishing a disaster, and then on top of that this additional text amendment is invoked right to have like the longer term, flexibility.
Will that come before the community board, because I think the question is just like.
The only reason I'm flagging this is that I think it actually, given that this is a formal text amendment and it most likely we get referred out to the community, more.
Based on complaints that I've heard over the years when I've been working here, so the it has to do with this section, 6513, that's being proposed, which is discontinuance provisions right for certain uses that are non-compliant so currently like the way that process works, which I think some of you may be familiar, with.
So I just want to flag for board members that you know this would mean that, like the two-year clock that normally counts starts counting for, like a vacant former bar on a residential block, you know, would get an additional kind of two years of time to.
I think you know easier for non-compliant use to go back into one of those spaces and more difficult to have that residential use revert back so that that's all I wanted to note.
Zoning regulations prohibit folks from either substantially improving a building or developing a building or just trying to make their building more flood resilient.
So what we mean by optional is that the zoning mechanisms are the optional ones, but for everything that's required to meet the flood resiliency standards.
And I feel like I was in maybe somewhat better position than many people, because I do know a little bit about flood resiliency because of my day job that I had until very recently when I retired about a month ago.
But this is the level of architectural and zoning complexity that really I feel Un uncomfortable in taking a detailed position on, but I'd like to hear what other people.
So I think there were a couple components that I've talked to this board about during the outreach and before about the like the big ticket items that were concerning.
If their building is fully built out and they want to use that floor area.
It's not going to be more than what the zoning allows, though, because that area is now exempted that 30 feet is now exempted.
So I guess: do you have any thoughts on that on being able to build more in certain flood areas.
Obviously, I understand with a lot of the lots in the flood areas, they're like single or detached homes, but in our district.
It's a carrot to give developers to allow them or property owners to allow them to flood proof, because we know that that's a lot of times cost prohibitive, and so we want them to be able to recoup their costs by reallocating the floor area elsewhere or have the option to do.
This text amendment technically allows a building to build up to an additional 10,000 square feet of florist place in these flood zones.
I think that the text that you're reading refers to Matt's kind of slide in the back that talks about allowing BSA to modify any kind of zoning regulations to help buildings that have to comply with flood resistance and construction standards, but can't because of barriers that we could not foresee, because you know, there's a lot of special conditions, but that would have to go through the BSA.
If a developer says I'm going to use, you know whatever 5,000 square feet for temporary flood panels.
We were just responding to you, know, providing just something very small for them to at least have that on-site department of buildings we'll be looking at the applications.
The Cp3 district needs statement, because we actually want to see a more nursing home in our area and I, but.
Just thinking about like a lot of the senior housings right, now, the people in just regular senior houses.
Our research looked at all uses with the occupancy code that referred to nursing homes and adult facilities and psychiatric facilities, and we didn't see what these those other types of oops sorry you're, just asking: about, regular senior housing, right, yes, yeah, so senior housing.
You want to say so, I think that if people choose to build in the flood zone, they need to occur that cost.
And I do agree with Mike that you know we should be very careful in incentivizing building in the flood zone.
So I really believe that you shouldn't try to use a permanent zoning text amendment because fundamentally, as we've, sadly experiencing right now with the pandemic.
You, know real estate development to be looking at flood zones in which they can sum up.
I mean I, have huge concerns, because you know a lot in district 3.
A lot of our flood zone is natural development and, as we you all know, NYCHA is said to have.
I think with the Holmes Tower situation, so I believe that on one hand you know our community will need supportive, housing, senior, housing, nursing, homes, etc.
Think, overall, you know enforcing the rules but making development where it really makes sense and not where it makes sense in terms of the market, how much money they can make from the Laksa development that will be attached to that, but how much it makes sense from a community resiliency and an environmental resiliency point of view, and I'm, not sure.
The as of right is just saying you have this amount of floor area and that's what's regulating the size of the building and what currently exists with how to a big site will generate a bigger building.
Oh, sorry, and just one more with the nursing homes just to clarify when we're saying that we're kind of banning or prohibiting that's, two new nursing homes, the existing nursing homes that are in the kind of one percent flood plain or in kind of you know, areas that we've designated they would still be able to be there.
But, like we said we're adding that 0.2 percent, because we want to provide this flexibility to those moderate risk areas, even though those are ones where the we may not.
If I understand this correctly, this is largely a proposal that is meant to incentivize a building owners and developers to engage in flood proofing without you know so that it wouldn't be so cost prohibitive.
You know a big enough issue to warrant and move the city to want to make such a change like this.
It's kind of this like multi-tiered approach, we're just talking about the buildings, there's a lot of other things that could be going on changes to infrastructure, to the coastal resiliency strategies and then just emergency preparedness, so making sure that folks know their evacuation plan that we're able to help out those who need to be evacuated first and things like that, we'll really just focus on the zoning here.
Some of us kind of like that fact that there's not you know, people rushing sure, I, understand that too I think that's a different conversation, though so I'll try to answer this question, but those.
The committee first I would like to know: Do we want to take a position or not on this issue.
And I see a couple committee members feel like they don't want to take a position.
You know, especially with the last comment with the marriage, I'm, almost thinking that we should have a position and be against so all right.
That's, just the courtesy that DCP is extending to the community board in terms of a deadline by which we should get in our comments, whether that be a resolution today or not, or you know whatever that might look like, but that we do that by the 28th right, yes.
I'm wondering like what you know if DCP gets comments from 90 of the community boards, that they don't like certain pieces like what are the chances of things changing and how does that happen.
There's new square footage being potentially available at a height that was formally not allowed pending height limits, right, which are still which, if they exist, would still govern, but I, don't I would just I would caution that I, don't think it's generating enough additional floor area to like trigger any substantial development.
You know it would trigger maybe some modifications at existing buildings or in new buildings, but it alone it wouldn't generate enough floor area to like substantially.
I mean it's still exempting square footage that is going towards that far so like, and that could go above right.
And again I mean Matthew did say it does incentivize development in the flood, zone, which, for me, I guess just to answer.
The China town area and those things never come to anything, and this thing that actually doesn't even serve so much our you know, built environment in the flood zone is not creating an incentive for our vulnerable.
I mean I, don't see a lot of people want to support this application.
You know, I thought that the concern is that to allow like one more floors for the building to I.
I, don't I think we should be exempting floor area as a way to incentivize private developers to do coastal flood resiliency.
What you just said: I just want to make sure the mind is denial deny unless you do this, you know, or they approve what conditions.
I, think understanding and I think everyone has voted so far to just deny it without adding any changes or comments or except for me, I wanted to give the rationale.
So long as those comments are not conditions for do this and then because I don't think we have that kind of time to understand what could be the alternative options that could you know, result in a zoning change, that's beneficial to everyone right now or text.
Think people brought up an important point that if you say no and don't outline, why you know what is the city getting from this.
