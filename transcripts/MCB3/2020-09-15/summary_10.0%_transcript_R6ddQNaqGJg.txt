We'll call in any members of the public that wish to speak or ask questions and the applicant will then have a chance to respond, and then the committee members will discuss and come to a resolution.
Okay, all right, we're going to begin the meeting, and this is the SLA DCA licensing committee of Community Board.
We may take the applications before the other agenda items to be heard, which are two numbers two and three, but we do first have to move to an approval of previous month.
The SLA notice is for a restaurant with a whole menu recorded music and no outdoor space on the ground floor.
And it's a second floor mezzanine there was a or have there have been Long- standing wine beer licenses at this location, most notably saline restaurant, which we last approved.
I. Think the business remained the same at that point, but we last heard it in December of 2013 with stipulations to operate a full- service, chinese restaurant serving flew to within one hour of closing, having hours of 11 A.M to 2 A.M all day having a closed facade playing recorded background music.
Only not using outdoor space, not applying for an alteration without first coming before the community board, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having late lines and not having happy hours.
No security, no sound proofing, no pub crawls or party buses, happy hours to 7, pm, no wait lines and an agreement to have someone oversee staff or to make patrons and noise outside the applicant, counted five ops within 500 feet and noted the proximity to a school, the school's, directly acrosss, the street.
The elements of the application, and I would amend what the information that we already have to include the floors, the breakdown of tables and seats and where the bar is located and that the facade is fixed.
The business has been a long- standing restaurant with a wine beer license, which we last heard in 2013 when the license for that business was issued.
Having, happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight lines outside and having a staff person responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside and posting the stipulation form inside the business just to the liquor, license and immediately addressing any resident complaints and providing contact information to the community Board so that we can forward contact information to residents or any other interested parties.
This is that's all I noticed as an application for a restaurant, with a full menu recorded music and background, and a backyard on the first floor.
A beer wine license in February of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full- service, Thai restaurant serving food, all hours having hours of 11:30 A.M to 11 P.M, all day, not using outdoor space.
Closing, the safada 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming before us, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials and not having happy hours and not having weight.
Eight private parties per year proposed hours are 11 A.M to 12 A.M all day inside 11, A.M to 10 P.M all day outside no security, no sound proofing, no problem calls with party buses happy hours, 8 pm, , there's no agreement about having somebody crowds and noise outside There are 11 ops within 500, and the applicant listed no license experience, but managerial experience at a restaurant on Mulberry Street for 10 years.
It is, as maybe some people from the community working last weekend, our we just have a dinner in dining tables and that's our purity just serving and closing by 10 like and serving you know, Because, as you say, mostly of the people right now or the restaurants only can open outdoors and that's one was the main reason that we take this place because we want to take give the people the right to do not go outside, because sometimes you see outside in the open streets.
I actually used to live on the sixth floor above in 186, so I was there for many years and once as Alex mentioned, some of the businesses were fine with the backyard space, The ones that the noise did tend to be.
The most recent history we have for that location and when the license was issued for that business, the number of ops in the area, the applicant experience.
Yes, I've been working for like more than 10 years, like managing restaurant and like helping in accounting getting licensed certifying with the health, department.
So it would be a full- service, spanish, italian restaurant, with the kitchen open and serving food during all hours, with hours of operation indoors of 11 A.M to 12 A.M all day with, with a closed facade, a fixed facade, recorded background.
It does not mean somebody's standing out there, all the time, but making sure that there's no crowds or noise outside on the sidewalk No, the staff outside to oversee crowds, annoying are staff responsible for overseeing crowds and rise outside and then with respect to the backyard that it would be operated as an extension of the restaurant, with the debt for sit- down dining only with no more than nine tables and 34 seats and hours of operation of 11 am to 10 pm all days and no music.
I have one question: I want to ask the applicant, so she mentioned a closed, fixed facade, your front windows: Do they open Sony?
We administratively approved a wine beer license for this corporation in July of 2017, with stipulations to have a kitchen.
Closing, the facade at 10 pm playing recorded background using music not applying for an alteration without first coming before us, not hosting pub calls or party buses not having them limit nutrient specials, not having weight.
So First I'm, going to give you an opportunity to speak or make a presentation about your application, but I just want to know with respect to the stipulations at the end What is it's a very small business and it does not have a cfo because of the age of the building, Okay, all right and what is in the facade?
We know that there is a lot of problems with gangs and shootings and stabbings in this area, but I could assure you that I will hire securely if anything will come out of time, but I'm not having a live music or that type of background music, And this is a family- oriented business.
You need to yes that one assured the neighbor that you know we do not want to have extra disturbance or anyone standing hanging, I know, we're right, acrosss the street from the projects- This is like a little bit of gang related area, but at the same time, if I, if I need it for whatever the I will, provide to help and make sure that we manage everything correctly, just to point it out that the gentleman did say in general, the area without without the liquor.
Although the corporation applied a beer, wine license, there's no existing license at this location and has not been for at least seven years that there was a hundred percent corporate change to that to the present applicant that we administratively approved in September of 2017.
Given these circumstances and that the applicant is proposing to continue to maintain the method of operation as a restaurant, you're, maintaining the business name.
So those stipulations would be that he's going to operate at spanish, a full service, spanish restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food during all hours of operation, without with the hour the amendment hours that he gained with no outdoor space, a fixed, facade, recorded background , there's no djs, no live music, no, promoting events.
But if it's at the valid point all right and to finish what you were saying, Clinton, and so you know, I was going to say you know if you want to support existing businesses, not bringing in new businesses to spread the customer base, even thinner, you know, and if it's a new business coming in, they have the option to you, know, apply for a full license or come to us to be heard for something else, as opposed to just going through the administrative approval.
And then, and the ones that do not hear their wine licenses are the ones that do not have any issues like they do not have a lot of licensed applications to begin with, and they may not just choose not to hear them or comment on them in any way, rather than administratively approving them.
What's going on, I think existing businesses who've been operating for years throughout the Covid-19.
They do not like the terms, they can say no we're going to come and be heard by the committee and take our chances all right.
The existing businesses do not have would not have the restriction right, so they could apply to upgrade the existing beer wine licenses could apply and they may We can say that we want businesses who are agreeing that their businesses are not going to substantially change within a period of time, and you know that they're going to it here to the method of operation for which they were granted the administrative approval for a period of time, and that in this climate of really of uncertainty that that's the expectation we have for the new businesses that want to have year.
We do need to do it at some point, because I you know, I think, especially we are opening indoors going to 50 at the end of October.
Potentially, I know that the applicants could come and go before the committee without administrative approval, but I just worry: It might be a little protectionist, which would could have some unintended consequences right.
With, And so, as a deterrent, I mean as someone who works for a person who is opening up a said, new business who has invested a lot of money into it.
