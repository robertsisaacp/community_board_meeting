Okay, all right, we're going to begin the meeting, and this is the sla DCA licensing committee of community board.
We may take the applications before the other agenda items to be heard, which are two numbers two and three, but we do first have to move to an approval of previous month minutes to officially begin the meeting.
And, it's a second floor mezzanine there was a or have there have been long-standing wine beer licenses at this location, Most, notably saline restaurant, which we last approved.

, there's no agreement about having somebody crowds and noise outside There are 11 ops within 500, and the applicant listed no license experience, but managerial experience at a restaurant on mulberry street for 10 years.
Yes, it is, as maybe some people from the community working last weekend, our we just have a dinner in dining tables and that's our purity just serving and closing by 10 like and serving you know, Because, as you say, mostly of the people right now or the restaurants only can open outdoors and that's one was the main reason that we take this place because we want to take give the people the right to don't go outside, because sometimes you see outside in the open streets, it's been accidents.
I actually used to live on the sixth floor above in 186, so I was there for many years and once as alex mentioned, some of the businesses were fine with the backyard space, The ones that the noise did tend to be.
I, know one person that one principal wrote 10 years experience at the business on mulberry street.
Yes, I've been working for like more than 10 years, like managing restaurant and like helping in accounting, getting licensed certifying with the health department.

What and the information the application about the experience of the applicant is that he seems to have been the manager at this business for while it's been in operation, but I, don't know if that's the three years it's been in operation or left, okay, so First I'm, going to give you an opportunity to speak or make a presentation about your application, but I just want to know with respect to the stipulations at the end What is it's a very small business All right and what is in the facade?
We know that there is a lot of problems with gangs and shootings and stabbings in this area, but I could assure you that I will hire securely if anything will come out of time, but I'm not having a live music or that type of background music And this is a family-oriented business.
I just wanted to raise that issue with the applicants and the the committee members I didn't realize this was going to come up, so quickly.
It's, you know I'm just trying I'm just trying to like make it make it work right now , Usually people are out and about at that time.
And, it's a long-standing business with an applicant who has you know as a tie to the business and that he's actually been the manager for seven years in the well for five years, Okay, all right, I will go to the making of a resolution, so it will be a deny Unless the applicant agrees, the stipulations that we enumerate at the end.
Given these circumstances and that the applicant is proposing to continue to maintain the method of operation as a restaurant, you're, maintaining the business name.
So those stipulations would be that he's going to operate at spanish, a full service, spanish restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food during all hours of operation, without with the hour the amendment hours that he gained with no outdoor space, a fixed, facade, recorded background , there's no djs, no live music, no, promoting events, no events with cover fees, no scheduled performances, no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited, drink, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and someone outside to oversee who will be outside.
If it's at the valid point all right and to finish what you were saying, clinton, and so you know, I was going to say you know If you want to support existing businesses, not bringing in new businesses to spread the customer base, even thinner, you know, and if it's a new business coming in, they have the option to you, know, apply for a full license or come to us to be heard for something else, as opposed to just going through the administrative approval.
And then, and the ones that don't hear their wine licenses are the ones that don't have any issues like they don't have a lot of licensed applications to begin with, and they may not just choose not to hear them or comment on them in any way, rather than administratively approving them.
What's going on, I think existing businesses who've been operating for years throughout the Covid-19.
They don't like the terms, they can say no we're going to come and be heard by the committee and take our chances all right.
Don't have wouldn't have the restriction right, so they could apply to upgrade the existing beer wine licenses could apply and they may We can say that we want businesses who are agreeing that their businesses aren't going to substantially change within a period of time, and you know that they're going to it here to the method of operation for which they were granted the administrative approval for a period of time and that in this climate of really of uncertainty that that's the expectation we have for the new businesses that want to have year.
Just saying why don't we just do do the stipulation regarding the period of time after administrative approval to come back to the community?
Potentially, I know that the applicants could come and go before the committee without administrative approval, but I just worry: It might be a little protectionist, which would could have some unintended consequences right.
Because it's certainly not that kind of time frame is not going to have an impact on Is that what you mean herman to evaluate whether or not it's having like a deterrent effect on your wine application?
With, And so, as a deterrent, I mean as someone who works for a person who is opening up a said, new business who has invested a lot of money into it.
