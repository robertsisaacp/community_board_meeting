The advisory committee, is comprised of d cars and all the local elected offices, including congress, lady nidia, velazquez's office, senator kavanagh, assembly, woman, neil borah, president gail brewer, council member chain cp3, and also the five tenants from 70 marbury street first.
They want to know what the community visions first At the last at the previous land use committee, meetings.
So problem is that d cars would have to decide like which would to include in the advisory committee and which could not, which may complicate and delay the process to hire the engagement, consultant.
You know like many preservationists and also other commun community members are aware that decas was hiring a engagement consultant and they just made an announcement today that a firm has been contract to do the job and the name is called three by three But today is just the first day.
However, I also have a feeling there may be a delay, because his government job and speaking of opinions, you are very familiar with low east side, preservation, initiative and think chinatown and a few other groups, and they constantly come to community board meetings to testify and advocate to preserve the current structure.
First, I just want a clarification when you said they've stopped demolition now at the second floor and the staircase, they are not going to proceed any further with demolition until the community engagement process is complete.
Yes, in fact, like I, said before, other advisory committee members are also present.
We, have it on the agenda, I think the fact that, because didn't actually show up, even though we asked them to constantly come in our committee or as soon as you know, as frequently as possible.
What is that all of this advisory council, as opposed to the community engagement who who's qualifying- You know all this kind of stuff, so just train stating what we think is the minimum basic them coming in front of a formal community meeting to talk about what they're doing and then engaging the preservation engineer to evaluate the options?.
I communicate very closely with linda and if we think that it should be on the agenda for wrestle, then I think we can do that, but I just feel like I want to like do some more background church and also discuss with try to push d class to do it one more time and also talk to other elected officers.
Answer that question since I think a lot of people actually also wanted to know, so We are not sure if city has a position now also for the advisory committee meetings that I went to the city just told us that they stopped the demolition right now they are not moving on with the demolition until after the until after the engagement process And I guess the outcome of that engagement, report, and that is the answer.
I mean it's easy to promise and you just mentioned that they won't do anything until the report is done, but we don't want to wait so long unless we don't make, if we don't make sure that they schedule time and session with the what is considered the public engagement and if the advisory committee is the responsible party for engaging , then we would also like you know that to be somehow made public either through the cb3 website or some other forum, so that people know when things are happening.
You know this consultant may be fine and it'd be a fine choice, So I mean I use that just as a singular example that the transparency and the community engagement has not been there, and I support.
I just want to give what I already know from the advisory committee to the public and also my committee, members.
Once we have the details like how to reach out to the com, committee, community organizations or groups or public So, this is my first time sort of participating in the chinatown.
You know this so-called informational session, but I think I'm repeating other people's requests, that we really need the city to be much more engaged.
