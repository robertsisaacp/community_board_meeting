So I'm, going to and give you give you a quick overview and followed by committee in public sessions, so The advisory committee is comprised of d cars and all the local elected offices, including Congress Lady Nidia Velazquez's, office, Senator, Kavanagh, Assembly, woman, Neil, Borah, President, Gail, Brewer, council member chain cp3, and also the five tenants from 70 Marbury.
We want webcast to start a community engagement process immediately and that should allow the tenants, the prior attendance of the building residential neighbors elected offices and community for free to participate meaningfully in this process, and the third clause is to talk about.
They all sent a letter to D Cass and asked the d- cars to conduct a preservation report, but the d- cars, a response that they want to wait until the Engagement document is completed.
They want to know what the community visions first At the last at the previous land Use committee, meetings.
So problem is that D cars would have to decide like which would to include in the advisory committee and which could not, which may complicate and delay the process to hire the engagement, consultant.
You know like many preservationists and also other commun community members are aware that Decas was hiring a engagement consultant and they just made an announcement today that a firm has been contract to do the job and the name is called three by three But today is just the first day.
However, I also have a feeling there may be a delay, because his government job and speaking of opinions, you are very familiar with low East, side, preservation, initiative and think Chinatown and a few other groups, and they constantly come to community board meetings to testify and advocate to preserve the current structure.
So, basically, there's not no real substantive decisions have been made other than hiring the engagement consultant, and that was because Dcas wants to engage the community before making any changes from what we've heard previously at other committee.
Yes, in fact, like I, said before, other advisory committee members are also present.
We, have it on the agenda, I think the fact that, because did not actually show up, even though we asked them to constantly come in our committee or as soon as you know, as frequently as possible.
Is that all of this advisory council, as opposed to the community engagement who who's qualifying- You know all this kind of stuff, so just train stating what we think is the minimum basic them coming in front of a formal community meeting to talk about what they're doing and then engaging the preservation engineer to evaluate the options?
I communicate very closely with Linda and if we think that it should be on the agenda for wrestle, then I think we can do that, but I just feel like I want to like do some more background church and also discuss with try to push d class to do it one more time and also talk to other elected officers.
We do not use the chat box to post opinions or comments, but I'm just going to quickly answer that question since I think a lot of people actually also wanted to know, We, the city's position.
I mean it's easy to promise, and you just mentioned that they won't do anything until the report is done, but we do not want to wait so long unless we do not make if we do not make sure that they schedule time and session with the what is considered the public engagement and if the advisory committee is the responsible party for engaging , then we would also that to be somehow made public either through the CB3 website or some other forum, so that people know when things are happening.
Jenny Lowe's suggestion that there be a regular report back and the fact that Dcas was asked to come tonight, Is that what I'm understanding I mean is yet another example of this lack of transparency and engagement, and I find that really disturbing.
Once we have the details like how to reach out to the Com Committee community organizations or groups or public This is my first time sort of participating in the Chinatown.
It is made of the five original tenants of 70 Marbury street, all the local elected offices and also committee offering No like no residents from the local Chinatown community, because I mean there is a process for tag members to become members or a process for local people to become part of the Consultation Advisory Committee, because I'm in I'm in the Gowanus canal- Advisory Com, Group Committee, whatever in the air in this local area, due to the superfund, that's happening.
So- called informational, session, but I think I'm repeating other people's requests, that we really need the city to be much more engaged, and if you can ask d cast, as I have put in my question, here, sd class to update the community.
