Recording has started. Thank you, so it's 6 37, let's just start the meeting good evening. Everyone welcome to cb freelance committee meeting for tuesday September 15 2020.. We are conducting the meeting through soon tonight and linda my vice chair, she's managing the platform and, as usual linda. Can you give a brief introduction about the zoom functions and some guidelines? Please, okay, I don't have that document, but really, I think the thing that people often don't know how to do is how to raise their hands. So you do that by bringing up the participant list and at the bottom of that list, you'll see a little hand and you click it, and that raises your hand and I believe it's controls- that's yeah control, six on a phone, something six. Thank you. Thank you linda, thank you and I also want linda. Can you mute the people who would that be? Okay? Probably just me, oh okay, so I also want to emphasize that please use the chat box for check-in and ask technical or procedural questions. Only please put your name title and affiliation in the chat box, because we always keep a record of attendance. Do not use the chat box to share your point of view or discuss any issues. I understand it can be very tempting to do so, but please just do not do it or you will be removed from the meeting. This is a cp3 policy and I also want to emphasize that everyone who wants to speak should raise their hands first and get recognized by the chairperson. This is just to me maintain the order of the meeting, so we can move it better. Thank you. I see people are already checking in. Thank you so much on for that so tonight. Our first item on the agenda is to approve the minutes for our august meeting and michael, can you please do a road calling to see if everyone approve oppose abstain present not voting at the same time.

So the next item on our agenda today is some 7d marbury street update. So I'm going to and give you give you a quick overview and followed by committee in public sessions, so I'm the official rep of cd3 to the 70 marbury street advisory committee, created by dcas. The advisory committee is comprised of d cars and all the local elected offices, including congress, lady nidia velazquez's office, senator kavanagh assembly, woman, neil borah president gail brewer, council member chain cp3, and also the five tenants from 70 marbury street first. I would like to start. I want to revisit our cp3 position on this on this issue and also share with you the current status of the site. So linda, could you pull out the pull up the document file I sent you earlier. I think you are mute yes hold on. I just have to move this to the other screen where it can be seen and well. You build I'll share all right, yep, okay, so all right, so we had a. We have a long, cp3 resolution on this on this issue, and I just extract for the resolve clauses that is applicable to the current development and the first two bosses talk about. We want webcast to start a community engagement process immediately and that should allow the tenants, the prior attendance of the building residential neighbors elected offices and community for free to participate meaningfully in this process, and the third clause is to talk about. We want d cars to expedite the reconstruction of the building and hopefully the building can be reoccupying within three years, and the last clause is that we want d-cars to continue to demolish the building until we reach ground floor. At the same time, we want d cars to to hire an independent engineer, company with historic persuasion, background to conduct a structural inspection and also historic inspection, and that is the requests that we made at cv3 and then the next. I would like to show what you have right now linda. Can you show the photo? Please? Oh yes, I can. I think it just takes a moment to open up photos on this computer. Thank you linda hi, and this is the wait. Let me see, are you seeing it? Yes, I can see that. Thank you linda, and this is the current site, as you can see from the photo. Dcas has already stopped the demolition. Actually, I think they stopped at the demolition since June, but because actually started at the second floor instead of ground floor, as we asked and you see the tower on the left side, that tower is just a staircase where the staircase is located and from the town hall you know, d cars hide the engineer company to conduct the inspection, and the report was shared with the public. However, the report did not include a preservation side, so I remember so recently all the elected officers, including margaret's office, kavanaugh's office, yulin borough, president gail. They all sent a letter to d cass and asked the d-cars to conduct a preservation report, but the d-cars a response that they want to wait until the engagement document is completed. The engagement process is completed and then decide what to do. They want to know what the community visions first and I remember at the last at the previous land use committee meetings. I think it was olympia. You asked whether the you think that the committee, the advisory committee, should add preservationists to it and and advisory committee had discussed this before and in fact is not just the preservationist. There are other chinatown organizations who also expressed their desire to join the advisory committee. So problem is that d cars would have to decide like which would to include in the advisory committee and which could not, which may complicate and delay the process to hire the engagement consultant. But but we are, we will make sure that the preservationist opinions are also included in the engagement and speaking of the engagement consultant. So you know they pre. You know like many preservationists and also other commun community members are aware that decas was hiring a engagement consultant and they just made an announcement today that a firm has been contract to do the job and the name is called three by three and there's a press release and I'm sure you can find more information about it online. But today is just the first day. So I don't have much detail to share with you about the engagement yet, but it says community board. We want to make sure that the firm reached out to as many stakeholders in the community as possible and find out the prevailing opinion and so far they said this process is it should take about 90 days. However, I also have a feeling there may be a delay, because his government job and speaking of opinions, you are very familiar with low east side, preservation, initiative and think chinatown and a few other groups, and they constantly come to community board meetings to testify and advocate to preserve the current structure. But there are also other groups from chinatown, such as chinese, consolidated by northwestern association. They have over 100 years of history in chinatown, their own properties, and many local residents are their members. They also send us letters asking future development to including to include affordable housing, so the two opinions are kind of somewhat like conflicting and what I told everyone is that, just to stay tuned for the engagement and participate in it and the advisory committee is not just made up of the ten, the seventy marbury tenants, but also elected officers cb3, and we will make all possible effort to make sure that everyone's voice is heard and so far that's all. I have I'm gonna open up to committee session and you can ask committee members can ask questions or make statements. Just remember that I don't represent DCA. So I understand this is a passionate subject, but I may not have the answers or information you'd like to hear I'm just sharing with you what I know so committee members. So I have your my hand up. I'm sorry. So I was gonna just say. I was under the impression that we had asked for them to come in front of our committee and it was not supposed to happen then, right next month, but the months after, but I think we haven't seen them again, have we saw it's the Covid-19 months passed so quickly have shouldn't they be coming to report instead of you. I think that is a good point. I'm your point is taken. I think we're gonna reach out to d cars to see if they can come to land use to report. Michael, thank you yeah. So I was just wondering that staircase in that photo, when we talk about demolishing it to the ground floor, does that include the staircase or is the staircase staying? I'm not sure. If you know the answer to that and then yeah. I guess I guess that's my main question right now. So when we asked d cast like I'm going back to our own wrestle, we asked dicas to demolish until ground floor. So originally our goal was to make sure that at least ground floor was not demolished and instead of the in and but then d cast, instead of doing that, it actually stopped at the second floor and the whole tower. I think it's a whole structure, so I don't I'm not. I don't have a sort of answer for you, but I'm guessing the whole tower is a staircase. So if you have to remove it, you have to remove the whole thing. You cannot just remove part of it. That's what I'm guessing I could be wrong, but that is what I am thinking: okay and then just to follow up. So, basically, there's not no real substantive decisions have been made other than hiring the engagement consultant, and that was because dcas wants to engage the community before making any changes from what we've heard previously at other committee hearings. That is correct, so dcas basically stop the whole project they want to. The decision will be made after a after the community engagement process after the company. The consultant finished their report. Okay, great thank you and I just want to maybe hear I'm sure I know there are lots of the tenants signed in right now. I just want to hear from them to see if they're concerned, because I know there was a concern about the possible delay of all of this, and I just want to you know, hear from them and see what they have to say about. You know just timing, just because I know it's really vital that we get them back as soon as possible. Thanks. Thank you, michael. When we open up to public session, I would make sure they have a chance to talk about their concept, but lisa is waiting. So it's okay. How come! I cannot see the participants. Let me see: okay, I'm sorry, lisa! You go ahead, yeah first, I just want a clarification when you said they've stopped demolition now at the second floor and the staircase they are not going to proceed any further with demolition until the community engagement process is complete. Is that your understanding? That is my understanding we have. We also have certain other members of the advisory committee in the in our meeting tonight. If something, I said, is incorrect, please correct me, but I think that is, that is my understanding, lisa and then my question is, I guess, I'm really concerned and confused about why they couldn't go ahead and engage. A preservation is to go through the building in the meantime, so that information could be available when the community engagement process is underway. It seems like just having that study doesn't do anything but allow for more informed consideration by the community group. I think it's a mistake to wait the 90 days, I think it does. You know both detracts from the information available for people while they're making these determinations and b slows down the process. Our board took that position that we want that, and I don't see any reason why we wouldn't go ahead and insist on them doing it. I don't oppose you on that lisa. In fact, all the elected officers are with you. That's why they sent a letter to d cars to push for that. I think they probably gonna continue to do that and will be part of it and we will be part of it. Cb3 will push for that as well cp free. If so, we want to know what this we have to discuss with other elected officers as well to see if they are also following up on that. If they do, then we can be part of it and if they don't, we should do it on our own. Now we probably should yeah I mean I can raise that in the next meeting too I mean we could have eraser today we could yes, but yes, we could have a wrestle today if we really want to. I just think that we want to wait until I mean I want to have a another round with discussion with the elected officers. First, that's you know, linda sorry. I can't raise my hand the normal way because I'm the host. Yes, I just want to support what lisa said. It makes no sense to me that they just don't get on with the preservation assessment, and that would be information that would be input to the community engagement process. Why wait until afterwards, no make any sense at all, because presumably the community engagement people will want to know what the options are, and you know what the costs are and what the time frames are. All of that depends on the preservation assessment, I'll bring that point to the committee meeting. Yes, in fact, like I said before, other advisory committee members are also present. Tonight I mean probably not all of them, but I saw some of them, so your point is well taken. We are aware of of this request and I think this is a very legit request, and this is also our boss position, so I I'm gonna like try to push for that in the next committee meeting. Thank you. That olympia's hand is up. No, I I'm trying to raise it, but okay consider excited. I wanted to ask so that I understand just because we know how difficult it is. Timing-Wise. You know we're gonna have our next meeting in a month, and there is all these issues of putting things on the agenda today. We have it on the agenda and I mean just restating what we need. I think the fact that, because didn't actually show up, even though we asked them to constantly come in our committee or as soon as you know, as frequently as possible, the fact that there is this hiring of this of this engagement company that we know by the way these engagement companies in the past when they were involved with land use projects. Sometimes they were not really very effective. I mean I'm all for engagement and participation, but we don't know how meaningful it will be, and so I feel there is an urgency for us to. You know articulate these things that you are brought up today in a in a you know, simple razor, because I don't know if we wait one more month and we have to put it again on the agenda and you don't know what's the agenda next month and I think there are important issues here, including the fact that you know this. I it's not clear to me, even though I said all these things and all these things. What is that all of this advisory council, as opposed to the community engagement who who's qualifying- and you know all this kind of stuff, so just train stating what we think is the minimum basic them coming in front of a formal community meeting to talk about what they're doing and then engaging the preservation engineer to evaluate the options? I think I think it's the right way to go. I would rather like try to talk to the committee advisory committee and d class first and in fact, talking about if we really want to do in the next month, the agenda we can make the agenda possible in on this issue. I communicate very closely with linda and if we think that it should be on the agenda for wrestle, then I think we can do that, but I just feel like I want to like do some more background church and also discuss with try to push d class to do it one more time and also talk to other elected officers. First, that's just my own opinion, but if other people feel like you might remind people, it's not proper to do a resolution when it wasn't on the agenda that we were going to do that. This is just an informational presentation. Thank you, linda, thank you, and also victor. Just victor hughie just want to remind you that the chat room. You cannot use it to talk about your point of view. I understand this is something you like you want to talk about your opinion, but we don't want the chat room to become a second discussion. I'm just you know be mindful about that. So committee members, if you don't have further questions, I want to move to public sessions. Thank you, I'm just going to go by the list collin hold on okay. You hear me yes, okay, I would, I would agree with linda and at least another one. The contractors who did the demolition is coming back in about a week or so to put a cap on it to put a cap on the second floor, because right now, there's no cap on it and the it we're not concerned about the inside, but the walls are exposed to the elements. We've had a lot of rain in the last month and a half so they're coming back, I understand within the week to put a cap on the building and since they are going back into the building, isn't it prudent for us for cb3 and the elected to allow an independent structural analysis of the building? This way we have their report and the advisory committee, whoever may be on it can make can make an educated. You know, can proceed, you know without with the preservation report, and you have a better. You have a better understanding on how to proceed. You also have a timeline of whether to rebuild, say, save the facade rebuild from there and you know the amount of the timeline to be for the building to be completed. Now you just you just the committee does not have enough information to move forward. Without that structural analysis and yeah, I would say you know you can write a resolution tonight requesting that you know you can draft the resolution from the floor here. Like I said your point is taken. I are you still talking collin? No, I'm finished working, I'm done, okay, all right, so I your point is taken and because we said this is an information session. So we don't. We don't do that and also I also want to discuss with other elected officers first before doing that and but your point is taken, I would have that in our next discussion with d cars and also the elected offices. Okay, can I just add something to that quickly? I think all right now I saw a letter somewhere a reply from the cash commissioner or one of the deputy commissioners to Manhattan borough president gail brewer's office, where they said they would have to reopen the building, but the building right now is not sealed in any way I mean you know, all you have to do is unlock the padlock at the construction gate and remove a piece of plywood to allow the structural engineer in there. It's not that the building was sealed. I mean if they it's really a decision they need to make I mean if they want to open up the building. They just really just open it up and go in. So I don't see, there's a big technical problem. There is really the decision so, but your point is taken. Thank you colin. Next, I want to go to alan hi, jackie. I just wanted to follow up on the on the questions that were posed by the local businesses on those blocks and during so I think they had asked a question regarding these reopening, as well as air pollution regarding asbestos right, the small business on bayer street and marbury. They raised those two questions in the town hall, so so I mean for those who actually walk by that area. Often, you may already know that one thing has already opened up for traffic like running of bayer, already opened up and also bowery, I'm sorry an awesome marbury, but because of the open street restaurant program. So some parking spots in that area are taken for outdoor dialing, but traffic can still pass through now. So I think the local business should be okay with that setting for now and in terms of in terms of air quality. I actually asked these cars that question before so because I remember last time the small business people have concerned about asbestos in the air, and so dcas is not monitoring the air quality. Now it's not monitoring it anymore because they said that they are treating these sites as any other site. So if there's no construction going on, they don't need to monitor the air quality. However, if the construction resume, then they will come back to monitor that. So that's all I have for air quality and open street okay. Next richard moses, richard. Thank you good evening. Everyone and I just want to reiterate, lower east side preservation initiative, support for the preservation assessment, in fact, with all the community support for this assessment, we're really not clear for any compelling reason on the part of d-cass to hold back on one, and I just want to say there have been hundreds of letters sent to the city administration, several rallies in front of the building testimonies. As you all know, at this committee, as well as the joint letter from the four elect local elected officials- and you know we don't know why d cass is holding back on this. There really doesn't seem to be a clear reason and again, just to reiterate it. Just you know provides options. It gives you a good cost estimate on what those options are and gives you a sensible roadmap going forward and again we want to reiterate our support for including a preservation, a preservationist on the committee also to help develop and weigh options and provide technical input where it's needed. So you know. We hope that this committee will support that as well. So thank you very much. Thank you richard before I go to jenny, there's a question posted by cnn, cn, like I said before, we don't use the chat box to post opinions or comments, but I'm just gonna quickly answer that question since I think a lot of people actually also wanted to know, so we the city's position, we don't this. We are not sure if city has a position now also for the advisory committee meetings that I went to the city just told us that they stopped the demolition right now they are not moving on with the demolition until after the until after the engagement process and the decision would not be made until after the engagement reports comes out. So right now is really nothing going on and whether they want to preserve the building or demolish the building or any future development would depends on. I guess the outcome of that engagement report, and that is the answer I have. I have right now so next jenny thanks jackie, so I'm glad to hear that they are stopping the work at the demolition and farmers to engage the community right. So my question is: how are they engaging the community? What is the schedule? What is it being done because, based on past experience in recent past experience, the mayor is not very good about transparency and like we need to make sure that we hold them accountable to have scheduled sessions in terms of the engagement? What does that mean? I mean it's easy to promise and you just mentioned that they won't do anything until the report is done, but we don't want to wait so long unless we don't make, if we don't make sure that they schedule time and session with the what is considered the public engagement and if the advisory committee is the responsible party for engaging, then we would also like you know that to be somehow made public either through the cb3 website or some other forum, so that people know when things are happening. That is a very quick question, like I said before, today is just the first day of the engagement, so I don't have much detail to share with you, but from the conversation we had, I'm not just not just with the tenants and the in the consulting firm and also all the elected offices, one of the goal or like a major goal. We have is to make sure that the process is to make sure that everyone from the community is hurt and the process is fair and transparent. In fact, today I remember this elected officers who emphasized that transparency is important. I don't have detail to share with you yet, however, I'm sure we would make sure that the process engage all the parties and also like I said before: it's not just community board like you can. Also, if you have any concern, you can also talk to your elected offices. If, if the process in any way is not fair or transparent, I don't think they're going to be staying, they will stay silent so and if I have when I have more details, I about the engagement I'll share with you, but today I just don't have all the details yet. Thank you, jackie thanks and next is susan chin. You jackie susan hi. How are you very good? Thank you. It's been a while, and so I'm wearing my preservation hat right now and also the fact that my father went to ps23. So you know I care a lot about 70 mulberry, so I would really advocate for the preservation assessment so that you all have the best information in terms of whatever significant building material is left, also how to treat it and also you know, the dcas response depended a lot on lero lero's report and I have to say after I read it seemed very basic. So the types of information that you in the community engagement process need to make it's really clear that it it's lacking, and so how do you convey that to d cast that you know it isn't just any building material or whatever that it is much more significant? So I just making a passion plea for you all to have the best information possible. I'm hearing tonight that a lot of speakers are advocating for that preservationist and analysis. That assessment- and I hear they're loud and clear. Thank you. Thank you. Susan yeah next is amy hi everyone. I agree with what has been said today and what I really want to talk to you with transparency, and I feel like dcas has not been entirely transparent and I use as an example the selection of the community engagement consultant last time when dcas presented we had asked if we could get a copy of the RFP and we were told it was on the website and then we went on the website and it wasn't there because it was only sent to a limited pre-selected group of consultants who had been pre-approved now. You know this consultant may be fine and it'd be a fine choice, but then they didn't even give us a copy of the RFP. So I mean I use that just as a singular example that the transparency and the community engagement has not been there, and I support jenny lowe's suggestion that there be a regular report back and the fact that dcas was asked to come tonight, and I guess they declined to come or they didn't show up. Is that what I'm understanding I mean is yet another example of this lack of transparency and engagement, and I find that really disturbing. They should be giving us a timetable, and I mean we're not going to hold them to it, because we know that schedules change, but they should be giving us a timetable of when things were happening and as for the advisory committee, I understand the composition of it currently, but at some point it's supposed to be opened up to other voices in the community. So when will that be- and you know things like that- don't just happen on the turn of a dime people should be preparing. I mean we don't do tasks in our lives like one at a time one after the other I mean they should be soliciting names now and suggestions as to who should be on the advisory committee. So I find the whole process really disturbing in its lack of transparency and orderliness, and I think the community board should be a little bit more proactive in getting answers. Amy just want to your points on the members of the advisory committee is taken, and I just want to clarify one thing so tonight, because I'm the rep for for of cd3 to the advisory committee. We I discussed this with linda. I just want to give what I already know from the advisory committee to the public and also my committee members. However, we are going to reach to ask dcas to come to the meeting, but we are not in so this time. We actually did not just want to clarify that. However, I would try to, but we actually asked them before whether they would come to the meeting regularly and we didn't get a very strong positive feedback. However, I'll follow up with them to see, if there's any way, they can do regular updates through the cp3 platform and fanny hi. Okay, I just want to quickly say I just want to quickly echo everybody's sentiments about this preservation assessment. I mean the fact that they keep on holding it off and delaying it. I mean, I think everyone I, the first thought that comes to my mind is that they don't want to find out. What's going to be in that assessment, or they feel that you know they're worried about what could possibly in that assessment and that's why they are, they don't want to do it and it goes back to transparency. You know this whole. This whole effort from the start has been lack of transparency, and this is just another tactic that they're using to just do what they want and just not in involve the community, and I'm just curious also for the the cag the community group is there have has have there been like a schedule yet as to how often they're going to meet and how they can relate what they have been discussing. The meetings like how they're going to relay that to the public is it going to be open to the public I mean, has that been figured out yet talked about disgust or anything? I mentioned that before in terms of the details of the engagement today is the first day, so I don't have the detail to share with you. I'm sorry about that. But once we have the details like how to reach out to the com, committee, community organizations or groups or public and I'll share with you, okay, all right yeah. So that's it! That's all. I want to say it's just thank you friend! Thank you, susan young, yeah, okay. So this is my first time sort of participating in the chinatown. This is the advisory committee, or I mean I'm just wondering how does one become a member of the advisory committee? Okay, so you want to know the composition of the advisory committee. It is made of the five original tenants of 70 marbury street, all the local elected offices and also committee offering oh so I mean yeah, no like no residents from the local chinatown community, because I mean there is a process for tag members to become members or a process for local people to become part of the consultation advisory committee, because I'm in I'm in the gowanus canal- and I am a member and managed to get on the consultant advisory com group committee, whatever in the air in this local area, due to the superfund, that's happening, so I'm just questioning why any other local residents of chinatown could be part of this committee advisory group. I mean it's, that's how we it becomes more transparent to the local residents. I mean, as opposed to being road blocking sitting at meetings, to listen to what locals suggest to the cag meetings. That's not how that's not transparency, because I mean you know the lo. The members you have now are already set up with the mentos set up as I'm hearing now so I mean you know you should probably continue to I mean you should probably open up the committee. Okay, your point is taken. Thank you, chris mate yeah. Thank you for hosting this committee. My only question is: can we have ecas come to a full board meeting and announce a timeline there? I think you'll give them enough time to present what they haven't planned for the fall and when specifically, as carlin mentioned, the elements are going to start playing a heavier influence on what gets preserved and what doesn't get preserved. Can we, at the very least ask for that yeah? We can ask for that. That's a good point. Actually I mean there's a. There is a timeline we so far. We know they want to finish their engagement in 90 days, but in terms of specific timelines about each phrase, I think we can ask them. Okay, so olympia, you have the last question. Thank you. I was just wondering also given what we heard today. If, at the last meeting, we have to add this item in the agenda, maybe we should also invite the company to understand you know what is the parameters of this engagement right because, as susan suggested earlier, there is a very skewed advisory board right now, and so, if how does that engagement gonna do outreach to make sure you know local stakeholders are involved and right- and you know what is you- can engage people in a meaningful and unmeaningful way? We really know nothing about all this yeah, and so maybe in our next agenda we can add something around that, so that it is more meaningful. I think yeah. I think you have a good point on that. I agree next is at gene, so actually will be the last question after that, I'm gonna try to wrap up that ed. Are you able to hear me? Yes, hi, I'm a former member of chinatown planning council before it became the chinese american planning council. I I'm new to this. I just want to make a few points and questions. I'm not sure. Is there a actual written vision as to what the building, what we want from the buildings we want it to look like it was just before the fire, or is this an opportunity to make it something more specific, be it a senior center or a daycare center or a learning center? I think one of the problems that I I'm seeing is that they're, probably too many players involved and many people are getting in the in the act and one of the problems is that there's a timeline that's rapidly changing my recommendation. Is you should probably I that's a recommendation that you offer to the community the choices that you think that the vision that the planners have as to what they want, get their input and use that be it a support to help direct the project? I know one of the difficulties is that a lot of times many groups have their own vision, but the, but by the time this is built, we really need the community that's to decide whether they want to make it do they want to return it to what it was just before the fire. Or do we want to make it something that will be useful for the community? The those are my only comments. Thank you ed and I'm glad that you spoke because it just remind me of something else, because at the beginning of the meeting, michael perlis asked me to make sure that the attendants also get a chance to speak, and I totally forget that. So, if I'm attendance I mean tenants means the tenants of 70 marbury street. If you are present tonight and if there's any point you want to make, please raise your hand. I just totally forget sorry about that and in terms of your opinion about visioning, I remember at the time hall meeting dicas announced that they mentioned that they want community members community members to express their desire for these sites freely you they don't want you to be bound by zoning or other factors, and just imagine and tell us what you want to see for the in the future development and in our own community bought free resolution. I think we also- I don't. I don't know if I remember this correctly, but lisa help me if you, if I'm wrong, I thought we also said that we want to see if, if we want to expand the possibility of having other community use in that building, but I just have to go back to the wrestler to confirm so. But delay looks like I mean it is a process, so I don't have much to say about that. It's a process that to engage people and engagement will take a little bit of time. That's why, like because forecast this engagement takes 90 days and I have a feeling it's gonna be longer than that. Hopefully it will be on time, but I just not very confident if I could just throw out a suggestion in terms of getting the community involved and fundraising. I I'm a city college, alumnus and many years ago. What they decided to do was supposedly sell a brick for a a memory war memorial wall, which you would put your name and ea graduated. I think they charged, maybe a nominal 100. If you were since we're rebuilding, I mean I'm sure there are many alumni from ps23 and their families that would like to have some kind of input in terms of leaving some kind of a name or something in memory of people in the past. This would be a somewhat of a, I think, a nice gesture permanent and it doesn't cost that much money, and this would also give you leverage in terms of trying to create what the final vision would be, because you'll be able to show that you have the support of the community. You also have money, that's a very good suggestion. I don't know how government funding would be used in this project in the future and how they would need to raise money. But that is a very good suggestion. I'm sure I mean your I'm sure. Other elected officers will hear you as well, so we would have that in mind in terms of fundraising- and I just want to remind everyone in the chat room. Please do not use that to discuss the issue. Otherwise, I'm gonna ask linda to just switch that to a function that no one can see you, so please make sure that we don't want the chatbot to be to become a side discussion cn. You are the last one really the last one. Okay, sorry, I didn't realize that we can just simply raise our hands and ask the questions. So I appreciate you know this so-called informational session, but I think I'm repeating other people's requests, that we really need the city to be much more engaged and if you can ask d cast, as I have put in my question here, sd class to update the community wait, I can't see it now to update the community through our community organization. Think chinatown that has been doing a really great job in informing community member like myself, to keep me informed about what's going on, and that would be much appreciated. You know this is our tax dollars that we're talking about. This is our community that has hosted non-profits in our community for decades and that's a very vital part of our community of chinatown, so for the city to do something without engaging the people who use those communities. Services is a wages, you know and we as a community in chinatown should not be discriminated, and I see this as discrimination if we're not properly, you know engaged in this process. So I appreciate, if you can let d cast know that we would like, as a community and to for them to you know, update the information on thing chinatown's web page all right. Thank you. Thank you for your. I take it as a suggestion and thank you for that. So I'm going to, I have an answer. I have an answer to your question. I found there is and you're right, therefore, we're asking for involvement of the community for programmatic decisions of the building in the future. All right, thank you. So I'm just gonna write it up and committee members do I do you have any other questions? If not, I'm going to to close the meeting and do I have a motion to return jackie, can I just can I just add yes, people any people who are signed onto this meeting if they haven't already to add their name just so we have it for the the minutes.
