I am a part of the committee I'm, an educator in the district I am the dean of students at a school on east fourth street and first avenue they're heavily involved in the arts in the community locally, with special needs students, My son attends the star academy and he's involved with a lot of community-based organizations that service him.
I was one of the people who led the campaign for the infamous abarello that required people a permit in order to dance, and it was used to discriminate against lgbtq and people of color, and we were able to repeal this law after 93 years So. As a result of that, we also established an office of nightlife and I was asked from the city council to serve at the nightlife advisory board and I do deal a lot with all kind of arts that have to deal also with nightlife A lot of performing arts, music workers, dancers, all sorts of performers and right now in terms of the district needs I, can bring a lot of experience of the stories that I hear from the impact that it has on people that you know are not going to go back to work until there is a vaccine, and so this budget that we're talking about next year is still going to be key for these people, because they're not going to go back to work in live performance and touring is not going to start until there is a real solution.
There were a lot of different workshops and opportunities for people to participate, and the idea was is that there needed to be more diversity in the arts, and there were very specific suggestions as how the department of cultural affairs could incorporate diversity into their programming and to their funding for diversity in the different areas of the arts in new york city So, okay, carolyn one thing to add, is that about district needs, Is that we're writing this for fiscal year, 22, which is next july?
Since there are a lot of new committee members, I think it's important to remember that it's sort of a odd timing to you know be writing about what the area of the east village lower east side chinatown needs in terms of cultural and art support, but it's for the future and also to be precise, anisha I think we're talking about the budget that will be voted on july, 2021, actually correct, right , I think everybody's world has been to totally upside down with Covid-19 and what we're able to offer and what the city is going to be able to offer and budgets have been cut.
We are very lucky that the city has funded arts and culture, but it is somewhat reduced from what it had been in the past So I think the other thing is trying to find ways that we can incorporate into the district needs is how we can best serve the arts community in what we're proposing to go forward.
Programs that support the cultural life of low-income communities and marginalized groups, The pandemic will be on arts and culture, and we don't know if the same challenges that arts and culture had in our district from before will persist after it's likely for some of these things, but I think maybe like between the first paragraph and the second paragraph.
They've left are still here and so concentrate money to give this kind of classes, for let's call it like the communities that stayed in town that tend to be lower income and people of color is going to be very important, and we need to ask because the DOE has taken out the money from that and the services So I think these are two things that we could I think highlight, and they are pertinent because of the way the city budget that just passed was, and instead a lot of the other issues that people are facing.
It helps to maintain the social distance and the access, so people can just kind of walk by and see this without having to enter a space, but we're also providing support to the lower Manhattan community cultural council, which is sponsoring this particular project You know, as a you know: private developer, we're not just coming into a neighborhood, changing it and trying to build something there we're actually contributing to the community as well too You know there are large, obviously, corporations that are affected, but if they have the capacity to be able to kind of you know, work with some of the cultural institutions and help some local artists do and continue this arts work Would we go about our are incorporating this into the district needs statement to encourage businesses- or I would say, maybe like I would, let's say like let's focus on, like maybe landlords or property owners, both from the commercial or residential side?
You know when she reads something that comes out of a discipline statement and say this is an expense So, basically, I think anissa's point is very valid, because, even though this idea may be interesting, what we in the district needs is as if you're directing it to a program that you want from a city agency until their budget line So. Let's say if you think that the department of city planning or hpd should allocate money for landlords that do something like that.
They need food right now, so I think we should basically have revenue things that have a consistent way for people to make a living like revenue producing either we ask for grants or for programs that pay them et cetera, because, let's be honest, our district is hit.
Think if we're talking about preservation of cultural venues, you know we need to create maybe a new phrase in the beginning in which we stress the fact that we do have a lot of small organizations that are seeing sheets of their budget, and we can use some data from the study that the center for urban future has put out and tati shared and basically say that this organization will need You know for the next budget to reinstate support, make sure that you know they're giving this the I don't know if they're gonna survive all the way to the next budget.
Maybe if people feel really strongly that they want to update a certain section of this, then they should probably raise their hand and volunteer now for it, Otherwise they're going to be left out and it will get updated by somebody else or that if there are additional suggestions to add we could you know set, we could send them all to you know olympia and carolyn, since olympia has now offered to be the secretary, and we just used the next committee meeting to edit the draft of what that paragraph of the impact is and then go through that list and say yes, no, this works It use the next meeting as sort of like a working meeting to workshop the, especially since we have so much time we can meet in august and september.
