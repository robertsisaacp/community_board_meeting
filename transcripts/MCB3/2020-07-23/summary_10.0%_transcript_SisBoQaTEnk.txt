I, don't know if you want to explain what this district needs and how we've done it in the past, we're a very small subcommittee and what are our focus and also because I mean we discussed yesterday at the land use and zoning that, given the kobe 19 impact, we I mean we added some language.
You, don't have to use the raised hands feature since you are a smaller committee, but meeting online virtually gets a little messy when there's a lot of people who want to try to talk at the same time, so I would suggest using a raised hands.
I am newly the chair, so I am joining this meeting as my first one, as you know, participating in the arts and culture subcommittee.
I am the dean of students at a school on east fourth street and first avenue They're heavily involved in the arts in the community locally, with special needs.
So, a lot of performing arts, music, workers, dancers, all sorts of performers and right now in terms of the district needs, I, can bring a lot of experience of the stories that I hear from the impact that it has on people.
That, you know, are not going to go back to work until there is a vaccine, and so this budget that we're talking about next year is still going to be key for these people, because they're not going to go back to work in live performance and touring is not going to start until there is a real solution , I'm excited to be on this committee.
I went to junior high school in the upper east side right now, work for a private developer, that's mainly situated in cb1, and they do a lot of arts based community initiatives.
There were a lot of different workshops and opportunities for people to participate, and the idea was is that there needed to be more diversity in the arts, and there were very specific suggestions as how the department of cultural affairs could incorporate diversity into their programming and to their funding for diversity in the different areas of the arts in new york, city.
Since there are a lot of new committee, members, I think it's important to remember that it's sort of a odd timing to you know be writing about what the area of the east village, lower east side chinatown needs in terms of cultural and art support, but it's for the future and also to be precise.
The other thing is trying to find ways that we can incorporate into the district needs is how we can best serve the arts community in what we're proposing to go.
Maybe it would be helpful if we went through each one, each point: okay, because the original was in the face of intensifying gentrification and the growth of exclusive private cultural amenities in the district, neighborhood art, venues, libraries, community parks often provide low-cost access to cultural program, and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects as designated arts and cultural spaces.
For, let's call it like the communities that stayed in town that tend to be lower income and people of color is going to be very important, and we need to ask because the DOE has taken out the money from that and the services.
You know there are large, obviously, corporations that are affected, but if they have the capacity to be able to kind of you, know, work with some of the cultural institutions and help some local artists do and continue this arts work.
If you know, if there's some way, we can kind of like suggest a connection between like landlords and property owners to with some these cultural institutions to be able Maybe work with the local artists so that it could be the window can be at least a temporary display.
I mean the district needs from arts, and culture can be whatever the like.
However, I personally had my hand up, because I don't want us to do such kind of recommendations right now, because the artists don't need to show their work.
They need food right, now, so I think we should basically have revenue things that have a consistent way for people to make a living like revenue producing either we ask for grants or for programs that pay them et cetera, because, let's be honest, our district is hit.
Think the language here is obvious, referring to it to a different neighborhood, like even gentrification right now, If we're talking about preservation of cultural venues, you know we need to create maybe a new phrase in the beginning, in which we stress the fact that we do have a lot of small organizations that are seeing sheets of their budget, and we can use some data from the study that the center for urban future has put out and tati shared and basically say that this organization will need.
I know: we've done three residencies this year remotely so that there might be a niche right there for artists to integrate and meet a need in the community via the schools.
Currently, So: how do you think that the DCLA the mayor's office of recovery, resiliency and the new york city emergency management should support arts and cultural organizations?
Don't even think they're gonna pursue a lot of the resiliency and essential planning that we need, because they're cutting social workers from schools like we are in a different.
Since we are meeting in august, we could maybe invite some cultural organizations to come, speak and just tell us what the needs are, what they say.
