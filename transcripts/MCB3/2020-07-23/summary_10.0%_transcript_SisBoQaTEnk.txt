I do not know if you want to explain what this district needs and how we've done it in the past, we're a very small subcommittee and what are our focus and also because I mean we discussed yesterday at the land use and zoning that.
You do not have to use the raised hands feature since you are a smaller committee, but meeting online virtually gets a little messy when there's a lot of people who want to try to talk at the same time, so I would suggest using a raised hands.
I was one of the people who led the campaign for the infamous abarello that required people a permit in order to dance, and it was used to discriminate against lgbtQ&And people of color, and we were able to repeal this law after 93 years We also established an office of Nightlife, and I was asked from the City Council to serve at the Nightlife Advisory Board and I do deal a lot with all kind of arts that have to deal also with nightlife.
I, can bring a lot of experience of the stories that I hear from the impact that it has on people that you know are not going to go back to work until there is a vaccine, and so This budget that we're talking about next year is still going to be key for these people, because they're not going to go back to work in live performance and touring is not going to start until there is a real solution, I'm excited to be on this committee.
I went to junior high school in the Upper East side Right, now, work for a private developer, that's mainly situated in CB1, and they do a lot of arts based community initiatives.
There were a lot of different workshops and opportunities for people to participate, and the idea was is that there needed to be more diversity in the arts, and there were very specific suggestions as how the department of cultural affairs could incorporate diversity into their programming and to their funding for diversity in the different areas of the arts in New, York, City.
So, since there are a lot of new committee, members, I think it's important to remember that it's sort of a odd timing to you know be writing about what the area of the East village lower East side Chinatown needs in terms of cultural and art support, but it's for the future and also to be precise.
The other thing is trying to find ways that we can incorporate into the district needs is how we can best serve the arts community in what we're proposing to go.
So I mean it's that there have been suggestions that education take place outside , there's still a lot of up in the air as to exactly how schools are going to proceed and how arts programs that service children are going to deal with that, as well as the venues for artists.
We do not know when the theaters are going to open the galleries you know and how they will be affected by Covid-19 Okay, because the original was in the face of intensifying gentrification and the growth of exclusive private cultural amenities in the district, neighborhood art, venues.
Think maybe like between the first paragraph and the second paragraph We state, just some of the things that of the impacts of Covid-19 and the pandemic, that we know right that performance venues.
Still here and so concentrate money to give this kind of classes, for let's call it like the communities that stayed in town that tend to be lower income and people of color is going to be very important, and we need to ask because the DOE has taken out the money from that and the services.
So I think these are two things that we could, I think highlight, and they are pertinent because of the way, the city budget that just passed was, and instead a lot of the other issues that people are facing.
Maybe work with the local artists, so that it could be the window can be at least a temporary display until you have the space rented out, you know, or the business continues remaining to be closed or something like that.
I mean the district needs from arts, and culture can be whatever the like.
What we in the district needs is as if you're directing it to a program that you want from a city agency until their budget line.
They need food right, now, so I think we should basically have revenue things that have a consistent way for people to make a living like revenue producing either we ask for grants or for programs that pay them et cetera, because, let's be honest.
Think the language here is obvious, referring to it to a different neighborhood like even gentrification right now, If we're talking about preservation of cultural venues, you know we need to create maybe a new phrase in the beginning, in which we stress the fact that we do have a lot of small organizations that are seeing sheets of their budget.
I know: we've done three residencies this year remotely so that there might be a niche right there for artists to integrate and meet a need in the community via the schools.
I do not even think they're going to pursue a lot of the resiliency and essential planning that we need, because they're cutting social workers from schools like we are in a different.
We did this at human services, where we sort of assigned everybody with like a certain section and everybody kind of worked on that section, emailed it, and I know that we're supposed to vote it on October.
If you ask someone to work on something that does not make any more sense, you're asking them, you're sending them on a good hand, Yes, If there is like, I, do not know, I mean we can even have a premise in which we say where the city able, by 2021, to have any remarkable, come back.
I personally think the city knows it, but you know that's the purpose of this document to say like what they need.
