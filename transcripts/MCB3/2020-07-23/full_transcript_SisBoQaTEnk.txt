Anisha, it's nice to see you again and thomas so glad you could join us tate, it's great to see you too, and can we all welcome wendy and ricky, so we're so glad you could join us. I just gave you socially distressed elbow it. What I gave him the elbow? No, that's what we're supposed to do these days right! We don't hug, we don't right! Yes, we can all bump elbows hi terry nice to meet you great to see you so glad you could join us. Thank you, nice to meet you too, so, okay, so we're on page 10 and 11.. Just give me a minute to move my screen around and I will get there. Did you guys have a chance to review last year's district needs so for all the new members? I don't know if you want to explain what this district needs and how we've done it in the past, we're a very small subcommittee and what are our focus and also because I mean we discussed yesterday at the land use and zoning that, given the kobe 19 impact, we I mean we added some language. That is specific about fears of the planning sector in that case, about the impact of kobe 19, but we also gave recommendations to jim that he agreed with us about the broader statement in the beginning of the budget remarks that we'll talk about our disappointment with the things they decided to cut because they had a lot of very important. You know resources for c b, three, and so I, like you know that our district realizes, especially at HPD et cetera, I think maybe one of the best thing to do- is to start out maybe that we could all introduce ourselves okay and how we're involved with the committee. Also, what we've been asked by the community board is to use robert's rules of order, so that, if you want to speak, please raise your hand. It's in the chat function, I believe or participants which is it michael doing a participants cab just raise your hand, I mean carolyn, it's really up to you as the chair of the committee. If you want to run it a different way, you don't have to run it. You don't have to use the raised hands feature since you are a smaller committee, but meeting online virtually gets a little messy when there's a lot of people who want to try to talk at the same time, so I would suggest using a raised hands feature. That's not required right. No, I know it has been suggested several times so at any rate, so at any rate, if you'd like to raise your hand to speak, please use the participants section so that you can raise your hand and then you can be recognized to speak, because what they're trying to do is encouraging. Having one person at a time, speak. Arts and culture is a subcommittee of the economic development committee anisha. Would you like to chime in there because you're, the chair of economic development, sure I'm anisha, I'm chair of economic development? I am newly the chair, so I am joining this meeting as my first one, as you know, participating in the arts and culture subcommittee. So thank you carolyn for having me here and excited to work with you. We were really glad to have you and you have great experience in arts and culture. So that's a real asset thomas. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? Yes, I'm new to the board. As of since October I filled in the vacancy, and now I'm serving my first full term. This is the first meeting that I made for this committee. I am a part of the committee, I'm an educator in the district. I am the dean of students at a school on east fourth street and first avenue they're heavily involved in the arts in the community locally with special needs students. My son attends the star academy and he's involved with a lot of community-based organizations that service him. So I've benefited from arts programming. I do a lot of work with people at saint mark's and we've done a lot of residencies to just give a voice to students with special needs. So that's part of why I'm here so glad you're here, tate hi, everyone, I'm tati. This is my second year on the board, yay and yeah, I'm born and raised in the lower east side, and I'm also a filmmaker. I studied filmmaking at college, so yeah, so olympia hi, you muted me the moment I was muting myself, so I'm olympiakazzi I've been in the board for three years. Prior to that I was a frequent flyer. I got involved with cb3 because my background is in architecture and urban planning, and I was concerned especially with the two bridges and with the ac river park, and you know with generally the justification. However, in the last four years I have become more and more involved with cultural advocacy. I was one of the people who led the campaign for the infamous abarello that required people a permit in order to dance, and it was used to discriminate against lgbtq and people of color, and we were able to repeal this law after 93 years and they were trying for three decades to repeal it. So as a result of that, we also established an office of nightlife, and I was asked from the city council to serve at the nightlife advisory board and I do deal a lot with all kind of arts that have to deal also with nightlife. So a lot of performing arts, music workers, dancers, all sorts of performers and right now in terms of the district needs, I can bring a lot of experience of the stories that I hear from the impact that it has on people that you know are not going to go back to work until there is a vaccine, and so this budget that we're talking about next year is still going to be key for these people, because they're not going to go back to work in live performance and touring is not going to start until there is a real solution, and so I guess, phase 400., so that's great to have that input. So, let's go to tariq, it's so nice to have you aboard hi carolyn. Thank you so much. I'm excited to be on this committee hi. I was born and raised in the lower east side. I still live in the lower east side. I grew up a part of programs like rosie's, theater, kids, dancing classrooms and went to I danced at alvin ailey and went to college at university of north carolina school of the arts for dance came back and founded my own non-profit. So I run an arts non-profit for youth, bridging arts and social issues and based out of the lorry side, girls club, I used to be at louis cita center operating a saturday program there, and so now I operate the saturday program here and also we're now currently in our summer arts virtual program, but I'm also an educator I've taught across the country, and recently I was, I was also the dance faculty at martha valley, high school, which is closing this next year. So yeah that's a little bit about me, but I'm so excited to be on this committee. We're so glad you're here. Thank you dad it's real ass out! So ricky hi ricky, I'm here sorry, oh okay, great so glad you could join us thanks guys, I yeah I'm also. I was also born and raised lower east side chinatown. I live at knickerbocker village, which is down by near the fdr in the east river, worked in city government for about 14 years, nine years at the department of consumer affairs and like five years at the department of health. So I'm also on the health committee as well too, naturally very interested in this committee. I used to play musical instruments back in junior high school. It was part of the curriculum. I went to junior high school in the upper east side right now, work for a private developer, that's mainly situated in cb1, and they do a lot of arts based community initiatives. One thing that they're doing right now is something called the echo exhibit where we surveyed. We had a poet survey, a number of lower east side representatives, lower Manhattan representatives and residents, and they basically crafted poets poems from their conversations and then they're on display down at the south street seaport. So these are some of the projects that we're doing at our art space. So I just wanted to see where you know we are as a community board. Well, thanks again, I'm so glad you're here, wendy hi. I'm wendy I was born and raised here in lower eastside Manhattan as well. My background is a little different. I do currently work. I do currently work in cornell, medicine and but I did go to high school for math science and engineering and was an architecture student for about two three years and when I was younger, I did do many. I did take many art classes, I always loved art and I always loved walking through chinatown and seeing all like the different murals that were put up like everywhere, yeah that I love it walking through it's great. It's always such like a visual piece literally to go through there yeah for sure. Well, it's really great for arts and culture to have this many people on the committee and have people who are interested in promoting arts and culture in the lower east side. So I don't know if you all had a chance to review the district names that we had drafted last year and maybe if we could go through some of the the points and ask if you have suggestions about what we can add to this. So let me write. Let me move this over anisha. Do you have a question? You have your hand up sure carolyn. Could you just explain what the district needs is and like how it will be used by the community board? Okay, the district needs is a document distracted by the community board every year and each committee drafts their own district needs that highlights the needs for their particular community that they're serving when we had drafted this last year. We were in the throes of we had just wrapped up the drive from the department of cultural affairs with create NYC and a lot of our comments, and that were incorporated into the district needs came from that event, because it had been a series. I don't know. If any of you participated in that with the department of cultural affairs, there were a lot of different workshops and opportunities for people to participate, and the idea was is that there needed to be more diversity in the arts, and there were very specific suggestions as how the department of cultural affairs could incorporate diversity into their programming and to their funding for diversity in the different areas of the arts in new york city. Can we ask someone who's typing to mute themselves? I'm sorry. Could you repeat that the rain is getting really loud? It's not it's not typing! It's the rain. I believe everybody's on youtube. I believe it's the rain hitting carolyn's window or air conditioner yeah that the rain is hitting the air conditioner. It's making a lot of racket, so, okay, carolyn one thing to add, is that about district needs. Is that we're writing this for fiscal year 22, which is next July? So, since there are a lot of new committee members, I think it's important to remember that it's sort of a odd timing to you know be writing about what the area of the east village, lower east side chinatown needs in terms of cultural and art support, but it's for the future and also to be precise, anisha. I think we're talking about the budget that will be voted on. July 2021, actually correct right. We did- and it's just basically also to I think everybody's world has been to totally upside down with Covid-19 and what we're able to offer and what the city is going to be able to offer and budgets have been cut. We are very lucky that the city has funded arts and culture, but it is somewhat reduced from what it had been in the past. So I think the other thing is trying to find ways that we can incorporate into the district needs is how we can best serve the arts community in what we're proposing to go forward. So I mean it's that there have been suggestions that education take place outside, there's still a lot of up in the air as to exactly how schools are going to proceed and how arts programs that service children are going to deal with that, as well as the venues for artists, we don't know when the theaters are going to open the galleries you know and how they will be affected by Covid-19 19.. So it looks like that's going to be with us for a while. So for some reason bing is having a fit. I don't think she likes to like me. So at any rate, just a minute boo-boo enough yeah the commentary from downstairs that so at any rate, maybe it would be helpful if we went through each one each point: okay, because the original was in the face of intensifying gentrification and the growth of exclusive private cultural amenities in the district, neighborhood art venues, libraries community parks often provide low-cost access to cultural program, and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects as designated arts and cultural spaces. Cb3 has identified ways in which the city can achieve this. Okay, the department of cultural affairs should follow the recommendations of create NYC cultural plan by supporting arts organizations to expand, promote diversity and inclusion in a cultural workforce and increase language access for communications and cultural programming to reach a broader, more inclusive audience, programs that support the cultural life of low-income communities and marginalized groups. Okay, do you feel that? Would you like to comment in terms of whether or not that you feel like? We should continue in this vein, that in asia are I'm happy to so economic development already met and one of the things I think sort of like what olympia said with land use is you know, I think we are in just an extraordinary time right now, so we don't fully know what the impacts of you know. The pandemic will be on arts and culture, and we don't know if the same challenges that arts and culture had in our district from before will persist after it's likely for some of these things. Yes, because they're systemic problems, but I think maybe like between the first paragraph and the second paragraph we state just some of the things that of the impacts of Covid-19 and the pandemic, that we know right that performance venues, you know, have closed for the foreseeable future. Cultural workers have lost. You know some of the things that olympia probably knows quite a bit about, based on her advocacy and experience, work and everybody else also. You know, I think that would like sort of stating that those impacts that we know right now would be a good thing to add and we've got a couple of hands up, so olympia is one of them. So why don't we go with olympia? Okay, olympia? What I was gonna say the way I am muting myself. I mean my. My idea would be to either edit this to reflect the fact that indeed we do not expect to have you know, theaters and- and you know, venues with high capacity galleries may open and may work. Actually they are part of phase four, but because they don't really require a huge public assembly. So if somebody is willing to wait, then they have a capacity of two three viewers at the time. Maybe a gallery can reopen, but I know that all venues that require a certain public assembly and they have very small margins of game they're not going to reopen, I think, realistically, if we want to brainstorm among with fantastic people that we have here today. I would say if we are aware that this is the city budget and unfortunately we cannot do much with the city budget, because a lot of things right now people rely on extending the pandemic unemployment and the enhanced benefits that are set to expire right now. A lot of things depend from the ppp guidelines, a lot of the arts and culture venues are leaving now a campaign about changing the pvp loans, and the city cannot do much. So I think what we should be brainstorming from each one of us and our experience is what could the city actually do so a low-hanging fruit is. The city has already opened the streets for restaurants and outdoor dining, but they haven't done the same effort to open up the streets for socially distance performance and, with you know with in areas like in parts that have a history of being able to have a gate and maybe create even revenue for certain performers, etc. So that is a low-hanging fruit that they could do now. They can already start planning for next summer, because all performing venues, institutions and artists know that this is going to be here for this, for the next budget too, and also what the city can do is if the budget of the city is more affluent. I think right now you mentioned the schools. What they're doing is they cut social services and arts classes for the kids? So in our district we know that there's been a flight. There are all those who were more affluent, who have the second houses they've left. We are very few of us- are still here and so concentrate money to give this kind of classes, for let's call it like the communities that stayed in town that tend to be lower income and people of color is going to be very important, and we need to ask because the DOE has taken out the money from that and the services. So I think these are two things that we could, I think highlight, and they are pertinent because of the way the city budget that just passed was, and instead a lot of the other issues that people are facing. The city unfortunately, can do little right. Okay, thank you very much, tati hi yeah, I was gonna, suggest the same as indonesia just that we false and in olympia too, just that we emphasize you know the impact of copen19. It could be in the same paragraph in the case of inten of intensifying gentrification and the code 19 pandemic, and then I just looked up. I mean, I know we're not supposed to use the chat, but I just looked up a study, so I could drop it in the chat is Covid-19 19 impact on non-profits arts and culture in new york city from June 25th, so yeah I'll put that in the chat- and this has like that's the center for their computer yeah- that's the center for the urban future right ally, study, yeah, okay, so I know so many of the arts organizations in the neighborhood have been impacted, and it's just you know, every artist I know is like scrambling, so it's just like. I think it would be a suggestion if that, if there were more performance allowed, if there were ways that we could incorporate more street art into it or a way of allowing visual artists to also have a way to show work, but any suggestions about how that we could go about doing that. Ricky, you have ideas tariq. I can kind of cite some examples like it's again what their, what my job is kind of like doing down at southwest seaport, where there's a number of empty storefronts, so they're allowing artists to kind of display their artworks in the storefront windows. Be it the poetry that I was mentioning. They actually printed a large scale, that's in the windows or they put a projector inside. You know the empty storefront they project and they have a kind of cycling as a slideshow or something like that. So you know it one. It helps to maintain the social distance and the access, so people can just kind of walk by and see this without having to enter a space, but we're also providing support to the lower Manhattan community cultural council, which is sponsoring this particular project. So you know, as a you know, private developer, we're not just coming into a neighborhood, changing it and trying to build something there we're actually contributing to the community as well too. So there's that aspect that we can kind of like think about. If you know there are large, obviously corporations that are affected, but if they have the capacity to be able to kind of you know, work with some of the cultural institutions and help some local artists do and continue this arts work. That would just kind of be based off of what you know. I know kind of firsthand right now that we're doing so. Do you think that all right? How would we go about our are incorporating this into the district needs statement to encourage businesses- or, I would say, maybe like I would, let's say, like let's focus on, like maybe landlords or property owners, both from the commercial or residential side? If they have you know some type of capacity to be able to, you know work with some kind of cultural institution and again it doesn't have to be art. Somebody just pace university actually just approached our corporation about utilizing some of the space at the seaport, for I think they hold dance classes for some of their students and they all they know. We have again empty storefronts, this large space on the seaport. So if you know, if there's some way, we can kind of like suggest a connection between like landlords and property owners to with some these cultural institutions to be able to kind of you know if you have an empty storefront, that's not being utilized rather than having the gate down or something like that. Maybe work with the local artists so that it could be the window can be at least a temporary display until you have the space rented out, you know, or the business continues remaining to be closed or something like that again. That's just me kind of spitballing thinking off the top of my head, wow anisha. Do you think we could incorporate any of that or do it needs to be presented to economic development? I mean the district needs from arts and culture can be whatever the like the subcommittee feels it should be. I think, if it connects to business, it's totally fine to steal for it to be in this statement, I the only thing I would you know like to be cognizant of- is the difference between the district needs and michael you might have the most. Like experience with this, the district needs versus like budget priorities and how we sort of balance describing the needs of the district versus you know needing to put all of the solutions in this versus following resolutions yeah, I like that. You think I have the experience to know the difference, but but no I mean that is something that susan always reminds us of that we have to you know she she'll be the first one to know. You know when she reads something that comes out of a discipline statement and say this is an expense. This isn't a district me so, but it is caught. You know. I think that I can help yeah okay. So basically, I think anissa's point is very valid because, even though this idea may be interesting, what we in the district needs is as if you're directing it to a program that you want from a city agency until their budget line. So let's say if you think that the department of city planning or HPD should allocate money for landlords that do something like that. That's how you could phrase it. However, I personally had my hand up, because I don't want us to do such kind of recommendations right now, because the artists don't need to show their work. They need food right now, so I think we should basically have revenue things that have a consistent way for people to make a living like revenue producing either we ask for grants or for programs that pay them et cetera, because, let's be honest, our district is hit. There's gonna be much less people much less spending et cetera, so I think we need to be like we need to be thinking of. What can agencies do like? Dot can open the streets and et cetera the DCLA can give grants to event producers like we could have things like that. That's the approach of district needs. There was actually a kale brewer did a special, a special seminar last year about district needs and budget priorities right. I think one of the other things that could be mentioned is that with sla they frequently require ambient music as compared to live performers and that that's something else that could be pursued in a way that if restaurants were allowed to have live performance as compared to ambient music, that would be a way of generating an income for performers that there isn't going to be any performance for a year. Now, what or maybe just on the side, but it's I know it is illegal to perform right now, if they're performing it's illegal, okay, well, I've seen several I mean. Maybe it's a special permit. I don't know, but I know that generally within a nightlife venue, even at the restaurants they right now they don't. I we had a meeting with ariel and she was just explaining if it's happening it's illegal. Oh wow, yeah susan, confirmed that the other day is illegal in economic sort of quality of life that it's loud because it's happening outside and people are angry about it. Well, actually, the performers were inside and the restaurant customers were outside so but I've seen it both on avenue, b and avenue c and just get a little unnerving with the lightning so headed anyway, yeah. Okay, so could we go down to page 11 with the rest? Michael? Could you scroll down to page 11? Okay is where you need to be sorry, there's a lag in the scrolling, so when I do it shows up later, for you guys, oh okay, all right got where you need to be, or you need to go further down. No. This is fine that okay, so we have a phrase for that. Actually, maybe if you could bring it down because the first part of the sentence is on page 10 and the second part is on page 11., this would include funding for latinx and people of color residents, artists and cultural workers in cd3, with particularly the focus on chinatown and louis saida. So I'm assuming that we would still like to keep this phrase, that okay, all right, the city should explore. Incentives for developers to provide below market rental space for arts, businesses and nonprofits in the city and development should include below market opportunities for arts, businesses and organizations, as was done for the food business at essex, crossing financial incentives for property owners to provide lower cost rental space to arts and cultural organizations would both less than the number of vacant storefronts. That can light a block as well as benefit the arts, businesses that there's so many vacant storefronts. Right now I mean, I think the survival of the local cultural institutions depends upon rent relief and long-term. You know commercial, rent, stabilization or something because that's the major issue of every cultural organization right now and also keeping employees yeah. So many organizations are closing in small businesses, so I mean, I think the language here is obvious, referring to it to a different neighborhood like even gentrification right now, it's going to continue, but it's going to continue in a different way because there's going to be vacancies, etc. So I think, if we're talking about preservation of cultural venues, you know we need to create maybe a new phrase in the beginning, in which we stress the fact that we do have a lot of small organizations that are seeing sheets of their budget, and we can use some data from the study that the center for urban future has put out and tati shared and basically say that this organization will need. You know, for the next budget to reinstate support, make sure that you know they're giving this the I mean I to be honest. I don't know if they're gonna survive all the way to the next budget, but that's not true, but I think because we have a concentration of the hardest hit communities who are usually catered by this kind of institutions. We need to have a huge premise in the beginning and just talk about the fact that for our district, preserving these institutions and giving them as much financial support for the rent, but also for programming that they can then give back to the communities and so basically create outdoor programming etc. We could use, you know, push and put a request for the department of city parks instead of cutting everything they could really imagine. We are the garden district of new york right because we have so many community district community gardens. If the parks department had the real money, they could really have outdoor camps outdoors classes and especially for all the kids that they are living in households with first responder parents, who were very small and they get no outdoors. You know space because of the of the sheltering in place that will continue and the school will be open one day a week in our district. A lot of our the public schools in my in our district is are going to have one day in school every two weeks. So it's like it's crazy. What's gonna happen to families with kids, so I believe we need to push for the organizations to be given money for the department of city parks to accommodate them in the parks in the community gardens for duty to open safe streets to do to give grants for programming to happen. Instead of cutting the art teachers, they should employ all these poor artists that are making no pennies and employ them to do programming in the streets, because the current DOE teachers are not enough because the classes now are broken, also in smaller classes, for social distancing right and someone needs to be teaching online anyway. So it's complex, but I think I think using the last year's comments except the ones that describe the demographics. That, of course, are still very valid. I would say everything else will sound like we live in another planet if we put them in, you know: right: okay, tariq, greek, sorry, my apologies! I have an emergency I have to I have to oh, I have to leave. My grandmother was just diagnosed with stage four cancer, so I am so sorry she's on her way to the hospital. Okay, all right thanks so much and I'm so sorry about your grandmother. Okay got a couple of hands up from anisha and from thomas okay. I'm sorry, I'm trying to pull this up. So I can see okay, so anisha thomas. Let me thomas you haven't spoken yet so please go ahead: okay, something that came up with our youth services. We've addressed certain needs. There was a a big need for social workers and there's a really lack of social workers in the department of ed. So that was a need that we focused on. Will we get funded from 18 years experience in the DOE? We're not, and I think that when you in the first part of the on page 10, when they spoke about meeting psychological needs, there may be a way there was. Actually there is a need in the community for students to have some kind of a therapeutic outlet. A lot of our students are suffering through trauma, and maybe there could be a way that we can have. Artists specifically do some, maybe trauma-based kind of programming that could be done remotely and they could be compensated. So, for example, even though the schools are facing heavy budget cuts, there are principles that are still you know, funding artists to come in and do residencies. I know we've done three residencies this year remotely so that there might be a niche right there for artists to integrate and meet a need in the community via the schools. I just want to mention that. Well, it's sort of like art therapists would be very useful. Absolutely for that, but yeah. Thank you! So much anisha, hi, anisha, sorry, I'm unmuted! Now I was gonna say that I agree with olympia that again sort of at the beginning. We should just sort of say what the impacts have been, and I particularly agree that we should probably just state that art venues might not survive the next year that you know, because of Covid-19, and particularly because of you know all of the government mandates they are they've been forced to close and because they ha that has impacted their revenue and ability to. You know conduct programming, what etc, that we know that all of them are financially strapped or you know trying to navigate how the next year will look, and we anticipate that not all of them will survive going forward, and that means that we will lose some of our the cultural institutions that we have in the district and will also lose the employment for the cultural workers that live in the district or anywhere else. Frankly, and I think that we should very much explicitly state that, because you know we don't fully know, what's gonna happen, but we do know that it. You know there are cultural venues that have already said that they won't be able to survive much longer right. The other thing, that's a trend with a lot of different organizations, is trying to take their programming online and using zoom, and how could the city hell? Do you think yeah? I agree with that also sort of new ways to engage with folks and then sort of also to what you know response to what olympia said. You know all this list of other priorities. I do think like. Obviously there should be funding and you know- support for diversity and some of the other initiatives that the city has been talking about, but I think we need to make the distinction about pre-covet and post-covet right, and you probably said in the initial statement yeah I think so yeah right wendy. Do you have some comments? Wendy, nothing! Yet I'm afraid I would love to put my video back on, but my the storm knocked out my router, so I'm using my data currently, okay yeah. I know it was getting really intense there for a while that, okay. So how do you think that the DCLA the mayor's office of recovery, resiliency and the new york city emergency management should support arts and cultural organizations? Direct participation and resiliency planning is outlined in the create NYC cultural plan? How do you think that they could do that? I mean these were priorities when we had different budgets right right now. I don't even think they're gonna pursue a lot of the resiliency and essential planning that we need, because they're cutting social workers from schools like we are in a different. You know moment. I think we should just write this new paragraph now, all together preaching, maybe reactivate the chat. This way people can, I don't know, contribute sentences, or I mean otherwise is someone taking notes so that they can write in real time the sentence and share it on the on the screen? I guess that would be michael. Do you want to write on a shared screen like we can try to write this sentence and that anissa was saying and share it on real time? Or do you want us to use the chat? What will be more effective? I mean it's up to you guys. I typically I'm not the secretary of the committee. You need somebody to be able to type something up. I can try to do it yeah something would be effective if it was in chat and that way we could all access it, because it's going to be harder to do it on, I would think: wouldn't it online with other committees. What we do is the person who takes a note share their screen. This way everybody sees in real time what that person is writing and then they just they just say you know they helped by just fixing it. You know orally and then the person who types needs to just type whatever is the news and anyway anything can work. But fundamentally, I think we should just write this new sentence. Keep the description of our district and then evaluate for now put in the back burn the majority of these requests. Yeah I mean I can also give out. I mean olympia if you want to, if you want to take the lead in typing up something that everyone can want, you know contribute to. My screen is a mess, but I can access to share your screen and then you know you just have to show one thing: you're working on, not everything else right. I would also say that there's so much that we have to change in this district needs statement just to inform it. You know by the pandemic that it might also be even more productive if we sort of like split it up and then come back to our next meeting where or not met our next meeting. But we did this at human services, where we sort of assigned everybody with like a certain section and everybody kind of worked on that section emailed it, and then we I'm assuming that we'll come back with those edits just because there is so much that I feel like needs to change. It might be more productive to do it. That way. Okay, great, I think that's a good suggestion. We've done a sketch, so we've done it in parts like that in the past, as well, where everyone's taken a section and the chair has compiled it and the schedule wise. I know that we're supposed to vote it on October. So the only thing we since august we're not meeting. We need to make sure that in september we meet before economic development. This way we can submit it to economic, they can adapt it and then the full board can see it because it needs to be voted by October economic development yeah. So it needs to be voted on by economic development in september. Exactly so, we need to make sure that does this sound good, then he said to you: that's fine. We can figure out how to do that. A lot of committees are meeting in august, though just to put it out. Oh, the economic development certainly is, and you guys are as well. I just scheduled all the meetings every [Laughter] like we were begging for a meeting a few months ago. They were like no right, yeah, okay, so we're meeting in august huh, okay, blame everything. You know yeah nobody met and we couldn't meet because we couldn't figure it out and now because of that, everyone's behind with everything so we're all meeting in august, every committee is planning on meeting in august, okay, completely. That makes sense yeah and what I would suggest. Then I like todd's idea of that we each take a different section and send those emails in prior to the august meeting and then in august that we can go over the different component parts and put it together a suggestion to that too, and that I guess sometime between that and your august meeting, is to designate somebody on the committee who's willing to sort of act as a secretary yeah make sure that they can make the edits in real time in your august meeting and that the august, you know that everything be compiled in a word document that can be edited. While you guys are muting right. Okay, that sounds good. So can we roll back to the top of the district needs on page 10 and divide up the sections? So I have a suggestion about that, because this is not exactly sections right and I would say, based on our experience, if each person- and I can well- you know I'm up to here- but I can try to do that if those of you who have ideas like the social workers or something and with the understanding that we are sending this to the city for their budget, so it needs to somehow be asking the city to prioritize budget lines to specific agencies right. So if you, if you have any ideas, you can all email them to me and cece caroline, and I can be the secretary if you want next month, in which I throw in a document all the various ideas that I received and I can work, maybe if anything wants to volunteer or 30 to do the introduction paragraph, the one where we're talking about the impact and the fact that we don't know if the events are going to be there and maybe use some data from that study from the center for urban future. That was referring to yeah. I just want to be sure that everybody has input and sometimes it's easier if people take a segment and work on it and then send you that information, but the segments may be relevant. So if you ask someone to work on something that doesn't make any more sense, you're asking them you're sending them on a good hand, what is it the english sentence? Good something? What is it? You know what I mean right, I'm sorry, not exactly if you're saying that something's irrelevant and who's chase, yes, a goose chase, a wild goose chase. Is this yes, so, basically, if there is like I don't know, I mean we can even have a premise in which we say where the city able, by 2021, to have any remarkable come back. We do wanted to fund. You know our artistic resiliency or stuff, like that. That's how we kind of did it for economic development. Frankly, because the impacts are so great for small businesses and for like improv, so we had like a really big paragraph about the impacts. For you know, business worker landlord etc. Said like this is all bad. We need to fix that and then we still care about these other things that will generally support the district. But I sort of agree with that, like that paragraph about, like how I mean frankly like arts and culture is really hit by the pandemic like I would not be surprised if a significant, our cultural orgs do not survive this, and I think that sort of urgency and you know- needs to be conveyed. I personally think the city knows it, but you know that's the purpose of this document to say like what they need. What truly what the needs are. Can I make a suggestion? I mean it's not called plagiarism if we're taking our own work so like anisha, I would suggest maybe share that first paragraph with arlen- and maybe you know maybe carolyn as chair- should take on that first paragraph and then the rest of the document. You know again as she's suggesting, maybe if people feel really strongly that they want to update a certain section of this, then they should probably raise their hand and volunteer now for it. Otherwise they're going to be left out and it will get updated by somebody else or that if there are additional suggestions to add we could you know set, we could send them all to you know olympia and carolyn, since olympia has now offered to be the secretary, and we just used the next committee meeting to edit the draft of what that paragraph of the impact is and then go through that list and say yes, no, this works. This doesn't work, maybe that's the maybe that's the best way to do. It use the next meeting as sort of like a working meeting to workshop the, especially since we have so much time we can meet in august and september toddy. What are your thoughts? I'm sorry, I think that's a good idea. I think what I'm sorry, I'm looking at the district needs. I think what michael said to just if people have a specific suggestion or if it, if they don't say it now, if they email it to olympia. One thing, though, that I do think that might be helpful is if, since we are meeting in august, we could maybe invite some cultural organizations to come, speak and just tell us what the needs are, what they say. The top three needs are because it's kind of hard to really change our district needs them. If we don't know from the local organizations to directly what they I mean, we know, but it might be helpful to be informed by local organizations as well. If we invite like three different issues: okay, thomas I keep trying to unmute your thomas, you don't have to unmute people. They can do it themselves, okay, good, yes, hi. What are your thoughts? Well, I do agree with tati about the. It would be good to hear what some of the local artists are identifying and, like I said there is a really big gap in terms of especially with the youth and I even with some of the seniors, just bridging those gaps through some kind of cultural connection, so I don't know how to articulate it, but I could think about it. I'd gladly contribute something along those lines. Okay, that would be great, so ricky hi your thoughts, ricky yeah, I'm fine with the suggestions that everybody made. Okay, great all right, so at any rate, everybody will email their suggestions in to me and to olympia. I think you all got my email, so you have my email address, it's my name at icloud.com and then we'll be prepared for the august meeting. By that time, olympia will have set up a word document that can be edited. Is that a correct understanding? Olympia? Yes? So for the new members, because of the open meeting law we're not supposed to have back and forth right, so any ideas that people have you can it's? Basically you are just submitting it, I'm just putting it all together and then I alone, maybe can put them in some order and make sure it rolls and prepare a rough draft. But then we discuss only publicly at the next meeting. So that's one thing I wanted to say, and the second thing I wanted to say is about that great idea of inviting people that he said in the others and doors. I would go farther if someone wants to come. That's fantastic, but we do have all those email addresses from the addresses that we've done so sending an email to all of them. On behalf of the committee of the subcommittee and saying we know, you're hurting we're trying to do our best. If there were, you know one up to three programs or grants or whatever that the city could do for you next year. What would you like us to ask for you know something like that, because you may get more. You know you may get some people that maybe cannot come that day in august, especially because it's august, and so, but maybe they're willing to you, give them one enough time to send you back one or two lines and we do have all the email addresses scatterling right. Yes, we have the email addresses. We also have a survey of the google form survey. That's been sent to the office to be put on letterhead that we could send out, which is basically asking people to update their information. We could include, like a section, I think right now, they're all overwhelmed, but I think, if you tell it's a very simple survey, it's just a matter. I wouldn't feel it. I don't know my inbox is exploding, so I'm really not responding to a lot of emails, but I think if you tell them just about the funding- and you know that we're giving priorities to the city- I think this is so like this is so clear and one thing and it matters so then you may get more responses. If you get. If you ask people too many things these days, they feel overwhelmed so that you may get less responses right. Well, it's not an extensive survey and the other thing about it is. The other thing is that we needed it to update the information on the list that we have so at any rate that something to be pursued. So michael appreciate your suggestions and managing yes, I would like to say two other things, though. If I could, I would say you know if you are going to do an email to that email list, just be careful about how it's worded, because if you say something about what do you want to see the fund it's going to make it sound, like the city has money to give out that they're not right, and we can't do that. We don't want to raise people's expectations for something you know we want to. You know phrase it in a way that makes it. You know where we're taking suggestions for what we can advocate for and on your behalf rather than the city has funding. What do you want us to ask for? And the second thing is, if you are going to go the route of inviting organizations to come, talk to you at your next meeting, I would just highly suggest that you make sure that there's organizations from all around the district- you know east village, side, china, chinatown, right and not just geographically, but also we have very different kind of organizations so, culturally racially etc. That's why I believe, because our survey is comprehensive, like our database is comprehensive. An email to all of them and then say: if you want to come in person, please let us know, and then you see, because otherwise, if you don't invite everybody, that's really a faux pas. You know I mean if you invite only certain people and not others, but you also have to remember olympia. That district needs is listed on the agenda. You know it was listed on tonight. It was listed on august's agenda also right, yeah, that golden ticket in the chocolate bar there's not much else. We can do sure yeah and just as an aside, we were supposed to review the minutes from the previous meeting. But crystal is not here, and I don't think that we have enough people to present to vote on the minutes from february, so that's postponed until august and hope the crystal will be able to join us in august. So I think we've pretty much covered everything. Is there a motion to adjourn? So I don't understand. Why do we need christa to approve our meeting our meaning? Because she was present at that meeting- and I thought that was they don't need to be present to vote for the minutes. If they're at the next meeting, they don't they don't. It doesn't matter that she's that if she was present at the meeting in february, but not here to vote for the minutes for them, it doesn't matter yeah, okay, yeah, you can vote without her. Typically, what happens is that for meetings like, for instance, for the new members who weren't here for that february, they would typically abstain from voting because they didn't participate in that meeting for returning we're just absent today. They just you know it just it's. It doesn't matter if they don't vote either way because they're not here to vote and it's the way you take your attendance is by voting. So it's the way that you're marking her absent for this meeting. Okay and also there was no in the last minutes. No, so actually what we would. I thought that there was, but that was supposed to be presented to the economic development committee that we had right now. It's actually. I think these are minutes that we had already voted, because the economic development committee met after us or something you remember. It was like so confusing it yeah. It was confusing because kovan 19 hit and everything was canceled that so at any rate, so what I was going forward yeah, so what I would suggest is, we probably should have done the voting on the minutes at the beginning of the meeting, because then we typically have to be revoked to adjourn as well. So we can just do one weirdly combined vote now to approve the minutes from the february meeting this meeting. Okay, so is there a motion on the floor to vote, to approve the minutes and to adjourn the meeting? I move to approve the minutes and enjoy the meeting and see you online. Second, okay, all those in favor, I think todd. Oh god, that's crazy, because only nati and olympia can vote on the men and myself can vote on the minutes and the rest of the committee can only vote to adjourn yeah. Well, they can abstain from voting on the minutes. They present not voting. I think it's no present not voting is what's used when somebody has a conflict so like, for instance, if I worked for the department of transportation- and I was somehow I understand that- but at the same time too, if they vote to abstain and staying as a no well yes and no, but the voting to abstain is basically the way that we typically do the approval of a minute. So we should just because what we've been doing on virtual meetings is just doing a roll call vote, so they're verbally reported. So I'm happy to just call the names out and do the roll call vote unless olympia as the newly minted secretary, you would like to do it all right. Yeah, you can talk. No, I think I think you should do it because you are the host of the zoom and you can see everybody all right. Yes, olympia, kazi here, yes, ricky wong, yes, tatia tatiana! Yes, thomas rosa abstain, wendy lee! Yes, anisha! Are you technically a member of this committee? I'm not all right, I'm not calling you don't cry, [Laughter], all right guys! Thank you! So much michael you're welcome. Thank you everybody for now guys so look forward to seeing you in august.
