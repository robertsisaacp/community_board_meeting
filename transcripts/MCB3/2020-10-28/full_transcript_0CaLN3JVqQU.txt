Okay, yeah, who knew the webinars started practicing the first vice chair of the Community Board. I am going to be facilitating the public session and the elected session. I had a little bit of a computer failure right before the meeting, so Linda and Clint have stepped in to run the back side of the meeting again. If everybody can mute themselves, richard your mic is still live. Thank you so again we're having some technical challenges tonight, because my computer crashed, but we will make do as best we can we're going to get started with public session. As a reminder for public session, you need to fill out a form and send it to the office by noon on Monday. In order to be included in public session. We have about 12 people tonight who have done so and as a reminder, you will get two minutes during your segment and Linda will be putting the timer up for those two minutes as well, so that you have some warning the first three people so that you can queue yourselves up, we're going to start with Roderick Williams, then we're going to go to Donald, Moy and then mark Benoit. So roderick you can unmute yourself, please rodrick! Are you there rodrick all right we're going to go? Okay, help me! I'm here! I'm here all right. Can you start your comments? Please? So what? What do I push? Yeah? I'm appreciating! You have two minutes to talk about whatever you want: okay, yeah with the saturation and proliferation of bars and restaurants in this community, even before the reopening, with only outside spaces, on June, 8th, there's always been a systemic noise problem in these communities coming from these established establishment. But the movements of these business into new spaces poses real hard questions about who gets to occupy these outside spaces that are decreasing demand. So, for example, there are two bars below my apartment window, 12Th, Street, L, House, 192nd, second Nominal. It was not able to open back up because there was only outdoor spaces, outdoor public spaces for only two or three tables. It's still closed, the barn. Next to it, jukes bar 196, Sec, Second Avenue has sidewalk public spaces for seven or eight tables. Along with open down with the open down. Panty downstairs patio. We have a painful consultation around public space in the city who can be in it doing what on what terms our pro problems with difficult behavior in the public women is going to be exacerbated if we try to move these business outside in those spaces and definitely without regulations, consideration or enforcement, one can imagine conflicts with people who are outside drinking alcohol on our streets more than usual. It remains to see whether the city this community can avoid the worst case scenario where streets become Quasi privatized, preserved for paying customers graded new freedoms. Now everyone was drunk inside now. Everyone is drunk outside all right. Thank you, Mr Williams, all right, our next Speaker Donald Moy Donald hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can? Oh, yes, okay! Thank you very much. Thank you for allowing me to speak. My name is Donald Moy and I attend grace Faith, Church and City grace church. These are two small churches in the lower East side, we're in the Chinatown community. We have a mission, we call the what we call it holy connection. It's we started a free computer lab in our church that we're reaching out to the shelter population and the homeless population. We find that there's a lack of ability of many of the sheltered population to gain access to internet access that they need for such things as updating resumes, job search, applying for government to aid or just accessing email, for instance, to engage in needed communications with family members and and community services. So we've we're two small churches that we just we have volunteers at our church, to provide mostly by appointment to the shelter population, to use our laptop computers so that they can gain internet access, and we would like to encourage the business community and other houses of worship to engage in similar services, because there is such a strong need for the financially needed to gain access to in to gain internet access. At this time we heard I heard with enthusiasm the testimony of the New York City comptroller last Mr, Luke Wolf, who said the school children need access, he's and he's encouraged the business community and private organizations to reach out and help school children needy school children to gain access to gain internet access. So we would encourage the business community and other houses of worship to find a way to also provide access to needy school children, because there is such a dire public need at this time and and I'll provide my information on the on the chat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Moy, all right, Mark Benoit here good evening. My name is Mark Benoit representing the Grand Street guild. We want to thank the land, youth, zoning, public and private housing committee for their thoughtful and thorough consideration of the guild's application to the amend the site plan of the Grand Street guild block to allow for the introduction of two new 100, affordable housing projects and upgraded open space. It is a project that we care deeply about, one that will add another 480 units of affordable housing to the block and one that has been made better through the process, including through our ongoing dialogue with the residents association. We wanted to thank the committee members and the board and want them to know that we have reached out to the Resident Association president to find a time to continue the discussions to confirm the project measures set forth in the letter, Center Council member Chin, and we will look forward to this ongoing dialogue again. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you. Mr Benoit all right before we move on our next three speakers are all going to be from the lower East side: Preservation Initiative, Richard, Moses, Deborah, Y and Laura Shewell they're, going to actually, I think, going to be Linda, sharing those slides that I had sent you before we get to them. I just wanted to backtrack a little bit and mention that for next month's meeting we are changing the way that we're going to have people sign up for public speaking thanks to Ed Chan in our office, who did a lot of leg work to digitize, the public speaking form the form that's currently up. There had some challenges we understand this month, so Ed has made it actually a fillable form directly on our website and not a downloadable pdf anymore, so we'll be launching that sometime between this meeting and our next full board meeting and that's how you'll be signing up to speak for next month's meeting. So I just wanted to publicly thank ed for that hard work and that great work on getting that form online, so Richard Moses you're up Richard, which one of these two things do you want up there for the powerpoint yeah, it's a it's a powerpoint, it's actually a pdf powerpoint that should say East River park. Let me get the house and Tennis Center comfort station on the top. Yes, exactly, okay, good evening, everyone, I'm Richard, Moses President of the lower East side, Preservation initiative, also known as lesbi. We at lesbia are proposing to restore and renovate the East River Park's Track House and Tennis Center comfort station, which you can see on the slides here rather than demolish the buildings as currently planned under the east side coastal Resiliency project. Recently, the New York State Historic Preservation office determined that these buildings are eligible for the state and national registers of historic places, for both their unique architectural distinction and historic importance. Saving the track house and Tennis Center comfort stations should not be difficult. Moving and relocating large structures such as these is not unusual. They can be easily enlarged to meet the park's current needs and in light of global warming and its effect on the lower East side, keeping existing buildings and restoring them is almost always a much greener solution than demolishing them and rebuilding new tonight we're asking for full board approval of a resolution in support of saving these buildings, as passed by the Parks Committee last week, and I want to thank the committee for this. My fellow LESPI Board member Deborah Y will now describe for you the unique qualities of these buildings and our proposal for restoration and renovation, which includes brand new bathrooms and other interior facilities that meet all park, department, standards and future needs and programming. Thank you very much. Thank you, Richard. That was under your two minutes. So deborah you've got your two minutes now. Do you want the powerpoint Debra? Yes, she does okay and confusing about you guys and what you need we'll get there do not worry. I have to unmute right wait. Yes, if you wish to be heard, okay, I'm sure you do there. You go okay and you'll advance the slides, then right I'll be happy to okay. Thank you. I'm Deborah, Y a board member of Lesbi here is a closer look at the track house on the left and the tennis Center comfort station on the right. Next, these buildings have numerous unique design elements. I did a survey of 37 parks and playgrounds in CB3 and found no other building with ornamentation relating directly to the neighborhood in which a park is located here. You'll find fish, water and vegetation, a design motif based on a shipping tool and also stars that may refer to nighttime navigation. Next, here is the current tennis center comfort station at the top in the middle is the new proposal which is bigger. This is a standardized contemporary design planned for parks all over New York City. It is definitely not unique to East River park at the bottom. Is our proposed restoration and enlargement extended at each end. This provides a focus on the historic structure, but with enough room for all new bathrooms, concession stands and storage. Next, here is the track house at the top in the middle. Is the proposed contemporary design again a standardized building? The bottom shows our idea for a restored track house with extensions. The interior would be completely new to fit all park department requirements. Next here are renderings of our proposed restorations, both buildings, newly cleaned and with additions at either end when East River Park opened in 1939. There were five such distinctive buildings, but three were demolished over time. We do not want to lose these last two. Thank you. Thank you. Guys must have rehearsed. You were under two minutes also last as last as Laura, you need to unmute yourself, I'm trying thank you. We got it. I'm Laura Sewell speaking today as a member of Lesbia's board, I'm also the director of the East Village community coalition, one of several preservation organizations that signed on to the effort to preserve and renovate the track and tennis houses in East River Park. I'd just like to share some background for members who might have questions about the timeline with these buildings. During the environmental review process, the SHPO only considered the track and tennis houses as part of the overall park, not on the merits of the individual buildings. The park itself was not considered eligible because it had undergone so much alteration over the years, but the track and tennis houses remain very much intact. Just like the fire boathouse, which was given certain protections, the community only learned that the track in tennis houses would be demolished when the new preferred alternative was announced about two years ago, lesbi was surprised to find they'd, been omitted from the environmental impact statement and has spoken publicly about this. Ever since the city escort team was aware that leicester asked the SHPO to reconsider these buildings last December with lesbi, providing research and endorsements and support the ship. Oh issued a determination of eligibility in June and has been in contact with the city ever since so lesbi's proposal to preserve and renovate these buildings was heard at parks this month, where we were thrilled to win. The committee support we've requested the opportunity to present the proposal to the city team. We've all heard how complex the esker project is: moving Con, Edison lines, installing reservoirs and gates many moving parts. If the city can do all this, they can certainly make accommodations for these buildings. Lesbi would like to thank Trevor Holland and the committee for being open to hearing our proposal and the Landmarks Committee for their support. Having earned the committee support, we've now started to share the news of this effort with the public, particularly those in NYCHA housing nearest these buildings. If you have not heard from us yet, you will soon and of course, feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns you may have for those interested in learning. Even more lesbi will give an in- depth presentation at our November 10 general meeting. That's lesbi L- E-, S- P-. I dash NYC for the mailing list. Thanks all very much. Thank you. Laura all right. Moving on to our next round of speakers, we're going to have harry bubbins, followed by christine that's romero and then finally I'll be taking off my board member hat and giving a public announcement as well harry thanks. Can you hear me? Yes, great thanks a lot: I'm Harry bubbins, I'm the East village director for village preservation. Thanks for the opportunity to speak at the public session tonight, I want to share an update regarding character: Community center, the old Ps64, the landmark former school designed by architect, cbj snyder between East 9Th and East, 10Th Street off of Avenue B for those that might not be familiar with it and I'm sure that's very few. If any and the ongoing saga of what's been considered, demolition by Neglect, there's been a recent update, the city inspected, the building the Department of buildings and the fire department went after there were numerous complaints from people accessing the roof and a pit that opened on the sidewalk. This resulted in the city issuing, what's called an immediate emergency declaration, and they requested that HPD seal the building the owner was notified of this emergency declaration, and the city indicated that, instead of sealing it instead of a city agency sealing it, they would allow the owner to perform the emergency work. We are going to continue to monitor and we call for the action to continue to make it safe repair. The building and I just lost my notes when someone took over and and ultimately returned, the building to community use as the mayor had proposed, and we want to acknowledge and thank all the many people that made complaints and the neighbors and elected officials and other organizations that are involved in this matter. The other thing real, quick that came more clear last night from the you might have heard about the Soho Noho rezoning proposal, we're very concerned about that and community board three. It's definitely going to impact Community board three as it's right on the border, if not in it. The final Rev delineation of the zoning proposal has not been totally announced. Yet we've urged the city to require affordable housing in new development without these massive up zonings as other cities too, but so far, they're resisting that, and we also do not want the proposal to make allowances for more big box chain stores, which they also seem to want to do, unfortunately, so stay tuned on the Soho Noho rezoning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight. Thank you, Harry Christine, good evening. My name is Christina. That's romero and I'm talking on behalf of the lower East Side Ecology Center, and I would like to thank the Parks Committee who, in the meeting in October, worked on a resolution in support of basically guaranteeing that the ecology center has a future here in East River Park. We are, we are asking for a written guarantee from the parks Department that all programs of the ecology center return to East, River, Park, Environmental, Education stewardship and composting once Esker is complete, and also that we find a sensible solution to guarantee uninterrupted continuation of our programs, especially our composting program. The relocation of a compost yard has hit a snack because the temporary site that was identified under the Triboro bridge in East Harlem does not seem to be moving forward, and so we really do not have a place to move the compost yard to which is very disconcerting and parks. Department is really not engaging in any sort of conversations with us about the future of this program, and I also wanted to just briefly share with the community board that today I received a email from Sam Biederman, who basically pointed out that our license agreement with parks is expiring on November 4th and that we need to move out of the firewood house, the latest November 5th, into Seward Park House, and I find that just really. Incredibly, I do not even know I do not even have words for it to give an organization one week to move its headquarters and do not really see the urgency for that, since we know that esker is not starting until 2021 and we intend to stay here until construction commences in East River Park. I have sent a reply to the Parks Department and asked them again to work with us on making sure composting will continue in this neighborhood and again we want assurances from the parks Department that will have a future here in the park, and I would like to thank the community board for their support. Thank you christine. Finally, I'm taking off my hat as the first vice chair and putting on my hat as the chair of friends here, friends, of course hook park feel free to tell me Linda, because I'm speaking from the public now so this Saturday Halloween friends of Corelias Park, is hosting a outdoor, safe, hopefully safe, covered friendly, trick- or-, treating event for the kids in the neighborhood between 11 am and 1 pm. We have about 15, or so local families and community groups who are going to be spread out throughout the park with treats to give out to the kids, and we will be welcoming kids for those two hours. You can go to our website friendsofcoreleaders.org to find out all the information we split up. People in half a half an hour shifts based on their last names, so check that out. If you want to come by there's a pre- registration on the website, because we need to collect everyone's information just in case. We need to do contract tracing afterwards, but we will have all covered protocols in place, we'll be taking people's temperatures, we'll have face, masks available and rubber gloves and the whole nine yards and then the following week, pumpkin smash, which we usually partner with the lower East Side Ecology center on unfortunately, this year we could not do to cover it, but pumpkin smash is occurring at the lower East Side Ecology Center compost yard so check out lower East side Ecology's website for information on that, and that is all I have so. That now concludes our public session, so we are going to move into the elected session. Just a reminder during the elected reports, we're going to ask the representatives to keep it to two to three minutes: Max we're going to keep the timer up for that, and we also only take questions to the elected representatives from community board members. So if you're a member of the public and have a question you might be able to get it answered in the chat from the from the representative, but typically verbal questions are only allowed from Community board members. I can only see nine people on my ipad since my computer crashed and with the screen share. I can only see one so. The only elected that I saw join us is Gail Gail. You typically like to go after all the others. Do you want to keep that or would you like to go? First, I see Deborah Glick here, okay and I thought I saw Harvey yeah, I'm here too sorry you guys might have joined after I look I apologize so why do not we start with you harvey go ahead and Linda. You can take the timer off of this okay and then we could see everyone's smiling face. Thank you. Thank you, Linda and it's good to see everyone and for gail and my colleague Deborah and all the members of the Community board. I really appreciate all your time and energy that you continue to provide service to our neighborhood, so you know we're a week away from all elections. So that's a pretty exciting moment. I know people have seen the lines for early voting. It's really heart warming to see how many people are out, not just in our city. In our state, but around our country or making putting hours aside to ensure that they have their right to vote, it's really amazing, and you know that extended hours, the board of elections extended the early voting hours, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, because there were so many people who needed a vote and there was not enough time. So that's first and foremost, so that I know I want to just respond to quickly some of the concerns people had around the street noise and there are issues going on with street noise. I encourage you to reach out to your city or state representatives. We've been talking to the mayor and their task force on noise and social distancing and the things we should be doing. We're happy to we're in regular contact with them around concerns that people have around people who are doing all the responsible things this upcoming weekend. There's a bunch of events for Halloween, just be careful, there's, kids events. I know I'm doing a candy event on 7th and b. There's also going to be a transportation alternative right outside my office, and so if people have time in the afternoon, please join us on the larger she'll. Just mention two quick ones. If that's okay with folks one, oh also this weekend we're doing a free, Conbody class. If you want to come to tompkins and do a free exercise class for a half hour, 45 minutes, it's a good workout, it's a free class in Tompkins Square park. The two quick things are just one budget expected we'll be going back to Albany, post November 3rd to talk about revenue. We all know that the Sydney estates are in fiscal crisis, that we have a revenue plan to get additional revenue. We've been told that it all happened. So it's really important for you all to know how critical it is that you put pressure on your state, elected officials and your governor to ensure we have additional revenue. We've been withholding four billion dollars from non- profits across the state, and that has really resulted in layoffs in our organizations, not just in our district but everywhere across the state. So we they need their revenue and schools need the funding and the risk is really high, so the answer's got to be revenue, not cuts, and the final thing I'll just mention for people who are interested is we're going to be having some upcoming events in the neighborhood that are focusing on trying to do much more creative ideas. If people have suggestions like we're doing the exercise class this weekend, we've done local events, we're going to do some things that on the street, if people have ideas, suggestions or things that allow us to get together but do socially distance. I know it's getting closer to winter, but people feel like they need to have other options, we're open to doing things. People suggest like a movie night on Avenue, B and 7th street. We could put a big screen outside my office, we're trying to be creative at the same time, respect people social distance, but understand that people are worried that once winter comes they're going to be stuck in their homes for months to come. So again, I'm happy to answer a quick question or two, but I know there are a lot of other people on who want to speak, and so thank you all be safe, vote early and take care of yourselves harvey. Can you just give some more details about the exercise class this weekend? What time and where yeah? So it's at Tompkins Square park, 11 A.M to 1 P.M we're going to be doing half an hour classes, so people can sign up. You do not have to go sign up ahead. You can come at 11:30 or 12.. It's called Conbody. People want to look that up at Acos, Marte who's, a lower East side resident started this company a while back and he's been generous and provided free classes for people in our community. Thank you, Harvard. Are there any other questions? Yeah? Can I can I ask you a question harvey. I did not realize it's Susan. By the way, I did not realize that the state offices were also working on some of these specific noise problems. So maybe tomorrow I will contact the office, so we can loop each other in and maybe you know, break out who's doing what, but to keep each other in the loop, so we're not duplicating each other's work. That sounds great Susan happy to make sure we can continue to communicate on this and help each other to serve this community. I need help any other questions for assembling my Rep's team well and I'll, say Susan, I'm happy to help as much as I can that's our job is to help all right. Thank you, assemblymember. Thank you be well. Everyone thanks! Gail did you want to give your report before we go to Assemblymember I'll, be glad to thank you very much. I just want to say about the voting something funny, because sometimes humor is helpful. So in one location today, because the seniors are all calling me. Where do I go because I have a special line where's my line, I do not know if you're getting that harvey, but I'm getting it so one location this is you can't make this up so the department, the board of elections, to their credit, made a senior line. This was on the upper West side, as you can imagine, and the senior line was twice as long as a regular line, and so the senior line got to go and the regular line was pissed. Just so you know you never know what you try to do. What's going to be the ancillary response, so now those other people are all calling me because they did not get to go. Oh God, also on the noise issue. I want to thank you Susan, because I saw on the state site that there were a couple of SLA challenges. Shall we say in your area and you confirmed that those were good places for the SLA to visit. So I just want to say thank you because I never know so I appreciate that. Thank you so anyway, this you know 70 mulberry, I'm sure you'll talk about it more just want to. Let you know that we're trying to pay attention. I know the next virtual town hall is November 9th, I'm sure you know that and workshops, November, 10th and so on. So we're paying attention we're getting you know. Hopefully I thought the moderation was quite good. Going into different workshops was quite good because it was a wonderful way to use zoom so we'll be paying attention and working with the community board. We had a good discussion, I think, with PSA 4 with their community council. I think there have been some challenges, maybe with the community, but it seemed to me that there was a good discussion. I want to say in terms of lower East side, Ecology, Center and escrow. Obviously, there's a process, that's happening, but I'm a hundred percent with lower East side, ecology center trying to find out why parks is slow in responding to the compost, and I do not understand why you'd have to move until construction starts. So we will be very supportive of that. I did not understand that they were forcing you to move when a week to go ridiculous. I think that the borrowing mission has got a sale of their building on Avenue D and, I always say every single opportunity for affordable housing is what we're focused on so working with you. We will do that. I have so many. The play- doh bar was the first I have so many. I think I'm up to four or five, where there's a restaurant and wonderful CitiBike in this particular case. Not only is there a wonderful CitiBike but there's also a hydrant, and so I got two more complaints today with similar situations. We have not yet gotten a response from D.O.T. If there's any way, and I would love some support or input from the community board that you could. I do not know I'm making this up, but we're all trying to be thinking outside the box move some of the bicycles so that there could be outdoors so that the restaurant can survive so, like I said this is becoming a very common. You know four or five there's, probably others. I've got five complaints. Actually, just that whole issue of the outdoors, so municipal arts, society and community Board five is followed up the time Square Alliance, Tim Tompkins is saying the same thing we need like and Susan has suggested. The same public realms are public space czar. I think there are about 20:21 agencies that are now focused on the streets. You've got obviously you've got the business. You've got the all the buildings, Department Health, Department, Sanitation, Department, fire, Department SLA, and the list goes on because a homeless, every single agency almost and nobody seems to coordinate. I got a request today, which was an interesting one, just PPE, because the waiters are close to the diners when ordering is eating is taking place and restauranteurs are calling me because they want their waiters to get m95s. They literally feel that there is not like a barrier between them and the diners and they're going to get sick because they do not have a strength in terms of their mask. So every little bit is challenging even the department of finance, because there's an issue regarding how do you deal with the hotel taxes etc? So I just want to say fire Department. The list is endless we need to think of, and maybe the community board three with your vast experience could be helpful on that in terms of Covid-19. A long time ago, I started working with DEP there's a terrific woman, pam Milardo who's, a deputy commissioner and he's in charge of the 14 waste water plants in the city of New, York and Boston. The big article in today's papers in Boston they are have been for quite some time doing, testing of our waste. Just today, as a result of their very sophisticated testing, they were able six days in advance to pinpoint an outbreak that could take place. That is what we should be doing. So Pam has pushed hard and she now has a lab. She has three people she's hired. You have no idea how hard that was in the support. You know we can't hire anybody even though it could save lives, but do not get me started. Deborah knows what I'm talking about, and so now she has her staff. She has her lab they're doing about 35 tests a day. They could, in fact, do a lot more when they have this equipment, which is on order. That's the short version of a big pushing, but I just want to say: New York should be doing this anyway, so very supportive of that in terms of the schools and there's much to discuss there are lots of parents on this call. So you know more than I do, but in terms of our focus, mostly on not just the devices but also the internet, the bandwidth tech can take at the Department of Education three days. That does not work if you're trying to get your homework done, etc. So we're pushing really hard giving my background and making sure trying to make sure that we have the kind of support that we need for the kids. I think you know that the NYPD so- called reform and reinvention collaborative listening tour is coming to Manhattan on the 28th and the 29th this week, uptown and downtown. You probably have the information, we'll put it in the chat it's on the NYPD and our website. I do want to have more than Queens Queen's had 150 people on. I want a lot more manhattanites. As you know, it's the head of the Urban League New York, the head of the federation, the protestant welfare agency and the head of the Robin Hood Foundation, who are doing this tour and the idea is how do you have a better relationship between cops and community and I think the governor told the mayor. He had to come up with something and he's doing this, and there are three really good people, but we do need to have our own suggestions and then, finally, on the 23rd of November, like others, we're doing a big tenant resource, fair, we'll send you those details, that's the quick version and I really appreciate everything that community board 3 is doing, because I know how hard to work and we are going to continue talking about Soho Noho. I know what that is like we had. You know a long discussion and we're going to try to follow some of those. Some of that outline. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gail. We have a hand raised from Olympia Qazi Olympia go ahead. Thank you! So gail. This is a DOE question. So, first of all, thank you for everything that you're doing already. There are a lot of issues with the opening of the schools and we do need to address you know they just changed again the plan and now within two weeks we need to decide for the whole year. They throw that on us in the last minute. But we need to be singing also long term because they we they're they can not get right now, but they're not also planning for next spring and next fall and outdoor learning is going to be huge and we need to plan now for the spring and next fall. And so what I want you to put in your other is right. Now all our schools have been shortchanged by the Department of parks and we need you and carolina if she's already here, the Parks Department is not responding to any requests from the schools about using the community gardens as outdoor learning, even though the community gardens are willing to do that. But the greenhouse has not given them any license and the Department of Parks has an answer to the request of the principles. So we need you guys to step in and push them to give responses, and also when we ask for specific areas in the parks, they did not gave them the ones that we asked, but they gave us crazy spots like the skateboarder. So now they want to put these kids there and throw the skateboarders out so they're doing everything wrong. So we need your support because we need to be thinking about outdoor learning in the long term. Not just now. You know that it's getting cold, okay, I'm 100 with you olympia. I've already had a big fight because downtown and uptown two parks where there was money from the park, the conservancy to pay for a tent and the Parks Department said no. We won't have tenants unless they come down at night. You can't take a tent down at night. It's got chairs, it's got heating. It's got everything! You can't take it down at night, so I had such a fight because D.O.E said yes to the tent and then the Parks Department, stupid gayle did not think I have to call the Parks Department for a tent because it's a huge park- and it was in this case in a place that nobody goes so it was perfect. They were going to put a hole for the tree. Everything was perfect. I could not get the tent, so I will definitely work with you on parks. To answer your question. Thank you. The next question is from Robin Chatel hi Gail nice to see you again for everything you're doing. I just wonder if there's any follow- up with your trying to get the barricades removed from police precincts, especially precinct seven, they close the block, sometimes at three o'clock in the afternoon, because they claim that they're, a booking. You know office and it's really interfering. There's a big food giveaway. It's interfering with the food giveaway from the avengers arts center, but it's just also. You can't walk on the sidewalks, basically on pit street okay. Well to answer your question. We got quite a lot of attention to our report. As you know, and then we have been actually reporters to their question have been asking the mayor and the pc at every press conference and they get goobly or whatever and now we're sending interns. Michelle has been keeping me going on this too. We've been sending interns to every precinct and we'll double check. If we're going to do, do not tell anybody, but now you'll know another report, that'll list who has or has not precinct wise change the barricades. That's as much as I can do we're doing everything we can robin. I do not know what else to do. I mean we're trying. I think we have to keep putting it out again and again as to what's going on, so I will check on the seven on precinct. Seven thank you. Gail final questions from Eric Diaz where's that hi Gail hi Eric hi Gail. Could you say one more time that tour that's taking place? You said it in your report: yeah the police, the police tour you're, talking about uh-, huh yeah. What happens is the governor said to the mayor and to every county in the whole state? All 62 counties come up with a police community process right, you know I'm making it simple and the governor. I think the mayor was the last of the 62, but he did come up with what he's calling the New York City reform and reinvention collaborative listening tour and the mayor appointed three people that I mentioned, the head of the New York Urban League, the head of the federation of protestant welfare agencies and the head of the Robin Hood Foundation they've been at least in Queens, and maybe another borough I think Manhattan's kind of in the middle, and they literally are listening apparently for Manhattan on the 28th, that's going to be in northern Manhattan, although you can join any one of them and then Thursday, which is the ninth in southern Manhattan they're, both at seven, and we will put the the link into the chat now what gets discussed or how it's won Eric. I do not actually know, but I do want Manhattan nice to show up. Definitely thank you and then last one gail. Just a follow- up, my son wants to talk, but there were there was some funding support for some local cbo's that your office was able to put out an application for. Does there have any updates on that at all the only thing we did. Yes, we had some money. We got cut badly this year in terms of the expense money, which is what we usually give out. It's only like, we can only give like 3,500, maybe 5 5000, to groups, because we have so little and I think we've and then we did the census money and then, of course, capital which you know so, to be honest with you. If you got capital since we have so little, we did not always give out the expense, but you should get a letter very soon. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Gail. Thank you, Gail for joining us today. Thank you, assemblymember Glick, hi, it's great to be with you and I always enjoy hearing the issues that are of the moment. For all of you voting. Let me just say that you know the early voting is a is relatively new to the state, and so we've tried to expand voting, but it's a presidential year, and that is always the biggest turnout and normally in a regular election day, there's something like 5200 sites across the state. This early voting is only is just under 300 sites. So to some extent the enthusiasm met with the relatively reduced number of places, and that's why we have these enormous lines. Plus you know people are online and they're trying to socially distance. So what would be a three block line is now a seven block line so we're go. I promise that we will be revisiting this. We wanted early voting to make it easier for people to vote and we're thrilled to see so many people here and around the country, but it is almost you know you should not have to have four hours to devote to standing out online and not everybody can stand for that period of time either because they have work, they have child care or because they've got a bad knee. So we're I promise you we will go back and try to revisit it aside from the fact that it's a pandemic and we have no money, we did not get the money when we thought we had money, so we're going to have to press for more resources for our elections across the state in order to make certain that people have a good experience. It's nice to make new friends online, but this is not really the way that you're supposed to develop your network of friends and associates. You should be able to. You know, vote within. You know 20:30 minutes at most, so I pledge to you. We will revisit this, the the budget. I do not know exactly what we will wind up doing we're talking about a variety of revenue, raisers but understand there are we can't change the actual rates in the middle of the year sales tax is down on the income. Tax receipts are down, although not as much as we might have thought, because there was an extension for people who were going to file first in April to go to July, and then there are some business taxes that got pushed till October. So everything is down, but some are not as down as much as we thought they might be, but the bottom line is: we need money from the feds. There is no way that New York state can fill the holes that we have and harvey mentioned that you know the cbo's, but across the board there's a 20 withholding now in some places. Maybe it should have been 10 and somewhere else. They could have withheld a little bit more. But you know it's easy and fast and efficient to just take a meat axe and say 20 we're going to withhold. They did not characterize it as a cut because the governor kept hoping that there would be a backfill, but the house did its job and of course the the Senate was totally recalcitrant and so much more focused on filling a Supreme Court seat than actually providing unemployment. Insurance back filled for people or city and state revenue replacement, which would have helped. We wrote, I chair the higher Ed Committee and we wrote to our congressional representative, saying we needed a second round for higher ed in so many parts of the state. The colleges are the biggest employer. They are the economy in a lot of upstate communities and a lot of those smaller independent colleges are in trouble. They had to refund their tuition in students that dropped out. Some of them got tuition back, but they had to refund room and board, and various meal plan money and other fees. So it is a serious in every category. Higher Ed took a big hit and financial aid took a hit 20 withholding there as well so working, praying and urging voting so that we have a more responsive, federal administration, one way or another next week. I am, I I'm not much of a drinker, but I plan to get drunk one way or the other, and hopefully it'll be on the positive side. So, on the open dining, we have to keep that going during the emergency so that we can help our restaurant survive, but we have to have a better plan, making it permanent without any review any euler, any eis any plan for sanitation fire depart plowing the streets in the snow. All of that has to be under consideration. So I look forward to working with all of you on that now final thing, I will say about what has happened with police department, where they have decided that having accountability is an insult and they are outraged- and that is you know, there's now contention between the people who they are here to protect and yet holding them accountable when they have been inappropriate, seems to be a shock to them and as a result, they are, I would say, stand standing down and that's unacceptable. So that's why I put in a bill to require a residency requirement for any prospective officers, because they should want to live with us and not just be an outside occupying force that comes in and has no regard for the communities in which they are working. Thank you. Thank you and vote. Thank you deborah any questions for Assemblymember Glick Susan. Did you have a question see? No? Oh sorry, I saw you want to meet yourself. I thought you wanted to speak. Apologies! Sorry! No, it said host asked you to unmute, so I unmuted- oh, that's weird anyway. Okay, thank you! Assemblymember! Okay! I do not see any other elected officials on. I thought we might be joined by another one, but we're going to move forward with hearing from the reps. I do not believe anyone from the mayor's office is on Andrew if you're on. If you can raise your hand same with public advocate Jumane Williams office, if anybody's there, you can raise your hand and let us know all right, then we're going to move to Ling Sha from Congress member Nydia Velasquez's office good evening. Everyone, a one quick first, one, very quick one, quick announcement, the the Eidl Economic injury, a disaster alone. That was the application that you know that was closed. But then Congress worked the house work to reopen it. The application was reopened. It's now. The final round of deadline that the deadline to apply is coming to a close. It's the deadline is going to close next week, October 31st. So if you I mean this loan, it offers it's for. You know any small business, non- profit organization of any size that has suffered substantial economic injury as a result of Covid-19. They can apply for the eidl and just that's a you know, that's a quick announcement and the congresswoman and congresswoman Velazquez has fought to reopen the application of of this loan. I think just you know, if you know of any organization or business that might need other than my you know might want to apply for it. Please help pass out the information. It's closing. The extended deadline is closing soon next week and you know other than that. The other member is in Washington Dc this week. You know as assembly woman glick. She could not have said it better. Everything is grueling in Washington and many things depends on the results next week and we're crossing our fingers and see thanks good night. Thank you any questions for congresswoman of last guy's office. All right. Oh sorry, one more thing our office has been working to help constituents who has been having problems with mail- in ballot. We are not physically open, but we can be breached either at our website velasquez.house.gov or by calling us I'll put the phone number in the chat like. If you know anybody who has problem with mailing ballot, you know reach out to us and we're helping all right. Thank you very much. We're going to go to Luke Wolf from Comptroller Stringer's office, Luke hi, everyone, I'm Lukewool from City Comptroller Scott Stringer's office. I want to spend my two minutes today to talk about some of the issues we've seen with NYCHA and also want to thank the not just sub committee for their work on this topic this month. So this week, comptroller stringer called on mayor De, Blasio and NYCHA chair gregory Russ, to address some of the alarming conditions in NYCHA development across the city that have left residents vulnerable as winter comes for a second wave of cobit, so conditions in many NYCHA buildings fall alarmingly short of the standards set by the CDC for current covenant mitigation guidelines, which is evidenced by the unfortunate thousands of residents who have tested positive for cova during the pandemic and sadly, the number who have passed away over the past few months. So what the comptroller did is he called on the agency to expedite capital projects that address chronic issues in the New York City's public housing developments, and that includes poor ventilation, elevator addresses and some other issues that will keep that will put residents in danger, as it becomes colder during the winter months. So to outline a few of those things, one modernize the ventilation systems which are notoriously prone to breaking down and fail to provide the adequate ventilation needed to keep people safe during Covid-19 number two provide adequate, PPE and sand hand type hand. Sanitizer number three ensure reliability of elevators and NYCHA. Developments to reduce crowding number four provide an upgrade to functioning heating and boilers, which are, of course needed going into winter and, lastly, eradicate mold to alleviate future mold outbreaks, because we know that this is a particular concern during the pandemic, when a lot of health conditions can be exacerbated about by the presence of mold and the best part about this is the city actually has the money to do? This, NYCHA was awarded 3.1 billion dollars in FEMA money and they've only spent 59 of this money. They also got a 300 million dollar community development grant and only spent 78 percent of this money. So there is available funds to use for these type of NYCHA capital improvements, and the city wants to call on. Excuse me. The comptroller wants to call in the city to make those investments now to make sure that NYCHA tenants are protected going into winter. So I'll drop the full letter in the chat and happy to take any questions on that or anything else we're working on. Thank you, Luke. Are there any questions for the comptroller's office? All right, hi, all right, yes, quick question, repeat again: the Scott Comptroller's office was has a recommendation list about NYCHA yeah. I hear that right. Yes, I just dropped in the chat. These are recommendations made this week to the mayor and NYCHA chair gregory russ about spending capital money to make sure that we have all the upgrades we need going into winter to one provide buildings as they should be and also, especially in a pandemic, make sure we're keeping people safe. Okay, thank you for the clarification. I thought it was a promise of actual. Oh. No. These are things that we think they should do now, and we also outline exactly where the funding should come from to make these records to make some of these improvements. Thank you. Thank you. Another question for you from Valentina Jones Val. Yes, my question is in terms of the assessments that were done in terms of ventilation and these other things that I mean ventilation is a big thing with Covid-19. So how do people who live in certain developments or specific developments know what the assessment was for their development so that they would know what to advocate for what to look for what to follow up on in terms of their development and staying safe? I can follow up with you specifically on the assessments around developments and any developments that you want to learn more about specifically to make sure you have that information. I know that we did do well. One we've done 15 audits of NYCHA, including on ventilation systems. This is work going back a while, but at least in the NYCHA excuse me, the senior developments 39 out of the 41 have old ventilation systems. So I know that's a particular area of concern yeah, so I think that we I can provide you more data, but especially in the senior buildings right now, where 39 out of 41 of older ventilation systems. Those are should be priority with some of the upgrades. So I guess I do not know how do I follow up with you? I'll drop my email in the chat and feel free to reach out and all right I'll. Do it tomorrow, perfect? Thank you, Alicia, you had your hand up. Did you have a question or no I wanted to ask. Can you hear me? Yes, I wanted to ask you Luke if the comptroller was working at all on anything to do with this overdraft protection issues that some low- income families may be having some of the banks have been using overdraft protection and it has a few of their elders and people that are suffering from mental health issues that get social security insurance. The Ssi check, they're, getting direct deposits into banks and they're using overdraft protection, and many of them can not afford to pay the banks back this overdraft. I just wanted to know if the comptroller knew anything about that and if not, then I would be happy to have a conversation with him yeah. I do not know if we've done any work on that issue quite yet, but what you say is it's clearly very troubling and would definitely want to follow up offline to find out more and what work yeah, they're being a lot of people are being taken advantage of the overdraft protections they're being charged way more than what they're getting in social security insurance checks every month, and so the banks are like say if you're getting 700 a month and the bank is overdraft for 900. or up to a thousand dollars, and people are now spending over that amount that what they get now they're stuck in a hardship and their whole check for the following month, is going to go directly to the bank and they have nothing to live off of. Let me give you a call on that tomorrow, because I want to find out more and see sure absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Luke have a good night. Thank you! We're going to go to victor from Congress member Carolyn Maloney's office. Victor hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Oh great Congresswoman, Carolyn Maloney kicked off early voting week by strolling to the polls with downtown Manhattan. Community leaders quote as early voting begins across our state. Today we reflect on the importance of this fundamental democratic practice and recognize that, even in these uncertain times, all new yorkers can make their voices heard during this pandemic. There are a variety of options of casting ballots, in- person, early voting, absentee mail- in ballots and in- person voting on election day across the country. We have already seen millions of Americans experience the ease and safety of early voting and voting by mail. Now it's our time to show that new yorkers care about democracy and demand to have a hand in shaping it. I hope that every New yorker takes advantage of the multiple voting options available and know that their voice truly matters in this election and always said the congresswoman and the congresswoman wishes the members of the board and the community a safe and festive halloween. Thank you, Victor. Are there any questions for the congresswoman's office all right, seeing none we're going to move to assembly member Yuri Lynn, you lean News, Office, Siobhani hi. How are you good thanks? All right? I will keep it quick tonight. So the biggest thing is the assembly member's fees, fines and surcharges bill. She introduced us a little like earlier this month, but it just got numbered so it basically the bill would remove all detrimental financial penalties from the criminal legal system, including court surcharges and fees, mandatory mini minimum fees for penal law and vehicle and traffic offenses and availability of incarceration as a remedy for failure to pay a fine surcharge or fee. It does a bunch of other stuff too, but that's the main gist of it. More information is on our board report. She has also continued to do food distribution throughout the entire pandemic, with the focus of ensuring that everyone has access to nutritious and culturally sensitive meals. If you need food know, someone who needs food, please feel free to contact our office. I'll leave my email in the chat in a second and we can figure out how we can help you, as a bunch of the other electeds have already said: 70 mulberry community meetings continue with a virtual town hall on November 9th. So it's really important to continue community input in that and then, as always, we are continuing to do our PPE drop. So if you know of anyone who needs e for any events, you're doing or anything like that, we would be very happy to help out we're. Also I've revamped the weekly newsletter. So if you are not subscribed but want to be, definitely feel free to shoot me, an email like I said again, I'll put it on the sidebar and let me know you want to be a part of it. We just give updates about what's going on in the district, Covid-19 related and also other things, and I think that's it. Unless there's any questions, any questions for Shivani all right, thanks, Siobhani, Greer Mayhew from Senator Cavanaugh's office. Are you on chantal? Is I'm here for the office, hello? Everyone thank you for having us. Please excuse my background. In disarray, the Senator echoes our partner in government's sentiments. As far as voting is concerned, if you're willing and able go out and vote and exercise that right as far as housing goes, we just wanted to give an update about the emergency rental relief act. There were approximately 94,000 individuals who applied 83,000 online and 11,000 via paper applications. 51,000 individuals, as of now were denied for not meeting the criteria. The state has distributed: 19.5 million to 8400 people according to associate. There is an appeal process and we are encouraging all individuals to appeal if they do get a denial so and you can forward them to our office, I'm going to throw my information in the chat shortly. We I apologize here we go so as far as Covid-19 spikes are concerned, our office is taking every step possible to ensure that the spikes are managed contained and stopped. We too are doing PPE drops. We were able to do some distribution to effie, adapt, forsythe and six street residences, BRC senior Center, Ccba, Confucius, Plaza and Grand street settlements. So if you know of any organizations that need some PPE, please send them. My way as well as far as local issues our office is closely monitored. Monitoring the rutgers 2 project, following our public forum, hosted in September, we've been working with our partners in government and the two bridges tower: Resident Association to voice and address disturbances related to the project and will continue to do so throughout the duration of the project and then also we were able to do a tour of the new harm reduction center on 35 East Broadway Assembly member Young news staff. Was there as well. It is a wonderfully newly renovated and modern facility, and together we sat through an informational session and explanation of the service menu to promote education and encourage dialogue between the neighbors in the neighborhood. So if you need anything from us I'll throw my email in the chat and feel free to reach out to our office, thank you. Chantal chatella! You are new rappers we're just not here tonight I am you're the new rat. Okay, not it yes, awesome any questions for chantal all right, so Senator, Hoyoma's office, carolyn! Are you here or anybody else from Senator Hoylman's office? I'm here it's caroline! Oh hi Carolyn, sorry how's it going good. How are you good dog, oh she's, doing well she's fast, asleep right now, thank you for asking so I'll try to be pretty quick. I dropped the board report in our chat and I guess, like everybody else, the big theme this week is to vote. So we have a little guide in our report. Just in case you could not find something else. Susan asked me to give a quick update on where we are with the Community Board budgeting proposal for Campos Community Center. So if everybody recalls CB3 had asked for some renovations to be done to the Campos Community center we've taken a mini step forward. Nycha has submitted the preliminary application to the Senate, which is a big thing, and it basically contains everything that was in the resolution, and so that's really good. We did not have to cut anything out, so I will keep everybody posted, but that's where we are right now, a couple of other things to be aware of in the next week or so Senator Hoyleman had a bill to require seat belts in the back seats of cabs and livery cars that will go into effect, November 1st, which is this Sunday, so you just have to wear your seatbelt now everything else. I think you can look at in our board report and if I can answer any questions, just let me know all right thanks. Caroline thanks mike any questions, all right, connor from council member Chin's office, are you on with us, hi everyone, it's harmony, connor will be joining us next week. Something came up for her, but every evening everyone this is harmony, and I'm here are some updates from our office. So last week, Councilmember Chen released an official statement reiterating her call on difta to delay the senior center request for proposals. Senior centers have navigated multiple obstacles during the pandemic to continue providing vital resources to older new yorkers, and for that we urge drifta to provide transparent steps on senior center reopening in the path forward. This Friday council member Chin will also be chairing an oversight hearing on the future of senior center home delivered meals. If you're interested in testifying I'll include a link to sign up in the chat box with financial insecurity on the rise, our city must maintain the programs that provide our most vulnerable populations with relief and last week, Councilmember chin and her colleagues passed Intro 2030, which keeps the threshold to qualify for screen injury programs at 50,000.. This will allow a greater number of seniors and disabled new yorkers to qualify for rent increase exemptions and last Tuesday we partnered with Earth Matter New York to celebrate their newest community composting drop- off site at the bowling green market. While we are excited to see these community composting programs return after fighting to restore funding throughout the city, we know that there's still much more work to be done and, finally, our partnership with the community first food pantry is only growing stronger since may, we've served over 13,500 families and we're always on the lookout for more volunteers to aid us in these efforts. I'll put the sign up form in the Chat box for anyone who's interested in joining our dedicated team of volunteers, thanks harmony, any questions for council member trains office all right. Finally, we're going to go to Jeremy younger for Council member Rivera's office, thanks Michael, always happy to close it out on a high note, hopefully, and for those who do not know me and I'm sure, I'm from the councilwoman's legislative and communications director and CB5 Rep, I'm just covering for isabel who could not make it tonight. Obviously, everyone's talked a lot tonight about the election and early voting issues. Councilman Rare has been a strong advocate for pretty substantial change at BOE. I think, since the primary you know recently what we've been calling for were additional voting hours, which we heard today that the board of elections is going to move to do so, starting on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There will be expanded voting early voting hours, which is great to hear. I do not know if those are up on the website yet, but you can go to the board of elections website to check those hours. In addition, we're also calling for future elections, I think giving the lines to make sure that they have at the very least, you know Eta estimated times for how long it will take to be finishing the line so that, if you do not want to be like mayor, De Blasio today and stand in line for three and a half hours in park, slope, you can plan accordingly, the you know and then obviously there's a whole slate of things we want to tackle. I think after the election, I'm certainly happy that our state colleagues, I think, you've all shown a lot of desire to tackle the constitutional issues at the state level that are going to be needed to make the real substantive changes. We need at the board of elections. In other news. The census count ended this month, a little bit early, unfortunately, because of the Trump Administration's, pretty blatant disregard for a desire to get an accurate count. Even with that meddling in the Supreme Court's rulings, New York City did finish above its actual estimated count or estimates for what it was supposed to hit. We ended up at about 61.8 percent for self- response rates. The U.S census office had expected that we would hit about 58 so great job to everybody in CB3 which, by the way was did I think, one of the probably the best totals of any part of Councilman Rivera's area. So big shout out to you guys for all the great work everyone did on that effort and then on some local issues. I think a lot of folks are aware of the situation on 14th street between First Avenue and Avenue a there for those who may not know, there's been a group of people who are selling kind of a random miscellaneous items on the street. These are not kind of vendors in this in the sense of people selling fruit or vegetables. These are people just kind of selling, really random items. Some there have been kind of issues of violence on in the area as well, and while a lot of these people, I think, are housed in the area, some are also homeless. So it's become a big issue in our office that we're working with on councilman, pat with councilmember powers on we have been in contact with NYPD DCA, SBS DOH, every agency on the sun, and unfortunately, it's really infuriating that the mayor's office, then their agencies kind of continue to play hot potato with this, which is a really serious concerning problem safety perspective both in terms of the violence both in terms of the Covid-19 risks that are posed and then just obviously the quality of life concerns. And so you know, we've now reached out to the governor's office to see if there's something that they can do in this front. We've also reached out to the street vendor project to see if they can also work as kind of an ally in the community to hopefully create some better solutions there. You know it's certainly a situation where there needs to be a solution that needs to be a solution as quick as possible, so we're going to continue to work on animal keto and updated and then the the other issues that I wanted to just briefly touch based on. We have a tenant resource, fair, a digital tenant resource, fair, this Thursday at 6 pm we're doing that in partnership with Councilmember Dianna Ayala's office, and if you would like to attend, you can rsvp to Ivy Rosado I'll drop, her email in the chat box and speaking of ivy. For those who know her. Ivy has been a fantastic member of our staff as our director of public outreach and sadly, this Friday is going to be her last day with our office. We are all really disappointed but happy for her she's going to be taking some time off and then moving into full- time social work, helping constituents, hopefully in the East village and other parts of New York City. Whenever role she takes on so we're all really proud of her and the work she's done, and with that I can take any questions. Susan. Thank you, hi Jeremy and the then the unauthorized vendors we've gotten an incredible amount of complaints. Also and I've been working with isabel in your office on this, and she also brought it up in our district service cabinet meeting, and it seems that no agency in our community board will take responsibility for it, but my understanding is across 14th street and the 13th precinct that the police there are giving tickets for unauthorized vending. Is that true, I'm not sure I will check in with isabel to confirm. That is the case, and if that is the case, that's certainly something that is incredibly concerning. If there's not you know, equal enforcement measures being taken or just even basic communication being taken. So let me check back in with isabel and councilmember powers team and get back to you. Thank you any other questions for Jeremy all right. I do not see any other hands up. Thank you. Jeremy thanks, Michael give it your best. Of course. I know she's going to miss all of you, yeah all right that ends. The elected officials report part of our board meeting tonight, we're now going to move to the roll call and the approval of the minutes from the August 2020 meeting, and then I will be handing the reins over to our chair Alicia for the rest of the meeting. Thank you again to Linda and clint for stepping in after my epic computer meltdown earlier this evening. I really appreciate it. Michelle hi I'll, be doing the roll call.

Thank you. So much, please bear with me, as I had some dental work done, and so, if I seem a little bit sluggish tonight, bear with me okay. So I want to just thank everyone for coming out tonight for this October zoom meeting for Community Board three. I would like to start off by saying a few things not a whole lot tonight to talk about, because we have a rather long agenda tonight, but first things. First for those that worked with me on the task force for the Baruch bath house. I wanted to announce that the RFP has been released and for the members of the task force. I believe I mailed you, I emailed you a copy of the RFP today, so this is being proposed as a community sports and programming facility, and if those that do not know or are not familiar with the bath house, it sits in the back of the Baruch houses in a little cut right. As we like to say- and it was a- it was a really historical building at one point in time, and now the building is dilapidated, and so the residents of the community and the Baruch residents of NYCHA would love to see it restored to something that the children and the residents could use again, not just for them, but for all members of the community and hopefully we'll get a really great response to the RFP. I do believe the cutoff date to apply is, let's see, November 24th. The proposals are due so or no at 3 pm, and so, if you are interested in applying for this, you can get in contact with Eric Weiss at the parks Department. If you need more information about that, please email me and I'll, give you all the details to that RFP. So, as I promised you, I told last time last month, I said that I would tell you the list of the hubs that are providing adult meals in our district for adults that are not just adults, but also for children or college students, or anyone that has food deprivation or someone that may need to supplement their income by having some meals provided to you. They are our public schools are having some hubs as they call them, and a few of them are in our district. We have Ps19 at 185, first avenue Ps64 on 6Th Street and Avenue B Marta, Valley, High, School and middle school at 145, stanton and Suffolk Street P.S 188 at 442, East, Houston, Street and University middle school, which is the ops 56, is at 220 Henry Street. They provide meals from 3 to 5 P.M in the afternoon. Ps19 is closed this week due to staffing issues, but please be sure to share this with neighbors or anyone that could use a supplement and meals in their homes. Okay, okay, so everyone is saying it. I'm going to keep saying it. Voting is a must! Please everyone go out and vote. This is not for community board members because we all know the importance of voting, but actually members of the public. Please knock on a neighbor's door, just remind people. Every vote does count. We need every voice heard for this election. My people did not get the right to vote until 1965 african- american women in particular. I know we stand together in this and saying that we have to be unified as people of color, and we know that it is execution of our 15th amendment. So let's do it everybody, let's rock this vote, and last but not least tonight I want to congratulate our past Chair, Gigi Lee and her husband. They gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Gimme, Lee Lynn, and she weighed six pounds and 11 ounces, beautiful baby born on the 13th of October, and so every. If you see Gigi- or you know, gigi- and you have a relationship with her or just give her a congratulations or send her a text or email or whatever just let her and her husband know that you are thinking of them during this time of welcoming their new baby and please do not forget to fall back, I'm loving it. I'm looking forward to Sunday getting that extra hour for those that do not know, I'm reminding you now we get that extra hour back into our sleeping beds on November 1st, so change your batteries and your smoke detectors and get that extra hours worth of sleep. Okay. Now I'm going to move on to that's the end of my report. Tonight, I'm going to move on to our district manager's report. Susan Stetzer, please, okay! Thank you. Alicia, first, a reminder that city offices will be closed next Tuesday, so Community Board three will be closed. The police department is alerting people that there may be demonstrations on election day or after particularly depending on how long it takes to declare a winner. The anticipation is that they'll be peaceful, but you may have to plan for street closures and unfortunately, the businesses are asked to be on alert again for possible broken windows and stolen goods, which seems to be from a few people taking advantage when there are demonstrations. The police report, the police, Department police reform and reinvent reinvention listening session that Gail talked about. I also got the information today and, while Gail is speaking, I sent it to all the board members, so you have the information to rsvp to attend on facebook or zoom meeting. Just a few last background notes regarding the district needs statement and budget priorities that you'll be voting on tonight. We have to submit these documents on a program that city planning designed for the documents, and it connects the statement to the priorities and what's new under this administration, is that all the information is captured from all 59 boards to be able to give statistics on what the needs are and how the 59 boards rank them. I'm not sure how all this information is really used or if it is, but there are times when it's really important. Just to give an example, since Covid-19 has impacted our budget, the city totally eliminated this summer, youth employment program and the commercial lease assistance program and because of community response and community outrage, both of those programs were reinstated. So it is important to be able to advocate for programs that are vulnerable, and the goal of this is to bring more money and bring services into our community. So if the program's already well funded, you know that program won't bring additional funding or services to the community. Just an fyi target on grand street will be installing reverse vending machines outside for the recycling of cans and bottles. People probably wondering what's going on and as a few of the elected official offices have mentioned, we're getting a tremendous amount of complaints, because city services are cut due to no money and because, mostly because of outdoor noise, not every outdoor dining corridor has a noise problem. It is not necessary. It's just some areas. We particularly find that lower Avenue, B and Upper Avenue a elicit more complaints. It is almost impossible to get the city to enforce. There's many agencies that are not enforcing and you know, we've been in conversation we're not asking for fines, we're not asking for you know you know, violations. What we want the agencies to do is to tell the businesses what they can be doing and what they can't be doing and letting them know what's expected. That is not happening, and just last on voting at campos Plaza. If you vote there, I did vote there yesterday at noon and there was no line. So I just want to recommend that there's no questions, that's it! Okay! I do not see any hand. Okay, thank you. Let me look and see. Susan hold on a second, no there's no hands up. Okay, just wanted to make sure okay, I do not see any hands. Okay, great okay, now we're going to so rather than us have our district needs statement and capital expense priorities right now, we're going to move it down at towards the end of our after the report, so that everyone gets an opportunity to share their reports, and then we can work on this. The last part of this which take it should not take up that much time, but I wanna in case people did not get a chance to review it or whatever, then we'll just go over a few things. All right. With your permission, we will move on to committee reports at this time, so we're going to go past executive and into the nominating Miss Linda Jones Linda. Where are you nominating committee? All right, I'm going to share my screen in a minute here. So I what I want to do is review the process in case you're not familiar with it, and also because it has changed. Let's see, let's try that one there we go okay, so those of you are not familiar will include everything, that's normally in the election process and also those things that are different because we are meeting via Zoom Elect. First of all, the election will be held at the next full board meeting and that's November 24th about a week before that meeting, I will send out an email containing a short statement written by each candidate, so you can get a little information about their backgrounds at the full board. Meeting on November 24th each candidate will also have the opportunity to make a brief presentation. So again you can become more familiar with them. After that presentation we will vote now. If you remember time's past that people would receive a paper ballot, it would have your name on. It would be your paper ballot and you would fill it out and that's how you voted. We can't do that so, instead we're going to use a on an online form that will look similar to the paper ballot. You'll receive an email just before the meeting. With a link to that form. I think, ideally, you will wait to vote until after the candidate presentations you go click the link you'll go to the form, you'll fill it out and you will have voted once the candidates are spoken. Okay, after all, have voted. The votes will be tallied by members of the Nominating committee and I will announce the results before the end of the meeting. Are there any questions about this? Is anybody looking at? No, I do not see any hands Linda. I do not either oh okay. So that's the process. One question couple of things. Sorry, I think Susan has a question yeah. I just want to know. If anybody has any problems, is there a way for them? Will they be able to to note it in the chat room and get help from somebody? Yes, I think what we'll do is it will have a phone number where, if you are not unable to use the form for some reason, you can call that number and dictate your vote to that person. That's managing the phone be one of our committee members. I just want to point out that I've had questions people having a little nervousness about their vote, not being secret. The vote has never been secret. It's public information, so you it will be known how you voted. That's always the case and the records can be foiled by sending a simple email request to the office, and Susan tells me that this does happen. So just understand that and the last thing on the list is just the names of the Nominating committee members me Ellen Liu, Paul, Rangel, Robin, Chatel and Troy Nellis. You have a question from Paul Linda, yes, Paul, not so much a question, but do you want me to show what the form would look like to the entire board right now, just to get a sure feel for it or it's a sample form does not have anybody's names. So I'll stop my share. I will make you a co- host chair. Okay! Go for it all right! Can everyone see that yes Sir, so when I'll most likely be the one to email? This link out to everyone you'll get something in your email and it'll pop up. Something like this. So those of you, if use Google, forms before you'll, see something like this you'll see your you would have to type in the email address that you've provided to the Community Board office. I will send that I will send the link to the email that was provided to the Community Board Office and that's the one you should be responding with on your email. You will put your full name as well. Everything is required and then you'll see the votes, so you'll see Chairperson person, one two three or four, or an abstention and so forth and so forth and so forth and so forth. That's what it will look like and if you want to send a copy of your responses back to you, all you got to do is click that and it will send it back to you as well. So that way you have a copy of your responses and then I get tallies automatically generated on a separate sheet. So that's what it looks like on our end and I'll send that over to Linda during the full board meeting next month. Does anyone have any questions for me? Yeah? I got a question I'm using my phone. I do not think I know how to do it off the phone you're using your phone like an iphone or something yes, yeah you'll be able to do it on your phone. You just go to the link and you'll still see the form. I see the form now, it's kind of small but yeah all right I'll see what I'm going to do. Yeah, okay, you'll still be able to fill it out. If you, if you can fill things out on your phone, you still you'll still be able to fill it out and it will still send back to it. Okay, can I ask a question: when will you be sending this? Because I get a lot of emails? I'm sorry it will be toward around a little bit before the beginning of the full book meeting of which of the meeting itself. The meeting will be starting with the weeknd. You might see it at 6:15. a week before a few days before no like 15 minutes before same day. Oh, my goodness, okay, thank you. You're welcome yeah everyone's going to need to have their a computer or something handy for next week's meeting that they can log into their email and click the link. Okay and Linda. That's all for your report tonight. Okay, I do have my list of candidates, but you can all have a quick glance at. We did pretty well in getting a nice bunch of candidates this time. I think, and I'm not going to read everybody, but you can all see who it is you're going to receive more information about each of these people in the in about you know a couple of weeks when I send out the statements. Okay, any questions, all right, we're not seeing anything. Are we supposed to be seeing something? Oh I see, Valentina has her hand up val and nobody else does wait. A minute. No Michael asked my question. I do not see anything and I'm hearing that I'm sorry now. Do you see it? No, we just see your desktop. Oh shoot, stupid system, because I have two monitors too fancy here: try again: okay, how's that there we go and Valentina you had a question. No, that was the question. I was not saying anything okay. Well, that was a good question. Thank you all right, everybody happy so more next November Linda. I do actually have a question. I'm sorry for the people who were running unopposed. Is there a certain threshold they have to meet in order to be elected or are they just elected? I well yeah. I guess I well either you vote for them or you abstain. So I think that I do not know yeah. This is David Adams. We had a case where a person did not get half the votes and he was not elected. He was on the post. Oh okay, thank you all right. That's my understanding. Also anything like that and oh David. I bet you know the answer. Maybe that is my understanding as well, although I have not seen it occur, like David has yeah I'll double check the I just biology right. I have just one other question: are you supposed to ask for a nomination just in case someone else wants to throw their head in or this is going to be it? I will ask for nominations if there's any, if there's any vacancies at the November meeting, but I think there won't be any Vacancies David Crane do not. They have to ask to close out the nomination tonight or something yeah tonight you should. You should ask if there are further nominations and then close them. Okay, further nominations raise your hand. I do not see any hands, not either okay. Thank you, David. If I do this enough years, I'm going to get it right. I think you officially have to state that nominations are now closed. Maybe just for the record, so nominations are now closed. Thank you. Linda you're welcome. Okay, all right now we're going to move on to. If there's no other questions for Linda at this time we're going to move on, let me see any hands. I do not see any hands. Okay, that's it Linda! Thank you Linda! I love them all right, we'll now move on to economic development anisha. We did not have any resolutions in economic development this month, so there are no other updates. Okay, thank you. Anisha, okay, Parks trevor. We had two resolutions which were very well supported. You can take a look at the agenda if you want some information that was for the preservation of the East River Park Track House and Tennis Comfort Center comfort station, which you saw a brief presentation earlier during the community portion and the support for return of the Lax Ecology Center's compost yard to the east, to the New East River, Park Estr, another very long and thorough resolution. In support of that. Just to note, because I know we're going to get into district needs in the ranking and a budget priorities is that the committee has spent a lot of time on ranking these priorities, and I know we go through this every year trying to move things around but understand that we have ranked our particular priorities and just hoping that we do not get into a too long discussion about changing how we go about that and changing that. We also do that in exec. I'm saying this partially because most of them are parks or a lot of them are parked in certain areas, and the committee has already spent a substantial amount of time on that. Thank you. Thank you trevor. Okay. Next we have health and human services may hi, so there were no votes taken at this meeting, except for the district needs and the budget priorities. We also had a presentation from the alliance for post. You know the lower East side harm reduction center, which I think somebody one of the electeds at the meeting tonight mentioned there was a site visit, they're the ones at 35 east Broadway. So we had a presentation from them. You know quite they brought a lot of their staff members. You know at all different levels and everybody they all talked about. You know their organization and why it was important and we saw a slideshow and we were told maybe one day you know we'll get to go on a site visit too, but probably not anytime. Soon, that's the end of my is. Are there any questions? Let's see hold on? Let me check there's a hand raised from Olympia. Yes, should I go yeah Olympia go ahead thanks, so Maylie. I just wanted to confirm. Your committee is also the committee that covers schools right. What can you talk? Louder? I'm sorry! I do not. I can't hear you so I was saying your committee is also the committee that covers schools in D.O.E. Oh you're like getting fainter and fainter, but yeah schools. Yes, okay, so I'm taking off my headphones. Maybe this will work better. Yes, sorry, I'm going to have to put them back again because my kids are going to bed, but so my I wanted just to ask that is, I know traditionally, the community board defers to sisi and all these other things for school issues. But what is happening right now? It is historic and detrimental for the neediest kids in our community, and so I wanted to urge your community to consider doing a resolution about you know this completely inappropriate reopening quote- unquote plan. Basically, there is no plan every day we get different announcements, and so I mean I do not know if this is the right venue to mention it, but I would you know, urge your committee to consider a resolution added, maybe in your agenda the next month, because it's like more people need to speak up about what is happening right now. It is really going to you know, put a generation back of a lot of kids. Well, yeah, I'm familiar with. What's going on exactly and the cc, that is not happy with it either believe you know, as you probably know, I think yeah. I would just say it's not a single resolution either you know so we just have to we have to dive into the details, but now is not the time to do it, so we can do it later and our agenda for November is already set yeah, as is for the other committees. We can't add anything to November good, but we, you know we'll talk about that exec we can discuss after okay Olympia. Thank you may is there anything else, you'd like to say Melee, oh no, I was just I was just shaking my head, but it's no okay, all right! Thank you me SLA. We received all of the stipulations for all of the items, except for one. That item is number 13.. They gave us a stipulation that they amended to allow for having weight lines. So this is, if you look at the resolution for 13 the second, whereas clause describes what the business is proposing to be and it's proposing to be a very small pizza, restaurant and I would propose an amended resolution in this case to deny- and I drafted the resolution or redrafted the resolution to include whereas clauses and I can go through them, which will include information about what the applicant, what we were preparing to resolve, what the applicant would not agree to and why, for this particular location and the method of operation and hours of operation, we have an expectation that a business will not have weight lines. So do you want me to go through the reading of the resolution? I can do it or the amending, so it would be. The title would be to deny it in place of the last, whereas clause and the last therefore, and the therefore clause there would be a clause that says, whereas, given that this location will be continued to up, will continue to be operated as a pizzeria initially recommended the denial of this applicant in the application, unless the applicant agreed to make his conditions of its license. Stipulations that and then listing the enumerated stipulations in the therefore then clause next, whereas clause would be whereas the applicant would not agree to ensuring that there would be no wait lines outside of its business, but otherwise agreed to the other stipulations memorializing. Its proposed method of operation, then, whereas Community board three has asked applicants proposing to operate licensed businesses with this method of operation and late night hours of operation in this area, to agree that they will not have weight lines outside, given that the streets in this area are already overwhelmingly congested with people from existing licensed businesses. I'm sorry. I was just looking for my pen and and noise from those people and the vehicles that transport them and then the last paragraph would be the therefore clause which would say to deny the application and the details of the applicant, the name and the address. Okay, any questions for Alex. I guess I do. I have to move that in lieu of the this is all about Alex Denial, as opposed to approval, which it was before, and I typed it for Michelle in the event that it passes. May I yes, it's just an amendment. I would just say you know. If there's no objection, then we'll amend that, as I just explained, if there's no objection, we'll amend it as previously stated. Yes, I do not see any hands and up and obs and objections, no objections. Alex. I do not see any hands of objection. Everything is everything else is otherwise the same. Okay, so David do we vote at the end. All of this is going to be included with the amendment right. The amendment was just passed, something the motion is now amended and yeah. We will vote on the motion with the emotion, Michelle and Susan. Thank you. Okay! No hands! No hands; okay, all right, Alex! Thank you! This is enforcing line out front. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not! I'm not! Reading the chat, landmarks. Okay, so Landmarks Committee had two resolutions this month. The first of them was a certificate of appropriateness for 538,540, East 11Th street, the free public baths of the city of New York, the this is being this building is being converted into a residence and home office space for some lucky people. It's a beautiful building. They have a number of proposals to improve the steps and install gift grates and the best thing is they're going to restore the whole facade, and we did approve that resolution that certificate of appropriateness, the second one was for 217 East 5th street, which is one of the buildings that interestingly, has a rear building, which would have been a carriage house at one time. There are several along there. The rear buildings are not visible from the street. They are making changes to provide ADA access to the entire all the floors in the building and the roof, which involves the most important changes installation of an elevator. We approve that any questions- okay, land, Use Jackie- has a resolution this month can't hear you Jackie, I'm sorry. Can you hear me now? Yes, okay and it's good evening, everyone so Lenus deep, has a resolution this month on Grand Street queue. So we reviewed an approved grand street use application to build two new buildings on Broome Street with 1080, affordable units and one building is for regular, affordable and the other is for senior citizens. The developer has entered into some agreements with the Grant Street Tenants Association, and these agreements are unpacking every air, purifier and other arrangement during construction. So we put it in the reso that we want to see this agreement being legally enforceable and we also support deeper project, affordability and there's a small update on true bridges resuming application. So this month, two bridges co- applicants asked CB3 the permission to revise the rezoning plan in response to the recent ruling made by the court on the two bridges area. So basically, in the past we assumed that those towers could not be built, but now they can be built according to the new court ruling. So this is just a technical revision and will not change the position of the letter. We voted in August, so we disapprove it and the course of the course to make that changes will be covered by the co- applicants, not by CB3 and on 70 marbury street. The first round of engagement meetings has finished and the detailed information of the second round engagement will be released in the next few days. As you heard from the elected officers who spoke before me for the second round, there will be a town hall on November, 9th and a workshop on November 10, and there will also be paper surveys, and this month we also did the first Nika subcommittee meeting since February. It was a pretty well attended meeting. I think we had over on 20 participants. The nature staff came to update us on the recovery and resilience constructions and answer questions on Covid-19 responses and other management issues, so the recovery and resilience construction at Smith, House and Laguardia are all substantially complete, but a rule house and recoveries would have a major delay. I think the delay would be more than one year. We are basically looking at the end of 2022 to finish them. The committee members and general publics also brought up questions such as a service interruption during construction, lack of outreach, rodent and garbage pickup issue and the nature staff agreed to have a separate meeting with the attendees some of the attendees, who are also nature, tenants, representative and also during the meeting there was a suggestion for CB3 to create a tango type of platform for nature residents, to raise all their problems and for nature to listen and provide answers, and that's all I have I see well, I said: hey you have a question from Valentina Jackie Hi, Val Jackie. I thought I heard you say: did you say that the two bridges lawsuit went through and they can now build there? Well? This is remember. Last month there was a court ruling that the council and borrowed President's office. They filed a lawsuit against the city on the bridges and then they lost that lawsuit. So now DCP is asking the two british co- applicants to make technical changes to the to the application we submitted. So DCP is asking right. Gcp is asking for some changes, but the other two lawsuits, because there was two community groups they had lawsuits. You are correct. You are correct, made it a point to say that there was an injunction that they could not build. You are correct, so they are just asking us to make the changes right. The technical changes right now, but you are correct. The other lawsuit other lawsuits are still pending all right, so asking the community board to make changes. Okay, I see hands, I see Carlin and then Damaris go ahead. Carlin come in hello. Can everyone hear me? Yes? Can you hear me? Yes, okay, okay, Jackie mentioned the paper surveys who's that going to be sent out to select people or the community at large. I think you would be able to get the paper survey. You can also copy it yourself, so the paper survey will be sent to all the people who attended the meetings, those engagement meetings and you can share with anyone you have contact to so you would have. I have a follow- up. There were a lot of community members left that could not get into those community the first round of meetings. It was a capacity limit or something I mean I got into one there was you know it was broken into a chat room of eight people, but there were a lot of people complaining that they were locked out of these meetings. I think there was a deadline useful for that, the registration deadline, certain people were not able to register before the deadline and because of that, that's why the advisory committee and also the consultant, opened up a time home meeting. So everyone will have another chance if you missed the first round. That would be another chance for you to express your concerns or opinions on 70 marbury and the reason they had that registration is because they had to plan for language assistance and everything. Okay, Carlin. Does that answer your question? Yeah? Sorry! I guess it does. You know: okay, yeah, I'm just concerned that many people can't participate in these meetings that and they want to well that so the town hall would be November, 9 and, and there will be another russian on November 10th. So this information, detailed information, will be released on the next few days and I remember that town Hall does not have cap, so anyone who wants to attend will have a chance to attend and speak their minds. Okay, we're going to move on to Damaris. I just want to make a, I believe, a clarifying point regarding the two bridges area. So there's three lawsuits, one lawsuit was overturned in order for them to move forward. The other two lawsuits have to be overturned, so they still can't do anything as of yet and DCP is asking us for worst case scenario, but that is for the waterfront rezoning application. That is not for the lawsuit. Thank you Damaris. Thank you. Okay Jackie. He physically has his hand up. Who is that Ronnie? Oh okay, go ahead! Everybody. I just want to ask a question about Grand, Street, gills, okay, about the two buildings. They have an agreement with them, but I did not hear nothing about jobs. Did we work on anybody hiring people from the community? So during the public session we did not hear that and Gwen Street uta has reached some agreements with with the the developers. So right so did you? Did you send anyone to attend the meeting and voice that concern? No, I did not okay so, and I guess that's the reason we did not have that I mean I wish you have. You had attend that meeting. So we could include that point. Why are we saying it's too late? Now? No, you still can yeah. If you want to propose any changes, you still can, but you need to you'll be great. If you have some languages, they know the language that I have, but just my job. You got to put that just put that in some kind of way to hire people from the community. I mean that should be automatic. I think you know we should ask for that. That's why you've been chosen yeah I mean so, do you do we want to work on the language right now? I can do the motion. If you want. I can write that language if it's helpful, that would be very helpful. So Olympia I moved to adding the resolution. We recommend that the developer commits to hire people from the district or to give a priority to hiring people from the district if they apply for the job. That's available sounds good. Yeah Michelle. Were you able to capture that no olympia? Could you email me that please? Yes, oh okay, email is better. If you do not mind, I use it include something about working with the lower East side, employment network, right, yeah, okay, so I'm working on the language as we speak Linga and I we recommend that the developer commits to giving priority to any local applicants for openings of jobs and that collaborates with the lower side, employment network, Lowery side employment network, maybe coordinate rather than collaborate, okay, side, network Glory, Development, Network, L-, E-, S-, E-, n lesson or vision of banner. They have a network workforce network. Also, it's the same one rodney. So now my motion should be seconded, but I'm going to read it one more time. We recommend that the developer commits to giving priority to local applicants for job openings and to coordinate with the Lorry site employment network. That's fine! Yes, that was good in traffic. Well right. If I think we need to talk. If there's any discussion about this particular motion, I saw Damiris wanted to speak and I do not. I'm just asking. Is that language? Sorry to put you on a spot, but I know we've done this before with other particular developments. I mean we're just trying to think: are we being consistent with our language and whether it's enforceable or not? I mean it's nothing, you know is enforceable without a contract right, but that's the first thing. The second thing would be so yeah I mean it's a good point to raise. We have recommended in previous resolutions that developers work with the low implied, lower side employment network. So that's in line, I think, with previous positions. I do not. I think that you know we can say that we want to make sure that the developers hire locally, that they make. They give a priority to hiring locally, which is a little different than any applicant, because I think you know you can't just hire any applicant. It has to be qualified applicants obviously, but and then the last point I just want to make is that I believe that this is part of what the guild has asked for previously, but the developer landlord did not want to memorialize any agreement. So that was part of the argument. So, but if the board is willing to do it, I'm not going to be the person to say no, I'm going to say heck yeah, let's hire locally and use the employment network, you know and coordinate with them, so I mean just you know somebody fine- tuned the language and I think we're fine. I mean I do not really have any objections, so the marriage, I added the qualified, and I put it in the chat it now reads. We agree to hire to hire. You know to make to give priority in hiring locally and working with the Low East Side employment network. I think that's fine. I think the current language is fine. We should get this done and move forward because we still have other items on tonight's agenda and I think that would capture what Ronnie suggested so David do we need any no yeah. Are there any other motions that have to be made? I think so ask for yeah so ask if there are no objections, because if there are not, that is the vote. Okay, if there are objections, then there should be some discussion. There still might not have to be a vote because, after discussion, you might be able to ask again okay, so are there no objections, but really the only time we need to vote on an amendment is if someone really forces us to have a vote by objecting and saying I want it counted. Okay, all right, I'm, okay with it go ahead. Go ahead! Ask the question: does anyone object? Does anyone object this amendment hearing? No, let me see, I see no hands. Okay, I do not see any hands. Thank you, David, okay, that's it Jackie, no hands, and that's it right. That's all for your report right, okay, good! Thank you! Jackie transportation. We just had the rebel presentation, no resolutions, that's it! Thank you Paul! Thank you all right so now, as promised, we're going to now move into our expense priorities and also to our district needs statement. Now. Let me just say this: you know the community board is required to give input on budget priorities for our community every year. We have to do this. Each committee makes a list of the needs based on research and consultations, and then they rank it in order that it's supposed to that they like to have it within their committee. We appreciate the hard work that each committee has done and respect the ranking within each committee. If it is, if you know it is possible, you can move the items down or up, but we ask that you keep them within the committee's ranking. Okay Trevor. I said that earlier, but I want to make sure everyone understands that, so we can submit 25 expense items and 40 capital items after the committee submitted their list, the exec collated them. So at the executive meeting this week we went over them and put them in a different and kind of compress them a little bit more okay. So if everyone got an opportunity to read this right, everyone got an opportunity to read this before tonight and perhaps okay. Thank you. Linda you put that up. Michael Linda! Thank you. So much you'll see that in the front of each one, there's a letter or a number before each item and it shows its committee ranking. So you would you so we would not lose it. Okay, so, like you see hs, that is health and human services and p parks. Okay at the beginning, if you can see it there pull it down a little bit more, so they can see the other okay, so you see and then land use is l. U go on down a little more, you see, p is parkes and they all see p1. That means parks ranked that as their number one thing: okay and e economic development that they rank that item as their number one thing: p3. That's parked number three item four item like that: t's transportation, that's their ranking and that's their number one okay. So everyone is clear about that. I think that's the list right! Okay, on and on. I have a question. Can I ask a question sure: go ahead Damascus I thought we would so. I saw like 12 human services priorities. Is that correct? That is correct. That is correct, yep and parks had a few, but, like I said we can, we can submit 25 expense items and 40 capital items okay. So anyway, if you want, we can start with the district needs statement or we could start with the budget priorities. It's up to you guys, which one you want to start with. What which one would you suggest we start with? And then we can? I do not I mean, do we need to read each one? I do not think we do if you've read them already. I do not think we need to read each one. Just like the district needs statement. If you got the everyone should have a copy of the district needs statement, and you saw that Susan sent out an attachment. That is a version of the district needs and proposed clarifications. So these would just changes. I'm sorry! You got that Linda, okay and so up to you. Okay, yep Linda go ahead and show that other one, that's the attachment that Susan sent out and it's like the pages are there for arts and cultural. You see page four page five. These are things that were further clarified and then we do not have to review all 30 pages tonight. So that way we can just go over the ones. You want to look at the changes. Yes, thank you. Thank you. Linda, okay, there's one susan may be able to explain some of these better than we can so and if everyone had an opportunity to read this right, if you do not have any objections, then we could just can we clarify what we're talking about because right now, what's on the screen is that's what that's? What I'm trying to do? Linda is looking to look for the amendment, so I'm asking you guys, which would you like to go over first, the budget priorities, the expense priorities or you want to go over the district needs statement which would you like to go over first Alicia. You've got a hand up from Michelle. Okay go ahead. Michelle yeah, I just Wanna, make sure I'm working off the right version, because I got a lot of emails about this. Have the budget priorities changed since the executive meeting, because I sent back a word version of that? But I did not get one back: no, yes, yeah! So this afternoon after the exec one member asked some questions and there was a few clarifications. You should have gotten an email today that listed seven pages with track changes is that district needs and just the distribution just the district okay. So I have the email you sent at noon, but I do not have an updated budget, so the budget priorities have not changed all right. Thank you. David Adams has his hand up go ahead. David yeah! I have no problems. I just susan you're, very good at this. I'm going to ask you: did you correlate with what the city might do anyway with our budget needs and maybe, since they're doing something else that we can cover out what we need and change our priorities around? Did you usually analyze it like it's exactly I? What I think you're asking is yes, so the each committee chair as well as Jim and I attended consultations with each agency and yes, we did find out what was already funded, which was not very much and what was what needed funding. Is that what you're? Asking yeah: basically, if you knew what they were going to do, anyways they would not have to waste a high number on something which may be important but they're doing it anyway. That's exactly that was exactly what we tried to do. For instance, we found out that they are not looking at cutting any senior centers. So therefore, you will not see that on the list. Okay, thank you. I just Larissa has her hand. I see Larissa's hand. I was going to suggest that we start with the the budget priorities, since we do not have to do a lot of editing ordering okay, something easy. We can get taken care of before. Moving on to things that might require more discussion. Okay, all right, so everyone did everyone get an opportunity to read the expense priorities. I know that exec we went over it quite a bit and we kind of moved things around a little bit. So if there are no objections to this to the budget priorities, then we can move on so everyone look it over or did you look it over? Just are we just talking about the expense? Are we talking about expense and capital? No, yes, which expense and capital no at the end, no just the expenses. Okay, so just the expenses lisa okay hold on a second and whose hand is that favorite Adam David your hand. Is I lowered my hand? It's not my hand, okay, if it is I'll, take it down again and there are no hamstrings dude, it's not up there anymore. Michael his hand is not sorry it's showing up for me. For some reason. Sorry, I got that. Okay, no problem, okay, so it's just the priorities. Lisa, it's the expense part, expensive capital priorities, also, yes, capital priorities, but I believe that I think they're down the end here at the end, that's on the next set yeah. So probably we should consider the two: let's do, let's do the first one: let's do the budget priorities expense priorities. So everyone look at that. If there's no objections, then we can go ahead and move on no hands for this. No hands no hands. Okay. So now we're going to move on to the capital priorities. Thank you. Linda. Okay, you're going to get the praises any objections. Are there any objections to this? I do not see any hands herman. That was that you herman, you said something: no okay, so we have no, I'm sorry, no hands no hands yet no hands. Okay. So now we're going to move on to the district needs statement, all righty, okay, thank you. Linda go ahead and put district needs up there and put the that first sheet that Susan sent out with just the marked up the red track, changes the priorities. Yeah, that's what's here now and I moved it to the first red mark. Okay, thank you. So the first one is arts and cultural page. Four alicia you've got an order, val's hand up okay and Herman, something just what are we looking at now that has like number 13 new school for Essex crossing? What is this is the capital yeah Linda got the wrong document up. That was capital priorities, and now we move forward now we're going on if there were no objections to that we're moving on all right. So this is capital priorities that we're looking at now. No we're beyond that now. So what are we looking at Linda has on this linda? Did you put up the red marks tracks? Yes, district needs things. Mister now we're on to district needs statement. That is not what we are seeing. My question is I'm looking at number 13 new school for Essex crossing. My question is: what am I looking at? Oh now, I'm not looking at nothing. That's right! I'm going to re- share it for some reason. It did not show that I changed the document. Thank you. So I'm just saying what was that document that 13 was essex, that was, that was the fiscal year capital priorities. Okay, thank you welcome. Are you seeing district needs now we're not seeing anything Linda, not seeing it yet Linda. Now, that's the budget yeah one more time. Okay! Now there we go. That's it! Thank you, okay, so the first one is the first markup and change is on page four, the arts and cultural section page four. There was it says here: email that you sent out version of the district needs was performed. It's not selling any change, it's not showing any changes on page four and five hold on. Let's go to page four and five Linda. Can you get to page four and five? This is page right now, Linda, you need to change. You need to go into your track changes and have it show the edits? You have it's, you have it set to simple markup, you need it, you need you need it to show, go into review, go see where it says simple, markup to your right, yep change that to show all just hold, no pull down, yeah pull down the menu, all markup. That's it! Okay! Thank you! Okay, so everyone sees the red okay. Can we expand the font one bump or two, the font with the size, the document control plus or something not the font but the size of the display? It's a, I believe, it's under view. Zoom increase sliding bar on the bottom. You guys are making my live challenge. Thank you all right, Linda. If it's any consolation, I ordered a new computer. While we were in this meeting, that's going to be a little big yeah. That's cool! Actually, oh there you go. Thank you wow. Okay, that make you happy. I think the next change was on page five right. So look! Everyone looked at four now, look at page five Linda, yes ma'am! That was four okay. This is fine right there and therefore, okay. Any no objections to this was that the full ask I mean. I know that our resolution asks the mayor to. Is it just foolishness to acquire the building as he promised? This is just showing the needs for the community. Okay I'll go over there, any other. Anybody else want to say something about that yeah, please anyone any hands for this section right here. This is for arts and cultural. Okay. Let's go down to health and human services, page six! Well page five, we had a little small change. Oh page, five, there was another technical yeah. Okay, I'm sorry that one! I do not think anybody recording with that one, just a clarification. Okay, where is that at that's Wi- fi internet under the last page, five? Okay, thank you. Now we're going to go to health and Human services, page six. What okay right there cafe? What is that really? Is that a term of art it is maybe the o between the l and the b should be a, but it's a cafe cafe: Gym Laboratory in laboratorium everything all those things ought to be separately, provided that's by the way. That's not a change! That Underline is there because the program sees that as a selling mistake, but you should change it to the lab o. Instead of it should be l a b instead of l, o b. You want me to actually make this l- a- b- o. Yes, if you would l- a-, b- O, Labeau taurium, it's an industry term laboratory! It's all of these separate things should be provided separately for the children and that's not been happening. They get this one room, maybe the purposes yeah. Now this one here working families, okay, all in agreeance, with this okay. Moving on moving on page seven, I think that was it right there on page for page seven linda at the top yeah, it was your other one that one little yeah that could also, but also okay. That was it. Okay, all right page 10., oh moving right along yeah, all right. It's fast everybody! Okay, here it is. Okay providers are okay and 58 bits. Okay, we okay with this. It's just a fact: uh- huh, okay, no hands keep going Linda we're going to go now to park section page 14., another interesting, spelling there. Okay, page 14., okay, page 14, SDR park, whoa! Okay, are we good with this? I do not see any hands alicia, I think you're good. Thank you! Michael! Okay! Go to page 16 Linda. How about this? Oh slated, okay, spaciously for temporary use, so far house; okay, yes, yep! No hands! Okay, good! Keep going page, 16., okay, right here by the boathouse and adding the compost yard, compost yard I needed to continue and we got the library art and offer that's just a spelling. That's just yep spelling spell check is going crazy. I think that's it guys. I think that's it down to the very end. To the are there any objections to the corrections or fourth, and then we can vote on the whole document. All three documents. Muted yourself, do you have a question when you get to 19 page 19.? Okay, that's that that's the one preserve the viability of H dfc where's that well you see that at home, 19 page 19 hdfc's. Now this is page that is page 19.. You had oh go up, go up! Linda, I'm sorry hey! I did not see it at the top. I still do not see it at the top. It's in the past right there. It does not have a heading. It is right. There expand support it's right there. What did you need to say Herman you're frozen? I think he wants to ask for faster, Wi- fi Herman. Maybe you can put it in the chat herman. What did you please cause tell us what you want us to say here. Herman. Can someone text Herman? Well, he said something like preserving the viability of H Htft. I believe that's what he said. That is not what this paragraph concerns. Maybe he thinks it's a good place to add a section about that. You do have to hear from him unless someone else knows what worrying that he would like there, I'm so sorry Hdfc in the document you might find another mention. I just know a little bit about them. I do not know enough to correct what Herman wants to say. Herman can you get? Can you call us, let us somebody back there. He is he's still frozen Herman. Can you search for Hdfc? Please and let's see if this is the only mention of the document? Yes, somebody keep muting me. No, we did not mute you. I did not meet you Linda. Are you muting her you're hearing me now? I have to hear yourself. Yeah he's he's fro there. You are you're, not muted, Herman. Okay, Hdfcs are many different animals. They all have their restrictions. They're all different and some of them are not all co-. Ops. They are residentials. They are. You want to propose a wording herman, I think he's frozen again he's frozen again. I think what he's trying to say is that they all they're multifaceted. So they it's not just one type of thing that that they're governed by they do not just all have co- op boards yeah. I understand, but I think guys what he's trying to suggest is not just to expand support for it for a residential resiliency upgrades, but also to support financially hdfcs that are in distress because they are very different. Some of them are in distress, but maybe well, if you just want to say that you're asking that these buildings that are in distress existed, I manage a lot of those what you called stress, co-, ops and it's a hard thing to get HPD to actually work in it. I also have buildings that the city refused to help and has gone into foreclosure and manage a couple of those okay manage on the lowest side neutral, using different types of Hdfcs. I'm sorry can I jump in there and just say please search for the letters hdfc. This is not the section if you search for the letters, hftc you'll bring up the sections. No, it's on page 18., it's up a little bit. That's on page 19, it's the first one that was found unless I need to go all the way back, move up, move up. Linda I see Hdfc here, oh okay, I was looking at my version backward there. It appears four times in the document. All right wait a minute here, I'll just go up to the top. It's just difficult David. This gets overwritten on that page preserve, affordable housing and then it's all cmts all right, page 18. yeah. I think I think itself misleads everything and should be struggling from it at this point. I'm sorry screwed up. Okay, you must you must what do you want to do? You click in the document now and then you can x out of the navigation thing. I said that I would like it to be eliminated. Based on my experience does not make sense. I work with Hdfc. I even live in one, so you want wait. I live in one two minutes and I do not see why we would take that out. Yeah. I just want to make sure that we're very excited about what we're doing. Would you close the navigation bar alicia? You find me okay, thank you. I do not know well, so what are we saying here? Herman? Do you want us to take out all the Hfdc's? What's? What is it that you're suggesting we need to say Lisa, I'm trying to understand what Herman is saying and he's frozen yeah, and I thought he was saying take out this paragraph to preserve the viability of hdfc buildings because he did not agree with it and I think it's perfectly fine and I would not want to take it out- he's saying that he works with some hdfcs and this does not refer to them, but it does not say all it is. Has resulted in many hdfcs being converted to market rate, housing or being lost to foreclosure does not say all right, but those are issues that affect many hdfcs and I do not think we should change this paragraph and it and it basically- and I like what it says in the beginning- increasing the operating cost, Alicia there's a there's at least four hands raised. Okay, I'm sorry, I did not see the hands. Let me look at the hands whose hands are up. First is David Crane, okay, David go ahead, never mind, never mind. Okay, I was trying to get your attention earlier. Lisa had her hand up Lisa. Did you say what you wanted to say? I wanted to say what that's what I wanted to say: okay, Jackie and then Damaris go Ahead Jackie! Thank you. So this paragraph was disgusted at the committee meeting already and I agree with Lisa that this paragraph needs to be preserved. In fact, it does have. Some does have a lot of actual need for the hdfc buildings. However, listen to what Herman just said, Hdfc does have multiple types. Some types are co-, ops, ownership, some type of rental. So if if Herman comes back, I feel like if he wants to be more specific, we can use the word limited equity, hdfc buildings that would make it different from Hdfc rental, if that is if Herman would agree to it, but I think in general the paragraphs need to be preserved and also I actually do not see that much problem with the language. The only thing I feel like you can be more specific is just to say, limited equity hdfc, instead of just regular Hdfc. Thank you, jackie. All. The hd are limited equity. That's the in the definition right. Some of them are not ownership. When we, when we debated this item, I think co-, ops and some are rentals, but right they're, all limited. Maybe we can use the word. I mean it depends how Herman wants to phrase it, but in terms of languages I do not see this paragraph has problem Damaris. You had your hand up. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please one person at a time Damaris I was just saying: Lisa and Jackie were not done yet I'll. Just before I ask my question or pose my or make my statement. I just want to make sure they were done. Are you? Are you two done Jackie and Lisa you're on Mute Lisa? I wanted to sorry. I wanted to clarify that these issues of increasing operating cost, lack of affordable options and gentrification affected both co-, ops and Rental Hdfcs right here, lisa. Okay, if, if we agree, should we put it right there Lisa do you see where Linda has the asterisk does not actually look like the right place, many cooperatives and rental right there elisa, I think Lisa is frozen, guys lisa you're frozen it's a bad time. Maybe I did not add anything. Oh we're getting towards it. Lisa. Did you hear us? Yes, but I think what he's saying is he did not suggest an amendment. He was just responding to Jackie, so I think the language is good to go right. Yes, okay, now Damaris, please I just wanted to. I do not. I do not have a comment about this section. I had a comment about the public, Housing and section 8 section. If we could, if we're, I think it's actually below this one, I think so yeah there. It is. Excuse me, I'm sorry. So the only thing I wanted to just say ask here and is: if you know if we would, if we want to add anything about Nycha's, new preservation, trust proposal and the blueprint for change. So we talk about community participation in NYCHA next Gen and Rad, but the housing authority is already now proposing an entirely new program. Next Gen, Rad and Pla, and things like info could be a part of that, but it is a different program. So I, if we were to add something. What I would like to add is when we, since we're talking about community participation, that we're here, I think the S last sentence. There must be increased community engagement and transparency from NYCHA. Regarding these new programs, I just think we need to make a reference somewhere in this paragraph that it's not just next Gen or pact, which is rad, but that if the blueprint for change proposal and the NYCHA, I'm sorry I'm losing my words right now, I'm so tired the blueprint for change and Nycha's Preservation trust initiative. In those two processes there must be community increased community engagement. That is a big issue right now. So a lot of resident associations and residents across the city are very concerned that this new initiative that is being proposed by the housing authority is happening during a time when many residents can't participate, because not ever all public housing residents have access to the internet or devices that get them onto the internet. So this is a major issue and people are writing letters, so I just think we should be in line in line with that as well. How about right at the end of both programs? Here we say as well as and mention those other programs that you that you spoke of, I think that's fine. I just think it needs to be mentioned so give me your cards here as well. As you can see, the questions have been discussed. Well, it's not just for this for Cd3, it's like city. Why? But I guess, if you feel like you, can put it there. Let's see we're talking about Cd3, so I know I know, but it's not it's not see. No. I do not think it does go in that section, because here it talks about several developments in Cd3. This is an overall program, so maybe it goes to Nitro 2.0 programs, including nation, next Gen infill, permanent affordability, as well as wait. The way to get the pack, the local iteration of federal rental assistance, all right program as well as Nycha's blue, as well as the blueprint for change and the preservation, trust and I'll get. I can probably get oh yeah. I think that's where I would put it. That's it stick with me here, so you make sure I get it right blueprint for change and do the blueprints per change, this proposal to create a preservation trust. Yes, I think that's fine. It's yeah our new models for public housing. I introduced the private sector into nature properties, that's where it does not. Well it can it can that. So maybe that would be the next change, our new models for public housing that may introduce the private sector into NYCHA properties, and I think, if you add that that'd be fine got it. I guess we should ask you. Anyone has a problem with this change. Anyone has a problem with this change. Let's see, hands any hands, no hands no hands. Okay, all right anymore. I think it are there any other suggestions, everyone look it over. Look it over no more check changes in here right. Okay, if there are no more changes, then we will vote yeah. That's where we're at now all right, ready. That looks good. Okay, Eric! You said something. No! I was asking: if we're ready, yeah, I'm ready. Is everyone ready? I think we're ready?
