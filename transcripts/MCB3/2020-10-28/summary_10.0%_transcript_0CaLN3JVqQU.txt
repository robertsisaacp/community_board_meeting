The, building and I just lost my notes when someone took over and and ultimately returned, the building to community use, as the mayor had proposed, and we want to acknowledge and thank all the many people that made complaints and the neighbors and elected officials and other organizations that are involved in this matter.
Other thing: real, quick that came more clear last night from the you might have heard about the Soho Noho rezoning proposal It's, definitely going to impact Community board three as it's right on the border, if not in it.
And I'm, talking on behalf of the lower East Side Ecology Center, and I would like to thank the Parks Committee who, in the meeting in October, worked on a resolution in support of basically guaranteeing that the ecology center has a future here in East River Park.
Department is really not engaging in any sort of conversations with us about the future of this program, and I also wanted to just briefly share with the community board that today, I received a email from Sam Biederman, who basically pointed out that our license agreement with parks is expiring on November 4th and that we need to move out of the firewood house.
I have sent a reply to the Parks Department and asked them again to work with us on making sure composting will continue in this neighborhood and again we want assurances from the parks Department that will have a future here in the park, and I would like to thank the community board for their support.
It's really amazing, and you know that extended hours, the board of elections extended the early voting, hours, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, because there were so many people who needed a vote and there was not enough time.
There's also going to be a transportation alternative right outside my office, and so if people have time in the afternoon, please join us on the larger Oh also, this weekend we're doing a free, Conbody, class.
So The answer's got to be revenue, not cuts, and the final thing I'll just mention for people who are interested is we're going to be having some upcoming events in the neighborhood that are focusing on trying to do much more creative ideas.
I know it's getting closer to winter, but people feel like they need to have other options, we're open to doing.
We could put a big screen outside my office, we're trying to be creative at the same time, respect people, social distance, but understand that people are worried that once winter comes they're going to be stuck in their homes for months to come.
So, again, I'm happy to answer a quick question or two, but I know there are a lot of other people on who want to speak, and so thank you all be safe, vote early and take care of yourselves harvey.
So, it's at Tompkins, Square, park, 11, A.M to A lower East side resident started this company a while back By. The way, I did not realize that the state offices were also working on some of these specific noise problems.
I think that the borrowing mission has got a sale of their building on Avenue, D, and, I always say every single opportunity for affordable housing is what we're focused on so working with you.

And I really appreciate everything that community board 3 is doing, because I know how hard to work We are going to continue talking about Soho Noho.
Let me just say that you know the early voting is a is relatively new to the state, So we've tried to expand voting, but it's a presidential year, and that is always the biggest turnout and normally in a regular election.
Now final thing, I will say about what has happened with police department, where they have decided that having accountability is an insult and they are outraged- That is you know, there's now contention between the people who they are here to protect and yet holding them accountable when they have been inappropriate, That's why I put in a bill to require a residency requirement for any prospective officers, because they should want to live with us and not just be an outside occupying force that comes in and has no regard for the communities in which they are working.
If anybody's there, you can raise your hand and let us know all right, then we're going to move to Ling Sha from Congress member Nydia Velasquez's office, good evening.
So, this week, comptroller stringer, called on mayor De, Blasio and NYCHA chair gregory Russ, to address some of the alarming conditions in NYCHA development across the city that have left residents vulnerable as winter comes for a second wave of cobit, so conditions in many NYCHA buildings fall alarmingly short of the standards set by the CDC for current covenant mitigation guidelines, which is evidenced by the unfortunate thousands of residents who have tested positive for cova during the pandemic and sadly, the number who have passed away over the past few months.
He called on the agency to expedite capital projects that address chronic issues in the New York City's, public housing, developments, and that includes poor ventilation, elevator addresses and some other issues that will keep that will put residents in danger, as it becomes colder during the winter months.
Are recommendations made this week to the mayor and NYCHA chair gregory russ about spending capital money to make sure that we have all the upgrades we need going into winter to one provide buildings as they should be and also, especially in a pandemic, make sure we're keeping people safe.
I hope that every New yorker takes advantage of the multiple voting options available and know that their voice truly matters in this election and always said the congresswoman and the congresswoman wishes the members of the board and the community a safe and festive halloween.
I'll leave my email in the chat in a second and we can figure out how we can help you, as a bunch of the other electeds have already said: 70 mulberry community meetings continue with a virtual town hall on November 9th.

I think, since the primary you know recently, what we've been calling for were additional voting hours, which we heard today that the board of elections is going to move to do so, starting on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
If you do not want to be like mayor, De Blasio today and stand in line for three and a half hours in park, slope, you can plan accordingly, the you know , I think after the election, I'm certainly happy that our state colleagues, I think, you've all shown a lot of desire to tackle the constitutional issues at the state level that are going to be needed to make the real substantive, changes.
She's, going to be taking some time off and then moving into full-time, social work, helping constituents, hopefully in the East village and other parts of New York City.
Also and I've been working with isabel in your office on this, and she also brought it up in our district service cabinet meeting, and it seems that no agency in our community board will take responsibility for it.
Please bear with me, as I had some dental work, done, and So I want to just thank everyone for coming out tonight for this October zoom meeting for Community Board three.
This is not for community board members, because we all know the importance of voting, but actually members of the public.
Alicia, first, a reminder that city offices will be closed next Tuesday, so Community Board.
A few last background notes regarding the district needs statement and budget priorities that you'll be voting on.
We have to submit these documents on a program that city planning designed for the documents, and it connects the statement to the priorities and what's new under this administration, is that all the information is captured from all 59 boards to be able to give statistics on what the needs are and how the 59 boards rank them.
People, probably wondering what's going on and as a few of the elected official offices have mentioned, we're getting a tremendous amount of complaints, because city services are cut due to no money and because, mostly because of outdoor noise.
I just want to point out that I've had questions, people having a little nervousness about their vote, not being secret.
I think, and I'm not going to read everybody, but you can all see who it is you're going to receive more information about each of these people in the in about : Thank, you all right, everybody happy so more next November Well, either you vote for them or you abstain.
You can take a look at the agenda if you want some information that was for the preservation of the East River Park Track House and Tennis Comfort Center comfort, station, which you saw a brief presentation earlier during the community portion and the support for return of the Lax Ecology Center's compost yard to the east, to the New East River, Park Estr, another very long and thorough resolution.
Just to note, because I know we're going to get into district needs in the ranking, and a budget priorities is that the committee has spent a lot of time on ranking these priorities, and I'm saying this partially, because most of them are parks or a lot of them are parked in certain areas, and the committee has already spent a substantial amount of time on that.
We have health and human services may hi, so there were no votes taken at this meeting, except for the district needs and the budget.
Yes, sorry, I'm, going to have to put them back again because my kids are going to bed, but so my I wanted just to ask that The community board defers to sisi and all these other things for school issues.
First of them was a certificate of appropriateness for 538,540, East, 11Th street, the free public baths of the city of New York, the this is being this building is being converted into a residence and home office space for some lucky people.
They have a number of proposals to improve the steps and install gift grates and the best thing is they're going to restore the whole facade, and we did approve that resolution that certificate of appropriateness, the second one was for 217 East 5th street, which is one of the buildings that interestingly, has a rear building, which would have been a carriage house at one.
I. Think that you know we can say that we want to make sure that the developers hire locally, that they make.
You know to make to give priority in hiring locally and working with the Low East Side employment.
Linda is looking to look for the amendment, so I'm asking you guys, which would you like to go over first, the budget, priorities, The expense priorities, or you want to go over the district Needs statement, which would you like to go over first Alicia.
If you just want to say that you're asking that these buildings that are in distress, existed, I manage a lot of those what you called stress, co, And, it's a hard thing to get HPD to actually work in it.
I wanted to clarify that these issues of increasing operating, cost, lack of affordable options and gentrification affected both co, ops and Rental Hdfcs The asterisk does not actually look like the right place, many cooperatives and rental right there, elisa, I think Lisa is frozen So. The only thing I wanted to just say ask here and is: If you know, if we would, if we want to add anything about Nycha's, new preservation, trust proposal and the blueprint for change.
These new programs, I just think we need to make a reference somewhere in this paragraph that it's not just next Gen or pact, which is rad, but that if the blueprint for change proposal and the NYCHA, I'm sorry I'm losing my words right now.
