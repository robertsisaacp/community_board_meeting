That is something that ever if everyone wants to keep that open in the right hand, side we can kind of see messages that they, you know as we go through the meeting as well The first thing up on the first item on the agenda tonight is a resolution for immediate support for New York City, small businesses impacted by the corona virus and so you've gotten an email from the office My correct did everyone read the email from Susan with the resolution?
, the resolution If there's any members of the public that have not well, you haven't gotten a chance to read: This only went out to the executive officers of the community board, so I will read it and you can read along as well so, whereas New York City is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of CoV I D - 19, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, whereas required aid and support programs for countless small merchants and their employees will be substantial, whereas all levels of government must work collaboratively to provide needed.
Community board 3 recommends the following: actions:: to provide immediate relief for all restaurants, hotels and small levels, commercial establishments, suspension of all fines and associated payments for a period of six months, automatic non free renewal of all city and state operating permits and business field filings for a period of six month.
The language reads that therefore the first therefore be it resolved community or three recommends the following: actions:: to provide relief for all restaurants, hotels and old commercial establishment affected by the cove in nineteen biros may I'm, suggesting to change all commercial establishment to small businesses, so take that out, altogether?
We are in a state of emergency The governor is doing all these executive orders and we are not going through previous rules and regulations, and I would also want to say that we should say that we should ask them to modify I In the resolution Can, we just put all small commercial businesses affected by the Copa 19 crisis and, just like Mae said, we don't have to actually describe What's a small business?.
The first therefore recommends the following actions:: to provide immediate relief for all, and you were saying commercial businesses , so get it rid of restaurants, hotels, yada, just say for all small commercial businesses affected by the covert 19 crisis, because I mean it could be a right, I'm, not sure if there are small businesses that aren't commercial and that might be a little redundant, even though you muted people, if there's passive noise, your microphone state, it looks like whoever has iPhone has a lot of background noise and your mic stays open.
Probably we see if I have a little longer discussion about how we're going to handle a lot of things if the situation is transferred drastically that we don't want to have committee meeting The floor is open for discussion.
Any opposed Everyone motion carried all right, so more chairs report I want to encourage all of you to check in on each other and on your neighbors, and there might be some people that are alone at this time and they need all of our support.
If you could just do your part as far as being a good neighbor and member of the community and looking out for one another, I encourage everyone in the public If you're watching this to please make sure you check out community board website as they're going to be updates on meetings and times to login to our meetings as we go live As you see tonight we're getting his support and I will assign to other people to help him out so that he doesn't get overwhelmed and so just be patient with us.
In fact, I've never really done a live, meaning online before so, and I know that this is all new to the office as well, as they've been really like, jumping in and getting support from the city of New York, a lot of stuff is just being done just like boom at the split second, so I thank her and that all being said you know we're gonna have full board this way, and so we look forward to seeing with that all is well It. we'll discuss the other meetings that are going to take place during her report.
We are having a parks and executive committee, and full board now feels like I should have had much more, but it's just because I've been busy where he actually had to go out, make disinfectant and disinfect the office, which I do every time.
We go back to my home for the attendants as the next item on the agenda, so Susan I know that we're all sort of learning this new system and not sure if you mean Alicia and maybe Clint-- should have a conversation about the full board meeting on Tuesday How are we managing that as far as public session and representatives from electives this month and they're, saying there they're not having a public session?
We need to vote on this So I would like to make a motion to pass this new social media policy That's a little bit more descriptive to say you're, you know amending the social media policy, as I Don't know, say to update the policy to read as follows, and then the new policy all in favor aye Okay, now we're going to move into our committee Thank you transportation, Perhaps Michelle, might report there's.
