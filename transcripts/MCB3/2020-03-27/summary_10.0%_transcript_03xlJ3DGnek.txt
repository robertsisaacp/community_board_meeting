From that harassments meeting a motion to approve Thank, You Megan, a second So. First on our agenda, we going to talk That's probably gonna work best, at least to start with that we mute everyone.
The first thing up on the first item on the agenda tonight is a resolution for immediate support for New York City, small businesses impacted by the corona virus And, so you've gotten an email from the office.
So, whereas New York City is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of CoV I D - 19, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, whereas required aid and support programs for countless small merchants and their employees will be substantial, whereas all levels of government must work collaboratively to provide needed.
Community board 3 recommends the following: actions:: to provide immediate relief for all restaurants, hotels and small levels, commercial establishments, suspension of all fines and associated payments for a period of six months, automatic non free renewal of all city and state operating permits and business field filings for a period of six month.
I, believe the floor is open to make an amendment releasing for at least raise your hand, okay, lady and Lee I said I actually had a question, not an amendment yet, but is there a specific reason why it's only street-level businesses?
That's like a vast categories of businesses, and maybe we should be saying, convert all commercial establishments affected by the co19 virus, which include eating and drinking establishments, hotels and other service businesses, so that we're more inclusive Yes may in Chinatown I'm commonly just referred to as small businesses, because it is the smaller businesses that are the most vulnerable.
No people don't try to define like how small is small, right, Can we just maybe talk about our community district We?
That's on the resolution The language reads that therefore the first therefore be it resolved community or three recommends the following: actions:: to provide relief for all restaurants, hotels and old commercial establishment affected by the cove in nineteen biros.
He says the name of the program is forgiving fines, the New, York City amnesty program, online, so I think you can ignore anything like that.
We just put all small commercial businesses affected by the Copa 19 crisis and, just like Mae said we don't have to actually describe.
Okay I'm, not sure if there are small businesses that aren't commercial and that might be a little redundant Even, though you muted people.
Harvey wants to open this new office and have a black party I, don't know if they will still have it under the conditions, but this will give them the option but to have a whole meeting.
We see if I have a little longer discussion about how we're going to handle a lot of things if the situation is transferred drastically that we don't want to have committee meeting The floor is open for discussion.
In fact, I've never really done a live, meaning online before so, and I know that this is all new to the office as well, Jumping in and getting support from the city of New York.
It look like we have Susan, we'll discuss the other meetings that are going to take place during her report.
We don't want people to sign up for something Exists so before the other thing that susan may or may not be talking about, is that we don't know yet from the borough.
Can, you say again for the second part or sure when at least the committee also plays an important role in affordable housing protections reviewing and provide recommendations on applications for certain affordable housing, This is the new part and considering matters related to rent regulations and code, enforcement.
Far as the description was concerned, so you know, after consulting with Susan, she thought it would be a good idea to bring all the descriptions to the executive committee for a discussion before we just started using the new church.
If we, you know, still want to look at them for edits, there's plenty of time and as far as taking committees off the website, we can't get rid of committees without a vote.
So people can see these things without actually going to a meeting they're, not things that they're looking for input in clearly anything may be employed or resolution.
We go back to my home for the attendants as the next item on the agenda, So Susan I know that we're all sort of learning this new system and not sure if you mean Alicia and maybe Clint-- should have a conversation about the full board meeting on Tuesday.
Instead, That would be good because I think particularly for the full board meetings not being able to control that it's going to be kind of a mess.
