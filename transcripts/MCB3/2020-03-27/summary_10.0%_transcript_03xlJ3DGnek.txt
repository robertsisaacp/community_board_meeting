The first thing up on the first item on the agenda tonight is a resolution for immediate support for New York City, small businesses impacted by the Corona virus And, so you've gotten an email from the office.
So, whereas New York City is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of CoV I D- 19, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, Whereas required aid and support programs for countless small merchants and their employees will be substantial.
Community board 3 recommends the following: actions: to provide immediate relief for all restaurants, hotels and small levels, commercial establishments, suspension of all fines and associated payments for a period of six months, automatic, non free renewal of all city and state operating permits and business field filings for a period of six month.
Three requests, the State Department of Financial Services ensure that businesses, interruptions related to a public health emergency be quite be considered a covered event for insurance purposes, further, be it resolved.
I, believe the floor is open to make an amendment releasing for at least raise your hand, okay, lady and Lee I know it includes hotels and other businesses, but there I feel like there are a lot of other like nail salons or like hair stylists that are not necessarily street level.
That's like a vast categories of businesses, and maybe we should be saying, convert all commercial establishments affected by the Co19 virus, which include eating and drinking establishments, hotels and other service businesses, so that we're more inclusive And yes may in Chinatown I'm commonly just referred to as small businesses, because it is the smaller businesses that are the most vulnerable.
That's on the resolution The language reads that therefore the first therefore be it resolved community or three recommends the following: actions: to provide relief for all restaurants, hotels and old commercial establishment affected by the cove in nineteen biros.
He says the name of the program is forgiving fines, the New, York City amnesty program, online, so I think you can ignore anything like that.
First therefore recommends the following actions: to provide immediate relief for all, and you were saying commercial businesses Yeah, so get it rid of restaurants, hotels, Yada, just say for all small commercial businesses affected by the Covid-19 crisis, because I mean it could be a right.
Okay I'm, not sure if there are small businesses that are not commercial and that might be a little redundant Even, though you muted people.
This is a very simple thing that the Transportation Committee would certainly you know, approve It's, a block party, which is something we encourage.
We see if I have a little longer discussion about how we're going to handle a lot of things if the situation is transferred drastically that we do not want to have committee meeting The floor is open for discussion.
In, fact, I've, never really done a live, meaning online before so, and I know that this is all new to the office as well, Jumping in and getting support from, the city of New York.
A lot of stuff is just being done just like boom at the split second, so I thank her and that all being said, you know we're going to have full board this way, and so we look forward to seeing with that all is well.
It look like we have Susan, we'll discuss the other meetings that are going to take place during her report.
We do not want people to sign up for something exists so before the other thing that Susan may or may not be talking about, is that we do not know yet from the borough.
Reviewing come up, providing recommendations on applications for certain, affordable housing projects and considering matters related to rent regulations and code enforcement.
Reviewing and provide recommendations on applications for certain affordable housing, This is the new part and considering matters related to rent regulations and code, enforcement.
If we, you know, still want to look at them for edits, there's plenty of time and as far as taking committees off the website, we can't get rid of committees without a vote.
I want to make sure everybody knows about the public officer law that I referred to earlier.
So people can see these things without actually going to a meeting they're, not things that they're looking for input in clearly anything may be employed or resolution.
The borough president, is going forward on appointing new members, but I'd like to remind everyone that we have not had new members and they prefer I do not know how many years- What's not necessary, trying to get agency some of the agencies It's impossible, even though people are working from home, so We are not having an Human, Services or economic development meeting this month, we're not having a transportation committee meeting this month.
We go back to my home for the attendants as the next item on the agenda, So Susan I know that we're all sort of learning this new system and not sure if you mean Alicia and maybe Clint-- should have a conversation about the full board meeting on Tuesday.
Instead, That would be good because I think particularly for the full board meetings not being able to control that it's going to be kind of a mess.
Okay, may I have a motion to adjourn the meeting: Thank you of name, Thank, You, Susan and Clint, and Alicia working Now. And I can press the space key And you're hiring me That's when it seemed like people could start doing it.
