One is in the room: may is here Welcome to the executive committee meeting for the month of October for CB3 We are going to get started with a roll call vote for approval of minutes, Michelle.
Okay, I'll start, since you brought up shares, we're basically not spending any money other than our usual our contracts and salary, because we're not in the office doing anything It's, mostly like a contract for a photocopy, and that kind of thing we actually a few of us are in the office either every week or every other week for at least part of the day.
What we do at transportation is we usually put up the list of rules at the beginning at 6:30 and people if they want to speak on a specific agenda item, they have to sign into the chat room before seven o'clock.
My committee has like 11 or 12 people, so we, our policy, is that you, our policy, is that you use the the raised hands feature or if you know you can also go like this.
We should take a vote, a pole, vote and see what people are thinking I mean like Linda did say it's according to the size of the committee.
I mean like, because I think Susan just wants to have some type of policy for the website.
He puts also puts like similar to transportation, puts a set of rules on the screen at the beginning of the meeting, but does not keep him up the whole time once we start talking, he takes them down, but I think people are allowed to sign into the chat room at any given time Maybe so maybe we just need to say on the website that each committee runs the speaker, differently.
I. Think raising the hand is better because we're trying to discourage use of the chat room for any purpose, except to sign in discouraging Chit Chat -And I often you know, turn it to turn it to private at a certain point, in order to keep people from doing it, because they can't seem to stop themselves.
It sounds to me like different people, do different things and that I should be saying that each committee handles the public speakers with different procedures.
The reason is because other than signing in because it's kind of it's just like when I sharing land use, it's just a lot of things going on.
You know I'll use wording to say that it's flexible per committee, the instructions will be given in that beginning and no need to sign up in advance.
They change them constantly and certainly never notify the Community Board, and you know particularly music, I'm, going to say loud music that is constant, like maybe have people said six hours at a time.
I. Think a good plan for how to vote and Paul is going to demonstrate to you how that will work.
The link for the ballot out in the late afternoon told people that they could either you know they could vote early or they could wait until they've heard the presentations during the meeting.
I would suspect they need to vote at the meeting, because otherwise they would not even have to be at the meeting, but I think whatever you decide and something like that, we should pass it by either the Bro president's lawyer or open meeting just to make sure that it's okay , do you recall what they when they did, the vote in Community Board one they sent it, they sent it out early, but they actually did the voting at the meeting.
If you wanted to for the for the actual voting period at the meeting, you know.
If we want to take Eric's suggestion-And, you know say we're going to take five minutes, go vote.
May I have one question for you, considering that we just had a DOE meeting I'm wondering if you think that number 10 is less important, Well, we said well, there's every building and there is every school right.
I kind of felt like this was a little heavy on those and did not include some of the other really important items from other committees and in to me.
I I lower ranked a couple of the health and human services ones to make room for those in the first ten, but generally that sort of The second major comment I have is that I think there's a couple of priorities that did not make it last time that I think should be in the top 25, such as the increased funding for commercial peace assistance, program.
Those were some of the things that I think the committee chairs And I can speak to if you want to deal with individual items, but the ranking within the committee is like the priority to keep okay.
But I'd like to talk about how we want to do this first, because we I agree with Lisa on some of the items from parks, because I remember last year's discussion and you know we moved around a lot of things, but what's the procedure or what do we want to follow to sort of get this done?
And also I wanted to say that, like I'm more familiar with my own committee items.
You know they need to be prioritized over those seniors or maybe right before that So preserve the order of the that the committee decides.
I would like to see parks maintenance, staff, which has had serious cuts, moved up pretty high along with the recreation program, the playground associates, which I think is If we could move those up and to the point, I thought Jackie made about knowing other committee's priorities.
It's kind of hard to say, put this in front of like city, Ffs hra, because I really do not know the importance of that, but I do know that we really need to get some parks maintenance because they suffered some serious cuts.
At least one thing from economic development should be in there, and that would be our first priority, the commercial lease assistance program, which has been threatened multiple times and actually was defunded by the city and then brought back because of advocacy, including ours.
Reading the priorities from other committee committees and I feel like I, want to see ellen pike stream being constructed, and I do not know if we are already having too many past items on that list or not like that's capital.
If you're moving something from DOB up, it's going to be the first one that that deal that what do be ranked as number one that will be moving up, and I also want to just say: you know: When, we talk about items both the chair of the committee and I can give information about how vulnerable that is from the meetings to take that into consideration, because some you're, certainly getting a bigger bang for your buck, or some are more vulnerable than others.
Only thing I wanted to say is that if we could move number nine, restoring funding for starving, program, maintenance and building maintenance from nature move it above seven, because I understand social services.
A lot of important issues, But I feel like NYCHA, is really lacking staff right now, And they have such a big population in our community.
I do not prepare it, but in order to make it easier, you know to give the exec committee a draft collated list to have something to work.
The slate of human services budget priorities, because I think that program, in particular, is quite heavily used by a number of the small businesses and economic development is certainly.
I know we want to insert stuff above that, but the more we insert stuff above that moves it down a list, but if we could just keep it in that particular space, I won't push the other items which are important because they include recreation programs for kids and tree pruning, but, I think.
I thought Jackie had suggested, swapping taking out tree pruning and stump removal and putting in land used to, but maybe I miss, I think he just wanted to move land use.
So the two committees that have items on this that need to move are health and human services and transportation.
You know made a request and if you ever go to those cec meetings, They have already submitted these ask to the school construction authority and none of it has been funded Yet I mean working with the schools more.
I understand the school's need and in a Covid-19 environment that cooling systems are going to be critical if they're not already funded, but I just want to make sure that we understand what we're looking at from the human services or this ranking from for the schools.
The I like the way what Susan had said that you know, if you're definitely not planning to take a vote.
In the park, or you know, and in the course of discussion you know the committee wants to take an action Or and therefore it requires a vote.
I think we need to be very careful about our wording in our agenda and that primarily has to do with the public, because a lot of the stuff we do is informational and they may not attend because and then they find that there was a vote.
If, we're going to vote on something and perhaps They say possible vote or an asterisk, but if it's for informational, purposes, I would never take that to mean a vote unless it's a timely thing, because there are instances where they've come And they've, given us a presentation and they do not need a resolution, but there might be something controversial about it.
So when I'm working with the chairs that we know what to put Jackie Yes, I kind of agree with trevor on that as well, because if we are taking a vote on something, I just wanted to be extremely careful about.
New information comes up that is very timely and that there is need for a quick action, and that saying just next month, there'll be a vote.
There was a chinese language reporter who said she would come You know we did work really hard to make sure that I mean it took some doing.
