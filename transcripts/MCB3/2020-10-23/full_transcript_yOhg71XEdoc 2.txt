We're recording so whoever's leading the meeting, we're ready. Okay, so Linda you have the wording that has to be fixed right. I do and Michael. If you'll make me a co- host, I will share it already. Okay, so I just want to say this part of the meeting is for the nominating. This is the nominating I'm sorry, the bylaws committee, the Bylaws Committee, and we're making a an amendment to as the executive officers and the bylaw task force as executive officers. We are going to have the nominating committee change. The wording of the I'm sorry by Law Committee by Law Committee, is going to change the wording for the Nominating committee right in order for us to do our electronic nominations. You have to have this meeting tonight. Yeah! That's right. Are we going to take roll call for the I get yeah? I guess we should do that. So can I do not see everyone? Let me look at the panelists. Let me see participants okay, so we have Michael Moreno, yes, Linda Jones, Yes, Cooper Smith, yes, Paul, Rangel, Paul! No, not here yeah he's here yeah. I could not get off me: sorry, Trevor Holland, yes, okay and myself, Alicia Lewis, Coleman, okay. I do believe that Lisa Kaplan is there? Yes, okay, so I do believe we have Quorum okay. What about Melee and Herman? I do not see them as yet so, but for the roll call that they're not here, then right, they're, not they're, not here, okay, there's Anisha! I do not know why Anisha's anisha is coming up as Lisa Kaplan. Also everybody is Lisa Kaplan. Let's just continue with the meeting and I'll change people's names. Okay, sure, no problem. Okay! So now I'm going to hand over this part of the meeting to Linda Jones. Okay, I have shared the document. Can everyone see it? Yes? No, yes, okay! So, as Alicia said, the reason we're doing this is that the current bylaws say that the election shall be conducted by paper ballot and obviously that's not going to be possible using zoom. So this amendment, or this replacement allows us to choose something. It does not say what method we're going to use it just says we can do something else. The election of officers shall be conducted by written ballot unless under extraordinary circumstances, such as those, in effect during the imposition of executive order, number 202.1 suspending article 7 of the public officers law, which allows for remote meetings remote voting methods which comply with open meeting law must be implemented. So that's what we're going to do. Would it be clearer if we said the last few words said which comply with open meetings, law will be implemented, will be used or it must be implemented, does not sound like it's giving permission in the bylaws. You know like this is I do not remember us writing that either. So, whatever your suggestion, Lisa will be implemented or something like that you how about utilized? No, you will be utilized yeah, good, okay, that's better any discussion. Can I make a motion to pass this? Anyone want to make a motion. Please did not Michael just like Michael. It was that the motion. Yes, I made a motion and I think Trevor just seconded it. Okay, I did not hear trevor. He raised his hand. It was not me that was, I believe, Lisa it was me. It was fall last. Second, okay, Paul seconded okay. So we just want to make sure that we're very clear about that. So Michael made the motion and Paul seconded all in favor. You need to do a roll call. I think. Okay, roll call. Okay, roll call here we go. Okay, Michael made the motion. So that's a yes from Michael right I'll, say: yes: okay, Linda Jones, yes, okay, Michelle, Cooper, Smith, yes, Anisha Stephen, yes, Paul Rangel! Yes, Trevor Holland; yes, Lisa Kaplan, yes, okay, so I do not believe anyone else has joined us so motion carries. Can I can I ask question so my understanding is that tomorrow I should take this motion and send it to the full board and say this: is your 28 day notice? It will be on the November full board agenda. Is that correct? Yes, that's! Correct! Okay! Now I do not know whether it's this section that would wait till exactly to talk about our thoughts about how to conduct this election. I have the nominating committee separately on the agenda. Okay, somebody send me the the amended resolution, so I can say that I'm just about to do that. Thank you motion to adjourn the Bylaws committee meeting. Okay, do we need a roll call for that? Also? Okay? Second, okay, all in favor, everyone is in favor aye. Okay, thank you. Everyone meeting clothes for the num.
