Okay, good evening, everyone and thank you for joining tonight's school board community board three full board zoom meeting before we get started on our We start with our public session, which is the first part of our meeting, and I'm gonna.
I just want to explain what public session is for community work for the visitors that we have that have never attended a community board.
The public session is an opportunity for members of the community to address issues or concerns about our community So if you are a person that wishes to speak during our public session, you have to submit a speaker form on noon month by monday, the day before the full board meeting noon before full board, meeting.
Actually just got a new commanding officer yesterday who have not met yet, but I will be meeting with him, and this is a frequent type of issue that we need to deal.
We have a few of our members here on the community board and you probably know grouvenir has six 21-story buildings that are on montgomery and water street, just across from the fdr drive and the southernmost portion of the east river park and pier 42.
I urge community board 3 to pass a resolution calling upon the parks, department, mayor de Blasio, ddc and orr to ensure that the lower east side, ecology, center, be included in the east river coastal resiliency planning process and the compost yard be included in all posted information about escrow and written into all escrow documents regarding the park.
Community resident, I fell in love with east river park, many men, many years ago, when I tried being a runner at the fifth street track at the time it was near.
Someone has said that composting is not compatible with a new park, but for those of us who live within its locale in public housing, the co-ops, the mitchell llamas and the tenement buildings, we know the importance of having this resource within proximity to our homes.
Are its guardians community board through should urge the parks department to re-explore and reconsider the need to include an accessible composting station and harriet.
I want to urge the people in cb3 to have the city change the plans to include the lower east side, ecology center in compost, part in the plans for the new park.
A lot of people said it was a done deal And we're wasting our time, but it just proves that if you have a sound, unjust cause and keep on fighting, we can beat the goliaths in this, which is new york city in this case, and we did win We stopped the jail.
I, hope everyone's doing well back to school So I'll just briefly spend a minute speaking about our work in that capacity, which included the controller joining many community residents at the rally in March last week where he spoke about the need to make sure open school.
The comptroller also released his 2020-2021 back-to-school guide, which has a lot of really valuable information for parents and families, including on how they can engage in their school on virtual learning, health guidelines for multilingual learners, students with special education needs and that's available in english, chinese and spanish And I'll make sure to drop that in the chat, and I.
We can address the specific issues to them, which includes the unreliable internet and city, shelters, the location, accessibility of learning, bridge programs and making sure that, if students want to request a transfer to a school closer to their shelter, they're able to do so to make sure that school and education is more accessible for those families.
At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the comptroller announced a prevailing wages initiative in order to hopefully return money back to workers which was stolen from them or not properly provided to them by their employees, and we are happy to announce that we have returned over 2 million dollars to workers across new york city Your rights workshops for workers across the city, working with a bunch of community groups.
I'll try to be brief, but you know thank you for continuing to have these forums in this virtual world they're in and thank you obviously, susan and alicia for all your work and all the members and staff of the board.
We, had a public forum a week a week The work has now begun and You know we're interested if people are having there.
If people are interested, the continuing on housing, the eviction moratorium, the good news, is, I think.
The governor, waited until September 21st to extend a mortgage from that expired on September, 20th, again , I think it'd be better if people, if the courts and the parties potential, the business owners and property owners all have greater, you know security and advanced notice about what's going to be in place to protect them.
If you are planning on voting, if you're planning on running absentee, please request your absolute about as soon as possible and send it on in where you know the post office is going to be even in the best of circumstances.
You don't pay taxes on that until you know you sell the assets, but lots of people's fortunes have grown very substantially during this, so that the proposal that I'm supporting there would generate five and a half billion dollars and again that should be realizable.
You know like we have a city income tax, so our highest marginal rate on income is higher than the jersey rate, even with their new thing.
If we want to see students, retained, persist and succeed, using those strategies, costs a little more money but in the end students graduate closer to on time, so they get to work sooner and our tax dollars are actually best spent because the students actually graduate so expanding those support.
You know: endangered species, clean air, clean water, so I would just say to everybody vote, and if you have extra time- There are a myriad of ways in which you can participate in the electoral system, and I would urge people who are terrified to take a little bit of your time in the coming weeks, to reach out to your fellow americans and work to see that new york is and and the rest of the world is protected.
I'm going to go to senator brad hoyleman I wanted to acknowledge our first ever community board budgeting selections and thanks to community board three, where we funneled our capital dollars through the approvals process from local community boards.
You know they look forward to going there after school and making sure they have a safe place to play and everything.
March was organized by four mothers in the district and the reason for which- It was supported from all the incredible local organizations, and it is important that this is understood by everybody, because the media narrative right now is that we, the parents, just want to send our kids to school, and it's the lazy teachers or it is this and that the reality is the conditions.
That we did was that we need more funding in order for the future of new york and all of new yorkers today to be safe, and so please fight for us for existing funding and in terms of taxing Like, many others said for the first time.
I am with new jersey because they had the guts to do the right thing and also consider senator jackson's bill, because funding for public education has been inadequate for years and any budget cut that may happen.
So you know if it's been a tough weekend and a tough six months, but hopefully, as we move into a new year and 57-81, we will maybe reflect on the bad past year and look forward to doing more the ecology center, clearly a critical part of our neighborhood, and that the board has been really important and strong about this, and we continue to the loss of ruth bader.
Alex, has sat through more delay committee meetings than anyone I've met in my life, We can't lose our local businesses And I think we need to do a better job, olympia.
Thanks, for the work on the rally and for you know, people like you.
Open, we're gonna have kids in winter code sitting in classrooms with The plan we have in place right now is going to work Okay, we'll be remote until January and focus on high needs, kids and kids with special needs or kids with ieps.
I think in terms of the jail you've heard some, but there was a meeting today with the city council and the mayor's office, and I hope that they come to the community, board.
So we're gonna make sure that there's as much community engagement as possible and the city is going to appeal.
We are going to do another letter listing all of these issues- We, as you know, focused on them getting food during the entire pandemic.
My understanding is that food program and susan may know this is going to switch over to diphtha And I hope that works, but I think that's something that should be very closely monitored, because the seniors need the food.
We also gave up money from the governor to individual groups working many of them in chinatown, and we just got a list from the u.s census of buildings that are not getting entrance to We will go over and figure out, which is what community board we have.
I mean amid the pandemic and budget cuts, and all of that cuny really needs funding, especially given the fact that nearly 80 percent of cuny students are people of color and removing that resource from an already underserved community would be truly devastating.
There's been a lot of great legislation, put forward that really works to support our community, but none of that can be passed if the legislature is not in session.
The questions at this point in the meeting for elected officials and their representatives are only for community board.
I don't see any hands raised from community board members, so we're going to go to victor from carolina, maloney's office.
Those people should fill the census, for you, know, for new york because they they're, probably in their second home You, know, which contains funding for rental assistance, for example a hundred billion and which, and then these assistance would offer you know, would cover you, know: public housing and the section eight residents that you know That's floated around by senate republicans and more adequate than the CDC eviction.
And it it's all depending on the November, election, And and then and then lastly, and then the congresswoman is working on a bill to you know to eliminate voter suppression in some of the key swing states and that's update thanks all right.
So I'd like to see what we could do to help the homeless a little better with those vouchers that they're giving out it is very restricted as to how they're going to find housing in 90 days with the vouchers I, don't know so, if there's any way that we can support them with an extension or even listings or Whatever Thank you, isabel marian from council members, chin's office.
Okay, I'm we're going to be convening the NYCHA section, 8 subcommittee on 1021, And. That's again on October, the 21st We are approaching our community board elections for our executive committee, and so during we're still in the midst of coving right, so we're still in the pandemic.
I think parks has announced that there are 30 percent short on their staff because of people being out ill along with having budget related issues and another complaint We're hearing a lot of, and which is one of the public session speakers spoke.
There are many times informational items from local nonprofits, such as when we got our first marijuana, dispensary or new community services or programming.
Members will have a proposal to ask the board for support, such as for traffic improvements or residents, who form a friendship group, maybe for a park we may have local organizations, such as community education, council, coming to the board for support all the items sent to the office.
They came to our board two times in the past year with you know, request for support on their new location, which we had voted on and approved, but you'll be able to hear more about their programs.
As alicia mentioned a little bit earlier, we are going to hold nycha's a committee meeting in October and NYCHA officers will come to our meeting to give us updates on resilience, programs and also general services.
However, we still have a little bit of time, so we are going to put it on the meeting after October Thank you, jackie transportation, alicia.
There has been some slight improvements as what fdny discussed, there's also questions from the community in regards to some of the pattern, the parking spots and things like that and now continuously to try to help the improvements on avenue being going forward.
What they want is that they want a letter of support for their application to extend the world trade center health registry for another five years, beginning in July 2021, and the letter needs to be submitted by October 15th to the public affairs manager of the new york city, health department and world trade center health registry.
