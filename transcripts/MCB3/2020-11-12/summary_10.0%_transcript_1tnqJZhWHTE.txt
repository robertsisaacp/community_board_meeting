Let me add my two cents here from a procedural perspective, so carolyn what the office told you is correct when it comes to the full board meeting public session at the full board meeting, they have to sign up in advance, okay or committee meetings.
Yes, and by the way, I want to inform all the committee members about what happened and what I personally did as a follow-up with the borough president, because it impacts them too.
We passed two resolutions at the past subcommittee meeting of arts and culture, but you know, unfortunately, because of the way the calendar has been set for CB3.
They raised some concerns, because our resolution unfortunately did not have enough context, so we offered to them to give the missing context, because this is a resolution about a bill, especially drafted by the chair of the arts and culture Committee of the City Council, to address very fair concerns of architectural organizations that are currently banned.
I think people are very much in favor of trying to help arts and culture to be able to have performances on the street, but I do not want to get into a discussion if that's something that we're not allowed to do at the meeting right now that you know, basically that we have to take your presentation as it is, and that the issue will be discussed.
It is SLA, it's all over the place, so having a resolution that focused on that brought a lot of feelings about having amplified sound, which distracted, I think from the central issue of having a program like open streets for arts and culture.
You know, there's a lot of new members, so they're not too familiar with the processes carolyn, but typically for items to get on the committee agenda.
There is a very interesting movement from a lot of progressives in New York state to get the governor to give relief to the city before December, because in December a lot of people actually are going to have zero like right.
That's why a lot of people are putting more pressure now to the governor to make sure that this comes, and if this comes I, think it is our responsibility to ask that they immediately start programs for arts and cultural workers and organizations like fast rapid grants or something like that.
I. Could not I could ask her I do not know if she's the one you want, though I think it has to go through the community board in terms of making that request crystal through the office.
The other thing, that's also a possibility is whether or not if we want to request somebody from Senator Serrano's office since he's the head of the state arts and culture committee to possibly come and speak to us about what are the possibilities, because he's been very proactive in terms of trying to help the arts and culture.
The Harlem Community Board did and a few others where we actually invite the commissioner, maybe of the Department of Cultural Affairs and the mayor's office of media and entertainment, and we invite many local organizations to submit questions and our committee.
Think is the right thing to do so that can be added to the December agenda.
I think you know, maybe also not I, know we spoke about the senator or even us, the City Council person who oversees arts and culture.
I think maybe that's a great opportunity for our committee to organize that town hall and invite the senator who oversees arts and culture, the city Council member oversees arts and culture.
I. Think many organizations will take time to come to a town hall and hear from a presentation about what's happening on the state city level and that pertains to them and then from there as committee members, we can share taking notes to help build some context as to what's going on in our in our district with the organizations.
And, then we can better plan as a committee moving into the new year of how we want to support, but I also think inviting.
I also think inviting public school principals from the district, because a lot of arts and culture organizations serve those schools and can not moving forward and so that.
Think there is arts, and culture is one of those sectors or topics that cuts across so many committees, whether it's I mean, certainly, as you all know, whether you like it or not- economic development, but also you know, parks, Transportation, Health and Human services.
I do think that there would be certainly board members and people from each of those committees.
I do not know if they I do not think the district office has any approval over anything.
Think that, from my understanding, because I've had this issue before with the open meetings law that if we decide once we do, approve it.
Okay, we can put it on the agenda for December and say at that point in time that we want to discuss the organization of a town, Hall, Zone Meeting, and to invite the representatives from the city and the state and whoever that we want to attend that meeting.
So I do think that you're talking about doing a town hall, which is not a official community board meeting.
Before, like how many town halls have I done with arts and culture.
I. Think you from my understanding is that this would go in the minutes as sort of the next steps is to explore how to do a town hall and then Carolyn would work with the office to figure out some of the logistics and in the next meeting there could be some potential dates.
I. Think that you know having had this experience a number of times with the district office that I've had some experience in putting town halls together in the process.
Think I would prefer to include the discussion and the minutes under what we talked about with the results of the survey and how the arts organizations that responded, and that we felt that it was appropriate between that and the last information that we see from DCLA that a town helped be hosted and that it would be listed on the agenda for the December meeting, at which point in time we will pick a date and go for that.
I would prefer to have this discussion in the agenda in the minutes, for this meeting, of which you will all get a copy, okay and that it will be listed as being on the December, agenda.
From my from my experience with the one town hall that I did some of the burden of what you what you and the committee have to do and what the office has to do was alleviated, because what I did was I went to our city, Council member and said hey.
So I would suggest that, maybe, since there is a city council member who is the committee chair for arts and culture.
Last year, I went from like March through June, getting dates from elected officials to attend a town hall and because of the structure, the skip meetings for the community board.
If he would help us, he's, got the power right, but just because of the experiences that I had last year with the town hall, that it would be helpful if the district office were on board with that.
Our committee members allowed to support you as the chair in organizing and kind of talking to City Council offices and things that are you familiar with the council, person.
Last year for the town hall, there were other people who pitched in and helped, but the problem was: is the communication between the district office and the committee and the amount of time that we had in which to organize and to present the material and get it out to people in a timely, fashion.
And I think that we as a committee, can ensure moving forward right, because what ended up happening is that we were penalized with having our meetings cancelled for several months.
And I would like to have a successful town hall that is actually helpful and useful and provide support to the arts.
You know you, as the chair have to kind of delegate tasks to us, and let us know what you need as committee as committee members to support you in organizing and getting this work done, but I'm happy that you're going to put on the December agenda.
I mean we'd still be important, but she would lead the meeting as our City Council member interested in the arts.
What we have determined in that what will be in the minutes is that we have discussed this and there were numerous suggestions made about how to proceed and that outreach will be made to the council person and to the chair of the arts and culture Committee on City Council, as well as to Senator Jose Serrano in terms of attendance.
Through, so that they're on board with what we're talking about, and it will be scheduled for the December 9th meeting that we are scheduled to have for arts and culture and at that point, but we may be able to have the town hall before that.
As to whether or not the district office would approve us going forward with the town hall prior to that.
Every committee is going to be meeting in a weird time in December because of the holidays.
You know I think they all they want to date.
Think, that the gist of it is that we all want to support arts and culture organizations, and we know that they're in dire need of support at this time.
