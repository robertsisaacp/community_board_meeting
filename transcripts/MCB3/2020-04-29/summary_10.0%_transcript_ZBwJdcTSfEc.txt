We don't want to get into a situation like we were in last month where the electeds reports took over two and a half hours, so we are going to be starting, so we've organized them the best way we can, and unfortunately things change- we've been dealing with emails coming in from people asking for their time to change and and if they're still on the talk to us, they're still going to talk to us, but we have asked East elected official to keep their report to ten minutes, and those ten minutes include the Q&A session A lot more before I start I want to say that I hope everyone on the call is safe at home and well It's very important You can they've mailed them to your home It's important, because it is the formula that is used to dispense over 800 billion dollars a year for schools, hospitals and job training and other essential services.
So we just voted recently an additional four hundred and eighty four billion package again a lot of money for small businesses, but money's also for our hospitals and for testing, not enough If we don't test and do follow-up on who's testing positive and not and we'll never be able to open up a game, We were supposed to go back into session on May 4th, but the medical community really complained and said it wasn't safe to have 435 people going back to Washington when we are still in the epidemic.
As, the chair of the Oversight Committee I, have a responsibility for the post office and where they're going to run out of money this summer, can you imagine how many people are getting their medicines by mail communicating by mail?
It's supposed to be open to everyone, who's, an SBA lender, but some banks are writing their own rules, Only doing loans over $100,000 and to call him you don't get to write the rules it's supposed to be eligible to everyone, but in this new round we funded or siphoned off or courted off, sixty billion for really small businesses, and this money will be distributed through credit unions, a minority institutions CDFIs which were created for unbanked, low-income people and micro lenders that are participating in the program, and this will be protected and used ugly for small businesses.
I also wrote a letter to expand the eligibility of this loan program so that non-profits and carrot of all organizations of all sizes can participate, and we have many of those in our community You had your hand up first and it's very good that you segregated those sixty billion for real small businesses, because they really didn't get to access any of the loans People who applied for the pandemic unemployment-.
I think you need to try to focus to help more than once more in need, and You also need somehow to address the people that are left out so far, People, who are not going to be perceiving the 1200 bucks each and to be honest, New, York rents, that's not going to go very far with unemployment for 3 6 8 months and more first of all, we need to We tried to get in the rent relief and the rent freeze, I'm on the Banking Committee too, and I got a letter and I got people up the Congress people to support it, where they're freezing any mortgage foreclosure under federal mortgages so that they won't be moving in that area.
Send me, your questions to my office and we'll answer: them:: okay, there are two people that one at an earlier time and one I appreciate the fact that you're trying to get through this meeting quickly, I just wanted to thank congressman Maloney first for her efforts in which I joined and attempting to really repeal the discriminatory and homophobic FDA gay men, blood ban.
We now require a whole host of protections for women who want to act as servants, including their own medical care, health insurance, life insurance, independent legal counsel, ensuring that they have counseling make sure that they have every medical decision is made by themselves, including whether to carry a child through term or not so I believe we're raising the standard for surrogacy, because so many states in this country and frankly, the world have no laws whatsoever and that's where women and parents who are well intentioned and egg donors get taken advantage of You, know I , think it gives some couples: individuals, LGBTQ people struggling with infertility, cancer survivors, some hope and God knows In terms of your first question regarding the issue of medical liability.
Council does not have the capacity to do that right now, as I have hundreds of cases in my office we're coordinating a large network, along with other elected officials who are on this, call to deliver meals and pharmacy runs and to take care of each other, so it has been very challenging, but I think the first virtual stated when office as well as it could and I know that some of you have participated in some of the hearings that we've held transportation, general welfare Today.
There has not been a seamless coordination between the private hospitals and the Elmhurst Linkens and wood halls of the world, and unfortunately, as Health and Hospitals is asking for monetary donations and I think that those disparities have not only been brought to light in terms of what we already know that food housing, health care and education, which are basic human rights specially in this city, are not accessible to everyone, but that we also see that in the fatality numbers, which have been absolutely heartbreaking, So in terms of the budget and how we're going to recover, we've been served about seven billion dollars in cuts from the mayor's office.
I could say that coming from a former small nonprofit and making sure that we're saving things like the Summer Youth Employment Program, when our pools are going to be closed, we don't know about what's gonna happen in their parks in our beaches and our young people need something to do.
I, just wanna ask a question on the track on the street closures, understanding that it was needed and the city's pushing through a lot of initiatives How is the community going to be able to participate or recommend which streets a thinker can should be closed or turned into open?
I know the mayor kind of did his big announcement and many people think that we might not go through with the bill, but until we see a real plan from the mayor, not just an allocation of how many miles are going to be determined by the NYPD We're gonna keep going forward because we do want it to be community driven to work with the Business Improvement Districts to work with civic and block associations.
I get a call this morning from somebody crying about the situation in the hospital What we're not hearing is the actual people that are out there working and what this situation is like and what their concerns are, especially because rules have basically changed, We're, also working to make sure that will protect whistleblow, because that is how a lot of the information got out to the public into the world as to the conditions that were going on in some of our hospitals, what went down in Elmhurst Hospital and how that news got out.
Let me know what you hear: I'm, always interested I'm, always checking with workers as well as people like a dr Katz and I want to make sure that people feel safe when they're inside what we deem as one of the spaces in New York City, which is a hospital That's what I'm gonna do tell them that they can contact you because you'd be surprised, I, think a lot of hospitals have policies that everybody has to sign off on about how they communicate outside.
If you can, if you're doing the people's work, I think I used too much today the morning you know straight through, because we had a hearing today, as my colleague Karina was talking about housing and building meeting and I really want to focus on our senior population, because I know that my office has been getting a lot of calls from our seniors In the beginning of the shutdown people who were supposed to be getting.
You know home-delivered meal from the senior centers, and that was going well for a while It was taken away from the Department for the aging and got centralized under the food Tsar and there's still a lot of problem of people getting food You know from the school One of the things that we want to focus on is that we want to make sure that, coming out of this crisis, that our Senior Center are kept home because they are so crucial in our community because, right now they don't really have any part in it.
We will work with community board neighborhood group to figure out after crisis Would these programs look like so that we make sure that our seniors, I'll, dudes homeless, our families in need are not lost?
I just wanted to hear any thoughts you have about the devastation that has happened in New, York, City, nursing homes that you know as the governor and the and the industry blame each other Is there any thought going forward of a task force or something that could really with people who don't have skin in the game?.
We have to figure out like how do we keep senior in touch and I know that you know we have a lot of computer programs while senior in the senior center We just gotta get everybody involved and when nursing home I think we have to work to really elevate home health aides, nurses and we gotta make sure they get paid better, that they are treated with respect and so that, because they are so critically needed.
Food banks are doing a great job, even though they're very stressed so I call the office If there's a community center that is having a food distribution, trouble that we can work through with the city but the I know you have our report and I voted against provision in the budget, but you know that's what we agreed to in the budget.
The question is how we're going to be able to keep as much we can ensure that we have real budget justice, we're really focusing on in Albany, and it isn't just about cuts There's a lot of bills that we all have around new revenue, whether it's taxing you know, the high income earner more The mezzanine debt bill with lots of legislation to talk about having resources at the table, because the antics, but can't just be cuts, could be cuts but also gotta, be we do doing really well need to put more on the table.
The second thing is, and we've all been asking I've sent dollars to the governor's office now, probably a month ago, Yes the authority under executive power to freeze all the runs now and we've told them to do it no reason to wait legislatively You know some people won't be able to use their security deposit Some people might question, cancel right, I, think it's legal, especially with putting a hardship fun together for those difficult landlords, but he's in a lot of power today and you should be exercising it instead of doing cuts, helping regular people so senator in terms of generating new revenues.
We want to make sure those people who are high income earners, people who are not New York residents pay additional they're not paying into our paying income tax Thanks for all your work, just instead of focusing on regarding commercial rents, instead of focusing on cancelling rents, which I think would require some sort of federal backstop of money or some sort of real estate tax concession.
We've got two hundred and fifty percent of what's called fair market rent which, in New York City, would cover rents potentially up to around forty eight hundred dollars depending on the number of bedrooms, and it would be available to people who have lost income or jobs probably have a range of criteria that would allow people to qualify and the goal would be since this is emergency, to create a relatively smooth process for people to get that assistance and again that I think that you know we Our idea is to do it as a piece of state legislation that would design a program and work out the kinks so that, to the extent this federal money bill, what we get move as soon as possible.
So, as Harvey noted about 200 of us legislators and other government officials, as well as lots of advocates, have called for a hundred billion dollar national figure, with ten billion of it going for New York, and that was addressed to our compression on New York congressional delegation and our two senators, and some of them have responded favorably and have actually put in writing their desire to try to make sure that is funded in the next stimulus and I would urge people who are concerned.
Think it's like 8.1 billion dollars and I've heard the governor, saying and also governor use policy issues oh just I, know that money has already been allocated through the cares act to the states, but I've heard that the governors are saying you know and a lot of senators also saying we can't actually use this money because of all those in place on it, including through the new Treasury guidelines.
Small business assistant program, pace university It should be good and again it's a zoomable event, and you know people can join a side of that move on to something member yulie knew and then are going to have joined us recently, and I also wanted to remind people that I'm having my Town Hall on Sunday 're gonna talk about the budget and it's gonna be the after budget aftermath and what it all means for us, and hopefully we can get some input on that and I want to make sure that where were actually addressing a lot of the community concerns that we have and the other thing I wanted to talk about really quickly.
However many years was to actually fund our New York CDFI program, and we were one of the only states in the entire name that has New York CDFI fund, like has its own statewide CDFI fund, but we've never funded it, and this is the first time that has been funded So. That was a big win, but the thing is it's like a little late for our state to actually be able to utilize it in the best and effective way, and you look a little bit of a runway for our credit unions, for our Community Development financial institutions and I think that we need to continue to raise that issue with our Congress people and I Think, that the PPP issue, for example, is really about making sure that we have strings attached to the funding right.
This is what I think exist so, and the governor and the mayor each have their own individuals who are making up the recovery committee and I want to tell all the community boards Maybe a Varro board discussion, but it is something Manhattan is like no other far off, and so we really need to have our own suggestions as to what recovery looks like I We're really delighted that Fresh Direct is now paid by the city of New York to work with NYCHA from the top of Manhattan to the bottom and on Friday were on the Lower East Side working with all the nights just to get them.
There was a discussion earlier about undocumented workers and housing If there's a housing situation or an unemployed in this situation, definitely you let us know they're trying to figure out how to have an effective community advisory group and that's going to be a very large project and I know that there's some state money to be used for economic development So we'd be working with the community board and different stakeholders to do that without getting into lots of specifics.
We have many being delivered to our office on Friday, not they don't go for everywhere , they're, not going to take care of all of Manhattan If you have some specific needs, please let Brian know, because we will try to address them and get them delivered and thank you very much hope you read our newsletter and congratulations to your amazing virtual community board meeting Thank you for that report.
This is a question about open space streets parks in Manhattan, Obviously, we're constrained for space and the city has announced severe cuts to parks and it seems a little odd because that's where people are going to go for recreation with pools being closed and I'm wondering how do we raise this issue about funding for parks so that we could make sure that the areas are going to be heavily used?
Okay also I want to thank our elected officials for being on the front lines, distributing meals, checking in on our community and doing the hard work as we are dealing with this epidemic and this pandemic At. The moment business community board goodbye to make enjoy I want everyone to give her a standing ovation, a hand, clap and applaud, because she has done an exceptional job, as our economic development chair We, look forward to working closely with you, as you have already done, a great job of sitting on various committee and meetings that will affect economic development for our community We decided that we were going to add additional executive meetings to deal with concerns and issues that may arise before the end of the month.
Is that concrete idea but may I think that, maybe in a month or a little bit more than a month, they will have or start thinking about it more after this fiscal year starts and then also I went to the community education council meeting, which deals with the New York City Department of Education They are getting a lot of budget cuts, but also we will work with the CEC to find out what the needs are in terms of BOE and in terms of budget priorities, so that will also be like a little later, so hopefully in August we can well in August.
