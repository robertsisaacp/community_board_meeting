I also request that cb3, you know to indemnify all of the open streets projects, making it far more equitable for block associations, lower-income and smaller groups to participate in this important community health, initiative.
Don't want to get into a situation like we were in last month where the electeds reports took over two and a half hours, so we are going to be starting, so we've organized them the best way we can, and unfortunately things change.
You know the past hour, we've been dealing with emails coming in from people asking for their time to change And if they're still on the talk to us, they're still going to talk to us, but we have asked East elected official to keep their report to ten minutes, and those ten minutes include the Q&A session.
They have gaps in their budget and if they don't get city and state funding, then they will have to start layoffs, which is going to be a terrible thing for our people.
As the chair of the Oversight Committee I, have a responsibility for the post office and where they're going to run out of money, this summer, can you imagine how many people are getting their medicines by mail, communicating by mail?
Now our government governor tells us we're going to be voting by mail, so we have to save the post office and make sure that it is funded.
Only doing loans over $100,000 and to call him you don't get to write the rules it's supposed to be eligible to everyone, but in this new round we funded or siphoned off or courted off, sixty billion for really small businesses, and this money will be distributed through credit unions, a minority institutions CDFIs which were created for unbanked, low-income people and micro lenders that are participating in the program, and this will be protected and used ugly for small businesses.
Since there is this difficulty of accessing the relief in the various forms that it exists out there for the people who are really most in need, and then there is no movement yet on the legislation, even though I know it has been introduced, now, even at the federal level about rent suspension.
Send me your questions to my office and we'll answer: them: okay, So, we're going to there are two people that one at an earlier time and one I appreciate the fact that you're trying to get through this meeting, quickly, I just wanted to thank congressman Maloney first for her efforts in which I joined and attempting to really repeal the discriminatory and homophobic FDA gay men, blood, ban.
I want to thank them for all their work, including distributing meals using you, know, leveraging different parts of our districts like the management company at Stuy, Town Peter Cooper, which is owned by Blackstone they've, been donated.
If you're sick, are you gonna pay the rent if you've lost your job If you've got two kids at home, who are being homeschooled and you have a loved one, who's on a respirator I mean I, can't imagine just how grim it is for so many of our neighbors, so I'm in strong support of the cancel rent movement, along with our sibling members, who are on the line, some member yulie, new and Harvey Epstein, among others, of course, Deborah Glick, and we not only are pushing that.
I've been appointed to the revenue-raising committee for the state Senate We're, going to look at ideas to you know the governor's proposing 10 billion dollars worth of cuts in the absence of any aid from the feds.
We have to tax the wealthiest, but you know we got to think of creative solutions like who's making money during this kind.
We, now require a whole host of protections for women who want to act as servants, including their own medical, care, health, insurance, life, insurance, independent legal counsel, ensuring that they have counseling make sure that they have Every medical decision is made by themselves, including whether to carry a child through term or not so I believe we're raising the standard for surrogacy, because so many states in this country, and, frankly, the world, have no laws whatsoever.
You, know where individuals who can prove that a loved one has been killed due to some negligence on the part of a physician or Hospital, can sue for beyond just the actual monetary damages, but pain and suffering, which has limited their recovery for so many people, particularly women people of color and people who are low income, because the estimate of your worth is based on how much you are able to earn according to a formula and if you're, a baby or if you're somebody who works in construction, they will limit.
It was done without watchdog groups and there was really no reason for it to happen at this point in time during a pandemic, so that that's my objection just on the on the face of it Here, but I would say in terms of the nursing home issues that really what we need are stronger standards and public health and Health Planning Council.
And I think that those disparities have not only been brought to light in terms of what we already know that food housing, health care and education, which are basic human rights specially in this city, are not accessible to everyone, but that we also see that in the fatality numbers, which have been absolutely heartbreaking.
So in terms of the budget and how we're going to recover, we've been served about seven billion dollars in cuts from the mayor's office.
I could say that coming from a former small nonprofit and making sure that we're saving things like the Summer Youth Employment Program, when our pools are going to be closed, we don't know about what's gonna happen in their parks in our beaches and our young people need something to do.
I know the mayor kind of did his big announcement and many people think that we might not go through with the bill, but until we see a real plan from the mayor, not just an allocation of how many miles are going to be determined by the NYPD.
We're gonna keep going forward because we do want it to be community driven to work with the Business Improvement Districts to work with civic and block associations.
We're kind of still figuring out the process to make sure that people do feel included, because you all know your communities best and that's what happens when you're kind of you know trying to operate in the midst of a pandemic.
My question is, who is going to talk to the workers, the workers, with just a variety of issues that, like I, said whenever I hear most officials talk and people from the hospital sector?
What we're not hearing is the actual people that are out there working and what this situation is like and what their concerns are, especially because rules have basically changed.
We're, also working to make sure that will protect whistleblow, because that is how a lot of the information got out to the public into the world as to the conditions that were going on in some of our hospitals.
You know dozens of people die every night and, in addition to the teachers and the students and the families and everyone else who are in homes where there is domestic violence, there needs to be a mental health program.
Let me know what you hear: I'm, always interested I'm, always checking with workers as well as people like a dr.
Katz and I want to make sure that people feel safe when they're inside what we deem as one of the spaces in New York City, which is a hospital That's what I'm gonna do tell them that they can contact you, Because you'd, be surprised, I, think a lot of hospitals have policies that everybody has to sign off on about how they communicate outside of that hospital, and your hospital said that he does not have that.
We want to protect whistleblowers, they're, doing the right thing and letting people know of the conditions, and it is because of them that many of the terrible conditions that existed in some of our systems early on were eventually rectified.
I'm on the iPhone, because my iPad and my computer is not working The morning you know straight through because we had a hearing today, as my colleague Karina was talking about housing and building meeting And I really want to focus on our senior population, because I know that my office has been getting a lot of calls from our seniors.
You know from the school it's helpful, but they still got to work out a lot of the kinks.
One of the things that we want to focus on is that we want to make sure that, coming out of this crisis, that our Senior Center are kept home because they are so crucial in our community because, right now.
They are calling out senior doing wellness check, but I also want to make sure that they have the capacity going forward to really look at what the Senior Center should look like after this crisis.
Now they put in more money in this 3.5, and the good news is that from the discussion with council, congresswoman Maloney, there's 60 billion dollars, set aside for women and minority-owned business, and also to allow smaller bank and credit union and Community Development Fund to help small businesses.
I just wanted to hear any thoughts you have about the devastation that has happened in New, York, City, nursing homes that you know as the governor and the and the industry blame each other.
We need to work with our state elected and the governor I mean they cannot abandon our frail seniors.
You wanted to leave time, hey, we'll just close by saying that we heard from the governor's folks that they might entertain yet an extension on the moratorium of evictions, we're going to push for that And we're going to push them to allow us to use security deposits for rent that's a way of actually getting money, not out of someone's pocket but into the hands of some of the smaller landlords that really they too are struggling.
You hear people having concerns about getting unemployment, benefit officers they're, having daily conversations with the governor's office- Tomorrow night around, you know, with the young Invincibles or on Keeney SUNY issues, I'm doing when they Creek around small businesses, I think we're all trying to catch as many people as we possibly can on these issues.
I think we are lucky to have such great colleagues on the east side with the assembly and send in the council I'm lucky to be able to be able to work with them, and if we think we can get something done, we can figure it out together early today, we, you know Yes, a or two days, ago, the governor's office dropped, a lot of hand.
You know we don't have money in New. York State I have a bill to allow commercial tenants to basically create like a scree tree type program for their small commercial businesses to say the landlord gives some portion of the rent that can be as a real estate production of real estate, taxes.
We've got two hundred and fifty percent of what's called fair market rent which, in New, York City, would cover rents potentially up to around forty eight hundred dollars, depending on the number of bedrooms, and it would be available to people who have lost income or jobs probably have a range of criteria that would allow people to qualify and the goal would be since this is emergency, to create a relatively smooth process for people to get that assistance and again that I think that you know we.
So, as Harvey noted about 200 of us legislators and other government officials, as well as lots of advocates, have called for a hundred billion dollar national figure, with ten billion of it going for New York, and that was addressed to our compression on New York congressional delegation and our two senators, and some of them have responded favorably and have actually put in writing their desire to try to make sure that is funded in the next stimulus.
Oh just I, know that money has already been allocated through the cares act to the states, but I've heard that the governors are saying you know and a lot of senators also saying we can't actually use this money because of all those in place on it, including through the new Treasury guidelines.
You know the effort of providing relief through stimulus bills that are going to cost additional money, so I think one option is, to the extent that they are going back to the drawing board, it's probably easier for them to modify the terms of some of the things they've done already than it is to.
You know: ask the executive branch, through its discretion, to change the terms of some of these things, that we can also ask Congress to go back to the drawing board and modify these programs to the extent they're, not working as they seem to have been intended to be and again.
There, obviously also a lot of efforts to make sure unemployment and other programs are providing cash to people for various expenses, including housing.
And I want to make sure that, where were actually addressing a lot of the community concerns that we have and the other thing I wanted to talk about really quickly.
And I started to ask on the state level for help since then, since end of January, because I start coming, None of my small businesses have been able to apply and successfully get any of the resources that were promised and it's very hard to figure out what would be the best way for us to actually even access those things.
If a kind, bigger business is able to return their money, maybe it can come to us, but if that's not the way, I think it should work.
I know the city council pressured the mayor, And I think there's another example of what does the community board in your case 4-3?
I assume this projects going to go forward, but I want you to know that we've been working with them.
And, that's going to be a very large project And I know that there's some state money to be used for economic development So we'd be working with the community board and different stakeholders to do that without getting into lots of specifics.
If you have some specific needs, please let Brian know because we will try to address them and get them delivered, and thank you very much hope you read our newsletter and congratulations to your amazing virtual community board.
Second, is the mayor: So that's another place to put focus as team who you know or just make sure that as a board or as a community, you tell them the same thing And then the third thing is Mayor said, open streets will be near parks.
I know you don't have a lot of heart, but that would be another place to say: We need the park open and we need the street open and they should work.
And I want the community, board, saheb, say I feel very strongly about the health, but I am sure that, as we sit here, today, the governor, who will decide what's essential and what's nine when it gets rolled out so on.
We've had I think four or five of them so far, all of them have had over 200 people, and we just want to get those word out to as many small businesses as we can to help as much as we can.
You can look to for additional help, whether your homeowner or tenant want resources for nonprofits, small businesses or freelancers are concerned about New, York's, seniors students or immigrant communities.
Okay, also I want to thank our elected officials for being on the front lines, distributing meals, checking in on our community and doing the hard work as we are dealing with this epidemic and this pandemic.
If there are others and I haven't seen you, but I want to thank those three members for doing an exceptional job of going out to the development and making sure that there's food being distributed to our seniors and our very vulnerable community.
Just saying that now so my question is they just started voting again at City Council for your lips and stuff, like that And I know that we were scheduled when of the crisis.
There is going to be a land use meeting, but the agenda would be on 70 Mulberry Street, as susan has mentioned before in terms of two bridges applications I think I'm, not sure if I want to put that on the May agenda.
