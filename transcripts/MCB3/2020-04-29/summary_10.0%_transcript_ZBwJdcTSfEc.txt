I also request that CB3, you know to indemnify all of the open streets projects making it far more equitable for block associations, lower- income and smaller groups to participate in this important community health, initiative.
We do not want to get into a situation like we were in last month where the electeds reports took over two and a half hours, so we are going to be starting, so we've organized them the best way we can and unfortunately things, change.
You know the past hour, we've been dealing with emails coming in from people asking for their time to change And if they're still on the talk to us, they're still going to talk to us, but we have asked East elected official to keep their report to ten minutes, and those ten minutes include the Q&A session.
I do want to say that imagine if we've been underfunded right now with all of the hospital workers and people that we need, the average return rate for the country is now 52 percent, but We have a lot of work to get our numbers.
They have gaps in their budget and if they do not get city and state funding, then they will have to start layoffs, which is going to be a terrible thing for our people.
The chair of the Oversight Committee I have a responsibility for the post office and, where they're going to run out of money, This summer, can you imagine how many people are getting their medicines by mail, communicating by mail?
They said they're only doing loans, over$ 100,000 and to call him you do not get to write the rules it's supposed to be eligible to everyone, but in this new round we funded or siphoned off or courted off, sixty billion for really small businesses, and this money will be distributed through credit unions.
Since there is this difficulty of accessing the relief in the various forms that it exists out there for the people who are really most in need, and then there is no movement yet on the legislation, even though I know it has been introduced, now, even at the federal level about rent suspension.
There are two people that one at an earlier time and one I appreciate the fact that you're trying to get through this meeting, quickly, I just wanted to thank Congressman Maloney first for her efforts in which I joined and attempting to really repeal the discriminatory and homophobic FDA gay men.
I want to thank them for all their work, including distributing meals using you, know, leveraging different parts of our districts like the management company at Stuy, Town Peter Cooper, which is owned by Blackstone they've, been donated.
I've been appointed to the revenue- raising committee for the state Senate We're, going to look at ideas to you know the governor's proposing 10 billion dollars worth of cuts in the absence of any aid from the feds.
Obviously, we have to tax the wealthiest, but you know we got to think of creative solutions like who's making money during this kind.
It is a very difficult problem, but I appreciate your comments, senator and our next and final questions coming from okay, Thank you for the for all the work up there, That I'll say the two one gave immunity: the hospital and nursing homes owners, not just the staff- There was some point to some of that, but essentially it's pretty hard to prove negligence as it is, and that really jeopardize the does, jeopardize future lawsuits etc and the other one allowed for commercial surrogacy.
We now require a whole host of protections for women who want to act as servants, including their own medical care, health, Insurance, Life, insurance, independent legal counsel, ensuring that they have counseling make sure that they have Every medical decision is made by themselves, including whether to carry a child through term or not so I believe we're raising the standard for surrogacy, because so many states in this country, and, frankly, the world, have no laws whatsoever.
You know where individuals who can prove that a loved one has been killed due to some negligence on the part of a physician or Hospital, can sue for beyond just the actual monetary damages, but pain and suffering, which has limited their recovery for so many people, particularly women people of color and people who are low income, because the estimate of your worth is based on how much you are able to earn according to a formula and if you're, a baby or if you're somebody who works in construction, they will limit.
It was done without watchdog groups and there was really no reason for it to happen at this point in time during a pandemic, so that that's my objection just on the on the face of it Here, but I would say in terms of the nursing home issues that really what we need are stronger standards and public health and Health Planning Council.
This would provide rooms who are homeless, New Yorkers, one of my bills, to mandate that we open streets to promote safe social distancing and then protecting New Yorkers small businesses, commercial tenant.
So it has been very challenging, but I think the first virtual stated when office as well as it could And I know that some of you have participated in some of the hearings that we've held transportation, general welfare.
And I think that those disparities have not only been brought to light in terms of what we already know that food housing, health care and education, which are basic human rights specially in this city, are not accessible to everyone, but that we also see that in the fatality numbers, which have been absolutely heartbreaking.
So in terms of the budget and how we're going to recover, we've been served about seven billion dollars in cuts from the mayor's office.
I could say that coming from a former small nonprofit and making sure that we're saving things like the Summer Youth Employment Program, when our pools are going to be closed, we do not know about what's going to happen in their parks in our beaches, and our young people need something to do.
Questions can only come from board members, so I know that there's a couple of people who are in the attendee list that have their hands: raised.
I know the mayor kind of did his big announcement and many people think that we might not go through with the bill, but until we see a real plan from the mayor, not just an allocation of how many miles are going to be determined by the NYPD We're going to keep going forward because we do want it to be community driven to work with the Business Improvement Districts to work with civic and block associations.
, we're kind of still figuring out the process to make sure that people do feel included, because you all know your communities best and that's what happens when you're kind of you know trying to operate in the midst of a pandemic.
My question is, who is going to talk to the workers, the workers, with just a variety of issues that, like I, said whenever I hear most officials talk and people from the hospital sector?
What we're not hearing is the actual people that are out there working and what this situation is like and what their concerns are, especially because rules have basically changed.
You know dozens of people die every night and, in addition to the teachers and the students and the families and everyone else who are in homes where there is domestic violence, there needs to be a mental health program.
Let me know what you hear: I'm, always interested I'm, always checking with workers, as well as people like a dr.
, Katz and I want to make sure that people feel safe when they're inside what we deem as one of the spaces in New York City, which is a hospital That's what I'm going to do tell them that they can contact you Because you'd, be surprised, I, think a lot of hospitals have policies that everybody has to sign off on about how they communicate outside of that hospital, and your hospital said that he does not have that.
We want to protect whistleblowers, they're, doing the right thing and letting people know of the conditions, and it is because of them that many of the terrible conditions that existed in some of our systems early on were eventually rectified.
I really want to focus on our senior population, because I know that my office has been getting a lot of calls from our seniors.
Go, you know from the school It's helpful, but they still got to work out a lot of the kinks.
One of the things that we want to focus on is that we want to make sure that, coming out of this crisis, that our Senior Center are kept home because they are so crucial in our community, because, right now they do not really have any part in it.
They are calling out senior doing wellness check, but I also want to make sure that they have the capacity going forward to really look at what the Senior Center should look like after this crisis.
It was not in the executive budget We also want to make sure that the money for the home deliver meal program, which is really the only program, does continue to service our homebound senior beautifully.
It did not happen in this 3.5 and has to happen in the next one, because otherwise, New York City the whole could be up to eight billion dollars and like we're going to lose a lot of the safety net program that we fought so hard for the other one.
Now they put in more money in this 3.5 and the Good News is that from the discussion with council, congresswoman Maloney, there's 60 billion dollars, set aside for women and minority- owned business, and also to allow smaller bank and credit union and Community Development Fund to help small businesses.
I'm, open to some questions , I just wanted to hear any thoughts you have about the devastation that has happened in New, York, City, nursing homes that you know as the governor and the and the industry blame each other.
Requirements demands asks for nursing homes going forward because I think there are media things which are being done, the best they can, but in the future it looks like there were things that could have would have gone better.
You, know skilled nursing facility because we're going to need a lot more that We have to take the lead on some of these issue.
You wanted to leave time, hey, we'll just close by saying that we heard from the governor's folks that they might entertain yet an extension on the moratorium of evictions, we're going to push for that And we're going to push them to allow us to use security deposits for rent , that's a way of actually getting money, not out of someone's pocket, but into the hands of some of the smaller landlords that really they too are struggling.
Listen to us because they, you know we're just state reps, but we're working with some individual senior centers that are still providing meals on their own and the city is struggling.
Food banks are doing a great job, even though they're very stressed, So I call the office Two one, two, six, seven, four, five one, five three: If there's a community center that is having a food distribution, trouble that we can work through with the city, but the it's.
Carney talked a lot about the city budget and you know the state budgets, impact.
Everyone hopefully, is able to recover through a lot from folks around prescription medication and we're trying to during the pandemic to live coverage for 120 days, so people are not freaked about getting their medication and small business issues are just you.
You hear people having concerns about getting unemployment, benefit officers they're, having daily conversations with the governor's office- Tomorrow night around, you know, with the young Invincibles or on Keeney SUNY issues, I'm.
Doing when they Creek around small businesses, I think we're all trying to catch as many people as we possibly can on these issues.
I think we are lucky to have such great colleagues on the east side with the assembly and send in the council I'm lucky to be able to be able to work with them, and if we think we can get something done, we can figure it out together early today, we, you know Yes, a or two days, ago, the governor's office dropped.
What we really need to do is go back to Albany The second thing is, and we've all been asking I've sent dollars to the governor's office now, probably a month, ago.
The loans from the federal government are not allowing us to do that right, now, not enough Even if we were pushing New York State to have a loan program as well for the governor.
You know we do not have money in New, York State I have a bill to allow commercial tenants to basically create like a scree tree type program for their small commercial businesses to say the landlord gives some portion of the rent that can be as a real estate production of real estate, taxes.
Just do not see it coming, because the governor is not really interested in moving that think over it at all, We've also asked the federal government to have funds I signed on with that I think probably 200, my colleagues to ask for federal money to pay the rent for those both residents on commercial businesses, Yeah, there's already a six month, backlog in SLA, so I do not think I would worry about them.
So, as Harvey noted about 200 of Us legislators and other government officials, as well as lots of advocates, have called for a hundred billion dollar national figure, with ten billion of it going for New York, and that was addressed to our compression on New York congressional delegation and our two senators, and some of them have responded favorably and have actually put in writing their desire to try to make sure that is funded in the next stimulus.
Oh just I, know that money has already been allocated through the cares act to the states, but I've heard that the governors are saying you know and a lot of senators also saying we can't actually use this money because of all those in place on it, including through the new Treasury guidelines.
You know ask the executive branch, through its discretion, to change the terms of some of these things, that we can also ask Congress to go back to the Drawing Board and modify these programs to the extent they're, not working as they seem to have been intended to be and again.
There, obviously also a lot of efforts to make sure unemployment and other programs are providing cash to people for various expenses, including housing.
And I want to make sure that where were actually addressing a lot of the community concerns that we have and the other thing I wanted to talk about really quickly.
We have to make sure that the state you know that the right barriers are put into place and that certain folks can really be able to I'm very worried personally about our small businesses, especially in Chinatown, because of some of the things that have been happening.
And I started to ask on the state level for help since then, since end of January, because I start coming, And I just I really fear that we're not providing the help that we need, None of my small businesses, have been able to apply and successfully get any of the resources that were promised and it's very hard to figure out what would be the best way for us to actually even access those things.
If a kind, bigger business is able to return their money, maybe it can come to us, but if that's not the way, I think it should work.
And I also want to talk about my rent, forgiveness, bill, rent forgiveness bill that a lot of folks are talking about people talk about as hashtag cancel, rent And I will make sure to leave some time for questions, but the bill itself is.
We, do not want to be waking up to a rude, awakening, Farzin nightlife, now being approved when the community has no input- I hear that so right now we know that there's been like folks who had applied before Co Vid We wrote a letter for sure we will have an SLA committee meeting report later on.
I know the city council pressured the mayor, And I think there's another example of what does the community board in your case, 4- 3?
Definitely you let us know: We've been working with Pratt Center They're, trying to figure out how to have an effective community advisory group.
I assume this projects going to go forward, but I want you to know that we've been working with them.
So we'd be working with the Community board and different stakeholders to do that without getting into lots of specifics.
They do not go for everywhere, they're not going to take care of all of Manhattan, but if you have some specific needs, please let Brian know because we will try to address them and get them delivered.
Obviously, we're constrained for space and the city has announced severe cuts to parks, and it seems a little odd because that's where people are going to go for recreation with pools being closed and we do not know what's going to happen with beaches in other areas, is there.
So, that's another place to put focus as team who you know or just make sure that as a board or as a community, you tell them the same thing.
We've had I think four or five of them so far, all of them have had over 200 people, and we just want to get those word out to as many small businesses as we can to help as much as we can.
You can look to for additional help, whether your homeowner or tenant want resources for nonprofits, small businesses or freelancers are concerned about New, York's, seniors students or immigrant communities.
Okay, also I want to thank our elected officials for being on the front lines, distributing meals, checking in on our community and doing the hard work as we are dealing with this epidemic and this pandemic.
But I want to thank those three members for doing an exceptional job of going out to the development and making sure that there's food being distributed to our seniors and our very vulnerable community.
We're, certainly going to want everybody to come community and the nonprofit's that are still in there.
