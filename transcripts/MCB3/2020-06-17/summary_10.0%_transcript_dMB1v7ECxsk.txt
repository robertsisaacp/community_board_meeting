Every year around this time, community pass three update, Is DNS as part of newer cities, budgeting process for its next physical year, which is 2020, and this year we aim to finalize the DNS in August instead of July due to Covid-19 And, we're going to also add puppet together with the Patrick priority in October.
So last night, I sent you guys some documents, but it's just some work still in developing and as the district I mean, I heard that from Susan multiple times before and DNS is just about The needs for our district Is, not a policy statement not about specific program.
Just simply identify the problem or the unmet need a lot of outside groups, and even city agencies will look at this document and use it as a resource, particularly community.
You, know, nonprofit, providers, CBO's and hospitals will look at it in terms of what the use of for you, know, designing, programming, requesting grant funding, helping as a resource to assess needs.
We will use this district means hopefully right to inform our budget priorities, which is the next point in the process, as Jackie mentioned.
There's not always a one- for, One correlation between a need and a budget priority, but you try will also be preparing questions to vidual agencies at meetings that happen between for leadership, the district office and those agencies in September, so I'm keeping a running list of those questions, and we can draw more questions for that.
I mean it was a lot of moving parts in the city with the budget, with tax revenue with programs and policy and with neighborhood need So we're, leaving that window open to flexible.
Next year, maybe organize that into the budget priority which is largely building and preserving affordable, housing.
When we were talking about the tenant organizations, it was not just for budget priorities, but also we thought to move it under preserving affordable housing, because it supports it, supports that need, and that's it.
If the need is affordable, housing to preserve, affordable housing and a specific program, that's not properly facilitating that we could ask that budget question later, but I think we should identify that the need is to preserve, affordable, housing.
That program we should in the budget priorities- If we think a program like an anti eviction program, might be very important, we still may not vote on it as a budget priority, because if it's already well funded, it does not need to get more money.
There was a question or something that Jackie brought up about the data points historically I'm behind on that work for a number of reasons, but It needs to be updated, which is not available yet, but we actually do have the updated ACS data I just have it updated every single line in the DMS, yet these will likely there will be things that shift a little bit, but you know the year- to, year.
You want a new code, nineteen's impact on the real estate market and construction industry, as well as anticipated city budget shortfalls, which is the development of new, affordable housing at risk, as does cuts in the federal funding to states and local municipalities.
Twenty coming from the federal government, there is a need for more deeply affordable housing in Cd3, but capital budgets for housing, particularly very low- income and supportive housing, are possibly at risk of significant cuts in the wake of in nineteen, and you can develop that you can edit that.
I do not know how we're going to ride in Jim, Olympia I think really important , I need to research it and get the and get the documentation, and if you have any Olympia, if you have any supporting and data or documents that you can share, that will be really helpful.
This is largely unedited from last year, but it's all about capital projects, and this is where I'm suggesting you maybe move that section that previously sat on its own about funding for CBO's that do local CBO's that do you know, tenant, advocacy, work, anti, Eviction work.
Do you say they they're endemic to the situation that we're leaving so That, of course, will provide it, but I think it is completely fair to describe it as in need to the extent that we know it's the way the system works in a distressed economic, situation.
That is not documented, yet what I still think the reason the sourcing is important is frankly, Because of the way the agencies and the city engages with the document and the way they work with everything you know, Other conversation about how community planning, works.
Oh, no sorry Just recommended that kind of reorganization from the bullet points with like policy needs to more of a of a reframing around a description of unmet, so that this next section you know, preserve the viability of HDFC buildings.
What I'm recommending you might want to do instead is say to ensure these buildings of these coops remain financially solvent and a safe source of affordable housing in Our district HDFC's need expanded support, services, expanded financial training, enhance and stronger resale restrictions, including sales price caps and long term tax, But I just wanted to present that change to the committee proposed change, which again is more of a formatting discussion, but I think it'll help the clarity of the document.
You kind of related to me at one point last year that there are some issues even for like the not- for- profit, housing providers, of reasons why you may even not want to participate in some of these programs.
The first thing right was There was a section: That's stood alone about expanding funding for the CBO's that do kind of various tenant protection and advocacy work, I'm, simply saying to kind of lump that and consolidate that with the preservation of affordable housing section the next thing I'm recommending removing is every year for the last three years, we've said ad C community district, three to the certificate of no harassment pilot program, whether it's going to be over by the time we're talking about next year's budget.
Well, so I wanted to add that what I also I pulled this budget priority questions, because I want more information from HPD about how the pilot is working.
I mean they have not given us a ton of data, and we do not know what we asked for in past years, but I think we need to follow up a little bit on the efficacy of this program.
You know that's what we're going to ask budget consultations: It's just a good place to just kind of explain, we're going to have any program that we think needs more funding in October, we're going to vote on those priorities which programs there'll be 25 for the board.
You know coming from council discretionary funds Is important, and you might want to consider like, as a budget priority to you.
You know these are things we can figure out closer to budget priorities in October, and This is actually a very good transition into the other one I'm recommending removing from last year, which was this need to adequately fund city agencies to address housing code.
I think it helps make it more about needs and less about program and policy, and you know that's where it stands.
