Programming requesting grant funding, helping as a resource to assess needs, We will use this district means hopefully right to inform our budget priorities, which is the next point in the process, as Jackie mentioned, there's not always a one-for-one correlation between a need and a budget priority, but you try will also be preparing questions to vidual agencies at meetings that happen between for leadership, the district office and those agencies in September, so I'm keeping a running list of those questions, and we can draw more questions for that process.
We want to focus on unmet needs and I want to say when we were talking about the tenant organizations, it wasn't just for budget priorities, but also we thought to move it under preserving affordable housing because it supports it, supports that need One thing you said, I, didn't understand it may I ask it.
We could ask that budget question later, but I think we should identify that the need is to preserve, affordable housing That makes sense, rather than like this program, that program we should in the budget priorities- If we think a program like an anti eviction program, might be very important.
So last year in September, I went to the HPD and Department of Building budget consultations and district office already maintained a list of the questions they have for these two agencies, and sometimes in last year, I also add my few of my own questions to ask them specifically asking about certain programs.
I think we can update that whenever they update their data they get around to it, but otherwise I think we articulate the same thing : It's, really, that's really something for the Health and Human Services section, but I think it goes without saying it's a crisis in our district It's connected to access to housing, so I just thought it was appropriate to add in a sentence about that Every year we talk about how we have to have our affordable housing targeted at affordability, levels that are more appropriate for an actual neighborhood residents, we're keeping that I'm I'm reading off my own car I'm a bit basically the end of that first paragraph right after the bullet pool and after we listen well nah right What we're thinking school down a little bit and go to this coded nineteen section!
Nineteen on your committee, sort of serve jurisdiction, I'll read through this You want a new code, nineteen's impact on the real estate market and construction industry, as well as anticipated city budget shortfalls, which is the development of new, affordable housing at risk, as does cuts in the federal funding to states and local municipalities.
Twenty coming from the federal government, there is a need for more deeply affordable housing in cd3, but capital budgets for housing, particularly very low-income and supportive housing, are possibly at risk of significant cuts in the wake of in nineteen, and you can develop that you can edit that We want to throw something out there to start the conversation about how you know.
This is largely unedited from last year, but it's all about capital projects, and this is where I'm suggesting you maybe move that section that previously sat on its own about funding for CBO's that do local CBO's that do you know, tenant advocacy, work, anti-eviction work, you can kind of plug it into this section in a sentence or two and that's part of the preserving affordable housing.
It's all unknown and a lot of this may be will be things that work What I still think the reason the sourcing is important is frankly, because of the way the agencies and the city engages with the document and the way they work with everything you know, Other conversation about how community planning works , What I would say is if this continues to be something that people are concerned about Is there data about how this unfolded with the last fiscal crisis?.
Because of these problems, Instead is say to ensure these buildings of these coops remain financially solvent and a safe source of affordable housing in our district HDFC's need expanded support services, expanded financial training, enhance and stronger resale restrictions, including sales price caps and long term tax, but I just wanted to present that change to the committee proposed change, which again is more of a formatting discussion, but I think it'll help the clarity of the document Okay so expand and support for residential resiliency upgrades.
Dms that you sent does the PDF I have never been able to open I, don't know really, and it's also on a website The first thing right was There was a section: That's stood alone about expanding funding for the CBO's that do kind of various tenant protection and advocacy work, I'm, simply saying to kind of lump that and consolidate that with the preservation of affordable housing section the next thing I'm recommending removing is every year for the last three years, we've said ad C community district, three to the certificate of no harassment pilot program, whether it's gonna be over by the time we're talking about next year's budget right The mayor's office, never responded positively.
I mean they have not given us a ton of data, and we don't know what we asked for in past years, but I think we need to follow up a little bit on the efficacy of this program.
A lot of a lot of this money is important and you might want to consider like, as a budget priority to you, know, move this over to a city, budget line and baseline You know these are things we can figure out closer to budget priorities in October, and so this is actually a very good transition into the other one I'm recommending removing from last year, which was this need to adequately fund city agencies to address housing code violations.
One thing that I just realized is and again I, don't know, because this is going to be for july 2021, but one of the issues is the right to counsel program and basically, the need for more support for tenants, I, not saying that we want them to expedite it, because people are evicted like our evictions are way down, go out and Furman Center We asked for more money for like very various iterations of right to counsel or for funding directly to CBO's, for this type of advocacy, and what we hear back at the budget consultations is that they're pumping a ton of money into these programs There is funding for these programs and I.
