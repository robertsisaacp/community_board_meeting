Just simply identify the problem or the unmet need a lot of outside groups, and even city agencies will look at this document and use it as a resource, particularly community.
You, know, nonprofit, providers, CBO's and hospitals will look at it in terms of what the use of for you, know, designing, programming, requesting grant funding, helping as a resource to assess needs.
We will use this district means, hopefully right to inform our budget priorities, which is the next point in the process, as Jackie mentioned, there's not always a one-for-one correlation between a need and a budget priority, but you try will also be preparing questions to vidual agencies at meetings that happen between.
I mean it was a lot of moving parts in the city with the budget, with tax revenue with programs and policy and with neighborhood need So we're, leaving that window open to flexible.
Next year, maybe organize that into the budget priority which is largely building and preserving affordable, housing.
We want to focus on unmet needs and I want to say when we were talking about the tenant organizations, it wasn't just for budget priorities, but also we thought to move it under preserving affordable housing, because it supports it, supports that need One thing you said, I, didn't understand, it may I, ask it.
If the need is affordable, housing to preserve, affordable housing and a specific program, that's not properly facilitating that we could ask that budget question later, but I think we should identify that the need is to preserve, affordable, housing.
That program we should in the budget priorities- If we think a program like an anti eviction program might be very important, we still may not vote on it as a budget priority, because if it's already well funded, it doesn't need to get more money.
So last year in September, I went to the HPD and Department of Building budget consultations and district office already maintained a list of the questions they have for these two agencies, and sometimes in last year.
You want a new code, nineteen's impact on the real estate market and construction industry, as well as anticipated city budget shortfalls, which is the development of new, affordable housing at risk, as does cuts in the federal funding to states and local municipalities.
Twenty coming from the federal government, there is a need for more deeply affordable housing in cd3, but capital budgets for housing, particularly very low-income and supportive housing, are possibly at risk of significant cuts in the wake of in nineteen, and you can develop that you can edit that.
This is largely unedited from last year, but it's all about capital projects, and this is where I'm suggesting you maybe move that section that previously sat on its own about funding for CBO's that do local CBO's that do you know, tenant, advocacy, work, anti-eviction work.
It's all unknown, and a lot of this may be, will be things that work, What I still think the reason the sourcing is important is frankly, Because of the way the agencies and the city engages with the document and the way they work with everything you know, Other conversation about how community planning, works.
No sorry Just recommended that kind of reorganization from the bullet points with like policy needs to more of a of a reframing around a description of unmet, so that this next section you know, preserve the viability of HDFC buildings.
Instead is say to ensure these buildings of these coops remain financially solvent and a safe source of affordable housing in Our district HDFC's need expanded support, services, expanded financial training, enhance and stronger resale restrictions, including sales price caps and long term tax, But I just wanted to present that change to the committee proposed change, which again is more of a formatting discussion, but I think it'll help the clarity of the document.
You kind of related to me at one point last year that there are some issues even for, like the not-for-profit housing providers of reasons why you may even not want to participate in some of these programs.
The first thing right was There was a section: That's stood alone, about expanding funding for the CBO's that do kind of various tenant protection and advocacy work, I'm, simply saying to kind of lump that and consolidate that with the preservation of affordable housing section the next thing I'm recommending removing is every year for the last three years, we've said ad C community district, three to the certificate of no harassment pilot program, whether it's gonna be over by the time we're talking about next year's budget, right.
Right, I mean they have not given us a ton of data, and we don't know what we asked for in past years, but I think we need to follow up a little bit on the efficacy of this program.
To you know, capital budget line items for affordable housing, construction.
You know, that's what we're gonna ask budget consultations : We're gonna have any program that we think needs more funding in October.
You know coming from council discretionary funds Is important, and you might want to consider like, as a budget priority to you.
You know these are things we can figure out closer to budget priorities in October, and This is actually a very good transition into the other one I'm recommending removing from last year, which was this need to adequately fund city agencies to address housing code.
Let's know whether we need more inspectors or not We asked I think every year, the budget consultation.
I think it helps make it more about needs and less about program and policy, and you know that's where it stands.
