The cameras live, We, understand, anyone's home and his issues, and we have pets and children and family, but we should be able to get to this fairly quickly Taking notes for this meeting, our first parks and waterfront meeting some members of the public we're going to use the raise hand, feature to ask questions, and that will happen after the community board.
Everybody knows where it's located in Arkansas, the northern edge of the drive through the budget is 6 million from the mayor's office, and the project is roughly 2,300 square feet next slide, please I'm sorry, so the goals of the project are to upgrade the existing restrooms to bring them up to Toronto such great parks, maintenance of operation, space at the first day left card, locker room spaces to the building reconstructing interiors, which in this case, are for back and space to clean and partially report the exterior brick to do new windows and door as required and utilities, including an oil to gas conversion.
You'll also notice that in the western wing of the building, the half room space is now for open space, which is sort of a larger sort of open, muster space that allows for parts of staff, You, know and other people to come in and to essentially muster in the morning and to have meetings as required to maintain the property and its rightful place.
One slide, please so we're able to recapture some of that circulation space and that's going to be important for us, because, as we get further into the presentation, you'll see how we modify and the fencing on the eastern edge of the building to allow for more circulation So we wanted to make sure that we were so reestablishing that the circulation corridor back here we can move forward one slide, so this is kind of a larger version of the plan.
We have the men's room with the door on the western edge of the building and we're allowing the main entry that used to go into that empty vestibule space to become a usable space for lockers for the M&O staff at opera, Out of this facility, the boys room in the back you'll notice, we've eliminated the stair when we captured that space as a janitor's closet You look at the office space and the M&O wall storage area.
The tree will remain, but that yard now is increasing slightly to the east, but it's decreasing from the north So we're reestablishing the circulation corridor behind the building and the pool which is just north portions Fencing will remain the same, and the tourist set up every season of setting a table up there for security will be done in the same way in future The elevation you're looking at the top is an elevation of that chain-linked fence, enclosure area, you'll notice that the chain-link is there and it's almost of the four-foot steel fence, which I mentioned all of that's being removed and it'll, be replaced by a single 7-foot standard steel fence painted black to match the rest of the park.
Okay again this we will mirror the wing to the right, with the obvious differences that here we have three windows in the in the office area of the building, whereas previous climbing so one window and those against our to match the existing condition of the building next slide, please It will remain in the new design.
The project Well first of all, I want to say that I think, as you can see, from the presentation, Jorge and his team have put a lot of thought and care into this project and a book and have considered every single detail, but number one I'm, pretty sure that the renovation of this building has been a long-standing community board 3 a budget priority I want to be able to get a substantial amount of funding in order to do it.
Department employees will have better working conditions, and a third point I want to make is that it is that this design allows for much better use of the space that's available in the building and by moving the mechanical room and giving us space for a first aid room and the locker rooms.
Underneath that it'll say raise your hand, but if you can't do any of those, we don't have a large committee and I see if it's an opportunity here, a lost opportunity to have some kind of indoor public space for community usage, for you know any parks, programming that might happen or and or any possible for the Friends of the park now or the concern any Conservancy that might come to the future, and so given that I want to know why we need four bathrooms and can't we just again go for a gender-neutral, bathroom We could eliminate two of these rooms and create a public indoor public space that the community can use for events, question for you more than for me, okay, very good, well, I'm, just an interesting question and That who frequent the park.
Let's say: I mean these are both important points, Was, that a request then from the community Steve Is that something that the community put forth and because I know, there's also been a lot of talk in with all these Park buildings and in normal locations in our in three that there's no community space available indoors.
Who will utilize that area of the park concept out there that many public institutions are putting forth and I'm putting that out there again when we're thinking about the future use and user of our public spaces when I ran after school in summer, camp We actually appreciated the fact that there was a separate inside bathroom for the children to utilize when they, you know when they went to the sprinklers and the swimming pool area, to say to Robin and I do understand what you mean about having genders fest non gender specified restrooms, but I think that would be an additional bathroom for that particular part, because that park is a haven for people that are transient and people that utilize different areas of the park like the dog, walkers and so forth, and so on.
Please look at your planning when it comes to public restrooms, First of all I guess you know we have rooms which is a it was create hiding places for the drug addicts that you're talking about Caroline Thinking about you, know, toilets versus a room for men and a room for women If we can get a couple questions from those who are also on soon, but not community board members, the budget, what's the situation with the funding here, I know this was a budget priority for CD three, for quite some time and also from our council member The project is fully funded and you know, God knows what's going to happen in the future, were with the Cova da 19 a situation, but we have every expectation that dis funding, since this project is a fully advanced and frankly, and so we have every expectation that this funding will remain in the budget and we'll be able to do this project and the proposed schedule.
Based on the comments and the notes have taken to form some sort of resolution based on bullet points and we go over Robin mentioned- is an existing restaurant to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at a first date, lifeguard locker room spaces in the building reconstruct the interiors to clean, partially repoint, exterior brick, new windows and doors, and these include a gas conversion also I mentioned this-.
If I may, you may also that we're providing a da accessibility and I'm, trying to figure out a way to incorporate some of Robins concerns, including that parks consider to use some of this space for to a lot some of the space for community use or for community programming, and is that I will look into the possibility of using the lifeguard locker room for some community space.
Whereas is okay, I'm gonna figure out a way to rephrase it, but I think that's important and we're gonna put and, as Steve has mentioned, to repurpose the lifeguard locker room into the community space I see whether or not it can be a shared use during the outside the summer shared use space in the offseason very good, yes, new space Robin has her hand up as well.
Well, it's a step that I'm not yet prepared to take so I will go back and talk to people and talk to Jorge as to what the feasibility is of doing something like that We need to also consider the fact that many of the community members who use it and have family or children in the area really appreciate the fact to do this.
There are people who use the park other than and committee members on, I think you know do all fit could be used for more than one purpose.
