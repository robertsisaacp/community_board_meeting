Just to let us know who you are so that we can know if it's a board member or a community member Jamel Phillips, a district three manager for parks , Everyone I, think so we're just going to ask everyone to keep themselves muted until it's your time to talk so that we can decrease on the amount of background noise and again just a reminder.
Taking notes for this meeting, our first parks and waterfront meeting some members of the public we're going to use the raise hand, feature to ask questions, and that will happen after the community board.
Everybody knows where it's located in Arkansas, the northern edge of the drive through the budget is 6 million from the mayor's office, and the project is roughly 2,300 square feet.
The goals of the project are to upgrade the existing restrooms to bring them up to Toronto such great parks, maintenance of operation, space at the first day left card, locker room spaces to the building reconstructing interiors, which, in this case, are for back and space to clean and partially report.
You notice on this plan, the new men's entrance on the left to the furthest western edge of the building and the new women's entries on the right is the furthest eastern end of the eastern wing of the building.
You flip back the slide one more time, you'll notice that the current configuration show is the man's edge it's tucked in next to the office space and the women's actions based on the eastern wing.
You, know and other people to come in and to essentially muster in the morning and to have meetings as required to maintain the property and its rightful place.
This configuration may or may not change slightly, depending on whether we can get away with just using one handrail per day as it were, but the distance is ability, but essentially that's the major change here that wrapping their back now One slide, you'll see here that the area between the ramp blow to Memorial is actually quite tight, and so we didn't really feel that was an appropriate use of space.
One slide, please so we're able to recapture some of that circulation space And that's going to be important for us, because, as we get further into the presentation, you'll see how we modify and the fencing on the eastern edge of the building to allow for more circulation.
Whilst when we start to discuss some of those changes to the fenced in area, east of the building, which is quite an eyesore, has always been something we wanted to address.
Will be the main entrance to the women's room and you'll notice that a window will replace the existing door on the left side of that bay, and then that will be a window that flexible or lockers face for the lifeguards.
Okay, again this we will mirror the wing to the right with the obvious differences that here we have three windows in the in the office area of the building, whereas previous climbing, so one window and those against our to match the existing condition of the building.
This shows that the current, a great tile condition in that niche will be replaced and the louver will be removed, and we will introduce new anti graffiti tile here as well to match the current tile as best we can and to give us maximum ability to maintain that niche, which is a very attractive for feeding target for you, know, The seven-foot steel fence is in place and by the way we haven't mentioned the fact that all of the sheds that were back there had been removed.
Department employees will have better working conditions, and a third point I want to make is that it is that this design allows for much better use of the space that's available in the building and by moving the mechanical room and giving us space for a first aid room and the locker rooms for the lifeguards.
And I see if it's an opportunity, here, a lost opportunity to have some kind of indoor public space for community usage, for you know any parks, programming that might happen or and or any possible for the Friends of the park now or the concern any Conservancy that might come to the future, and so given that I want to know why we need four bathrooms and can't we just again go for a gender-neutral, bathroom.
We could eliminate two of these rooms and create a public indoor public space that the community can use for events, question for you more than for me: , well, I'm, just an interesting question and That who frequent the park.
Was, that a request then from the community, Steve Is that something that the community put forth and because I know, there's also been a lot of talk in with all these Park buildings and in normal locations in our in three that there's no community space available indoors in any of these parks?
We actually appreciated the fact that there was a separate inside bathroom for the children to utilize when they, you know when they went to the sprinklers and the swimming pool area, to say to Robin And I do understand what you mean about having genders fest non gender specified restrooms, but I think that would be an additional bathroom for that particular part, because that park is a haven for people that are transient and people that utilize different areas of the park like the dog, walkers and so forth, and so on.
I. Think that one of the reasons why Tompkins Square has maintained that specific area for the children, with the sprinkler and with the separate bathrooms, has a lot to do with that.
Look at your planning when it comes to public restrooms, First of all, I guess you know we have rooms, which is a it, was create hiding places for the drug addicts that you're talking about Caroline Thinking about you, know, toilets versus a room for men and A room for women I'm, just gonna ask some quick questions before we see if we can get a couple questions from those who are also on soon, but not community board members, the budget What's the situation with the funding here , I know this was a budget priority for CD three for quite some time, and also from our council member.
Robin mentioned- is an existing restaurant to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at a first date, lifeguard locker room spaces in the building, reconstruct the interiors to clean, partially repoint, exterior brick, new windows and doors, and these include a gas conversion.
If I may you may also that we're providing a da accessibility And I'm, trying to figure out a way to incorporate some of Robins concerns, including that parks consider to use some of this space for to a lot some of the space for community use or for community programming, and Is. That I will look into the possibility of using the lifeguard locker room for some community space.
We need to also consider the fact that many of the community members who use it and have family or children in the area really appreciate the fact to do.
It's, understood, Ryan I just wanted to add so we're putting in that the lifeguard locker room area could possibly be used.
There are people who use the park other than and committee members on.
You need to read: Okay, upgrade existing restrooms to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at first aid and now I know.
We need to change that language, but as first aid, Locker lifeguard locker room spaces in the building.
Think, one of the points, though, with the lifeguard, is the fact that you have staff that can utilize the equipment in the first-aid room.
Most of them were put into the non-essential category, and that's why construction has been suspended are those that were already underway so when I get back to the office in which I hope to do in the next couple of days Last week there was probably like 25 guys in there working out together, and none of them were practicing social, distancing and It's parks planning on communicating what the new timelines are on projects that were small to your first question.
