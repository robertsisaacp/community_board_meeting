Ryan are you on wine Believe you know, I'm, just trying to get hurt Just to let us know who you are so that we can know if it's a board member or a community member Jamel Phillips, a district three manager for parks , Everyone I, think so we're just going to ask everyone to keep themselves muted until it's your time to talk so that we can decrease on the amount of background noise and again just a reminder.
Taking notes for this meeting, our first parks and waterfront meeting some members of the public we're going to use the raise hand, feature to ask questions, and that will happen after the community.
So the goals of the project are to upgrade the existing restrooms to bring them up to Toronto such great parks, maintenance of operation, space at the first day left card, locker room spaces to the building reconstructing interiors, which, in this case, are for back and space to clean and partially report the exterior brick to do new windows and door as required and utilities, including an oil to gas conversion.
Some of the proposed work we'll be putting some existing antenna will be remaining we'll, be putting some penetrations for new events as required to achieve the reconfiguration inside This will be a they switchback ramp to allow for the full ad, a compliant slope requirements and for the intermediate landings please.
If, you notice, on this plan, the new men's entrance on the left to the furthest, western edge of the building and the new women's entries on the right is the furthest eastern end of the eastern wing of the building.
You flip back the slide one more time, you'll notice that the current configuration show is the man's edge it's tucked in next to the office space and the women's actions based on the eastern wing.
You'll also notice that in the western wing of the building, the half room space is now for open space, which is sort of a larger sort of open, muster space that allows for parts of staff.
You, know and other people to come in and to essentially muster in the morning and to have meetings as required to maintain the property and its rightful place.
You'll notice, the same assisters space on the East Wing again is the first aid station and the rural office space and the down stair to the mechanical room in the basement.
One slide, you'll see here that the area between the ramp blow to Memorial is actually quite tight, and so we did not really feel that was an appropriate use of space.
So we're able to recapture some of that circulation space And, that's going to be important for us, because, as we get further into the presentation, you'll see how we modify and the fencing on the eastern edge of the building to allow for more circulation, and so we wanted to make sure that we were so reestablishing that the circulation corridor back here we can move forward.
This is a slide whilst when we start to discuss some of those changes to the fenced in area, east of the building, which is quite an eyesore, has always been something we wanted to address.
That door will be the main entrance to the women's room and you'll notice that a window will replace the existing door on the left side of that bay, and then that will be a window that flexible or lockers face for the lifeguards.
Okay, again this we will mirror the wing to the right with the obvious differences that here we have three windows in the in the office area of the building, whereas previous climbing.
It'll match the new doors going into the other areas of the building, as will the entry to the girls room immediately to the left.
So it will be secured from public for temporary Also notice that to provide some cooling of the building, we are putting some outdoor condenser units in that's worth yard, as we're calling it The. Lower elevation shows that we doors both inside the loggia and at the boys room to replace the existing doors there.
The second point I want to make is that obviously, this project provides a dual benefit to the public, which will have a much more pleasant to surrounding and better conditions in the bathrooms and to the Parks.
Department employees will have better working conditions, and a third point I want to make is that it is that this design allows for much better use of the space that's available in the building and by moving the mechanical room and giving Us space for a first aid room and the locker rooms for the lifeguards.
Could eliminate two of these rooms and create a public indoor public space that the community can use for events, question for you more than for me: okay, very good, well, I'm, just an interesting question and Come into a separate bathroom and not be not get mixed in with others.
Was that a request then from the community Steve Is that something that the community put forth and because I know, there's also been a lot of talk in with all these Park buildings and in normal locations in our in three that there's no community space available indoors in any of these parks?
We actually appreciated the fact that there was a separate inside bathroom for the children to utilize when they you know when they went to the sprinklers and the swimming pool area, to say to Robin.
And I do understand what you mean about having genders fest non gender specified restrooms, but I think that would be an additional bathroom for that particular part, because that park is a haven for people that are transient and people that utilize different areas of the park like the dog, walkers and so forth, and so on.
I think that one of the reasons why Tompkins Square has maintained that specific area for the children, with the sprinkler and with the separate bathrooms, has a lot to do with that.
So I'm not arguing about against the need that everyone is saying about boys, room for kids and the daycares, but again I'm going back to parks to say you know.
Just going to ask some quick questions before we see if we can get a couple questions from those who are also on soon, but not Community, board members, the budget And I know that's a big question for a lot of city, projects.
Robin mentioned- is an existing restaurant to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at a first date, Lifeguard Locker room spaces in the building, reconstruct the interiors to clean, partially Repoint, Exterior, brick, new windows and doors, and these include a gas conversion.
And I'm, trying to figure out a way to incorporate some of Robins concerns, including that parks consider to use some of this space for to a lot some of the space for community use or for community programming, and Is. That I will look into the possibility of using the Lifeguard Locker room for some community.
First I, think one of the things I did not hear was that people or parents and daycare centers like the idea of children's restrooms in terms of one of the, whereas is I I think where that should be one of the I'm, going to figure out a way to rephrase it, but I think that's important.
And we're going to put and as Steve has mentioned, to repurpose the Lifeguard Locker room into the community.
We need to also consider the fact that many of the community members who use it and have family or children in the area really appreciate the fact to do.
Well, I'm, foreseeing that there's going to be stuff in the first- aid room, which is which we probably do not want to expose or have open to the public at any time.
There are a lot of schools as been mentioned, that use it of the schools all have their own space You know, as far as the people that actually use the playground.
You need to read: Okay, upgrade existing restrooms to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at first aid and now I know.
We need to change that language, but as first aid, Locker Lifeguard locker room spaces in the building.
Priority Steve, you told me something: I forgot where I wrote it a DA, accessibility and said I can't read my own handwriting 88 accessibility, Brian Gillis did I leave out anything other than our parks, we'll take a look at the possibility of using between Life Guard Locker room, dual purpose area during the offseason, and it will involve getting some community input.
Yeah I was just going to say that I think what they said was that the lifeguard we use that space, because what I thought about I was thinking that, in terms of staff.
