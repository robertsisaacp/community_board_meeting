My bottom line concern is that I think that there are significant issues in this letter that the land use committee would want to talk.
And, it seems to me from I- did, have an opportunity to talk to jackie a little bit about it, and he explained to me that the issue is with regard to the expiration of the article 78 correct that we're not going to be a part of anyway, and I'm not- , don't see the relationship of this letter to the report that george james sent, which talks about two alternatives about whether or not we want to compromise or whether or not.
Other scenario that is posed calls for changing the height and getting rid of the 50 of affordable housing, and that will be a very long discussion because we are straying far from what we originally started: with, which basically comes from the chinatown working group plan and what the board voted.
Then we would stray, and that require a serious conversation because we're going far away from the whole issue of 50, affordable, housing, 350, foot, height limits and Let me just say that there are parts of this letter that I don't know that I ever agreed to like admitting that we like a tower in the park design for this neighborhood over a contextual building.
I understand if you're saying that we should think about that vote, that we have that the community board supported that's a whole different story, but we voted to support this rezoning and I am saying that, But every step of the way when we had to sign a letter.
We weren't, going to discuss anything unless it needed a vote or it was a land use, issue.
We've lost our right to sue, because tomorrow is the deadline, so we could if this goes to land use and if we at the end of the month, it goes online news and it goes to full board.
Everyone said about that and, as I know, some members were hesitant about it and some members growing up the whole each village issue, but the board voted to support this via resulting application and that's where we are today.
In long discussions and land use, He's also drafted this letter and we're not going any further than that at that.
At least I'm raising the issue that, if god finished the issue, that if we do not support this or the letter or the, then we were We voted for community board three to be a co-applicant.
Well, see I, don't know if a executive committee members recall last exact or the exact before the last one I mentioned at the committee report- that we had a brief conversation with the co-applicants that we're gonna do a presentation in the august land news meeting and that had been has been my plan.
First The committee members would want to know because they spend a lot of time in the last two years on this project as well.
Yes, and there are things that have happened and we haven't been able to discuss the vote and that's the reason why I wanted to bring it to exact.
But here we are talking about august and this thing is moving There's the you got to go to the committee, then you got to go to full board, but there are timing issues that we're running into, and this is one of them.
Unless people have comments, if that's the consensus, then that's fine, but I really take some concern about about the context of the letter which was written by george james and the fact that we people- I, don't know people forgetting what we originally supported, but I think that needs to be explained jackie, because what I'm hearing right now is people forgetting what the board supported.
The city planning's position is that it's they're still considering it right and that we can use our political and every other methodology we can think of to continue to work with them to get them to honor this, including what george james mentioned in his letter, which was calling on carl weisbord's position that they have to move ahead on a project even if they have substantive differences.
Why can't this letter go to land use in august, although obviously it would be preferable to go in July, but we can't do that because the agenda's already set, I, mean basically, is all It's all you're looking for tonight or is all the co-applicants looking for tonight is just is assurance that cb3 is still behind this project.
I'm just raising the issue, because we're not going to meet until august and even if the land use does decide, it's still got to go to full board.
Why I'm bringing this up and the timing issue, so I mean I, haven't heard anyone say that they're, not supportive of the project anymore, I, would say: again, I'm completely unprepared, because I wasn't prepared to chair tonight, but I would suggest that maybe if the letter is going to be redrafted anyway or edited well miner, can we maybe insert a paragraph into here that says something about the fact that you know that, due to the you know, due to pandemic and timelines and whatnot, and that the land use committee of the community board wasn't able to fully discuss these things.
The community board's executive committee is still in support or something like that to a certain extent, but that doesn't necessarily stop or absolve us of certain deadlines.
The reason why I said exact, because there's nothing else that would allow us to discuss this and bring it up before the end of august You know if we are able to add some language into this letter.
You know the fact that the community board hasn't really had a full amount of time to send this to committee, given the way that we work and given the pandemic, but that we are still in support of the project moving forward and that potentially those edits can be made relatively soon and that maybe we can revisit this letter at our second exec meeting in two weeks, but then.
Unless the community board signs it, what difference would that make because then it becomes a letter with three other, the three other co-applicants.
I, don't feel comfortable signing this letter without it going to land, you, As may said, it's complicated, it's something that language has the expertise to review We want a general letter that says community board 3 continues to support the project.
No, I, understand I'm, looking at what I'm trying to understand what you're saying about, if community board, if there was a simple letter, not something like this just attached to the to the memo itself, that would be fine, I'm, saying not with bullet points.
Just, saying community board three continues to support the application, for you know for the rwc, dcs or whatever you want to refer to it, and that we have taken no position to otherwise change because of this.
But if you're saying all we need is an indication of our support, we send that procedure-wise You know this letter is attached to the actual draft of the rwcds which michael had on the screen.
This is saying that we don't need to send a supportive letter.
I looked at the letter, I do agree that some things that are in the letter should be discussed a little further and taken to like up at the committee meeting.
If it has too much opinion, then that's another thing, but if we're going to send in the rwcd rwcds, but I think what it is trevor is that a lot of the conversation that has been generated was stuff that wasn't discussed at committee.
I saw that there were a couple of letters in support, but one was very vague and the other one seemed to come from the head of a building like look at that also so just that it was addressed with the residents, which is what we've always asked of them: anyway.
If you're, if the community board is supportive of it, you know we'll definitely open up conversations.
If you need any support you let me know whatever that looks like you.
Let me check, but I did want to say that now that all the presentations are online, also, I send a message out to all of the board with links to the presentations and links to the two videos from the trainings, because that would you know be good for people to watch in their spare time as they're sitting at home.
And I'm, already working very closely with the chairs, and I appreciate that I think the kinds of things alicia mentioned like watching the timeline which I shouldn't be doing anyway So last month, I was not at the meeting, but I watched a little bit of it, and I saw a report that I had submitted to the sla a blanket waiver letter with businesses supplied by the bid and nobody on the on the exact set.
Let me know because the other community boards are going to start to generate the conversation and they're forming a task force in which we've all been well.
