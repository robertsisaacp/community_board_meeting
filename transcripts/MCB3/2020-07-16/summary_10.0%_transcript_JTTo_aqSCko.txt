Is the out the letter that we're preparing to send out and traffic Can you explain to the committee right there's a couple of things: if we do not sign this letter, if we decide not to pursue it, it's over It moves no further, and if that is the case, then we lose the other option which the community board would not be a part of, and that is to sue dcp.
I guess my bottom line concern is that I think that there are significant issues in this letter that the land use committee would want to talk about and I'm very worried since our board has been held accountable of late about transparency of taking this out of the hands of the land use committee, without a clear understanding of why there's an urgency- and I don't see the relationship of this letter to the report that george james sent, which talks about two alternatives about whether or not we want to compromise or whether or not We are standing directly about this project, as originally submitted and I.
Think Normally I would encourage the bottom line to me is, as I see this letter, there are only two signatories on it: One is cb3 and one is the attorney for all of the other co-applicants, so I understand your point lisa, and we had a discussion on the phone about that all the co-applicants would, but if the community board did not sign, it would raise a red flag to city planning that they are not a part of the application.
I understand if you're saying that we should think about that vote, that we have that the community board supported that's a whole different story, but we voted to support this rezoning and I am saying that, but every step of the way when we had to sign a letter, the land use committee reviewed it and if we didn't have Covid-19, we didn't have a pandemic, and then we had have the issue of not meeting about this, because the first two meetings we had for land use We weren't, going to discuss anything unless it needed a vote or it was a land use.
Is that if you look at the days, so if tomorrow is the deadline, you can file article 78 and you are sending this letter out to dcp But let's say a month from now lisa's argument that this letter somehow strays from our original support of the two bridges rezoning We can't sue.
At least I'm raising the issue that, if god finished the issue, that if we do not support this or the letter or the, then we were We voted for community board three to be a co-applicant It would have to be on the agenda for next month.
We still have the lent two bridges on the agenda, like we've had for every month or was taken off, Well see, I, don't know if a executive committee members recall last exact or the exact before the last one I mentioned at the committee report- that we had a brief conversation with the co-applicants that we're gonna do a presentation in the august land news meeting and that had been has been my plan.
That's why I wanted to bring it to exact, because now we're not looking at reviewing anything about two bridges until august Yes, and there are things that have happened and we haven't been able to discuss the vote and that's the reason why I wanted to bring it to exact I, hear the concerns about being transparent because there's been some issues in you know about cb3's transparency, but here we are talking about august and this thing is moving and I understand, with cb3 being a co-applicant, there's the you got to go to the committee, then you got to go to full board, but there are timing issues that we're running into, and this is one of them unless people have comments, if that's the consensus, then that's fine, but I really take some concern about about the context of the letter which was written by george james and the fact that we people- I, don't know people forgetting what we originally supported, but I think that needs to be explained jackie, because what I'm hearing right now is people forgetting what the board supported.
That's the first thing: I shared So. There is an argument based on what we believe city planning should do, and that is that their position is to move applications along as long as they're complete, as opposed to giving an opinion on before they actually vote on it That would have to be honestly an article 78 argument, as opposed to in a memo like we're about in a letter like this, the one that's shown on the screen two different issues, so there is there is something visited city planning that basically says that this article, this rezoning proposal is not, is incomplete and cannot move forward, and this is the response to that.
So we're really looking at almost a september letter and we're not being timely on this, because just the way of the cove, but also just because of the way cb3 works, which is that we understood that coming into this with cb3 as an application, I mean I haven't heard anyone say that they're, not supportive of the project anymore I, would say again I'm completely unprepared, because I wasn't prepared to chair tonight, but I would suggest that, maybe if the letter is going to be redrafted anyway or edited well miner, can we maybe insert a paragraph into here that says something about the fact that you know that, due to the you know, due to pandemic and timelines and whatnot, and that the land use committee of the community board wasn't able to fully discuss these things.
, you know the fact that the community board hasn't really had a full amount of time to send this to committee, given the way that we work and given the pandemic, but that we are still in support of the project moving forward and that potentially those edits can be made relatively soon and that maybe we can revisit this letter at our second exec meeting in two weeks.
You know hold some weight saying that we are, that we're still in support of it and that we're signing the letter, even though we weren't able to discuss that committee , so I feel, like the whole letter, should be reviewed by the land use committee.
We want a general letter that says community board 3 continues to support the project Without.
Our opinion see our support for this The bullet points on the first page, Looking at what I'm trying to understand what you're saying about, if community board, if there was a simple letter, not something like this just attached to the to the memo itself, that would be fine, I'm saying not with bullet points.
Just, saying community board three continues to support the application, for you know for the rwc, dcs or whatever you want to refer to it, and that we have taken no position to otherwise change.
Haven't seen that letter that you're, that we got from dcp I'm, not talking about the letter We are submitting the third draft all right, so I just want to put a stop to the back and forth between you and lisa, because it's turning into a private meeting, let's and alicia's joined us now So we're talking about the letter now for the rezoning right, Everyone got a copy of what the letter looks like, and so the issue was sending the letter with our support on the letter was making sure that we were able to attach some type of supportive letter to go with it What was the concern?
This is saying that we don't need to send a supportive letter The controversy is that there's a lot of things in this letter that people don't feel comfortable without discussing further I looked at the letter.
It looks pretty fixed they're, going to remove their fixed structure or there's a way to take it down to have an open-air rooftop, so I'm not really sure about the structure, part of it alex You know that's what we need to vote on If you want to mute, please people mute So. Maybe if we can let the applicants speak, they can say whether people are there at this time or not because their microphone something's going on with their mic susan, so I can understand.
I. Don't have contact details for everybody in that building, Fourth avenue you know, so we reached out to the people who we had dialogue with before and then you know this is something that community is supportive of We. Goes out and a sign goes up for all of the residents that may still be in those buildings What we're asking them to do is now post flyers in those lobbies, so that people that they might not have contact information for can be alerted to the scenario and send us photographs to the get done I'm, assuming we need to take a vote on this Gonna have to send a letter, and what I would like to suggest is that it would be to-.
So, nice peer report, yeah I, just wanted to remind people, because it seems that a couple of chairs have learned that you can stop the recording and then start it again before you know so that it's not catching the first five or ten minutes You just excuse my language bullshitting with your committee members before you start the business of the meeting.
