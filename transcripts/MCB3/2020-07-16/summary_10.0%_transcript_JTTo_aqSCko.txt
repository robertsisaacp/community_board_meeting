Can you explain to the committee right there's a couple of things: if we do not sign this letter, if we decide not to pursue it, it's over.
My bottom line concern is that I think that there are significant issues in this letter that the land Use committee would want to talk.
And, it seems to me from I- did, have an opportunity to talk to jackie a little bit about it, and he explained to me that the issue is with regard to the expiration of the article 78 correct that we're not going to be a part of anyway, and I'm not- And I do not see the relationship of this letter to the report that George James sent, which talks about two alternatives about whether or not we want to compromise or whether or not.
Other scenario that is posed calls for changing the height and getting rid of the 50 of affordable housing, and that will be a very long discussion because we are straying far from what we originally started: with, which basically comes from the Chinatown working group plan and what the board voted.
Then we would stray, and that require a serious conversation because we're going far away from the whole issue of 50, affordable, housing, 350, foot, height limits and Let me just say that there are parts of this letter that I do not know that I ever agreed to like admitting that we like a tower in the park design for this neighborhood over a contextual, building.
I, really think that if paula feels comfortable signing it polish, it signs Lisa, let's stop right there, because you keep saying paula, that's just the way the letter is structured, it is a co-.
I understand if you're saying that we should think about that vote, that we have that the Community board supported that's a whole different story, but we voted to support this rezoning and I am saying that, But every step of the way when we had to sign a letter.
We can't say: city planning was wrong, but if we know we're going to sign a letter or something similar to this, then we still preserve that.
We've lost our right to sue, because tomorrow is the deadline, so we could if this goes to land use and if we at the end of the month, it goes online news and it goes to full board.
Some members were hesitant about it and some members growing up the whole each village issue, but the board voted to support this via resulting application, and that's where we are today.
In long discussions and land use, What city planning says we're going to fix the memo on George ai, not just providing some comments.
At least I'm raising the issue that if God finished the issue, that if we do not support this or the letter or the, then we were We voted for community board three to be a co-.
I mentioned at the committee report- that we had a brief conversation with the co- applicants that we're going to do a presentation in the August land News meeting and that had been has been my plan.
If, that's the consensus, then that's fine, but I really take some concern about about the context of the letter which was written by George James and the fact that we people- I do not know people forgetting what we originally supported.
Think that needs to be explained Jackie, because what I'm hearing right now is people forgetting what the board supported.
The city planning's position is that it's they're still considering it right and that we can use our political and every other methodology we can think of to continue to work with them to get them to honor this, including what George James mentioned in his letter, which was calling on Carl Weisbord's position that they have to move ahead on a project even if they have substantive differences.
I think what's missing and listening to Lisa, and your initial comments is the letter that city planning sent out saying.
Why can't this letter go to land use in August, although obviously it would be preferable to go in July, but we can't do that because the agenda's already set, I mean basically, is all All. The co- applicants looking for tonight is just is assurance that CB3 is still behind this project.
We're really looking at almost a September letter and we're not being timely on this, because just the way of the cove, but also just because of the way CB3 works, which is that we understood that coming into this with CB3 as an application.
Why I'm bringing this up and the timing issue, so I mean I, have not heard anyone say that they're, not supportive of the project anymore , so I think it's safe to assume that the board still is supportive.
That says something about the fact that you know that, due to the you know, due to pandemic and timelines and whatnot, and that the land Use Committee of the Community Board was not able to fully discuss these things.
But the Community Board's executive committee is still in support or something like that to a certain extent.
You know the fact that the community board has not really had a full amount of time to send this to committee, given the way that we work and given the pandemic, but that we are still in support of the project moving forward and that potentially those edits can be made relatively soon and that maybe we can revisit this letter at our second exec meeting in two weeks, but then.
Unless the community board signs it, what difference would that make because then it becomes a letter with three other, the three other co, applicants.
We want a general letter that says, Community Board 3 continues to support the project.
No, I understand I'm, looking at what I'm trying to understand what you're saying about, if community board, if there was a simple letter, not something like this just attached to the to the memo itself, that would be fine, I'm, saying not with bullet points.
Just saying, community Board three continues to support the application, for you know for the Rwc Dcs or whatever you want to refer to it, and that we have taken no position to otherwise change because of this.
I'm saying we do not sign this, but if you're saying all we need is an indication of our support, we send that procedure- You know this letter is attached to the actual draft of the Rwcds which Michael had on the screen.
This is saying that we do not need to send a supportive letter.
I looked at the letter, I do agree that some things that are in the letter should be discussed a little further and taken to like up at the committee meeting.
I saw that there were a couple of letters in support, but one was very vague and the other one seemed to come from the head of a building like look at that also so just that it was addressed with the residents, which is what we've always asked of them: anyway.
Comfortable, nor does anybody need it in person and I meant in any form no, If the community board is supportive of it, you know we'll definitely open up conversations.
We're, going to have to send a letter, and what I would like to suggest is that it would be to- This is just to give you something to work: with, CB3, Approves, the weight, temporary waiver of the stipulation to have only enclosed dining on the rooftop during the executive order for outside for the executive order for Covid-19, okay, Michelle.
Second, Vice, Chair, Support, Treasury, support, okay, I, wanted to say we need to send a thank you letter out to Margaret Chin and to Carlina Rivera for giving us discretionary.
Let me check, but I did want to say that now that all the presentations are online, also, I send a message out to all of the board with links to the presentations and links to the two videos from the trainings, because that would you know be good for people to watch in their spare time as they're sitting at home.
You know write little parts, but we are going to be a little bit more proactive and when I say we, I do not mean the committee members, but So I think I might want to ask Larissa to be the vice chair and Thomas to be the secretary.
There is a lot of caucasian people that sit in positions on our board and we've not talked about that, and I, and I- And I know that it's like kind of peeling off the band- aid a little bit for some people, but I think we should have a conversation around it.
Let me know because the other community boards are going to start to generate the conversation and they're forming a task force in which we've all been well.
Believe there is a discussion on tomorrow's agenda about reopening of community board offices.
