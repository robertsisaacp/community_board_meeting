You, okay, good evening, everyone welcome to the community board three health seniors, Human, Services, youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting.
I just want to let you know that when Larissa finds the instructions she'll be giving an introduction to how the CB3 meetings are run, virtually it's a little different in some ways, different, some ways, similar to the in- person meetings that you probably have been to this me whenever you're ready, sorry, okay, great and also Do it more later, but we do have some new community board members who are visiting our committee, today.
Would vo I am a longtime resident of 7Th Street I am a cultural producer and development consultant for community- based organizations in NC, v3, primarily Latino, and were taken once Ok. So we will go to our first agenda item, which is to vote on the minutes of the previous meeting, which was in March.
You know combine the district needs and the budget priorities a bit, but before we go on continue Susan, could you just give an introduction to what the district needs The beginning of the budget process for community boards starts in May, with the writing of the district need statement, we're working on the fiscal year started in July, 2021.
What I would like to do is you know we have some time to decide on to finalize our budget priorities and district needs.
You know what our district needs to be should be, so they would be people who are working on the ground and not just who could also have a give us an overview of what they think.
We provide us with the expertise, but in Carmen for the seniors, and if the you know, we definitely need your help, but we're also going to bring in speakers who can give us more information beyond what we have.
No Yomi will discuss the needs of the public school students and what they see 4:20 over 21:22 and Oh and okay, Carlin Cohen, is from the chinese- American Planning Council and she will discuss something called the Asian, a neighborhood recovery plan, which is a plan that's signed on by many Asian American organizations, including I , think 11, who are from our area and also the settlement houses in our area.
And I think some of those items shall discuss are applicable to the other communities and best to let you know we do plan to meet in July committee members, we plan to meet in July.
In, my personal opinion, I think we need social workers and every single school community period to I I do believe that students in with special needs, are also suffering tremendously, if not double the amount of trauma, because there's a wide range of supports, there's a wide range of services that children with special needs receive because there's also a wide range of special needs and their expectation.
My students have had trouble accessing technology Private schools does not matter all education programs are going to go eventually into a hybrid form of learning at some point, whether it's a couple days, Face- Face in a classroom and a couple of days at home on a computer via classroom, zoom classes, stuff like that Next fiscal year, but the one that we're for that.
We can't connect every single household with broadband service, but you know the fact that we're number one on a list in New, York City, is sort of concerning for me as well, because families, you know what highlighted need was when you know, spectrum and optimum , you know, thought they were doing such a great honorable job, giving service to families.
If we do go to a hybrid form, whether what is the rustle you're going to look like We, do not really have into those the neighborhood really, at least on the south end, where I am the New York City Public.
And so I know that in the school in which I work there quite like more than 50% of the school, has children with autism or special needs.
There was, you know, people can say what they want, but they I do not think anyone can account for having a pandemic and what that would look.
A lot of the school communities use their PTA s to help pay for devices my son's middle school, for instance the PTA donated money, because for every family that got an iPad, they ordered a keyboard to go with the iPad, and you know in a household with multiple kids that may have to be on classes.
There was a lot of surprises, addressing what type of devices already exist in our home and how many do they need families and know that they need if they have multiple kids in the household, they need to fill out the form multiple times.
So, when I think of an example of what it looks like I, think of them and cutting those services will directly impact these families right because they rely on it.
That's really the first thing that I think of now talking about emissions me We were the first in New York City to have the first admissions policy, and it includes a threshold of including students in temporary housing, acrosss.
That what's important here, is to note that we're talking about neighborhoods rather than necessarily Asian Americans as a racial and ethnic group, acrosss the state overall, and the reason for that The diversity that exists within areas like Chinatown in the Lower East Side, but also recognizes that a lot of the impact that we saw was really Geographic and the reason we thought it was important to put this together was because we have obviously seen a lot of impacts, particularly economic ones, due to COBIT 19 in neighborhoods, with high levels of asian- american populations.
We joined together to put together this recovery plan, recognizing that the impact in the East geographic areas that have large Asian American populations was going to be different than that facing New York City, as a whole.
We, do plan to kind of continue refining this plan as we see what the ongoing impact of Covid-19 and the economic impacts are, but we also wanted to put together a first draft of it or first go at it early on, because we knew that a lot of decision- makers at the city level, we're going to be, you know, beginning to make decisions about this year's budget and then even looking forward.
That looks like really two major things: providing relief for all of the workers that have had wage loss and replacement, and particularly at the city level, pushing for that relief to include community members that have been left out of federal relief, particularly for a lot of immigrant workers in cash jobs, so some delivery workers and other part- time and informal economy workers we've seen that the federal relief has not really been reaching them and so making sure that is something that the city prioritizes and Did committee members that you received this last minute.
We also know that housing and neighborhood affordability will be a big issue because of that interrelated economic impact, and one of the things that we really do not want to see is a that.
We know that with the income recertification, there have been a lot of issues for folks living in NYCHA facilities that are technically eligible for relief, but are not getting it and then providing subsidies for commercial tenants that can't afford rent, particularly in mixed use, in supportive housing buildings and then another big area for us is public.
You know not only important, but it's highly achievable at the city level, as we think, through what education work and access to information.
All of this is supporting the community- based neighborhood organizations, so settlement houses, social services agencies that are doing this work.
I. Think an example of this that we saw is with the meal delivery programs, where the city went to try to kind of take over those programs and do delivery coordinated through the city that there ended up being a lot of issues, not only identifying seniors who are homebound and needed meals, but ensuring that those meals were then going to be culturally competent, nutritionally appropriate and more and so for us.
Dip ton has seen an 11% cut at a time that we know that our seniors need support to remain in their homes safely and comfortably more than ever, dy CD.
We think that now is a time more than ever that young people actually need this programming support, whether it is after school like the beacons and compass or Youth Employment programming like SYEP and then similarly Geo HMH.
It's, going to be really necessary to allow their parents to work and get back to work We know that is really critical programming, particularly at a time when their academic experience is interrupted and as they're starting to think about moving into college or jobs or whatever it's coming for them afterwards and then, of course.
You know our seniors are going to need ongoing support through the recovery of this.
What does it look like to actually collect better data, so we really have a sense of where and who and how people are being impacted by this, and that is going to be really critical.
For example, you know more than ever, users are going to need a summer programming and the social emotional support.
