You, okay, good evening, everyone welcome to the community board three health seniors, Human, Services, youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting.
What I would like to do is you know we have some time to decide on to finalize our budget priorities and district needs.
You know what our district needs to be should be so they would be people who are working on the ground and not just who could also have a give us an overview of what they think.
And I think some of those items shall discuss are applicable to the other communities and best to let you know we do plan to meet in July committee members.
I know you guys are working on your district In, the last week, husband, I'm, an emotional toll, I know it's taken an emotional toll in my for myself in my household, but one of the glaring things that I am seeing that we need is, as you all know, whenever there's a budget crisis in the city.
The first thing that always gets cut is education, even though we still expect our kids to you, know excel and do well, and but we always cut them first, and then we wander wonder why they're not doing As great All supportive services have been cut for kids, so those programs that usually support children after school or have been cut so beacons sonics, after-school services all have disappeared, they're, not being funded, and so it's opening.
I should be top of mind because the social-emotional supports that our kids are gonna need after this is gonna, be unsurmountable and a lot of things that couldn't come up from this, that if we don't address it, it's gonna spill, over.
In, my personal opinion, I think we need social workers and every single school community period to I With.
All education programs are going to go eventually into a hybrid form of learning at some point, Whether, it's a couple days face-to-face in a classroom and a couple of days at home on a computer via classroom, zoom classes, stuff like that I Wi-Fi, more than one laptop or tablet in the house, because there's multiple young people who need to be on classrooms, So I think we all saw the need for broadband service when we all went remote.
Don't I, know those organizations that, if you do contact them and show the need they will connect free Wi-Fi service for households You know for it like they do like link type of things, but that's gonna require a larger push, especially if you're in a neighborhood that has the least broadband service per household in a city.
Is this something that you can suggest that the community board can write a resolution on to help with There was, you know, people can say what they want, but they I don't think anyone can account for having a pandemic and what that would look.
A lot of the school communities, use their PTA s to help pay for devices my son's middle school, for instance the PTA donated money, because for every family that got an iPad, they ordered a keyboard to go with the iPad, and you know in a household with multiple kids that may have to be on classes.
So, there's different kinds of questions going on here, so people are having a lot of questions about what's wrong this time and how they could have done better, but also committee members.
I know how important after-school programs are for students in temporary housing.
That's really the first thing that I think of now talking about emissions me We were the first in New York City, to have the first admissions policy, and it includes a threshold of including students in temporary housing across every single school.
That, what's important here, is to note that we're talking about neighborhoods, rather than necessarily Asian Americans as a racial and ethnic group across the state, overall, and The diversity that exists within areas like Chinatown in the Lower East Side, but also recognizes that a lot of the impact that we saw was really Geographic and the reason we thought it was important to put this together was because we have obviously seen a lot of impacts, particularly economic ones, due to COBIT 19 in neighborhoods, with high levels of asian-american populations.
We joined together to put together this recovery plan, recognizing that the impact in the East geographic areas that have large Asian American populations was going to be different than that facing New York City, as a whole.
As we see what the ongoing impact of Covid-19 19 and the economic impacts are, but we also wanted to put together a first draft of it or first go at it early on, because we knew that a lot of decision-makers at the city level, we're going to be, you know, beginning to make decisions about this year's budget and then even looking forward.
That looks like really two major things: providing relief for all of the workers that have had wage loss and replacement, and particularly at the city level, pushing for that relief to include community members that have been left out of federal relief, particularly for a lot of immigrant workers in cash jobs, so some delivery workers and other part-time and informal economy workers we've seen that the federal relief has not really been reaching them and so making sure that is something that the city prioritizes and Did committee members that you received this last minute.
We also know that housing and neighborhood affordability will be a big issue because of that interrelated economic impact, and one of the things that we really don't want to see is a that.
We know that with the income recertification, there have been a lot of issues for folks living in NYCHA facilities that are technically eligible for relief, but are not getting it and then providing subsidies for commercial tenants that can't afford rent, particularly in mixed use, in supportive housing buildings and then another big area for us is public.
You know not only important, but it's highly achievable at the city level, as we think, through what education work and access to information.
All of this is supporting the community-based neighborhood organizations, so settlement houses, social services agencies that are doing this work.
I. Think an example of this that we saw is with the meal delivery programs, where the city went to try to kind of take over those programs and do delivery coordinated through the city that there ended up being a lot of issues, not only identifying seniors who are homebound and needed meals, but ensuring that those meals were then going to be culturally competent, nutritionally appropriate and more and so for us.
Dip ton has seen an 11% cut at a time that we know that our seniors need support to remain in their homes safely and comfortably more than ever, dy CD.
We think that now is a time more than ever, that young people actually need this programming support, whether it is after school like the beacons and compass or Youth Employment programming like SYEP and then similarly geo HMH.
Programming, I think that we'll find at the infrastructure, the staff spaces will go away because some of the organizations won't be able to sustain it, and so I think that you know that is one critical area that SYEP is the beacons The compasses, oh those second one for me, is Senior Services.
You know our seniors are going to need ongoing support through the recovery of this.
Following the city, the outline of the 38 racial and ethnic subgroups that they have collected city health data in before and then other things is that you know there should be other data indicators collected as well, What does it look like to actually collect better data, so we really have a sense of where and who and how people are being impacted by this, and that is gonna be really critical.
For example, you know more than ever, users are gonna need a summer programming and the social emotional support.
