You, okay, good evening, everyone welcome to the community board three health seniors, Human, Services, youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting This is the first time we're doing a virtual meeting So it's you know a first for us, virtually it's a little different in some ways, different some ways similar to the in-person meetings that you probably have been to this me whenever you're ready, sorry, okay, great and also I wanted to recognize I'll do it more later, but we do have some new community board members who are visiting our committee today, so and also another thing is that Thomas Larissa is our secretary nor in normal times, since Larissa has another job right now at this meeting, Thomas will be taking over as the secretary and he will be picking the minutes You are not a committee member, please sign in by entering your name and affiliation in any First, then the public will have a chance to speak.
So before we start the meeting I wanted to recognize that we have four new community board members here today think there's three or four oi tribal birds: longtime member of well member of cb3 public member last year, longtime resident of Louisa Ricky Wong born and raised Lower East Side Chinatown, formerly New York City Department of Health Department of Consumer Affairs as well to now in private sector First time here, just got appointed I was born and raised in Chinatown right here in Lower, East, Side, Manhattan and I Would, vo I am a longtime resident of 7th Street.
We already voted on the coming budget year, we're looking at July a year from now all right Well this budgets, gonna, be finalized at the current budget for next month will be finalized by the end of this month, and we have written letters like we wrote a letter to protest the cuts in Summer Youth, Employment, Program, okay, all right, but what we had done is that if we were aware of any cuts to programs that we were cut are part of our budget priorities.
Yeah, okay, Naomi no Yomi will discuss the needs of the public school students and what they see 4:20 over 21 22 and then Carlin code, lastname, , Oh, Cohen, think 11, who are from our area and also the settlement houses in our area and In July committee members, we plan to meet in July, you're gonna be dealing with the budget priorities You like to speak first sure hi, everyone I hope everyone's having a good evening.
I know it's taken an emotional toll in my for myself in my household, but one of the glaring things that I am seeing that we need is, as you all know, whenever there's a budget crisis in the city, The first thing that always gets cut is education, even though we still expect our kids to you, know excel and do well, and but we always cut them first, and then we wander wonder why they're not doing as great All supportive services have been cut for kids, so those programs that usually support children after school or have been cut so beacons sonics, after-school services all have disappeared, they're, not being funded, and so it's opening a very This can potentially open a very bad Pandora's box for our children because they don't have anything to do over the summer Obviously.
They're, not gonna, stay in the school buildings at 3 o'clock and go straight home , there's a call that we need to start having a lot of discussion around social emotional support, I'm hearing across this district about you know, being racial allies and acknowledging what's going on, and a lot of this is really emotional.
Pretend, like everything, has been okay since then We as y'all, where there is a larger ratio of school security officers to guidance, counselor's If, that in the entire school system we means not If, it's a community school, so the honey streets, education alliance, those folks are providing supported services to our kids, but it's not through the do II, so I think that's something Thank!
The first thing I will say: is a social workers I think that's critical In my personal opinion I think we need social workers and every single school community period to I They, not in the school building that with people they don't know , they don't understand why they can't be with people and a lot of the families are experiencing the child rebelling or like acting out and because they don't know it very confused by all of this my top number one top number two number two would be supportive services like through after-school programs and the beacons and the Sonics and the Y's sy ApS, because that is supports of families.
A question about technological needs for our young people throughout the district Do we private schools doesn't matter All education programs are going to go eventually into a hybrid form of learning at some point, whether it's a couple days face-to-face in a classroom and a couple of days at home on a computer via classroom, zoom classes stuff like that I Wi-Fi, more than one laptop or tablet in the house, because there's multiple young people who need to be on classrooms.
Is this something that you can suggest that the community board can write a resolution on to help with you know people can say what they want, but they I don't think anyone can account for having a pandemic and what that would look like I first want to connect with you offline find out what she needs.
They have, after school, They have extended hours on there after school They serve hot dinners, and they also do weekend Friday and Saturday programming and the same thing in the summer So when I think of an example of what it looks like I, think of them and cutting those services will directly impact these families right because they rely on it You know anything about sort of the lifespan of being a temporary housing facility, you're required to look for work, you're required to go endless meetings, and you have to drag your kids with these meetings, which means you're missing school and, if you're working, that means you're working depending on your work shift, you may become homely, and so you rely on these after-school providers to help feed your children That's really the first thing that I think of now talking about emissions me We were the first in New York City, to have the first admissions policy, and it includes a threshold of including students in temporary housing across every single school Send me, your top five capital priorities that you believe are not funded , so we couldn't put them on our agenda for our meeting with BOE We worked with about 30 other organizations that are working in Asian American neighborhoods, including his mace at eleven in CV freeze area to come up with what we called the Asian American neighborhood recovery plan That, what's important here, is to note that we're talking about neighborhoods, rather than necessarily Asian Americans as a racial and ethnic group across the state overall, and the reason for that is kind of recognizing number one The diversity that exists within areas like Chinatown in the Lower East Side, but also recognizes that a lot of the impact that we saw was really Geographic and the reason we thought it was important to put this together was because we have obviously seen a lot of impacts, particularly economic ones, due to COBIT 19 in neighborhoods, with high levels of asian-american populations.
We know that you know in lower Manhattan and in Chinatown that as early as February, there were reports of our small businesses and restaurants having loss of 50% in revenue We joined together to put together this recovery plan, recognizing that the impact in the East geographic areas that have large Asian American populations was going to be different than that facing New York City as a whole.
That looks like really two major things: providing relief for all of the workers that have had wage loss and replacement and particularly at the city level, pushing for that relief to include community members that have been left out of federal relief, particularly for a lot of immigrant workers in cash jobs, so some delivery workers and other part-time and informal economy workers we've seen that the federal relief has not really been reaching them and so making sure that is something that the city prioritizes and did committee members that you received this last minute.
You can read along on that Naomi did touch on some of these things, investing in workforce training and placement to ensure that, in long term, economic recovery that there are options available to folks, we don't know what the economic recovery is going to look like and so city programs that support our young people like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, our adult literacy programs or workforce training and placement programs and Umbridge programs that serve immigrant community members and other city programs like that We think, is a really high priority, so that we ensure that community members are able to move through this long term in a significant way and, of course, a concern.
We think that now is a time more than ever that young people actually need this programming support, whether it is after school like the beacons and compass or Youth Employment programming like SYEP and then similarly geo We saw a an 8% cut and department of social services about the same, and so something that we're really pushing for is, as we move into FY 21 22, as well as beyond, really focusing on building out social services, because we have seen a huge spike in the demand for social services, and if the funding is not there at the city level to meet that demand, then it's really going to slow our recovery process To whatever extent.
And I think, particularly as we move into the contact tracing and testing phase, which is likely to go on for some time in New York According to the estimates that most public health experts are saying making sure that those navigation services remain throughout Are. or you know that we could look at locally and particularly to see where this happened, because this kind of points to looking at the inequality in our neighborhoods I missed the very first part of that question.
So we've been really pushing for future data collection to disaggregate data into further racial and ethnic subgroups following the city, the outline of the 38 racial and ethnic subgroups that they have collected city health data in before and then other things is that you know there should be other data indicators collected as well What does it look like to actually collect better data, so we really have a sense of where and who and how people are being impacted by this, and that is gonna be really critical again, as we move through recovery over the next several years.
