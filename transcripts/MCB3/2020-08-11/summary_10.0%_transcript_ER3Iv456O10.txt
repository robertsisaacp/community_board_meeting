I. Think you guys are amazing and both of the topics on our meeting tonight have come about by grassroots efforts by members of our community and the organizations they belong to village preservation, lesbian, east village, Community, coalition, The, first topic on our agenda is approval of the minutes.
It's the initiative regarding the national register, listing of the two buildings in the east river park, and we have richard and deborah presenting, and you guys I'm gonna, make you post.
We reported to this committee on our new york state, historic preservation, office, application for the historic east river, park, track house and tennis center comfort.
After, initially focusing on the east river park's fireboat house, which was already listed as eligible for the state national registers of historic places.
They weren't didn't, provide us a lot of detail on what they're doing right now, but they did say that they were reaching out to you, know the city administration and going to work with them on possible routes to remediation.
So, we're hoping to go to parks and asked for a resolution from parks which has been really working on this project to consider the adaptive, reuse, preservation and adaptive reuse of these buildings to recommend that from the city.
And we do want to get the support of you know The local elected officials- Sorry about that, at the beginning of this meeting, I neglected to ask that people attendees go in the chat and put in your name and affiliation.
This project that you know we wanted to go with the national and state register listing, as the best way to you.
Thank you to everyone in the public for being here, we're gonna go over together a bit a very brief history, which a lot of people here know far better than me will go over the conditions past and present of this hazardous and emergency condition.
Next slide, please harry again, and what the history of most people know: is: Charis el bujio, the community center in the 70s when the building was taken over and while there's not enough time tonight to go over the immense amount of programs and educational experiences that were offered.
East 10th street, the fire department, con ed and the office and of emergency management had to come on the scene to see what was going on the building because of cracks- The department of building issued a vacate order in 2019, one that exists until today and, along with the vacated order, comes orders to repair next slide.
I think it goes to show the importance of taking care of our landmark structures, as well as the possible dangers and hazards that can accompany an older building being left to decay, and so that's a lever of power that the city has at its disposal, which we're not aware it's been utilized.
If this presentation is going to have, I might have to speak about it over 50 million dollars in loans on the property under getting financing for the property, calling it an apartment building which the accuracy document on the right shows, and yet the building is tax assessed as a as a school which doesn't comport and just shows what potential lack of transparency that the owner has been representing next case.
It can't be given back to the community, as promised by the mayor before his re-election and so again this is one of the most historic buildings in the community and also has a very close place in people's hearts for many reasons and has not been treated the way it should be by the city, including really the buildings department and the landmarks preservation commission, because in our view the proof is in the pudding.
The only thing that I would want to add is that there was one suggestion from a resident that the community board write a letter to the lender, describing the sorry condition of the building the vandalism and trespassing that are allowed to happen.
You know we filed complaints, I've written the community board, we organized the town hall where we had 99 people come to the town hall to express concern about the building and how they would like it returned to our neighborhood and it seems to be frozen in a moment of time and that no one takes any action.
Basically, they have to have access somehow that high to do this graffiti and also what I want to show everybody They send signals into my living room, and this has been happening for five or six before Covid-19 When a debris fell from the building, and I have serious concerns that with the wind, these pieces of glass can fall on someone passing below and hurt them.
I. Think that the letter to the lender is a great idea that way, if you know, he's already gotten 50 million dollars the owner on based on it being a residential property which it isn't right.
Some of the people who've been watching this for a very long time can maybe speak to that I mean I, think some people have tried, but You know I, don't live in that neighborhood, so I'm not as up to date on the day-to-day happenings Yes, since you mentioned, and thank sandra for those important points about the letter to the lender, making them aware of it in case they're, not aware, and as far as the elected officials go, you know, many people have been involved, doing different things to the best of their ability.
You know it would be such a tragedy to lose a beautiful building, but it would be a far greater tragedy to have people made homeless or killed because of actions that are not being taken by the city.
With, a long history of serving the people of the lower east society's village, including, but not limited, to restoring the not-for-profit organization known as charis el boheato to the building located at 605, east 9th street.
Right, thank you, Well, I, would, I would suggest, perhaps doing the city slash lpc, just so that if the city, if lpc, is already maxed out on their budget for the fiscal year or there's some kind of issue with you know bringing them in Okay, I'm a little unclear just as to the committee's intent on the fourth, therefore What I do someone's a little bit vague here and then send a letter with this resolution to the lender of the owner to make them aware of those these issues.
Well, I, don't know whether cb3 wants to send a letter or not okay , I.
