I. Think you guys are amazing and both of the topics on our meeting tonight have come about by grassroots efforts by members of our community and the organizations they belong to village preservation, Lesbian, East Village community coalition, so you guys are unbelievable.
It's the initiative regarding the national register, listing of the two buildings in the East River Park, and we have Richard and Deborah presenting, and you guys I'm going to make you post.
We reported to this committee on our New York State Historic Preservation, office, application for the Historic East River, Park, Track, House and Tennis Center, comfort, station, and now I want to provide you an update and review the results in 2019 lesbi was invited to be a consulting party for the East side, coastal resiliency project dealing with the East River Park reconstruction for flood protection, which I know most of you are familiar: with.
Phase of the project: After reviewing the building's fine architecture and researching their history, we decided to bring them to the attention of the New York State Historic Preservation office, also known as SHPO as potentially eligible for listing in the state and national registers of historic places.
The only difference is really in the backgrounds where the tenements can be seen in the 1939 photo, and today, there's public housing, SHPO noted the distinctive three- part structure of this building accented by two chimneys at the ends and an unusual stone cupola at the center.
They were not did not provide us a lot of detail on what they're doing right now, but they did say that they were reaching out to you, know the city administration and going to work with them on possible routes to remediation.
If the city does not want the buildings to be listed, you know they won't be listed and the SHPO's role is really advisory here, as well.
So, we're hoping to go to parks and asked for a resolution from parks which has been really working on this project to consider the adaptive, reuse, preservation and adaptive reuse of these buildings to recommend that from the city.
We do want to get the support of you, know the local elected officials, and You know some of the other organizations going forward to push the city to do the right thing.
Thank you to everyone in the public for being here, we're going to go over together a bit a very brief history, which a lot of people here know far better than me will go over the conditions past and present of this hazardous and emergency condition.
Please Harry again, and what the history of most people know: is: Charis, El Bujio, the community center in the 70s when the building was taken over and while there's not enough time tonight to go over the immense amount of programs and educational experiences that were offered.
If this presentation is going to have, I might have to speak about it over 50 million dollars in loans on the property under getting financing for the property, calling it an apartment building which the accuracy document on the right shows, and yet the building is tax assessed as a as a school which does not comport and just shows what potential lack of transparency that the owner has been representing.
And finally, you know, I, think we have very basic requests for the city at this point that we're looking for the city to secure the property So that teenagers and whoever else can not enter and can't do any more damage to the outside.
Want to see the developer, find five thousand dollars a day and apply to apply a lien to the property, as per the you know, city, rules and regulations.
It can't be given back to the community, as promised by the mayor before his re- election, and so again this is one of the most historic buildings in the community and also has a very close place in people's hearts for many reasons and has not been treated the way it should be by the city, including really the buildings department and the Landmarks Preservation Commission, because in our view the proof is in the pudding.
The only thing that I would want to add is that there was one suggestion from a resident that the community board write a letter to the lender, describing the sorry condition of the building, the vandalism and trespassing that are allowed to happen.
We received a notice from a letter from the Landmarks Commission saying: They seem to think that it's been sufficient, that he put up two heavy- duty, black tarps, on the areas of the building on 10th street.
You know we filed complaints, I've written the community board, we organized the town hall where we had 99 people come to the town Hall to express concern about the building and how they would like it returned to our neighborhood and it seems to be frozen in a moment of time and that no one takes any action.
It's waiting for something to happen, and I think that we need to try to draft either a resolution asking LPC to move forward with demolition by neglect.
Basically, they have to have access somehow that high to do this graffiti and also what I want to show everybody They send signals into my living room, and this has been happening for five or six before Covid-19 9- 1- 1, because that was around the time that the lady died when a debris fell from the building, and I have serious concerns.
The people who are living near that- Until when we write the resolution olympia, one thing you may not know- is on the on the Landmarks Preservation Commission's website, there's a violation form and any time you see a violation on a New, York, City Landmark, and we see lots of them on this building, go on there and fill out one of those forms.
I think that the letter to the lender is a great idea that way, if you know, he's already gotten 50 million dollars the owner on based on it being a residential property which it is not right, so I think hitting him.
What's, really important about this image is that it shows the densely populated neighborhood that surrounds this building and their residences, You know it would be such a tragedy to lose a beautiful building, but it would be a far greater tragedy to have people made homeless or killed because of actions that are not being taken by the city.
Lpc, take legal action to compel repairs and issue the maximum fines retroactively and moving forward and three place a lien on the property and send a letter with this resolution.
Further resolve, CB3 reiterates its call made in a resolution in 2013, requesting that the De Blasio mayoral administration returned the former Ps 64 school building to the community by legally retrieving and then selling or giving it to a well- established, not- for, profit organization, with a long history of serving the people of the lower East society's village, including, but not limited to restoring the not- for- profit organization, known as Charis El Boheato to the building located at 605, East 9th street.
Dob must issue a warrant allowing the NYPD to enter the building.
Yes, I'm wondering if perhaps there could be, therefore, that the city retain a qualified preservation engineer to thoroughly assess the building and identify you know any potential hazards, areas where the building has been structurally compromised and areas where the Exterior Envelope has been has been compromised.
I know the city should retain a preservation engineer as soon as possible to assess thoroughly assess the buildings for potential hazards for areas where the building structure has been compromised and the Exterior envelope go down.
What I do someone's a little bit vague here and then send a letter with this resolution to the lender of the owner to make them aware of those these issues.
Well, I do not know whether CB3 wants to send a letter or not okay, I.
