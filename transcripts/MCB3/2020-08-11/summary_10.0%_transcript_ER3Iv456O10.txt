David We reported to this committee on our new york state, historic preservation, office, application for the historic east river park, track house and tennis center comfort station and now I want to provide you an update and review the results in 2019 lesbi was invited to be a consulting party for the east side, coastal resiliency project dealing with the east river park, reconstruction for flood protection, which I know most of you are familiar with After, initially focusing on the east river park's fireboat house, which was already listed as eligible for the state national registers of historic places.
During the environmental impact statement, phase of the project, After reviewing the building's fine architecture and researching their history, we decided to bring them to the attention of the new york state historic preservation office, also known as shippo as potentially eligible for listing in the state and national registers of historic places.
If I could just jump in I think the distinction is that the fight cross is listed as an architectural resource on the environmental impact statement, but these buildings were not, and it's that omission that caused us to conduct a survey and ask the ship up to take another, so we're hoping to go to parks and asked for a resolution from parks which has been really working on this project to consider the adaptive, reuse, preservation and adaptive reuse of these buildings to recommend that from the city Obviously.
but they're like basically cement block rectangles and these buildings are far superior to what they're planning to put in there absolutely well Not we don't need any vote on this I understand, and everyone should know that you all are going to make a presentation at parks committee in september, Yes, okay, so keep an eye on the agenda for that If you're interested in pursuing this with you know, with the actual escr, which is what is all being done in parks.
So as I said this is, was a joint request to be on this agenda tonight again, thank you to everyone in the public for being here, we're gonna go over together a bit a very brief history, which a lot of people here know far better than me will go over the conditions past and present of this hazardous and emergency condition.
Next slide, please harry again, and what the history of most people know: is: charis el bujio, the community center in the 70s when the building was taken over and while there's not enough time tonight to go over the immense amount of programs and educational experiences that were offered That was a critical resource for the neighborhood that was lost next slide.
so bad East 10th street, the fire department, con ed and the office and of emergency management had to come on the scene to see what was going on the building because of cracks, and this is from our online documents for one an eyesore and a magnet for garbage and darkness, because the lights aren't maintained the scaffold, that's a permit There was originally back in 2013 in order to repair a permit to repair which was never executed in 2019 I think it goes to show the importance of taking care of our landmark structures, as well as the possible dangers and hazards that can accompany an older building being left to decay, and so that's a lever of power that the city has at its disposal, which we're not aware it's been utilized.
Think it's back to harry richard and you can see what happened to another lower east side landmark the norfolk street synagogue three years ago It was really a loss, historical loss for the community, and on top of that, during the construction around the kind of the clearing the site, one of the workers for the project was killed.
It can't be given back to the community, as promised by the mayor before his re-election, and so again this is one of the most historic buildings in the community and also has a very close place in people's hearts for many reasons and has not been treated the way it should be by the city, including really the buildings department and the landmarks preservation commission, because in our view the proof is in the pudding.
The only thing that I would want to add is that there was one suggestion from a resident that the community board write a letter to the lender, describing the sorry condition of the building the vandalism and trespassing that are allowed to happen.
Yes, okay, I live immediately across the street from character, I used to organize block association meetings in the building when it was still occupied by chadas We wrote from the block association complete with images in april of 2019 We received a notice from a letter from the landmarks commission saying: Oh you know he could be fined up to five thousand dollars a day.
Think some people have tried, but Yes since you mentioned, and thank sandra for those important points about the letter to the lender, making them aware of it in case they're not aware, and as far as the elected officials go, you know, many people have been involved, doing different things to the best of their ability, Our hope with this agenda item, and this hopefully forthcoming resolution is to armed with that To go to the elected officials and point out how community board three has taken a strong stance in support of these action steps So in following up what you're saying we're hopeful armed with a resolution from cb3 a strong resolution that the elected officials and their staffs, who are here today, I see some of them I.
Via further resolve cb3 reiterates its call made in a resolution in 2013, requesting that the de Blasio mayoral administration returned the former ps 64 school building to the community by legally retrieving and then selling or giving it to a well-established, not-for-profit organization With a long history of serving the people of the lower east society's village, including, but not limited, to restoring the not-for-profit organization known as charis el boheato to the building located at 605 east 9th street.
