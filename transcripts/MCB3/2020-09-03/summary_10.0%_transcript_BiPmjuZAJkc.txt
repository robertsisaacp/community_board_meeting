I never thought about a fee But given everything that we're going through economically I have no problem supporting megan's resolution asking that they returned these fees back to the applicants. Well, you know we'll wait and see, but at least help the people out now giving them those couple of thousand dollars back.
It did not include the return of sidewalk application fees for first-time applicants, because that's the only thing we're talking about is return of, first-time application fees. Right, because they suspended or they returned the renewal fees it says, whereas, although the city suspended payments for sidewalk cafe renewal fees during the Covid-19 crisis, it did not suspend sidewalk, cafe application fees for the four first time, applicants did not include the return of sidewalk, cafe, application fees for first-time applicants and we'll take out the suspend I wanted to add because I guess I what I don't know how to put it, but I just thought of this before the meeting is: I don't want them, the DCA just to return all the application fees and then to feel like businesses if they are staying open kind of like lost their place in the line. 
If we get rid of this open restaurants program, you know in a year or two from now they want.
I mean people don't have that much security. The last it says, therefore, be it resolved that community board 3 asks that the department of consumer affairs refund all sidewalk cafe application fees. Just then two restaurant applicants, two restaurant applicants who have not yet been granted licenses. So, should we take out restaurants? Because there are actually other businesses that have sidewalk cafes that might not be classified as restaurants, necessarily. Like Dunkin Donuts. You know they did they don't necessarily qualify as restaurants, but they still apply for sidewalk cafes. They just took out restaurants, it's fees to applicants who have not been okay. But if that is a problem, then it's restaurants is also in that first paragraph, whereas numerous restaurants were in the process of applying for NYC sidewalk cafe licenses before the Covid-19 crisis, maybe just swap out restaurants with businesses.
It's in the second paragraph also so, whereas application fees for businesses applying for sidewalk cafe for a sidewalk cafe license are significant, ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 for an unenclosed sidewalk cafe to more than 6,000 for an enclosed cafe. Whereas the mayor's executive order, number 126 issued on June, 18th 2020 and definitely suspended the issuance of sidewalk cafe licenses in favor of the NYC Open Restaurants Program. 
Whereas, although the city suspended payments for sidewalk, cafe renewal fees during the Covid-19 crisis, it did not include the return of sidewalk cafe, application fees for first-time applicants. Whereas the Department of Consumer Affairs that processes sidewalk cafe license, applications has not communicated with applicants about when their licenses may be issued or when their fees would be returned.
And, whereas restaurants in New York City have suffered incredible financial losses due to the health pandemic with many forced to close, therefore, be it resolved that Community Board 3 asks at the Department of Consumer Affairs all sidewalk cafe application fees to applicants who have not yet been granted licenses.
Things have affected my businesses to some degree, but I think I agree with Anisha that, yes, like, if they're going in community board theories District Needs statement anywhere, it should be health and human services.
If you put in the District Needs it's not going to impact anything that's happening now, and hopefully this situation isn't going to be You know we're not going to be seeing the same situation, but you will be voting in October on sanitation, budget-ish You know, budget funding, and if anybody has any sort of final changes or comments to this. I'm happy to read it through. So, if there isn't any further discussion about it, we don't actually have to like vote to approve this right?
Many non-profit cultural organizations within the CD receive annual funding through the Department of Cultural Affairs, as resources are redirected to respond to Covid-19. The city's annual budget has become more constrained, so that support for small vulnerable arts organizations are not certain. Community Board 3 neighborhood art venues, Libraries, community gardens, and parks provide local, often low-cost access to cultural programming. Arts and culture should be integrated into the city planning projects such as designated arts and cultural spaces and new publicly subsidized developments.
I think you know some of these bullet points towards the end, so we can go through that, but I just wanted to open it up to see if there any other sort of general questions or comments about this I'm, just wondering like the funding, stuff I think could either be separate resolutions or should be budget priority stuff rather than also, my daughter is having a tantrum, so I may need to shut myself if she starts screaming again. You think that I think there may have been some confusion about the back and forth of what the town should have been, but there definitely is huge needs in our district, because there is a concentration of venues and artist workers, and so it is definitely part of the district needs if we need to rewrite it so that it doesn't.
I think that you know we can work together to figure out how to change some of those bullet points and then present it at the October Economic Development committee meeting and then have the arts like have more arts and culture people come sub community members come to sort of weigh in on it then as well.
