If any of the community members have issues that you know, they would like to bring to the attention of the full committee.
I think there are different ways we can work on it, but hopefully this one is a very straightforward issue and the resolution is pretty straightforward, So megan, if you'd like to sort of introduce the context for it, and then I will bring up the resolution because alex made some comments on it.
So this is, you know, sidewalk cafe, licenses that are issued by DCA department of consumer affairs.
So usually the process is when you're applying There's certain application fees when you're applying for the first time you know But, since Covid-19 happened, they stopped issuing those licenses, but they- What are they doing with their application fees?
So I, you know I'd like for them to return the money to if the applicant so chooses the money to be returned, which I don't think I made clear at the end, so I might want to tweak that a little bit, but that's kind of where we're coming from and happy to answer.
Okay, when the when the city opened up the process for the sidewalk cafes, I do not recall there being, like all of us, I'm, aware of several places that they're sidewalks, I never thought about a fee, I'm, not sure how the city can justify it, except under the heading of long-term practice, but Given everything that we're going through economically, I have no problem supporting megan's resolution asking that they returned these fees back to the applicants.
Did not include the return of sidewalk, cafe, application fees for first-time applicants I wanted to add, because I guess I what I don't know how to put it, but I just thought of this before the meeting is: I don't want them the DCA just to return all the application fees and then to feel like businesses if they are staying, open kind of like lost their place in the line and aren't What, if we get rid of this open restaurants program, you know in a year or two from now they want.
Therefore booze on community board, three requested consumer affairs refund, not all but sidewalk, cafe, application fees to restaurant applicants who have yet been granted licenses who are like or who so choose to have their can.
So the last it says, therefore be it resolved that community board 3 asks that the department of consumer affairs refund all sidewalk cafe application, fees.
Although the city suspended payments for sidewalk, cafe renewal fees during the Covid-19 19 crisis, it did not include the return of sidewalk cafe, application fees for first-time applicants and whereas the department of consumer affairs that processes sidewalk cafe, license, applications has not communicated with applicants about when their licenses may be issued or when their fees would be.
But for the most part you know there haven't been that many comments from committee members about any other major changes is wondering if there any other sort of final comments to this, where people feel like we are on this.
Think susan could probably comment on this, but he wanted to bring up how the increased drug use on the streets, the drug selling and the drug use is acting as a deterrent to people moving into the neighborhood and Also businesses trying to operate in the neighborhood.
Think I agree with anisha that yes, like if they're going in community board theories district needs statement anywhere.
There are a lot of negative things happening in the community that are impacting businesses and it's not because there are some homeless people on the street in front of the church in the nativity or in front of the luxury condos that were the side of the second avenue.
It is a problem and because of the productive complaining it you know, the board is going to try and act on it, so that my question is then, which is it sounds like it is being worked on, but then does that mean that we don't need to include it in the district needs or do you think it'll have more of an impact or help your work?
The city could collaborate with the community to create WPA style programs to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as the impacted arts and cultural industries rebound DCLA should collaborate with DOE to create grants and funding streams for cultural organizations that provide support services, including remote learning and after school programs for local schools.
I think you know, we've learned that DPLA doesn't do the budget priorities process with us with the community boards, and some of the things in here are sort of budget.
Just wondering, like the funding, stuff, I think, could either be separate resolutions or should be budget priority stuff rather than DNS.
Are you going to vote on it at the next economic development meeting without arts and culture beforehand, and what you would want to be doing?
But I didn't know, budget priority process with us, and then we can also think, as the arts and culture subcommittee, about which of these more immediate needs should just be resolutions.
How do you address the issue that all of these people who are impacted on by the laws of this funding for this year?
I. Think that you know we can work together to figure out how to change some of those bullet points and then present it at the October economic development committee meeting and then have the arts like have more arts and culture people Come sub community members come to sort of weigh in on it then as well.
