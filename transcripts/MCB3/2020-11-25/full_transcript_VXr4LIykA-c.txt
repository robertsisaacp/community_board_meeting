There's something here: Michael, no yeah, we haven't started yet I'm just getting things situated so folks before we get started with public session, I'm just going to call out the names of people who signed up to speak because I don't see most of these people in the attendee list. So if I call out your name and you are in the attendee list, you can raise your hand to. Let us know that you're here that would be appreciated. Emily mock. If you're on the phone you use star nine to raise your hand again: Emily Mock, Sue, Peters Katherine apologies for the mispronunciation Adam Cantor Cameron Scherr Ryan, Lavonne, James, Whitfield I thought I saw you Marco Mazzaro. You all signed up to speak in public session, but none of you seem to be here so we're going to go ahead and start public session with people that I know are here. Michael. Yes, I know that Emily Mott withdrew her statement. She did okay! Thank you all right. So just a reminder, folks for those who whom this might be their first meeting the way public session works. Is that you'll have two minutes to make your comment. You will be timed. There is no back and forth no question and answer it's just two minutes for you to say what you would like to say. So we're going to start with two people who signed up to speak about park issues and the first is Tommy Lowe hello. Thank you. Michael, I'm here to speak about pier 42. on November 12th. There was a community meeting about pier 42, at which the EDC presented the latest edifice of what they were planning and everybody was quite shocked, because a lot of people had not seen the plan and people were concerned that almost 40 percent of the space that's available will be taken up by tennis courts, which will be surrounded by 16-foot fences, basically more than 40 percent of the area, it seemed ridiculous. It was unanimous there were more than 40 people on the call and not one person thought the tennis courts were the highest priority for this community. They also let us know that the upland park could be delayed and they gave us no time source for that, because it is the only entrance to the ESCR projected construction sites, so all truck traffic will be coming through Montgomery Street and they indicated that could possibly interfere with future construction of the upland park. Why? This is also important is the only bathroom that is slated to be available for pier 42. The temporary park is in the Upland park and that's a year away, we've been told, there's going to be no bathroom, no water, no shade. How can you have a community facility open which is supposed to be mitigation for East River park and have none of those we were told, believe it or not? In a 1.45 billion dollar project and a 45 billion dollar temporary use of pier 42? There was no money for courtesans. This community has to stand up and start pushing back. Our elected officials made a lot of promises and a lot of them are going by the wayside on this issue. I'm really concerned that there was no resolution out of the Parks committee on this. Thank you. Tommy next speaker is Wendy Balor Sauer. Sorry, thank you. I'm a 30 year low East side resident and sustainable design. Professional I've been asking NYC EDC to improve access to and care for the public space on pier 36 for a year with fresh air and exercise. Now critical to public health, NYC has pivoted to address Covid-19 and reinforced access to public space programs like open streets. However, the conditions of pier 36 public spaces have worsened steadily as the need for social distancing has grown, especially by CB3 residents that truly have no place else to go and, as Tommy just said, pier 42, which is right next door was Reese, was presented with an interim recreation designs. I mean current local residents. Things have changed since 2013 when the Upland Park was designed. First Covid-19 demands fresh air and space to move. The design does not reflect current understanding of climate change, nor the need for shade restrooms green, a green park and Esplanade excess. It's the only thing: that's going to be open between the Seaport and 26th street I, especially object to the jail-like fencing and I've requested River. A Riverside walkway be extended from pier 42 to pier 35, giving us a third of a mile of waterfront access. This interim park could be our only Riverside access for a decade, yet it leaves the needs of local residents out as Tommy beautifully described. So it to me, it's just part and parcel of how communities, especially lower income community members, are being treated in this community notice. There's no bike lanes being proposed for below Houston Street, for example, I, don't think it's fair! We need access to that space and it needs to be green space. Thank you, Wendy again, members of the public, if you have not signed in yet please do sign in in the chat feature with your name and any affiliation or organization that you are representing. This is for attendance purposes only and if you filled out a form on the website ahead of time to speak tonight, please make sure that your name matches the name that you filled out on the form. So that we know to move you over so that you can make your two minute comments. If you are in the attendee list, and you did sign up to speak, you can use the raised hand feature to. Let us know that you're there. It will make it easier for us to find you, so we are going to continue now with some more public speaking again, keep in mind the two minute limit and we are going to go to four speakers who signed up to speak against item number eight on the SLA vote sheet. First, one will be Marco. Yes, can you hear me? Yes, oh just one second, soon good evening. Sorry, just give me one seconds, organizing here good evening. My name is Marco Macero and like Ryan and James speaking after me, I will be a principal and a part of the management team for 120 orchard. I would like to start this meeting by thanking everyone for their time, especially during the holiday week. The main concern that was brought about from the community board that I would like to address is the uneasiness. Regarding our experience, much like James, my partner, who will be speaking after me, I have over a decade worth of experience serving this exact same community in 2011, I worked up the street at Taqueria, lower East side, which is located on the exact same street at 198. Orchard I worked there as a bartender and I left as the manager. In that time, there wasn't a role that I didn't fill. Additionally, I would like to point out that for a very long time, I was also a member of this community. I lived at Delancey and Clinton, which is just up the street from this location and not only in a management capacity, but also as a neighbor capacity. I feel as if my experience enables me to understand both the needs of the venue and that of the community and I would just like to thank everyone for their time and pass it along. Thank you is the rest of the people with you, I don't see James or James is here. Okay does James want to make. His comments is James on the phone. He is. He raised his hand in the chat. Okay, Ryan Levan is also here. If you can hear me, okay, Ryan, why don't you go ahead while we figure out James Brian, you've got two minutes. Thank you good evening and thank you to the board for hearing our reconsideration. As you know, the subcommittee has recommended denial of our application for a license at 120 orchard bar. We wanted to ask the full board to reconsider, on the basis that this is a standard application consistent with the transfer of assets of the prior tenant, who had been there with for six years as part of an 18 a year chain of uninterrupted use in substantially the same method. We also the community board. The Licensing committee's proposed stipulation, doesn't take into account in sufficient insufficient notice, the mitigating factors that the fact that we took into account, while caucusing with the community and the community members over the course of over a month to try and address the perceived problems at the location and try and get out ahead and address any potential issues. We've made many proposals to try and curtail the business program. The business plan, including including a robust sound mitigation plan, a traffic mitigation plan, a crowding on the street mitigation plan. We've proposed to put most of our sound down in the basement, which is another buffer, as well as on top of the already existing sound buffering material we have in the ceiling. Additionally, we have, we agreed not to operate under a temp license in order to hear out the community in some we've worked. We worked earnestly and in cooperation with the community member to try and address the concerns. We don't think that those were properly given shrift in the in the sla's resolution and we'd like to respectfully ask the full board to reconsider thanks. Very much. Thank you Ryan Ryan. Do you know is James is the last three digits of Jan's phone number 693? If somebody can tell me what phone number he's on I don't know yeah, let me look it up right now. He is his last his no it's two four six one of the last digits of his phone number: okay, I! Don't have a phone under that so James. If you're on the phone, you, if you can hit Star nine, to raise your hand, that's how you need to raise your hand on the phone and then I'll know it's. You there's only two phone numbers and neither one of them matches that. So, let's go to Cameron hi thanks everyone for your time and for giving us the chance to speak on this topic. In addition to the highlights that Ryan had for us, you know I, think I think we really want to highlight how important it is. You know this is a an existing operator, an existing license for quite a bit of time, and we put a lot of effort into mitigating the issues that were raised by the community. In addition to that, as everyone here is aware, we're in a super unique time. Covid-19 has had a incredible impact on this industry and you know, with most estimates, saying 50 to 75 percent of restaurant hotel and nightclub operations going out of business in New York City. So you know reinvestment in this neighborhood in lower Manhattan in general is critically important right now to the economic recovery, and you know this type of of denial of an existing license by an applicant who is currently licensed in the area. It's very dangerous for future business owners, because it's a risk that most people did not see as being on the books and it will give real pause to people coming in and making the investments like we're. Making. And you know our view- is the city and the neighborhood really need folks right now to look at these types of investments and to hire local people in high-paying jobs and to avoid you know, vacant storefronts in the neighborhood and all those things that are really closely linked to negative outcomes and safe and poor safety and other bad conditions in the neighborhood. And if we have existing licensees in Community board three, who put together good applications and work with the neighbors and are taking over places that have been operating for 17 years and then they're getting denied by the Cbn Community board. It's one more risk in addition to Covid-19 10 pm curfews, higher rents and all the other challenges facing businesses that will stop small businesses coming in and that's not something that's good for the neighborhood. Thank you, Cameron all right, James, let's see there, you are I, think all right. James we've got two minutes James. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, sorry about that hello, everyone, my name is James Whitfield I will also be a part of the management team and as a principal at 120 orchard room. Just a bit about myself. I have roughly 10 years of experience in hospitality in New York, I've worked in nearly every format from fine dining casual dining sports bars. I was even the general manager of a bar up the street in the East village. The last six years, though I focused mainly as an operator of liquor, licenses and hotels. More recently that time it has been spent working with Tao Group and have opened some of their venues here in New York as well. One of the main reasons I was brought into the team. Here was not only my knowledge ofF&Boperations but, more importantly, my experience of overseeing food and beverage operations in New, York hotels and the skill set together instills in its management team I believe my knowledge running operations in a hotel will help and be an asset to everyone, including the local residents. Here, one of the main operational focuses when running a bar and a hotel is keeping your hotel guests separate from your bar guests and ensuring an organized and speedy process as well. Let's guests, arrive and leave. The idea is to make sure that the hotel guests are not intertwined with your bar guests and we have a smooth transition. It is also important as a town management, to always maintain a front-facing image of ourselves in the venue. I believe my background at hotels will help tackle some of the issues brought up by the residents and operationally make our new proposed plan work for everyone involved just to touch again. One of the concerns of the community board was a lack of experience from our team. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to speak during our time in front of the board, but I'm confident in my abilities as an operator to tackle any issues or concerns the board residents may have with the 120 orchard property look forward to working with you guys in the future. I appreciate your time with me this evening. Thank you, James all right. We're going to move on to the next speaker. Adam Cantor. Are you with us Adam you're on the phone hit, Star nine Adam, All right, Sandra Strother, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I didn't do my official form, basically I just want to say thank you to the board for last month and your support in the Grant Street guild. I'm sorry, I'm the president of the Grand Street Guilds, Residents, Association and I just want to thank the board for the resolution. It wrote in support of our endeavor the residents endeavor to protect the future residents and through a forcing management to do a acknowledge, a memorandum of understanding between the residents association and the developer. Last month, I wasn't able to attend. I'm sorry, I fell, asleep. I had worked the early elections and then did a few food distribution that day so I just want to thank my Fellow board members and I want to especially shout out Rodney for adding on to the resolution the need to have the community to assure that the community is used in the construction, giving the community people in the on the lower east side, a preference in getting jobs for the construction. Okay and that's all I want to say. Thank you very much Ford. Thank you, Sandra Stu Peters. Are you with us sue? So, if you're with us, please raise your hand if you're on the phone, it's star, nine, all right. How about Catherine? Sorry about the main pronunciation, the CUNY graduate school Catherine. Are you with us? Okay, that's not so then the last public speaker is me taking off my hat as a board member and talking about the taking on my role vice president and friends of Pearlier, Park I will talk myself just want to thank everyone that came out for our Halloween event last month. It was very successful. I think I want to thank Gail, Brewer and Carlina Rivera for attending as well. We had over 125 families come through the park with about 250 kids, all in a very safe social distant way, and it was a wonderful event and barring any upcoming closures. We will be doing two more events in the coming weekends. This weekend, Sunday November 29th we'll have our annual fall leaf, breakup event from 10 a.m, to 1 p.m, where we will be raking up and bagging the leaves and bringing them over to the lower East side, ecology center for composting. So if you feel like getting your hands dirty on Sunday and working off some of that turkey meal come on out spoilers for park and then the following: Sunday December 6th from 4 to 5 p.m. We will be having our holiday event and tree lighting event, so we'll have a tree in the park again this year. We have lots of giveaways to give the kids again we'll be following all Covid-19 protocols for both of the events taking people's temperatures requiring masks and social distancing. So more information is on our website. Friends of four leaders.org and I hope to see some of you there. Thank you very much so I that will close our public speaking portion unless any of the three people who I called on have magically appeared. So we are going to move to our elected reports and just a reminder again for anyone who might be new to attending a full board meeting during the elected reports, questions are taken only from community board members to the elected officials and or their reps again with the reps. We will be timing, you in two minutes, so please keep it free for the elected officials. We will not be timing you, but we still ask you to keep it free. I, see our borough president is on Gail. Would you like to go first, or do you want to listen in first I'll? Be quick. If you don't mind, cause I got four community boards tonight Michael. Thank you and I loved the Halloween event. I have to say: I went to a lot, but the two girls. They are twins who were post officials, USPS post officials in their costume, but then they pulled out. This was before the election a little mail because they had a mail pouch and it said vote. It was very fabulous. So congratulations. There were many great costumes, but they were phenomenal. So thank you so, just in terms of community board applications, obviously February 1st at five o'clock is the deadline for those who are reapplying and I hope everybody is and for those who are applying for the first time. Second, even though it seems like budget is far away for 22, it's not and so we're having sessions for the communities that want to apply, we don't we're not going to have a lot of money this year. I'll tell you that right now, because it's all based on what the city's capital budget is, we get a percentage each borough, president, so I know the mayor is not going to be spending as much. So I'm also going to be finishing up projects so that as my last year, it doesn't wait for the future just FYI in terms of the schools we try to give as much money to the schools as possible. It's December, 8th in terms of an information session. The actual material application is not due until February, but the December 8th at 4 o'clock to get information and on the borough president's website. You can figure out how to sign on and for non-profits like culturals and others. It's December 10th at 11 o'clock, FYI I just want to talk about the schools in terms of how angry I am I. Think I mentioned this before, but it doesn't get a lot better. So we always put in a lot of money as parents know and principals know, for technology and everything else. It's public schools. If you apply, we will find a way to get you money. So we did that 2020. we're now a year and a half out of that time, and we still have not been able to spend them because we managed to get something called directive 10, which was a memorandum out of the controls office. That says, you have to have basically carts and they have to come out of the closet and they can't leave the school and it has to be networked and it has to be available for five years. We got rid of all that, because I want people to have a laptop or a chromebook like everybody else in the United States. So we got rid of that fine, but guess what between SCA school construction authority and do we? They come up with more challenges so deal. We basically said today that they are supposedly working on it. This is a memorandum that came in today stating that you know, since they had so many problems in September and now they've reached out to 650 schools that receive funding and they're, trying to figure out how to spend it and so on and so forth. It makes me nuts, so we are not giving up, we are still pushing and then the next hurdle, the SCA said. Oh by the way the school has to pay for insurance and the school has to pay for a cover for the device. So no that should be paid for by the Reso a money all right, so I'm just fighting about that and I will continue, because you know better than not how many kids do not have a device. I've been talking about this for years and years in terms of 70 mulberry, which you're only too familiar with I have to say that in my experience of working with facilitators, these facilitators are very good and you know they got a gazillion different perspectives, but I think they've been fair, they've been transparent and that's my experience and listening to many of the participatory discussions. One thing that I'm working on is making sure that, where is the 80 million dollars in the budget literally, where is it listed? So just so, you know I'm like a dog with a bone. When you give me a task and I am going to find that 80 million dollars, but there's many other aspects of the building and I'm aware of it. I want to thank excellent testimony from the community. I know that pier 42 there's a lot of discussions. I know that there's been redesign, but the community listened to a lot more and I know I will in terms of escrow and coast resiliency project the same issue: blower Eastside Ecology center still needs support and we are working on that I. Don't I think you know better than I, but just so you know, I will not give up with their compost or with anything else. That Christina and me I also want to thank community board, 3 and Council member Rivera, because we're working on the catholic church properties, of which there are several in district 3, to figure out how much maximum affordable housing open space and things that you want, and we did have a discussion. We're going to have more and we'd be glad to share that at a different time. But just so you know certainly working with Val, with Cooper Square with the council member Community Board. There's a lot of work to be done there and congratulations on never forgetting any of this. As a community I. Also we're working on Plato bar I can't say that we've been successful but I love. The owner are several situations where, between the CitiBike or hydrant, the rescuer can not have outdoor dining and it's horrible for the individual who runs the restaurant, so we're trying I can't say I've been 100, successful, I will say every single day. I get a problem with public space. I think I mentioned that the municipal arts society, the Time Square alliance, everybody's calling for a public realm. There are 21 agencies, as I have said, before, working in the streets. Just to give an example, you got the issues of sanitation and small business and the health department and the abilities Department and the Homeless Department and the school and the SCR, the state liquor authority and the list goes on. I had one the other day where this restaurant wants to build like a structure. It looks too much like a scaffolding, even though it's in the parking space, So D.O.B said no it. You know you gotta talk to each other, so just so you know. That is not something that anybody should give up on child care slots. We're still focused on 550 of them were pulled out of Manhattan to go to the other boroughs, one in Chinatown in particular a lot in Chinatown as well as other locations, so we're making a huge fuss about it. Hamilton Madison has been phenomenal, Chinese, Planning, Council, Cpc and others, because all we're getting from the city and D.O.E is 3-K that doesn't work you have to have after school and we can not get hurt by not having head start so I'll leave it like that to say we're not giving up on that one either. So many fights we're also meeting pretty regularly with everybody who is an expert in housing. That's affordable, trying to come up with a task force that would make sense, probably not for this mayor. He did put back the money that was cut over 450 million dollars was cut in the budget originally for capital for affordable housing. That is now back, but it's not clear to me exactly what it is going to fulfill in terms of those projects that are in the pipeline. Thank you very much board. Three. Congratulations on everything that you're working on I know. It's a lot and happy thanksgiving, we're all hoping that we don't become yellow. We don't become orange. I was out in the Yellow Zone Uptown yesterday today, I'll be there tomorrow with the health department and others trying to get people to wear a mask, not congregate, and we do not want to be orange because I particularly, and you also spent a lot of time getting the barber shops, the hair, salons, the nail salons and the quote: unquote non-essentials open and it will be a disaster to have them closed. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gail again, Community board members. If you have questions, if you can use the raise hands, function, I appreciate it. We have one question guys so far from Trevor Holland, yes, hi, Trevor, hi Gail. Thank you for all. You do I, don't really have a question just to thank you and that's speaking as a community member and someone who lives in two bridges on Monday. The appellate court obviously didn't further the case that you had with the city council. However, I see that you're going to take it directly to the court of appeals, so I just want to thank you for continuing the fight. There's a lot going on in two bridges on the waterfront and as a resident. We really appreciate what you're doing. Thank you, Trevor Damaris Reyes question yeah hi Gail. Thank you for all the work that you're doing on behalf of our community and our wonderful borough of Manhattan I, really appreciate you. I want I was hoping that maybe you can elaborate a little bit about this housing task force and exactly how members of the task force are being chosen. Sure it's focused to be honest with it's not focused on Nigel you're welcome to join us. It's mostly. What we'll do is like have a topic like one of the topics recently is there's nothing good about this Covid-19, but one thing is we had we have in the city of New York. As you probably know, 700 hotels, I think it's 60 I could be wrong that have either homeless or some tourist not a lot. So then we say okay, so we should be able to purchase some of those hotels for affordable housing. That's an example of what we discuss. We also look. You know it's mostly like development and not tenant. We did you know we're all focused on tenants. We did a discussion last night with tenant rights and I know you do that all the time. It's also the issue of looking at some of the data that the Furman Center has as an example. It's looking at artists, housing, I, get told New, York City can't do artists, housing I! Don't want to hear that I, don't believe it. We did some in east Harlem with Melissa to her credit. It's looking at. Obviously you know it gets into the AMI a little bit, but you can't even build the stuff in Manhattan, so why we even talked about AMI it's looking at supportive housing and the conversion of the single room occupancies. It's that kind of thing to mass, but I'd be glad to bring you up to date. It's kind of like a big picture to be honest with you yeah well, and just for the record. You know we don't only focus on public housing, no I know, but I'm just saying this big picture and I'd be glad to bring you up to date and get you in okay. Great. Thank you Gail. That was the last question appreciate you being here tonight. Thank you. All right, I think we have three other elected officials on I, see assembly, member Harvey, Epstein state, senator Brad, Hoylman and state Senator, Brian Cavanaugh. If there's any other elected officials on please raise your hand to, let me know. In the meantime, we will go to assembly member Harvey Epstein all right good evening. Everyone hope everyone's having a good holiday. Thank you. Aura who's, my deputy chief of staff, for to put our newsletter in the report, and it's obvious. Like everyone knows this, we are difficult times with Covid-19 and we're doing the best we can. Today we are able to work with our community groups with our local elected officials and give out turkeys throughout the district. I think we gave out over 700 really impressive effort, but with with our centers and council colleagues and Congress people really good day likely that we're going to go back to avid, arguably likely we'll go back to Albany in the next couple of weeks, just because we need to do high-income partner attacks. So you have a moment you want to talk to your state, elected officials and your governor. We should be taxed the wealthy right now. We need revenue, not cuts the four billion dollars in cuts that we're seeing coming down the pike. The cuts are specifically going to non-profits and social service providers and that's hurting so many low-income New Yorkers that in the middle of a pandemic it can cut resources, make zero sense, especially the resources that help like less resources are for our staff. It's not good less resources from the non-profits and serving our community. It's not good! It isn't really a mistake in leadership and I, encourage you all to say the same message to the governor recently HCR the housing Office Brian can talk more about this because he's really in tune with this talk, released a report about our rent relief for a tenant, and we allocated a 100 million dollars and HCR has failed to distribute less than 40 million of it. So tenants who are struggling, 1.4 million tenants are behind on the rent and we're not even giving out the 100 million dollars that we allocated. So we really need a real rent relief package, including cancel rent eviction, moratorium, a real comprehensive plan and I'll say that we have really an opportunity before the end of the year when we go back, hopefully to vote on the revenue to do some serious criminal justice reform. You know people who are incarcerated, who are at risk of illness and dying states around the country, are doing clemency. We've seen that in every large state, from California to New, Jersey Massachusetts, unfortunately, New York lags far behind and we're not doing clemency for folks who have been incarcerated. The data is really good that people who have been in prison for 15 years or longer, you know, and over 55 are unlikely to receive it be resilient, less than 5 recidivism rate, but with those people now being locked up costing us, you know each over a hundred thousand dollars in prison and the risk of them dying is even higher because of Covid-19. So we're trying to grant we're going to have the governor grant clemency as much as possible and also to let people go who have been incarcerated, and so if people are online with doing that, I think we have real opportunity. Finally, this the super majority, both in the assembly and the Senate. Well, we saw this week that we have that in both the houses of the legislature. So it's a you know, it's a message that I think we should take home was like the progressive approach of reforming our balance system, repealing 50A housing, initiating support for tenants. The voters went to the polls this November and supported all that approach, and so now we have the opportunity to further elaborate on those things that we fought for over the last year and a half and I hope that you will join me and my Senate colleagues to make sure that happens. Thank you and if you have a question, I'm happy to take it, but the next hopefully you'll all walk away with. Is we need you not guts and share that with the governor thanks Harvey, we have a couple of questions for you: Michelle Cooper, Smith hi. Sorry, thank you for being here. I have a question. You mentioned the 100 million dollars in rent relief that was allocated but I believe it's actually like 60 million that hasn't been distributed, and the reporter asked governor Cuomo about this earlier, the in the week and his Sec Melissa De Rosa said that it was the legislature's responsibility to come back and reset the stipulations, because apparently I mean maybe the applications didn't fit the requirements. So I guess my two questions are a is that true is the legislature, the only one that can fix it and b? Will you be fixing it so that the money is fully distributed because there's a deadline on December 30th for using it? Thank you yeah, so yeah for the 100 million dollars. We spent less than 40 of it, which means there's over 60, left and I. Think there's two things: one is 93,000 people applied. They have failed to even in this report, they release two weeks ago process over 11,000 applications. So that's a real problem. Two I agree that the with the governor that the program was too restrictive and we need to have much more expensive program and I. Think everyone on the assembly in the Senate really wants a more robust program and I was unfortunate. It was such a restrictive program, but that doesn't absolve the government's responsibility of advertising it to the 1.4 million tenants who are behind in their end and to make a program. That's simple that was really. The application process is extremely complicated, so I think the legislature built an hour program because we only had 100 million. We wanted to have 500 million, but the governor only went after 30. So we put, we created a more restricted program because the governor wanted less money and I think we should have a much more robust program with more opportunities for our people to apply. So we can just say it's on responsibility of the legislature and we will make a more robust program, but it's really his responsibility to help tenants and it's his actions that created the most restrictive program that we could pass. Thank you assembly. Member next question is from Kay Webster hi Harvey. How are you good I wanted to ask you about? There's a bill. A health equity assessment bill. That's going forward that Senator, Rivera and Assemblyman Gottfried have put forward, which is really trying to require a health equity assessment before a certificate of need can be given to a hospital or nursing home for transfer, downsize or whatever or closing. And I'm just wondering if, if you have thoughts about that, and also in particular, because Democrats have a majority that there might be a shot at actually getting more seats for consumers on the public, health and Health Planning Council, which determines who just who actually decides who owns things and in terms of the health facilities and I know Stanford just did a survey that said that over half of all people who died in hospitals were black or hispanic and then there's many other inequities, women etc. So I have the same question for Senator Hoyleman, Cavanaugh, Assemblymember Glick, so I don't waste time asking again, but if, if you've looked at it thought about, it would love to hear yeah just on the hospital issue. As you probably know, I was out front. When you know Mount Sinai has been trying to close bed at Israel. I was opposed to the closing. We wrote that we wanted more beds, not less beds in our community. We have been working on getting more people on the board, I think Senator, Hoyleman and I wrote a letter, maybe six months ago or a year ago trying to get better representation on the board. I've worked with health advocates that we really want to have a robust oversight and really not allow this closures to move forward. So that's clear on the bill that you're into Godfrey Bill, I'm not 100, sure I've looked at it. I can't I, don't know the number of top my head, but I really trusted someone. Remember Godfrey, who knows you've been chair of the health committee for decades and those issue issues inside and out and I 100 agree that you know that we need a more robust oversight and we need a better health care system. We need a New, York, Health, Act, best and I. Think we can. We have the power to do that this year. Even if the governor opposes us so there's a lot, we can do right now on health care. A lot we can do on criminal justice reform a lot. What we can do on the environment- and we just have to we just need to step forward and just do all those things. Yes, thank you, and you know that Mount Sinai is now reconsidering, I'm sure you know yeah, because we were right and they were wrong. Yes, absolutely thank you, Assam, the member. That was our last question, for you have a good day. Thank you and have a good holiday. Everyone enjoy it and what the Borah President said about ecology, center I forgot to say 100 in we need to save it. You know for our community. Thank you, I believe Senator Cavanaugh might have dropped off, so we'll go to Senator, Hoyleman, always happy to fill in when Senator Cavanaugh drops off and I am here. So go ahead. Brad I'll just be nice about me, though. I will I and Brian has done amazing work in on in the housing area. We all know that so suffice to say that our conference is looking at that very issue. That Harvey was asked about the 100 million, the 40 million unspent, and of course it can be. You know that money could be sent out the door by you know: executive order. Albany doesn't need to reconvene to get tenant that relief, but we're having meetings about that very issue between the governor and the Senate conference. But I want to just talk about a few things briefly. One is that, pursuant to the last question about I'll answer that first, the legislation that I passed with assembly member Gottfried to increase consumer representation on the public health and Health Planning Council, because right now it is far easier to close hospitals than it is to open a hospital, and we need more consumer representatives and that's what the bill that assembly member, Gottfried and I passed does. It adds three consumer representatives to that council Fitbit. It's called it's sitting on the governor's desk, we're negotiating, possibly some chapter amendments, but I'm hopeful that we can get that bill signed because we have seen that closing hospitals is bad for everyone and I'm glad that Beth Israel is rethinking that strategy at the insistence of the community. Secondly, I wanted you to know that I participated in a vaccine trial. I am a pro-vaccine legislator. I think many of you know, and and what we're needing, though, to look at is when we do have all these vaccines. How do we get them distributed and what's going to be the priority and how do seniors and our vulnerable populations get them and I? I'm hopeful that we can work out a plan and have some public participation on that, but I just wanted to know that's top of mind for me. I wanted. You also to know. Third. Is that a bill that I passed in the legislature that allows you to easily cancel your gym membership online was signed by the governor. It's going to also crack down on businesses that mislead consumers through very convoluted automatic renewal or continuous service schemes. You know where they say free trial, but they don't tell you that you're automatically signed up for life, basically long and short, it's going to give the attorney general new powers to crack down on those types of consumer frauds which is really necessary, particularly during this pandemic. The governor also signed another bill of mine fourth item, which is a bill that restricts so-called strategic lawsuits against public participation or slack lawsuits. Those are lawsuits that are off often fired by rich and powerful entities or individuals like real estate interests or Donald Trump, who has sued a range of people to try to get them to shut up and their criticism of him. Everyone, ranging from Bill Maher to miss America. These lawsuits, you know, have blossomed and they're, often used to target, not just critics but advocates like our own Michael Mckee from Tenex pack, who was sued for 40 million dollars by the Rent Stabilization Association, because he dared to speak out in support of the new rent laws at city Hall. Well, this new law is going to allow the plaintiffs it's going to require that the plaintiffs pay the defendants fees, if a judge if they lose a lawsuit and the judge determines that it was being used to silence them. I had a press conference on that recently. I've also passed. I've also proposed legislation that we're calling the Pandemic Self Storage Act. That would prevent self storage unit auctions from occurring across New York state during the pandemic, and this is really top of mind, because just this afternoon a constituent called and her personal possessions are going to be on the block tomorrow at 11 a.m, due to a self-storage company. That is auctioning them off we've, you know issued a very firm statement. We hope that the storage unit operator rethinks this, but we need this bill to be passed because it's crazy. It's also incredibly heartless to do this on the day before Thanksgiving, not to mention the fact. This is this woman, a senior her personal possessions and her small business items are going to be sold off tomorrow. Unless we can stop it so I'll keep you updated on that and then a lot of other items in my newsletter that you can read I wanted to acknowledge my colleague, Caroline Lexelbaum, who many of you know and I think Jacob Riley. My other colleague is on substituting for Caroline, but I proposed a bill that would crack down on illegal street racing. I know we've experienced that in this neighborhood and across the entire city we're calling it the furious act named after that you know classic film fast and furious, but it's going to authorize New York City to operate speed, camera program both overnight and on weekends, to catch some of these jackasses, which is all like what I can call them, who are making it less safe and keeping us up at night as well as change the definition of what a illegal street racing is right now the statute requires you to actually sit down and plan your route in advance in order to be charged with this infraction that's crazy. Nobody sits down and plans the speed racing route, so it would be impossible to charge anyone with that, but so we're going to try to change that and then finally, a bill that I'm very proud of called the restoration of Honor Act, went into effect just on November 12th, and what it's going to do is restore benefits to veterans who were just charged by virtue of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Under don't ask don't tell I'm very proud that we have fixed that stain on our nation's veteran history through this law. I hope we can pass it at the federal level, because there are a lot of federal benefits that these individuals have been denied to. Thank you very much happy to take any questions or hand it over to my esteemed colleague, Brian Cavanaugh, to answer all the questions well before we do that. We have one question for you so far from Michelle, Cooper, Smith, all right, hi, senator hello, and thank you for proactively asking answering my question about how the unspent rent relief it's been top of mind. I'm I was on the Soho Noho rezoning meeting a couple of weeks ago. I believe it was October, 26th and I was just wondering if you would be willing to explain your comment about how you thought that the rezoning was the equivalent to the Amy Coney Barrett of Rizonins I mean just from my perspective. Bdb has a lot more time in office than Trump and it's a little bit of a different impact. So I just was hoping that you could explain that because I was on it. So thank you sure it was a bit of a flip comment. I will acknowledge that. My point is that this is a complicated rezoning and time is running out and and the mayor's losing staff left right and Center Polly Trottenberg, you know one of his greatest assets just is stepping down this month. So to be very honest, I think confidence. Public confidence in the De Blasio administration is on the wane, so I think it's something we have to consider. That doesn't mean right is David Duncan. That doesn't mean that we can't, you know, figure this out together as a community. If we can understand a few principles which is height, restrictions, maximizing, affordable housing and protecting the historic district as well as not bleeding into you know, other neighborhoods through you know gentrification. So there's a lot to unpack in this proposal. I'll be coming out with my ideas: I'll be working closely with Senator, Cavanaugh and and Councilmember Rivera in particular, with Councilmember Rivera and I actually share part of the Noho district. So the comment was: was flip, I thought maybe too I thought clever, but maybe not as funny once I said it. Thank you. Senator Hoyle man, I appreciate it. Senator Cavanaugh I have to apologize. I looked for your name under B for Brian, but you changed your name to Senator Cavanaugh. So next time, I'll look under s. Thank you. I'm not sure why I'm not sure what algorithm decided. That's, how I get labeled by this and I appreciate Senator Hoyleman's, you know commentary on his humor I. Also I want to question his taste in movies from his earlier commentary, because I've seen fast and furious and it ain't no classic jackass, never mind. I'm gonna move on from the movie theme. Let me just so just first of all, I want to you know, join those who mentioned you know: we've had election day since the last time we were all together and I. You know. First of all, you know appreciate the great opportunity to continue to serve this community, along with my great colleagues, several of whom you've heard from tonight, and just to note that it is I. Think a remarkable thing that, after you know an extraordinarily active and very proactive session, that we seem to be the voters of the state. What statewide voters seem to be returning. Nearly all of the incumbent Democrats are still a few races that are out there plus adding a few to our majority. We look like we're going to have 42 or 43 of the seats. As the you know, the democratic majority of in the 63 seat Senate. So just you know again. I know this is a non-partisan setting, but just in terms of the the direction that we're going I think you know we're likely to see continued kind of robust representation in our majority and, of course, joining our assembly. Colleagues as well just on the housing thing I, you know, I think we've covered this pretty thoroughly already my colleagues, but you know the 100 million dollar emergency rent relief program. It is I think, in my view, critical that we ensure that hundred million dollars gets spent for the purpose that we intended it for which is to provide rent relief, and there are various routes to doing that, including a gubernatorial executive order or the legislature could act or- and there is some possibility that HCR the housing agency could just make some administrative changes that might get additional money out the door, but I also do want to emphasize that in its best version it is a tiny fraction of the need. I, think I've said this on this call before, but our push at the federal level is for 10 billion dollars with a b that is 100 times as much as 100 million dollars. So, although we will be focusing on ensuring that money get out the door, it's kind of a unfinished business for 2020, we really are looking ahead to try to ensure that we get the resources in place to address the much broader rental housing crisis. To ensure that the you know, this public health crisis does not become a kind of eviction homelessness crisis. You know we knew. We know that those were already serious problems before code and we certainly don't want. You know people to be stuck with either giant arrears or certainly not evictions, and you know Senator Hoyleman's bill. The Tenancy Farmer Act has provided some real predictions as well, but there's a lot more work to be done. Second, just critical housing issue at the moment is the status of the eviction moratorium. We again senator and I, and a lot of our colleagues had joined together right at the very beginning of the pandemic, to insist that there be a complete moratorium on residential evictions and we had we obtained that early on for the first 90 days until June 20th. There have been modifications since then. There's been a number of phases of this and I'll spare you the details, but the current status is that the eviction moratorium is not comprehensive enough to prevent residential evictions. Most tenants will be protected if you have a hardship and the basis for your eviction is non-payment of rent you're supposed to not be subject to eviction, but we are pushing for a blanket moratorium to be back in place, especially as our numbers go up in New York and around in New York City and around the state on Covid-19. So again, this is a primarily been a function of the governor's executive order authority and some administrative orders from the courts, but either legislatively or through pressure on the governor to address that I think we really must achieve that to ensure that we don't have evictions and again they are beginning in limited ways, but that's going to grow over time, and so this is that's really urgent. I just I know you have a long agenda and you've covered a lot of ground tonight. Just you know, I'm just I don't want to cover stuff that other people talked about just a couple local issues. We've got a we're working collaboratively with my colleagues and with Cooper Square Committee and others at 174, Forsyth Street, which is a building that has really it's a HUD funded building that is housing folks, with with hearing challenges and the conditions there are very poor and we've been working to try to we're going to try to address that Morton with Nydia Velazquez, and you know all of our colleagues, Yulin and Margaret Chin's offices as well and Gail's office has been involved, and we also we've seen a number of instances where there have been gatherings. You know, obviously, we've been Tac, we've all been working on trying to get the balance right with nightlife and make sure it's not. You know that restaurants have ability to function, but not imposing you know undue quality of life concerns on our communities, but we've also seen instances where there are private gatherings, including rooftops, and so my colleagues, especially Council member Rivera and Seminar Epstein and I, have written to the management of some buildings on east, 2nd and East 3rd street. It was a site where somebody actually tragically fell and miraculously survived. You know without apparently very serious injury from the rooftop, but we are trying to get you know, landlords to be responsible about what's going on in public areas of their buildings. So that's something that you know. We I think that should be a copy of that in the materials we're providing I. Think I know it's a long. You have a long meeting ahead and you've heard a lot from state. Reps I think I will end there. I am happy to take questions and concerns. Thank you. Senator Evan we've got a question from Kate Webster hi Senator Cavanaugh. Thank you for your report and I do want to echo that I love when I love, Senator Heiman, admitting that it wasn't the best joke, but we've all done that so I want to ask you also about the health equity assessment bill and the Fitbit question, because the lack of representation, you know the results. You know with Rivington. You knew it was Beth Israel, but also as Covid-19 rises. I. I'm not sure that we've really tackled what's happened in nursing homes and it looks like we're in jeopardy again and the downsizing the elimination of hospitals in Queens really caused that community to go under same with the Bronx and Manhattan is in danger of parts of it becoming over bedded and, as you know, our community also is in danger of losing something. Although Mount Sinai has rethought, but I don't think we want to leave it up to these hospital systems, so yeah and I think it's I think that we have you know. I have had various versions of this conversation before, but I think we were always told that you know they're right-sizing our system and you know making, and you know we don't need all this capacity, and obviously certainly we learned in March and April and may that you know not having capacity is critical and certainly you know the results. You know the impact of Covid-19 was. You know a very good example of very disparate impacts, depending on where you lived and so I. You know the bill you're talking about I, think was introduced just in October and I. Have this is the Senate Center Rivera and somewhere in guthriesville it look I'll say it looks good. It looks logical to me, I, haven't you know my name's not on it yet I haven't I will take a closer look, but I have seen it and you know for those who aren't familiar. It basically requires a health equity assessment as part of the process for constructing new facilities or reducing or eliminating them. So it certainly seems like a smart, sensible approach to me and I will probably put my name on it soon, but I'll take a closer look before I commit to that. Thank you and making sure fific is properly responsive and representative is really important too. Thank you. We have another question from Eric Diaz hello. Can you hear me sorry, yes hi, how are you I, attended? Kavanaugh I wanted to say that I'm heartened to hear about the 174 foresight. Is there any specific details or any kind of plans? I know you kind of you may have mentioned it. I just want to make sure I heard it and understood it, and let you know that we're supporting 174 foresight as well yeah and just want to hear more and thank you- I mean we're honestly we're trying to get. It feels like an issue where we need additional oversight for the landlord. It's not you know it's a matter of poor conditions. Poor maintenance, limited access to the spaces in the building that are supposed to be common spaces that are available, inadequate communication with tenants and respect for tenants and just some poor conditions. So we walked through it. You know we had a press event in front of the building, but we're just. We are we're in the process and again I, don't know if Congressman Velasquez is represented here, but our office has been instrumental in reaching out to HUD and pushing for you know we're more just we're. You know this has been something that's come up in the last couple weeks, we're pushing aggressively and I know you guys have been involved there as well and so on. There have been some other good local organizations that have also had some involvement. There but we're getting everybody together, we'll stay in touch with you about it and I, don't have any specific update other than to say we're on top of it and we're going to make sure that the tenants get a better, get better conditions and better outcomes. Thank you so much Senator Kavanagh and yes, please continue to move forward. Good fight. Thank you. They need it yeah. Thank you, Eric senator. We have one last question for you from our chair: Alicia Lewis, Coleman, Hi, Senator Cavanaugh. Thank you for coming out tonight and happy holidays to you, and your family I also wanted to piggyback on what Eric just said about 174 Forsight street. They these residents have really I mean, have really gone through for a very long time, and there are no social workers on staff there and I think it is very important not just for 174, but the building. That's right next door to it as well. They're both represented by the same management company and no one has reached out to help them so I mean I'm glad that you are part of the organization of helping to reorganize the residents. They don't know how to organize themselves so any help that could happen there around organization if there are local community based organizations that could help them, because they are a very special group of people and they are my neighbors and I love them very much. Thank you right. Yeah I appreciate that much and again, I mentioned Cooper. Square Committee has also been involved in organizing and I think, but we will stay in touch with you as well about that and I again. I appreciate the you know the support for that effort here at the board and I just say that just add, because that part of the Sarah Roosevelt Park, is that a lot of the issues of why they can't easily organize and they're? Actually some of them do is a is interpretation. There's no signing every time we have a meeting, we've had to have volunteers, so if we could have somehow signers assigned to every meeting we had we used to do it here. It would be huge in terms of not being marginalized. So thank you. Senator that's a very good point as well, and we did have you know. Volunteers at the press event, we did as well, but we'll keep working on it. Yes, thank you. Senator have a good thanksgiving. Thank you. Everybody same to all of you and be safe. Thank you. All right, I do not see any other elected officials on so we're gonna. Go to the representative reports. Reminder keep it brief. Two minutes: I'm gonna try not to use the timer, but if people start going over, I will turn the timer on is Andrew from Mayor De Blasio's office on or Phillip from public advocate to Money, Williams Office. All right, then we're going to go to Luke Wolfe from the comptroller's office. Luke, everyone nice to see you all and wish you all happy thanksgiving later this week. So a few updates from our office I want to share and the first about our response to the Covid-19 health crisis. So at the start of the pandemic, the comptroller launched an investigation into how the city responded in those early days and weeks and asked for documents and information from all the city agencies who were relevant to the pandemic figuring out what happened? What went white right and what went wrong after being continually stonewalled and to this day I've only received excuse me, have not received a single document for city hall. Last week we actually took the administration to court to try to get them to comply with our Sabina and actually follow through on that investigation. Our goal here is to figure out what happened in those early days and weeks. So now, as the second wave is coming, and we deal with this in the coming months, we can make sure we can help give recommendations to tailor our public health response to our needs, so we'll continue to push on that and make sure that our city is responding as effectively and efficiently as possible to the health pandemic. Second, the comptroller put out an op-ed on a topic which I know is very important to Cv3, which is on police accountability. So he put out a few recommendations on how to reform and strengthen the Ccrb. The first would be granting the Ccrb the power to make final disciplinary decisions which something they currently do not have in their advisory role. The second would be removing the NYPD office of trials, which currently reviews most of the serious Ccrb cases and instead putting that jurisdiction with the Ccrb and the last is further expanding their jurisdiction and powers to make sure they can have real accountability for when there is inappropriate action by police officers. So I can drop that link in the chat for everyone to review, but that is just the start of a plan to make sure that we're holding everyone accountable, and the last thing I really want to touch upon is on remote learning. We have been working hard on proposals to close the digital divide. There are currently a hundred thousand students without Wi-fi access across our city, thirteen thousand students across shelters. We put out plans to one close, the digital divide for those 100,000 students, but also focusing on the students in shelters as well, especially when all students are learning remotely now all of the time. We really need to make sure that they have access to education and right now that means access to internet and the tools of technology to go with it. So I'll drop links to the chat as well as my email, but have to take any questions on those two things that brought up. Thank you, Luke. Are there any questions for the comptroller's office and board members all right, I think we're good Luke. Thank you. Have a good holiday Thanksgiving Everybody, Congresswoman Congress member of Blackface's office link, Shaw hi, everyone, the congresswoman they'll, ask us, wish everybody a great Thanksgiving holiday. Today she was she. You know: she's been busy going around distributing turkeys for those for those community members who are less fortunate and, and then tomorrow's gonna be another turkey day. Just as Senator Kavanaugh mentioned Congresswoman, our has Congressman Velazquez has been doing a great deal of work, pushing putting pressure on NYCHA to come up with a plan to improve their Covid-19 preparedness and the response to keep residents safe as winter coming up. People are spending more time outdoors and it's unacceptable that that serves some of the conditions in some of the buildings. Along with the reason led reports, she and Senator Gillibrand have joined forces together to put pressure on NYCHA and a congresswoman was on the ground of 174 forside street last week to visit the ground and then to get first-hand information from the residents and the management, and that's it thanks. Thank you. Thanks for having me questions for the Congress member's office, all right come and see honey. Thank you have a good holiday. You too, Victor from Calallen Maloney's office. Are you with us tonight Victor or anybody from Kyla Maloney's office, all right we're going to go to Siobhany from Eulen's office hi, everyone I will keep it pretty short tonight. The assembly member also has been out and about a lot recently delivering turkeys and tomorrow, she'll be delivering hot meals. So that's been a big focus of this week and you know logistically figuring that all out the other thing that she's been really focused on is the committee meetings for 70 mulberry. She continues to really prioritize and make known that we need to have community engagement and she'll continue to be involved and push for as much community engagement as possible. Moving forward with that, she is also our office has received a lot of complaints about heat and gas and hot water, outages and Nycha's. So that's something that she also is continuing to communicate with NYCHA about oh, like figure out whatever she can do to help residents and then finally, yeah just continue to PPE and food distribution. As I say every single month, I feel like I sound like a broken record, but if you ever, if you need PPE or you know of anyone who does please feel free to reach out to our office and I- think that's all I have thank you. Siobhani any questions. All right have a good night Bonnie. Thank you, too Charlie Anderson from Doubleclick's office hi good evening, everyone Charlie Anderson from Deborah Glick's office. I'm going to echo the same comments as my colleague Shavani. The assembly member has been out over the last few months earlier this month as well, delivering Pppe and other items to some of our local community partners. I have one update this evening and then I will be done. As you all know, in 2019 the state legislature changed election laws that allowed to allow for early voting this year, and this was the first year that the state of New York did this. On December 9th from 5:30 to 8:30 pm the New York City, voter Assistance advisory committee is going to be holding a hearing to gather feedback on early voting throughout this year. If you have comments, anything you wish to share talk about your experience and so on, I would encourage you to participate in that hearing and share testimony I believe you can do it either in person not in person. Obviously, but over zoom be able to read your testimony or you can submit comments as well. All that information is going to go to the elected officials, including your state, elected officials and they'll, be able to hear that I will drop. The link to that meeting in the chat here, I believe on our board report. The link might be dead, but you can I'm sorry about that. That's my fault, but you can always copy that link, search it in Google and find the correct one, but it will be corrected in our end of the month. E-Blast as well. That's the only thing I was going to mention tonight. Unless there are questions, that's it from me. Thank you. Charlie! Do we have any questions office all right, thanks, Charlotte Thanksgiving, all right, Connor Irvin from Council member Margaret, Chin's office, hello. Also just introduced myself. My name is Connor. I came from another council member's office, but I've never met all of you so nice to meet everyone. I am council, merchants, communications and legislative director. So some brief updates. So last Thursday the council voted on a historic age scrim agent package. This is something that market's been working on for a long time and something she introduced last year. So we're very excited to see it voted on and it did pass. It will combat age discrimination in the workforce. By creating a center for workforce development for older adults, it will provide training and resources. I'm sorry, my computer just went black. It also does a bunch of mandates on the commission of Human rights and department for the aging to work to provide some recommendations and reports and studies on age, discrimination and council merchant is thankful for all of her colleagues support and is committed to providing older, New Yorkers with the support they need in these difficult times, and you know as chair of aging committee. Some other updates are that the MTA announced that starting December 1st there will be split tolling coming to Verrazano Nero's bridge. We're also very excited about that. That's something that she's been advocating for a long time and we're hopeful that will reduce the amount of traffic, noise and car pollution on canal leading up to the Holland tunnel. So we're really excited about that some local updates. So we have partnered with Chinatown bid to create the homework hub. It's hosted by streets lab and it allows all New York City students to gather and get help with homework safely. You can sign up and get time with a tutor with any homework helper like just practicing reading, and there are heat lamps and snacks provided, and it is on Deuter Street. On Mondays from two to five. We also joined a rally to celebrate international street vendors on November 12th, because council Virgin is the prime sponsor of introduction 1116, which is working to help vendors, get relief and support. They need to eliminate our city's black market for fending licenses and to just bring them justice to these immigrant entrepreneurs. We also want to plug our community first food pantry. We are approaching nine months of of hard work. We partner with Ua3 to combat rising food and security, and last week we delivered 500 boxes of fresh produce, milk, durian grains to Rutgers houses, and you can sign up to help volunteer also just from listening. I wanted to say about 174 foresight, so Cooper Square is actually no longer part of the organizing process and they, the tenants, are looking to organize, but Coopersquare informed us that they're not helping on that advisory level anymore and we're looking into ways that the city can help pay for translators and I hope that everyone has a healthy and safe thanksgiving and my email I'll put in the chat, but please feel free to reach out to Margaret's email chin at council.nyc.gov with any concerns. Thank you. Connor I appreciate it. Welcome to your first community board 3 meeting. There is one question from a board member Olympia cause he's asking. If you can repeat the tutoring opportunity details sure so let me scroll back up, so it's called. Where is it? It's called homework hub? It's really cute I saw it myself. They set up this like area with heat lamps and they give snacks and drinks to students if they want to go sit with a tutor and get help with homework. A lot of it is like practicing reading. There were some young kids there when I saw it, but if you have more specific people sign up for it. I can give you that information, so yeah I'll put my email in the chat and just send me an email and I'll. Let you guys know great. Thank you, Connor any other questions for council member Chin's office. All right we're going to go to Isabel Chandler from Council member Rivera's office hi good evening. Everyone nice to see you I will try to be very brief. Councilmember Rivera, we are working to address heat outages, gas outages as they come up in the community, specifically Haven Plaza, as many of you may know, has experienced heat outages. We have been working with both residents and management to advocate for the restoration of heating, as well as working with management to get gift cards and other support for residents experiencing the loss of their heating. In addition, Officer Garcia of the NYPD resigned before his administrative trial. I know. Many of you shared concerns about next steps. After his violent assault of Donnie Wright in the district, and while we are certainly glad that he no longer works at the NYPD he's also still receiving benefits and his pensions, which is exactly why Councilmember Rivera is fighting to call for the mayor to ban escalation tactics and violence that creates situations like that one. As Senator Kavanaugh mentioned, we are working with other offices to address the uprise uptick in concerns about partying in the neighborhood, as it relates to social distancing. You know we want everyone to be safe and the governor you know recently released a mandate to limit gatherings to 10 people. We've been working with individual tenants and buildings to address this, but if you know of anyone who is experiencing this or has concerns, please do feel free to reach out to our office. And finally, as we are experiencing, you know a rise in Covid-19 numbers concerns about community health and Safety. Councilmember Rivera has held I, hear held a hearing this month in November about the public hospital system and their preparation for the second wave she's been advocating for the pooling of resources so that we can better serve communities if we experience and as we experience higher rates of cases, and we have two upcoming hearings in December, one on the upcoming vaccines and how they will be distributed and the other on the maternal mortality crisis in New York City. So if either of those, if you are interested or have questions about them, feel free to reach out to me and find sorry I already said. Finally, but really finally, I added the November 2020 newsletter from our team in the chat so feel free to look through for updates or reach out to me directly. Thank you, Michael, sorry to let's go on, don't worry about it. I don't have any questions for council member Romero's office.

If you could explain it again, I am the nominating committee. I'm sorry, I'm the chair, I hate to if Val just went away for a little bit, I hate to disenfranchise her, because we know she's here. She was here before the meeting started and she definitely had the ability to talk, because she was asking me some questions about how to vote and I do and I just saw Felicia Khrushchev just came on okay on but I was on another format. I, don't know I've heard everything that was said. I took notes. Okay, are you like? Are you a? Yes? Are you a yes in the minutes? Yeah all right? Thank you! You're franchised, I'm sorry, I have a question. Were we voting on the minutes that wasn't announced I announced at the beginning of roll call that we were voting on the minutes and taking attendance, but then Michelle added the disclaimer that the attendance was also going to be used to determine whether you were present to vote, which is why I think half of you said present instead of yes, okay, but, yes, we were voting on the minutes and taking attendance. Alicia this is your chair. Okay, we're gonna move forward because I don't know where Val is at, but that's okay. We can always come back. If that's okay with you Linda can't we know that Val is present. Will that be all right with the committee? Yes, it's okay! Thank you, Linda! Thank you all right so good evening.

I was actually opening it up. While thank you very much, no problem, okay, everybody! So now let me see why can't I see that the vote sheet scoochie over. Thank you! Okay. So we have one item that we voted on at executive office Michael. Can we center that a little more okay? Thank you! I'm sorry! I'm you want me to go up to the item. I'm sorry, I'm confused! Where you want me to go. No, I'm sorry nominating committee. That's up to you guys nominating Linda. What's your goal? Sorry, Linda! Okay! So folks, I think, as you all know, because we're zooming and we're not in the room, we can't vote in the way we always have conventionally done so we have come up with an online ballot which can be reached by clicking on the link in the email that was sent to you shortly before the meeting, but before we do that we're going to have presentations from all of our members. All of our candidates is everybody: okay, with understanding how to use the link and go to the ballot? Okay. If you start having problems with that, we have some email addresses and phone numbers, you can contact or you can raise your hand and I'll try to help you Linda Richard Ropiak raised his hand physically. So I don't know if that means he has a question or not. Linda earlier I tried to log in to the election page and I did I was not able to access it. I spoke with Paul and Paul said that, as the voting proceeds, I will call Paul and phone my decisions in them. That's fine, okay, that's allowed. Some people may be only on a telephone and not be able to go to the email or you may have a problem with it. So we have backup, we have Paul and we have Robin as backup and they can put your vote in and Linda Val is back and has a question val. You have to unmute yourself, yes, I, apologize, I have a question. What is it you want me to do? First of all, we want you to be here so that you count, and so you can vote and you are you need to say. Yes, if you approve the minutes, you need to say yes for approval of the minutes and the roll call attendance spell. Okay, yes and yes for roll call, attendance. Okay, so we're going to have a presentation from each candidate first and then it will be time to vote and that's when you go to your email and click, the link and vote Linda. There's one more question from charter Trevor, not a question, but I just want to thank the nominated Committee for putting this together. I know: it's been a difficult year trying to come up. Creative ways to make sure we can vote and not be disenfranchised as Michelle has mentioned, but just thank you to the economy and committee for coming up with this procedure. Well, on behalf of a lot of hard working committee, members I. Thank you. Okay, we're ready to go with the presentations. Let me get my list up, so we do it in the right sequence. We'll start at the top with the candidates for chair and the first speak. Oh I should also say you have two minutes and I think we are planning to put up the clock for you. So you'll know the first speaker will be Alicia, Lewis Coleman. Thank you everyone again for considering to continue to support me as your board chair, having an opportunity to serve you in our community as chair for the past. Two years has been a honor and a privilege for me, especially as Covid-19 brought about an unprecedented challenges for our, which is located in the east village, on East 11th Street in 1St Avenue, and since the height of the pandemic, I went from serving children to now serving the adults that come to the door every day and I get to see firsthand what covett is doing to destroy our community as far as people having food deprivation, one of the major priorities over the past year has been to increase representation on our board across our board, because CB3 is so wonderfully made of an eclectic amount of people with different backgrounds. Cultural diversity and the such I want to continue to have our community reflect that. Our leadership reflect that and the goal is to work towards appointing new committee members as they would like to be in leadership roles. I would like to encourage the newer members to reach out to me. I also want to continue to review the operations of our board and the committees, and if there are any issues that are going on I'd like for members to reach out to me directly and don't be afraid to tell me when something is not right, because that's the only way we're gonna fix things if we again address them and not wait until the last minute to say this is happening and that's happening. We can only work together as a team if we are connected as a team I. Thank you again for all your support and I wish that you will continue to allow me to be your chair. Thank you, Michael Mourinho, I'm muted, myself. There we go sorry about that. Thank you, Linda and right, don't worry about it. I can keep talking. I am I had the opportunity over the past few weeks to speak to many of you one-on-one, you read my candidate statement. I, don't want to be repetitive in what I've already talked about and what I've put out there. But what I thought I'd do tonight is spend a little bit of time. Just telling you a little bit about me because a lot of what I've heard from people is that they don't really know who I am so I'll tell you a little bit of personal stuff about me. I've had basically three careers in my professional life. I started out as a theatrical stage manager and then a special event. Producer I was part of the team that produced the Aids walk here in New York and the Aids dance of bonds in the 90s. When we still did those Javits center, then transitioned into a career in non-profit, fundraising and development, helping raise millions of dollars for various different organizations, including Broadway, cares Equity fight dates and gay men's health crisis and the Empire State pride agenda, and for over the past decade and a half, probably I've been working in higher Ed Administration, specifically research administration. So currently I'm the executive director of sponsored projects for Long Island University. Basically, what that means is that I manage all the aspects of funding from private entities, local and state and federal governments in relation to faculty research and student scholarships. Part of that means that I have to ensure that the university is compliant with the various rules and regulations placed on the funding given to us and deal with contracts and compliance and all that fun stuff. That comes with all of that money. So again, I just wanted to give you a little bit of glimpse of my professional career, and maybe that helps you understand why I think I can transfer some of those skills into being the chair of the community Board. Thank you, Michael. Okay, we're going to talk, have the candidates for first vice chair now, the first one is Lisa. Kaplan thanks, I appreciate this opportunity to introduce or reintroduce myself to each of my fellow board members. As you probably read from my written statement, I have a considerable amount of relevant experience. Working in this community I was first appointed to CB3 in 1977 and served as the chair of the board back in the year 2000 during the 9:11 crisis, and I've served a chair of several committees and task forces over the years this past year, I served as second vice chair of the board. I've also had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of this community and how city government works when I served for six years as Rosie Mendes Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, his chief of staff, I've been active in both staff and board numerous community organizations over the past 40 years I take my role as an officer of this board real seriously and with my experience as a backdrop I believe I've been able to constructively assist the sport in its operations and effectively to effectively represent our neighborhood one example of how I've done this during the past year is the next item on our agenda tonight. The executive committee I item regarding clarifying when a resolution may or may not be considered on a committee agenda. I saw that both board members and the general public were not always clear on whether Abrezzo could be entertained and I suggested to the executive committee that the policy be clarified. They agreed. They asked me to draft a policy statement and I did that and my effort resulted in the item before us tonight that and I believe that provides the necessary clarity. That'll be helpful to the board. I. Ask for your support tonight and the opportunity to serve as first vice chair next year. Thanks. Thank you, Lisa next Larissa Schoenberg hi. Thank you. Everyone I appreciate the opportunity to run for first vice chair, I know a lot of people. Don't know me very well on the committee. So just briefly, I am senior team lead for billing and coding at Mount, Sinai Department of Anesthesia and pain management. I really love my job, because I'm training a lot training. A group of fillers and coders and I am kind of the gatekeeper to help people make sure that they can see the physicians they need to see to get the care they need and to get to the specialist. We do a lot of fighting for our patients advocating for them with our specialists, with insurance carriers and with with other hospitals. So I am keenly aware of the health, this health disparities and the need for continued health care in the community, which is why I'm very proud that I served on the community board in Health and human services. For three terms, I've served as a member, a secretary and currently zoom master, yay and I love to volunteer for anything that they need to help for move the community forward. Last year, I was appointed to the governor cab, which is the place I've been hoping to get appointed to knowing what a key role that hospital plays in delivering services to our vulnerable community I was just elected to first vice chair of that cab and very excited to make sure that the communication flows from the cab to the community board, so that we can work in tangent to make sure the services don't get cut and it's the the hospital continues to serve the community in the best capacity, as first vice chair I, would hope to bring open communication to the board. I feel we have a tremendous amount of talent on this board. I feel we have a tremendous amount of services that people provide and we just need to make sure that they can bring that to the forefront. I know, I'm sorry, I'm a little long, but make sure that everyone feels that their needs are being addressed. That there's a concern that it is taken seriously and the validity is followed through from beginning events to complaints, concerns or needs, and that we make sure everyone can serve in the full capacity on the board. I also want to encourage education and support the chair in any way. I can thanks. Thank you. Okay for second vice chair, we have Eric Diaz hello. Can you hear me yep, okay, great hi, Community Board, three just wanted to introduce myself to some new committee members and also to the faithful community board members that have been with me since 2015, when I was first appointed to community board three. Since that time, this board has allowed me the opportunity to be elected into the executive committee, probably within a year and a half of my first appoint meant to the board, and that since then has given me opportunities to learn and grow and understand the ins and outs and the responsibilities of what an executive committee must do on a community board. Three level. I was heartened by that election because it showed that there are true. Latino representation is possible within this board. True people born and raised in the lower east side, like many of us here, can be a part of this community board effort to see things happen on behalf of our community leaders and communities that we serve. I just want to take the opportunity to tell you that I look forward to being the second vice chair and, as my Bio and my statement points out, I'm very interested in hearing more community advocacy issues working alongside the chair with their weekly responsibilities. I. Thank you for the time that I've been given to be the assistant secretary in record-keeping and in the secretary position during this pandemic and I. Just look forward to continuing to move important issues forward. I, look forward to hearing all the exciting new energy, that's in the community board and and again I wanna. Also let the community board know that I have full confidence in the slate that I've been part of with our current chair, Alicia Coleman and with Larissa Scheinberg his first chair. We have awesome people running for this position and just thank you for your. Was it your trust in me? Thank you. Eric for Secretary Michelle, Cooper Smith, thanks Linda, as you all probably know, because I call your name every month, I'm Michelle Coopersmith, I'm currently the assistant secretary for the board and I'm also first or I'm the vice chair for the transportation committee, where I get to support Paul Rangel, who is my friend and dear colleague, and I'm running for secretary this time around after doing a lot of the secretarial work since the beginning of the pandemic, because Eric has been working so hard in the neighborhood to support families in need, and so I'm hoping that you will support me to continue in that role formally going forward. I am a resident of the lower East side. I'm below Delancey, Street and I have a long-standing connection to this neighborhood. My grandmother grew up just down the road on Rutgers Court and her home was raised during the slum clearing of the 1950s. So I was inspired to join the board, hoping that I could do something to help the neighborhood and make sure that things like that. No longer happen here. I've had the chance to learn a lot being part of the executive committee and a member of transportation, and now the SLA committee and I just ask that you continue to support me in this role and I look forward to serving you for the next year. Thank you, Michelle, okay for Assistant Secretary, Shirley, fantasy, hi, everybody, my apologies and we're competing for internet connection, so I don't have video on because it will slow me down too much. I'm running for assistant secretary I have lived in the lower east side for East Village for 30 plus years and I got involved in community board, because I wanted to make a difference in the community that I so much appreciated. For the time I've lived here. I have two children special needs: children, I've I'm on the health, Human Services hospital, seniors, homeless, Human, Rights, Committee education, I'm really interested in shifting education for our community and really looking into how to shore up mental health issues, because that's become a big thing and it's part of my passion. I'm also involved with a community upstate which is working with food scarcity and, at some point my wish is to bring that into our community or into New York City, but right now, they're working in the Hudson valley to try to shore up food scarcity, issues and work Communica in communities with farmers and with language justice, I happen to be bilingual and in spanish and English and I look forward to serving the community board in a bigger capacity this year. Thank you for Treasurer Thomas Rosa, you with us Thomas forgot to unmute hello, everybody good evening. Cv3 I am Thomas Froza, I'm very humbled to be nominated for this position. I'm hoping everybody got a chance to read my bio, if not I'll, just give you a quick rECAB I have over 23 years of public experience, public service experience, starting off with the city Council, and what I've done. I've become applicable, acclimated to city budget processes through that I am currently the dean of students at the Manhattan school for career development right there on East 4th street and it's been a phenomenal run over there. We become experts at doing a lot with a little bit of money, which kind of brings me into this position. I'm also the title three coordinator for my school so over the last 10 years, or so. I've allocated over a hundred twenty thousand dollars in funding for english language learners on directly through programming, and it's been a phenomenal task. I have an annual budget of about two twelve thousand three hundred sixty six dollars. My role as Dean is obviously to keep the students safe, but I'm also a fierce advocate for my students, and we get a lot done with a little bit of money. One thing that we've been able to do: we have an incredible relationship with Nyu and we host phenomenal graduation ceremonies. I'll invite everybody this year, it's just it's a great time. I was able to secure professional artists that I know and at minimal cost and many times they'll. Do it just from our relationship, and we just really do something special to enhance the lives of the students in our district, I'm hoping to bring that flair into the work as treasurer I understand. The budget is not as big, but it doesn't matter. I'm used to doing big things with a little bit of budget and I'm hoping that I'd have the opportunity to show my stuff in CB3 and continue to learn and grow with all of you thank you, Thomas and finally, Sandra Strother hi. Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for the nominations. I do feel remiss and not giving a little bit more about my background. In the late 80s I was newly married, moved to California worked for the western space and missile center under 80 engineers came back to New York divorced homeless. Three children helped by a congresswoman media Velazquez to have to get the apartment that I have right now for 25 years, I worked for major law firms and 20 2009 I got disabled, so I went back to college, got my associate's degree criminal justice and my bachelor's degree in 2015 I joined the board of Grand Street Guild residents. Association 2017 I became its president hell-bent on changing the quality of life and to restore a center community. Here in on the lower east side, where I forgot to mention I am born on the street that I live I do several programs events every year mother's day, father's day social services events and for these events, I have to write proposals receive funds, allocate distribute purchase items in order to make these events happen. I received several awards, as you can see behind me for New York State Assembly citations from Eulene three from the council citation councilwoman Chin, the 2018 Community Service award, 2019 Les Heroes award in all of this I had to do most of the work for getting it done. Also working with Eric Diaz from Vision Obama I have applied for one grant, such as the citizens Committee for 2019. I understand that we don't have much money at CB3 and it's not all about I realize it's not all about the budget. For the executive committee. I've attended most of the meetings this year and I realize it's about the process and the policies of how the community board works and I think I could be a positive voice in making anything better that we attempt to do. Thank you very much for your nomination. Thank you. Okay! That's all the candidates, so now is the time to try out the voting system. So if you would all go to the link that you've been provided in your email and vote, please me too, foreign, hey Linda! Yes, is it's not loading for me? Is it loading through yeah just loaded? For me it takes a while Dominic and if you can't get your Wi-Fi, maybe if you have a cell phone, you could use your. If you have personal hotspot, you might want to try that yeah. My other sites are loading for me, like other sites. Are loading just fine for me? That's what I was concerned about yeah well, give a little time. I, don't know! Why could it be overloaded if everyone's doing it at the same time, or that could happen it popped right up. I just got it yeah what I just got in popped right up for me, I'm on chrome. It just takes a while mine went to pretty easily I use another computer instead of the one that I'm on mine went through just like that on safari mine went through like that mine as well very quickly, so I'm out of there. So if somebody else needs to get in, maybe you will now, let's give it a few minutes and then every if somebody still couldn't vote contact, Paul or Robin, was it supposed to send you a receipt? No, oh, okay! Nobody may it should. You should get an email with their receipt. It's from Google right, okay, yeah, I'm familiar with it, but I just thought! That's what I thought I saw. Yeah I got a receipt, yay good work mistake am I taking my vote, should I just resubmit yeah we submit because, yes, what happened I made a mis I made a mistake in voting. Fortunately, the email response was helpful. If you made a mistake, you should just email Paul with the change. Otherwise, okay I think it'll go in, you know it might go. You'll have to figure out what to do. He said you could only do it once all right I'll. Do that thanks, I, don't know where is Paul? Are you on? Can you hear me Paul yeah, I'm on sorry, okay, Dominic's, sending you a correction. That's fine! I! Have my email open, I'm ready for it. Jackie I see your cat cute. Oh a community board member is telling me he can't access it. He has an Aol account. What's the other option for voting? What's the other avenue again, I can vote for that person Eric. Oh okay, should he call you he can call me yeah or text guests in the email thanks Robin can I ask a question of our chair Alicia, usually at least during a live meeting. While the voting is happening, we continue with business so that the meeting can progress. Can we possibly do that I? Think that's a good idea! Yeah I think that's a good idea! Sure! Okay, so let's go on. Let's go back to the screen share. Thank you. Michael sure hold on one second, okay. So, as you see here and as Lisa made mention her and Linda worked on this executive committee vote. But we're going to first do my report and let's see where are we go back down? Thank you. Oh! So we'll do the the chairs report. First. Okay, so again, thank you everyone. So we had an item for Covid-19 and I want to just hold on one. Second, let me get my notes: apologies everyone! Okay! So as you're aware there is an increase in covic cases in our district and all over the city and where the city is very concerned about the imminent action and immediate action that we should take. The Department of Health has created a new position of Manhattan director of test and tracing which ha has reached out to us for help in connecting with the community partners for both contracts and volunteer opportunities. We have connected her to les ready and have a few committee chairs who will work with her group as necessary. Les ready had already volunteered to sponsor some pop-up testing sites that we will co-sponsor with other organizations. The dates are not set yet so just hang in there, but there will be testing on Avenue B and on Avenue D. There will be a need for volunteers for the testing days. So if you are interested in being a volunteer on the volunteer list, please email, Susan and write volunteer in the subject line and her email is E s-S-t-e-t-Z-e-r at CB, DOT Nyc.Gov, that's Susan's, email address for the community board, so make sure you write in the subject that you write that you're gonna volunteer for the test and tracing okay, and this is so important. I just recently got tested with my whole family actually last week and the process, it was very long. The lines were horrendously long and we all went to different spots to get tested, but in the end I think we feel like a sigh of relief that that we all were able to do that as a family and I. Think it's important for us I think for everyone to have peace of mind. I'm not telling you what to do, but I strongly suggest that you know we all take the opportunity to do so for peace of mind, okay, so this year's holiday celebration. You know it's that wonderful time of the year that we normally have a holiday gathering of some sort, and this is Covid-19 right. So here we are and what do we do? There's all these wonderful zoom activities that I'm seeing from various people, I've even attended two zoom funerals, so I know we can put on a great zoom holiday extravaganza for our board and I'm calling on all people that have talents, gifts that want to share poetry, song, maybe of some sort, and I'm looking for organizers to and really I want to make sure that we're able to get this done before the heightened of the holiday season. I know that Hanukkah is coming and Christmas is coming, but we're not doing a specific holiday celebration, we're just celebrating the end of the year and just we need some cheer. We need a little holiday spirit right about now, I think to encourage all of us in what we're dealing with in the midst of this storm called Covid-19. So if you're interested in helping with that, can you please email me and let me know that you're interested and participating in the gathering? It would be nice to have as many people that know about arts and culture to participate and help create this wonderful activity for all of us and we can even play some games. I've even seen people do like some type of game activities and stuff like that. Okay, the next item was so we have our end of year. We also do another thing for the associate staff in the office, and that is we give gifts of gratitude. Michelle was kind enough to send out and take it on to be the contact person Michelle. Would you like to share your contact information for the accounts on how people can contribute if they wish to contribute for the gifts for the camp or yeah I sent out an email to everyone, but I you can find me on Venmo, Paypal or Zell I can just I can throw my email address and my phone number in the chat. If that would be helpful for people to find me, that's usually how you can find people or if you would like to send a check. Just you can email me or text me and I will send you my address, but thank you so much to everyone who has already contributed. I. Have you all in the list? So don't worry, we know you contributed. So thank you very much. Thank you, Michelle, and so also we sent out an email to the full board about a conflict resolution, training on December 7th from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. It's given by the center for creative conflict resolution and I think that I thank you, Deborah Glass, for reaching out to them to see if they would give a training that would be later on in the day they did respond back to Deborah and they said somewhere in the new year that they would be able to possibly put out more training and dates and times in the near future, but for right now. This is the one that has been scheduled and the link for those who, if you lost it in your email, we could resend you the link for the conflict resolution, training for December 7th and, as our borough president announced tonight, that the full board applications for community boards is going to go out and will be due for February. First, if I'm not mistaken, it will be a great opportunity for all of you to reach out to members of the community people that may have not had an opportunity to participate in the community board process if they're interested in becoming community leaders, people that you know, for whatever reason you might feel like hey, you know you should try this. It might be something for you to offer more contribution for the community and have their voices heard as well. So I encourage you to reach out to people and have them fill out the application I believe it will be on the Manhattan borough president's website, and there and I believe we also put it up on our website in the near future. I want to also encourage you to think of residents that are still without gas. If I'm not mistaken, part of guild houses is still without gas, and this is holiday season. People will not have gas to cook meals for themselves, as some residents from guild houses still have not had gas for a few months now, and it's just deplorable, as far as I'm concerned, to be without gas to be able to feed the basic needs of your family. Please I encourage you. If you know of someone that doesn't have gas, maybe you perhaps can offer to help them in some way. I'm not telling you to cook them a whole meal. If you see fit to do that or if you see fit to offer them some type of support on where they could get a meal, I do believe there are some local organizations that are providing hot meals as well as, as we heard tonight, Ulaine's office, our elected official assemblywoman. She will be distributing some hot meals as long as well as several other organizations in the community and I do believe. Vision Urbana, as Well Eric has been out there and Sandra you've been out there, giving out hot meals and or offering Thanksgiving trimmings and turkeys for everyone. But just remember there are people that won't have a stove to cook a turkey on so and that all being said, I want to. Thank you all again for your attention to my report. Next, we'll have the district manager's report. Susan. Are you there? Where's Susan might not be connected to the sound. The right way go on the. We can't hear you at all click on the arrow next to the microphone and select what microphone you might be. If there's another microphone option, select that since I'm sharing the screen, the menu should show up on the top of your screen. I think there's an arrow next to the microphone. Nothing I'm going to stop sharing my screen for a second so that you just I, think you might have an easier time finding the functionality that way. No there's no arrow next to the microphone. So there should be a check mark next to whatever microphone you're using. If there's another microphone listed, select that one instead, because whatever microphone your check mark is on, is not working. Could you hear me now? Yes, there you are hey, it was a real tech, a real talk speaker or something I. Never first time that happens. Thank you. Zoom is wonderful. First, the Community board application is on our website, so you can direct people there. Thank you. Just a few minor reports. Dot has notified us department transportation that they are expediting more programs. What that means is not community review, they're doing that to the street seat program and also bike corrals, so I just want to let you know. Bike corrals are being installed on first Avenue at 5th Street, 7th, Street, 9th Street, 2nd Avenue at 4th, Street, 6th, Street, Saint, Mark's and 10th street. Are we usually have a high demand? People always want more bike rails, but it'll be interesting to see how this works out with all the restaurants in the same place as Gail mentioned, the open street open restaurant issues. We are continuing, as I've mentioned before, to get complaints not about the program but their complaints about non-compliance and right now there are two issues that we're hearing most about. One is amplified sound. The restaurants have figured out they're not allowed to do that up on the sidewalk, so they're, using putting amplifiers or mics on a chair just inside their door just inside their window, and maybe three or four windows excuse me, but the most more serious issue is the enclosures outside I think there's very good science to show that the more Covid-19 spread is from restaurants. The outdoor dining should mitigate that, but now that many of these structures are being totally enclosed, which is non-compliant and there's no ventilation but they're being treated like outdoor dining, not like the 25 indoor I have excuse me. I've tried several times to bring this. The attention of the city I have not been successful, yet I think it's a really important thing to keep working on, and you know I think it's just it's. It is seriously dangerous with Covid-19 increasing and that's all I'll report on tonight. Unless there's any questions. Sorry any questions, please use the raise hand, function, I, think we're good Alicia, you're, muted, yeah I, don't see any hands. Thank you. Okay. Next item on the agenda. Let's go back to screen share. Thank you! Okay. So the executive, like I, said before the executive voted on this one item and Lisa and Linda both worked on it. Thank you very much for the two of you working on this item. As you all can read, so we're adding this description so that it will make more. It will be more clarification for the public members as well as committee members on once. An item is placed on the agenda, and so you guys have, if you have any questions about it, let me know otherwise we can move to vote on totally at the end, at our end of vote for tonight for all the items, any questions about it, any Hands, Michael, oh one hand I, see one hand, okay. Who is this that's in the attendee list that might be David Adams, oh okay, yeah? How you excuse me, I'm just curious: what does this change from what we've been doing until now? What does this resolution change or implement? I'm not understanding it. Just tell you we're voting on it. Is that what it's, how items get added on like at the a lot of people, are struggling with hold on one second Michael, you pull it back up again sure sorry I can't get to it. So instead of description of an item so like, if we're doing a resolution, sometimes when we have resolutions on on an item in committee meetings, the subjects like are placed on the agenda right so like the public will say: oh how did you get that item on the agenda and sometimes there's no explanation on how information is given right, no resolution, so resolutions are allowed, but at times there might be a hard time getting the matter for legitimate, like gathering further information, you know, like a lot of people want to say: oh well, should we further review that? Should we give further information on that item Lisa. Do you want to give a further description because you worked on this item? Yes, please go ahead, Lisa you're, unmuted yeah. Can you hear me David? Can you hear her? Yes, sorry there's there was some background noise from somebody, unmuted and I, just I, just muted them, so you're we're good. Now, okay, you can hear me huh, yes, yeah. No, the issue really was about the fact that there had at some point been a lack of clarity about whether or not a resolution could be entertained on a certain item and there might be discussion on the item and it wasn't clear whether or not a resolution was in order and there had been times where the chair, various committees may or may not have allowed a resolution to go forward when there had been an expectation by those present that one was relevant or should be discussed. So this just makes it clear in advance whether or not a resolution is appropriate to be heard at that agenda item David. Does that clarify for you, David I, muted, you because of the background. I, don't see this, it means when we put information. You know it's usually we have when we come to the vote informational purposes only you want us to put it on the agenda before we have the votes. Is that what you're saying yes in essence, that people would know in advance that a resolution would not be heard at that meeting? You want to hold up what happens if they decide. If someone changes their mind, we need a resolution. It would be held up next heating. Well, it couldn't be held, but by the next minute could be too late. But the issue was that there were times where people said, even though it wasn't mentioned before that an entered that emotion couldn't be entertained, so it became it. The you're predicting what's going to happen two weeks in advance of what may become an emergency situation, you're very your hand, handicapped and locking the the committee. If they have to do something they're saying they can't do it, because there was no official notification until then, Nick can I butt in here for a minute, I can't raise my hand, go ahead, Linda yeah David. Sometimes there are items on the agenda that are it's very early in the process, so they're put on the agenda for informational purposes and the time for voting on them may be one or two months in advance. I understand that I said, but what happens if something happens that we have to make a resolution? Can someone then come say you said there wouldn't be a resolution, but conditions come down with us to make one? Would this be a legally restrictive item for us to make a resolution? Well, we my own experience, I, haven't seen that happen. What's happened, sometimes an agency comes to us and they want it happens in parks. We didn't think we're gonna make a resolution and then they decide yeah. It would be very helpful because they have a tough time with the budget committees, and sometimes it happens that we have to make a resolution that we weren't planning on doing that night just to help them get their monies in well. The intent of this was for those things that are truly informational. The vote is a couple of months now can I say something yes hold on go ahead Susan this is actually the informational only is actually something the board voted on several years ago. It's been part of our policies already that certain things are just informational, often I, think only because there's only one perspective there, the issues you're talking about like the parks agencies coming, that's never informational, there's sometimes there's a longer there's always there are sometimes an ongoing project that we're gonna have across you know by your server we're gonna have an ongoing project and they're going to want to. In that case, they want to manipulate something at the very least and need to change, need an authorization to make that change, and even though we're asking just for an update on what's happening, something could come down that can may require us to make a a resolution. David I think this is hard for, like Claire, I'm sorry, Susan I think this is more for. Like clarification, this is more for like informational like more. If someone wants further background information on an item David, let me all right. Let me just why do we need this resolution? If we're not going to make a resolution at those meetings anyway, stop interrupting the women who are talking please, and thank you I. Don't believe that this is going to hold up the process if we need to pass resolutions on anything, I believe that this is more for like a clarification or for like further information, because sometimes there are items that we do need further informational background on rather than going ahead and passing on something where a lot of people like I think just recently, land use had an item right Lisa. If I'm not mistaken, there was everyone said we need further the background on this item. We can't go ahead and further just pass this. We have to send it back and further review the information because it was just too much to give in one meeting and people really were struggling with. The item am I right. The purpose of this meeting this resolution was to make sure that, to the maximum extent, feasible resolutions would be heard not to restrict them. The there had been the albums that had a rose were on the other side. David. So sorry, I didn't hear the word. I'm sorry, oh the uproar. The process I didn't hear that word. Clearly, I'm sorry I, don't know what word you didn't hear, but I think it was the uproar it didn't come across, but I figured it out from your statement. Okay, thank you all right, Alicia, I'm sorry to interject here, but you have three hands up from other community board members. Okay, sure thank you. Mike! I'm just final statement. I think we have this already and we don't need a resolution that would handicap us. That's I'm gonna ask that we allow other members to have yeah also I just said I just have to make my latest comment that I don't think we need this because we operate this way anyway. Bye. Thank you. David, okay, I saw Trevor, Olympia and Dominic. Okay, I, don't know. Who's ham was first go ahead. Trevor I, just spoke I'll, be very brief. I do think that the chair of each committee and the office will be won't. Use that for informational purposes for most of the items it will be for items that we are sure that there's not going to be a resolution. I'm just going to add that in certain situations and I've expressed this and I expressed, it said that commit the executive meeting where we had a very long discussion about this. I didn't think. We'd have one this length tonight, but this is really also for the community, because a lot of times the community may not be aware that something may get. Something may be voted on, even if it's on your agenda and we want to make it clear to the community that if it's an informational presentation it is for that purpose. Only, but that's all I have to say I just wanted to point that out because, like Lisa says we're really talking about the other side of the issue, as opposed to items that we're going to vote on. Thank you, Trevor, sorry, Alicia I just want to let you know that clinch who can not raise his hand, also wants to make a comment at some point too. If you can call on him sure Dominic, yeah, I, think Trevor pretty much just said what I was gonna, say and I think Lisa clarified. You know there is an out here where you know, resolutions are allowed if it comes to it that something surprising happens, but that I've been in multiple meetings when it really wasn't clear to people that it was really informational, that there wasn't going to be a vote in communities especially is like has, you know, gotten a lot of people there and it's really helpful for them as well as for committee members. That may be confused. You know as to whether or not there's even really supposed to be resolution. So I think this is a good addition. Thank you, okay, Olympia and then Clinton. Can you hear me now? Yes Olympia we can yeah, it works. Okay, so I agree with everything that has been said, but I think David's. Concern is also fair, so not today, but we could also consider trusting each other and our various committees and actually presume that there can always be a resolution, but the committee chairs and the committee members will know if this is a first presentation and they don't want to deliberate yet because our difficulty at land use has been that at times we really wanted to say something and we were impeded because we were told. Oh, we weren't expecting a resolution on this item. So that's why I think this is valid, but we could also consider in the future, not restricting ourselves. You know allow it for us. If there is an item in the agenda to do a resolution on it, you know as adults. Thank you, okay, thank you, Olympia Clint and then Robin, okay, so I think part of my confusion, and maybe someone else is having the same issue is the where we're describing it is. Resolutions may be introduced and voted on by a committee. Unless the agenda item has an asterisk I think that's for me at least when I read that it's causing a little confusion and I think it should be. You know some items may be introduced to a committee where a subject is on the agenda and may be made public and may be voted because I think when it says resolution a resolution to me, maybe means something that's going to be voted on, but if it's an item to be discussed for information, only that's a different to me. That reads differently than saying a resolution, because a resolution is something I. Think and I could be wrong. That means you're going to be voting on. So if you're saying an item may be introduced, that's I think that's where the difference coming in. Please correct me: if I'm wrong anyone, okay Lisa, would you like to respond to Clint yeah, I'm not sure I, understood Clint's comments, basically saying that he doesn't believe me resolution should be there. It should be item well, I, think where the confusion might be. Is that what we're saying is with regard to any item on the agenda resolutions may be introduced and voted on is so wording. We need to change the wording. I thought it was clear, but if that helps Clint that that's what it means, it's just that the way it's worded here is that it's talking about the item on the agenda can can be addressed through a resolution at all times unless there's an asterisk after that item on the agenda. Does that make it clearer? Does that address your question Clint? It does to a point. Yes, I understand what your intention is. Yes, okay, thank you Robin and then demires agree with Clint I. Think, what's confusing? Is that you're call you start out by saying resolutions and again I think it should be agenda items can't maybe introduce and voted on as resolutions or something you know, or just or at least take out completely the whole that middle sentence unless that agenda item has an asterisk on it. With the explanation on the at the bottom stating informational presentation, I think that should be a separate paragraph that says informational presentations shall not be have resolutions. An informational presentation is and then define what an informational presentation is and I think that in each committee meeting the chair should then, if there's an informational presentation should then read what we define the definition that we come up that you, the executive committee, come up so of what an informational presentation is, because the public doesn't know the difference, and so, if we're making a difference, then we need to define that difference. Thank you. Robin Demaris, yeah, hi, I thought I heard Susan, say or someone say that this was already voted on several years back, and so, if that is the case, I think what my understanding is, we're just putting it out there so that the public and the chairs are reminded that this is how we operate. Is that am I I'm consuming this? The wrong way is that right that it was already something that we voted on. We didn't have the resolution the asterisk part before, but the concept was voted on. This was just to clarify, so it's perfectly clear and informational presentations are rare. As you know, they come up in land use fairly frequently where an agency is coming to give us a presentation about something that is preliminary or a developer right. Yeah, so I mean in closing. If I could just finish my remarks, so we could just I just think it seems clear to me too: we've had a considerable amount of discussion on it. I mean can't we just move on and put it up for a vote or something people don't want to vote on it. They don't have to vote on it or folks want you know additional time, but like it's 905 folks can we make can I. Have someone make a motion that we stopped a conversation on this? If there's, if there are no further remarks, I'm sorry if there are no further yes I saw it Damaris made the motion who seconded I'll. Second it. Thank you, Sandra, okay, so we're finished with the discussion about this item, and so, if I need, let me see David for clarification. Do we continue or send it back to executive committee, or do we now just vote on it at the end? And people will decide at the end whether or not this is something they want to implement with the asterisks where's it this David? Yes, what you just did was to decide to end discussion. Then it was going to be voted on tonight. Okay, so we decided to end the discussion. So now do we have to have a we have to have a motion whether to adapt this item or not. Do we I mean it's on the agenda coming out of the committee, but we don't need to I. Think right. We just had a long discussion about is what we did right. Okay, so it will be voted on at the end. Okay, all right. Let's move on the agenda! Thank you so much everybody for the conversation about this item. Okay, a transportation is going to move down because he is in the midst of counting. So we're going to move to the next committee, which is economic development. Anisha. Are you there? Yes hi, so we had three resolutions presented at economic development and two of them were passed. I'll start with the first one, which was the to support grants for small businesses to winterize outdoor spaces. We had a presentation from the department of buildings, a representative, come and discuss the process and regulations, I guess for using heating equipment and electricity to winterize outdoor structures for outdoor dining. Mainly, we had feedback from the public and also from the committee that the regulations and restrictions were burdensome and costly for businesses that were already struggling, and we weren't really sure how it was all gonna work out. So we did put together a resolution to for support, including grants to help businesses. You know adhere to these rules. Basically, so if there are any questions about that first resolution, please let me know: okay, let me look for hands. I, don't see any hands, so you can go on to the next item great. So arts and culture is a subcommittee of economic development, so we did have two additional resolutions from arts and culture Carolyn. If you're on, if you'd like to talk about your first resolution, the first resolution was asking for the city to consider instituting WPA style work programs in order to help the arts community recover about 70 percent of the arts. Community has lost funding and during this period of time, and so it was thought that perhaps one of the best ways to address the issue is that they needed support from city and state agencies, if possible, and if federal funding comes through to support this community by establishing work programs that would employ artists and arts organizations. The second resolution was: let's answer any questions on that. First, one, fine! Is there any any questions on the first one, any hands, no hands; okay, go on Caroline, okay. The second resolution was in support of then at the law of legislation introduced by Jimmy Van Bramer at the City Council, and it's Intro 2068-2020. The way the resolution was worded. It was asking for Community board three to support the this legislation. It's stating that it would effectively asked mayor De Blasio to rescind his executive order on amplified sound. There were a number of questions at the committee on economic development as to how this would play out and basically the committee was tied in its vote not to support the resolution and on the resolution we basically have agreed to take the resolution back to the Economic Development Committee. There will be a joint meeting of economic development and arts and culture on December, 2nd and the resolution will be recrafted. There was also I think it from what we understand now, a representative from Jimmy Van Bramer's office, who will attend the Economic Development Committee to speak to us about this legislation and what it entails. The legislation was introduced to the City Council to support arts and culture organizations and artists to be able to perform on the street, but it also stated that it would have to follow guidelines, there's a self-permitting process involved, so at any rate, as stated, it will go back to the committee on December 2nd and we will resubmit the resolution for after that meeting there any questions, yes, I see one hand from Olympia: okay. Yes, it's not a question. Carolyn is just a clarification because I think the way you talked about the resolution you skip the most important part that the legislation that has been introduced by the chair of the arts and culture Committee is trying to make it legal for arts and culture established arts and cultural organizations to host outdoor events. The United States was one of them unique in not hosting, especially in New York, any. You know public events outdoors safely this summer. They prioritize the restaurants but the arts and culture. They had no opportunity to do safe performances, outdoor and this is in the legislation that doesn't sort any other existing regulations about safety, noise, etc. At the same time that legislation by the mere fact that allows it, because right now there is a ban, a complete ban on public events by allowing it to take place, as you can imagine, a theater company, etc, they will have to use, amplified sound. But currently there is a ban on that too. So our resolution was asking for that band to be lifted for these permitted arts and culture events, not for the illegal things Olympia, but we're going to take is going back to the committee right, so you guys are going to further work. I do want to say, for the rest. Can I please finish so I do want to say that this was a clarification and for the rest of the community board. They need to be aware that what happened at that meeting there were a lot of problems and that we're going to be working on that as a whole, with the leadership and with I think that the Economic Development Committee heard this and is fully supportive of trying to support the arts and culture sector. Obviously it is an important part of our neighborhoods and also our economy. It really was just that the resolution didn't have enough information and they we need clarification about a number of things in order to craft a resolution that adequately supports this proposed legislation and also contextualizes it in our neighborhood and the challenges that we do have in this neighborhood around sound. So I am happy to be working on this in the next meeting and I'm sure it'll be a robust discussion. As always. Thank you. Robin Question clarification. Yes, I'm glad this is going back to committee, because I want to come to that meeting and again of this. The resolution that Van Buren was putting through is not. It has nothing to do at all with sound. It has to do with the staple office permitting arts organizations to be able to use outdoor venues since they can't congregate inside. So it's a much broader larger legislation and in two of them one is that spaces anywhere like that already exist that are used for public gatherings and two like the restaurants in the restaurants, using their there's their front sidewalks. So I'm glad that this is going back because I want to be in that meeting to I've been working on with the group of culturals on this legislation as well. So thanks bringing it up. Thank you, Robin. Thank you. Okay, Anisha! Is that all for your report? Yes, are there any questions? Any further questions? Okay, thank you very much. Everyone I'm gonna move on to the next item next committee, which is parks and recreation, waterfront and Resiliency Trevor hello, everyone, no resolutions, but a lot of information. Escr came back this month and they will continue to come to Parks committee as they have for at least a year every single month to give us an update on the progress of the plan. Construction has started for Pa2 or project area 2, that is the area community Board 6 project area 1, which is our area we'll start soon. It is not delayed. It's they've moved a couple things around and it's still on schedule to be complete for the bmcr, which is the Brooklyn bridge, Montgomery coaster, resiliency project, that's the heir for Brooklyn business, Montgomery Street. It ties into the ESCR. There will be a webinar on 12:17 or sometime during that week. We don't have a final date and that's to give an update on and allow some community input on that particular flood design. Pier 36, we discussed access because the dock is controlled by EDC, who leases it to one of the peer operating companies. I. Believe it's Billy Bay. We could not really come up with a agreeable time to open and close that area. There's been a lot of problems behind that particular pier you can just imagine. We still have fireworks behind period, 36, believe it or not, and a host of other activities, because there is no closing time so we'll probably discuss it at the next committee or even in January, pier 42. There's a lot of stuff going on with pier 42 I think the biggest problem we have is making sure we get information to people. We did have outreach on that back in March. They also attended. They also held a community meeting at Governor gardens which is directly in front of pier 42. They did get some input from those two meetings, however, I think there's a there's still needs to be some clarification in what is called upland and the interim deck the up then portion is federally funded and on a deadline and that construction will start I believe here, 42 will start in the summer of next year and the interim deck peer deck will start also next year. That will bring the total number of projects to I believe four major projects along the waterfront all occurring. At the same time, I've talked with our community Board office about seeing if we can get some construction meeting to have to grab hold of all these projects going on. At the exact same time, the all these projects, pier 42, bmcr, the espionage projects and the Brookton Bridge. My coastal resiliency project bmcr, are all under some deadline for federal spending. So there's a something positive about that, meaning that they're likely to be completed on time, but we got to make sure that we keep the city honest about these deadlines because we don't want to lose those federal funds. Any questions for Trevor, okay, Trevor I, see no hands. Thank you so much. Okay, health, Human, Health, seniors human services, melee hi, so yeah we had our meeting last month. There are no resolutions for the board to vote on this month. However, I did want to bring your attention to next month's meeting, which our next month's committee meeting, which will be on December 4th. We have a couple of agenda items that might be of interest to you. The first one is about senior citizens. The department for the aging is planning on a friendly social visiting program. I think it's a new program, but it's based on the model of you, know, volunteers, being recruited and trained to provide services or counseling or some kind of friendly phone visiting support to senior citizens. So they'll come and present about it. You know we don't know that much about it like how seniors get these services or which volunteers are being recruited or even if you know there are still volunteer opportunities. So you, if you'd like to know more about it, please come to the meeting. We will have two representatives of difta attending the meeting to let us know about it. The second agenda item, which is about students in school, so it is related to Covid-19 testing of students in schools. It's been brought to our attend. Well, we know that you know I think there's a promise of monthly testing in the schools, some random monthly testing, but it's been brought to our attention that it's not all happening, especially at the D75 schools, the district 75 schools. Those are the schools that are specialized in providing education and services to students with disabilities or special needs. So we will. But we know that you know if your kid is going to get tested, you know parental a permission is required, and our friends at Cec1 know that. Well not every kid who's going to school has been tested or is being tested. You know so there's a lot of issues and we will have a couple of speakers from the citywide council for these 75 schools, as well as the citywide council for Special Ed students at the meeting. Who can talk to us and answer our questions and you know we'll, learn more and see what well what's next. So that's on this on Thursday, the first Thursday in December, any questions any hands may I don't see any hands. Okay. Thank you. So much. Okay, SLA hi Alex for the two resolutions. Where we had stipulations, we received those stipulations and I wanted to make two corrections: they're, not substantive they're, my typos, so in number three, which is nori Tai Bazar. The therefore clause, the first line of it should actually say this is a recommendation to approve consistent with the title and the body of the resolution, not a recommendation to deny and number eight, therefore, which is 120 Orchard Llc. The therefore clause has the wrong address: I apologize, it should say 120, Orchard Street, not 244, East, Houston, Street I sent those corrections already to Michelle. Michelle has her hand up Alex Michelle, yes! Well, it's not really a question for Alex, but I'd like to I need probably David's guidance on this, but I'd like to give the entire board an opportunity to vote up and down on number eight 120 orchard. Bar Llc, which the committee recommends to deny I, will say that I voted for that approval and there are a list of what would have been proposed stipulations in the fifth, whereas clause. So David I apologize with my poor knowledge of legislative procedure here. But can you advise me on how to put that on the floor? You've just done. You've asked for a separate vote and that's all that's necessary. So we'll do a separate roll call vote for this one assuming that is what you're intending yes well just because right now the resolution says to deny so obviously would I have to offer an amendment to it. Yeah, if you want to amend then, or should we do it up down vote on the deny? No, if you want to amend it, you should do that in advance. It'll be cleaner. You would say: I moved to amend in a certain way. Okay, so I moved to amend the resolution to add the stipulations that are outlined in the fifth, whereas clause, starting with number one and ending with oh sorry, wait, I'm looking at the wrong paragraph, I think starting with number one operate as a tavern with music and art, and number 12 provide a telephone number for residents to call complaints. I will just say that I thought that the applicants and many of them spoke at the beginning of this during the public session, actually didn't make a pretty good case for their fitness to operate this this location and while I understand that there are issues around noise and there was with the previous applicant. These are not the same people who would be operating it and they seem to have, as they explained at the beginning of this meeting, pretty solid experience, operating and already on the lower east side. In fact, and I'm deeply concerned about what this neighborhood will look if we have to close down again and what it'll look like in six months or a year, and we should be giving opportunities to folks who you know who want to invest in our community, so do I need to do anything else. David do I need. Do you, wanna I, don't know Michael. Do you wanna just highlight the those stipulations one through twelve there, which is that the stipulation she's proposing to attribute to this applicant are not this applicants necessarily method of operation but they're the stipulations that belong to Max fish, so I just want to make that clear. This is not necessarily comprehensive of the proposal by the applicant okay thanks Alex yeah. That's what I was wondering about I guess, because SLA is has like the agreement of stipulations David. If this is the right way to do this or if she should you want, do you want to go into an explanation of what would be the right way? I mean David. If you want him to answer it well, the right way to structure the motion, the right way to approach this change. I mean the right way to the right way to craft motions or to get them modified is to make an amendment. But the amendment does need to be clean and understandable. I mean I, couldn't follow it, but it's really hard in this kind of a meeting to follow so I, don't know exactly what language is being altered. That's really. My only role in this yeah that's best about SLA, because it's more complicated than normal, I believe it's. This is this right, Michelle yeah, but the thing is that generally we get and maybe Alex. If you want to explain this more, we would get agreement from the applicants on the stipulation. So that was my question about how we should proceed with this, because I would like it to get an up and down vote on by the board, but I'm just asking what the best way to go about that is. So let me just explain the history then, of the application, so we heard it in October. We heard it at length. They had a certain method of operation that they proposed. It's the same as what the second paragraph is of the resolution, what they proposed, both in October and November. We had some concessions from them about the things that they might change. They withdrew. They had some discussion with the lorry side dwellers about what things they might change. They submitted Eightmen or their attorney submitted a statement of the proposed amendments which were not comprehensive of the method of operation. But what the what they felt they could agree to at that point: I included that it. If you go further down, there's another paragraph that includes that that they submitted that statement and what it included. Then we had a lengthy debate in the November meeting in the November meeting. They couldn't agree necessarily four out of six members wanted to deny the application two wanted to approve. We did a motion to deny. We did have a lot of discussion about the potential amendments they would make to their method of operation to address the community concerns regarding this business, but also regarding the conditions in the neighborhood generally that this business it continues with the same method of operation, would contribute to. So we wanted to avoid that. There was some assertion that by then that they couldn't change their method of operation further and not have a success and continue to have a sustainable model. Your method of operation. When we were in the midst of making a resolution to deny, they then began to say that they could change things that they had told us previously, that they could not change and I included. That, at the end of the resolution, because I wanted to have a fair hearing, so I think one of the principals who spoke said we hadn't done that. But I think that the resolution fairly reflects that I think that we couldn't necessarily credit that they would be able to pull back their model to address community concerns and complaints, and given that the prior location had the history it had, we still felt we had to make a resolution to deny. If we want to have a resolution, a contrary resolution to approve it with stipulations, then it probably has to go back to committee so that we can again try to construct stipulations. But the stipulations aren't I. Don't think that what's can included in the resolution, I don't think we can go through it now and call out from it. The things we think might be relevant stipulations for this type of business and do it in an efficient way where we can create a resolution with stipulations that the applicants could then sign. Okay, Alex, I'm sorry, Trevor has his hand up, and then I also wanted to ask whether you think this is worth us, maybe pulling the item since it's such a hardy discussion about it. So, but let's go on to Trevor's question Trevor before you talk, I'm sorry to interrupt Alicia. You also have David Adams and Clint. Okay. Thank you. Well, I was just trying to get clarification. I think Alexander just gave me a little clarification about the procedure for this, for what Michelle is proposing is that new language, because I'm struggling to find understand what we're doing right now. So what you is proposing is just the history of the or the stipulations that apply to the prior on the board business. But those are the situations that were for the prior business. They don't necessarily reflect the way the new business wanted to operate completely or address their proposed method of operation, but this is still a straight-up denial, not on denial, unless even with that particular paragraph, and in order to do that you're saying because of the complexity, it will probably need to go back to committee. Yes, okay, thank you. Okay, next is no I. Actually I. I'm withdrawing my comment. I, don't have anything to add at this point. Thank you. Clint David, hello, yeah, we're here, yeah, okay, basically I was just saying the same thing. It has to that. Since there are resolutions and the parties have to agree to it, we can't we can't approve a resolution. That's not a denial here! Okay, thank you, David, okay, so we are agreeing that we are going to pull this item. Do I have a motion to pull the item. Michelle, I'm sorry go ahead. Michelle, oh I was just going to ask what the best if we should pull it or if we should have people vote no against, but if I'll do a motion to man to committee, if that's the best way to do it, yeah I just want to clarify clarification from David David Crane. Are you there yep? Can you just let us know a direction to go here, I'm a little confused about whether there's a motion to amend or not. I'm withdrawing my amendment for the stipulations because, as Alexandra explained, we need to go back to committee to craft simulations that the applicants could agree to, but I'm asking if we should just do an up and down yes or no on the denial or if we should just remain so, then pull it for a separate vote, and we should do that vote if he well, probably at the end of this committee report, if that's what's desired, then we should have a separate vote. A roll call vote on this one item right at the end of this committee report, I, ask a clarifying question: I, I'm a little confused. What that separate vote is for because Michelle keeps saying voting no or are we voting to send this back to committee for revision? So what are we voting on? Exactly I was thought was to vote on the underlying motion. I didn't hear that there was a motion to send to committee. I was hearing that it would have to go to committee if it was going to be changed along the lines that originally was proposed. So I believe that all of that has been withdrawn. Is that correct? Yes, I rescinded my amendment and I'm asking if we should do an up and down vote yes or no on this current resolution yeah? So yes or no on the amendment as Rita? Sorry, yes or no, on the emotion as written, and so if we when we, if we do that, which we should it's been requested, a yes would mean to deny and a no would mean that we will not pass the denial meaning we wouldn't send anything. Okay, I see, hands, I, see Dominic and Trevor go ahead, Dominic, yes, so just to clarify, because I Michelle's suggesting I actually took myself off mute because I was going to second her. It's not like she was trying to send it back to committee. So I was going to second that, but it sounds like we need to vote it vote no first, and then we can do that correct! That's correct! Thank you! Okay, Trevor! That was my clarification. Dominic asked my question. Thank you, Trevor Lisa. Can we make it so that, if the? If there is a vote, no on the original motion, it will automatically go back to committee without having to take a second vote. I think that we would do that I don't know if there would be need to be a vote for that I think it would automatically the committee chair would put it back on. The committee can I clarify, though we're voting yes, actually, because the motion is to deny. So we need to agree to deny this African. Is that right? Yes to deny? And if we vote no you're saying we are not going to send any resolution like this now Susan's hand, I want to ask your procedural thing. So I assume these people have already gone to the SLA because they already have a temporary permit. So what impact is the vote going to have next month on their license if they agreed to consider stipulations? I mean if this has already gone through to the SLA and they've already you know what was the situation so I don't know that there are well-defined stipulations yet because they insisted that there were things that they couldn't change. Then they told us they could change them while we were at and after we were in the midst of constructing this resolution to deny okay. But that's not what I'm asking no I, don't know that it may be that the stipulations get imposed, but the intention of the community groups that came opposed to this are that they're going to go to the SLA to be heard on this particular application. So I don't know what the resolution will be. That's, but again, that's not what I'm asking they're going to open. So they have a temporary license. They're going to be open, they may be open already. Are they still willing to consider signing stipulations next month? They don't have exactly their application. I think they may be, but I don't know, because those issues still remained outstanding at the time that we constructed them. What I'm trying to say is procedural, I, guess they're, not there I guess they didn't stay, I'm just saying. Procedurally, this is very difficult because you don't know what options you have in committee. No I also say that you know they're, not valueless, applicants, I'm not saying that and I. Don't think that we said that in the resolution and in fact we did hear them for a location on Houston Street and approved them for that location, and that has was issued that has yet to open. But the issues here were that there was so much community opposition. It was so very specific and it wasn't adequately addressed by the applicant I appreciate that they that the one said you know, robots but saying something is robust, doesn't make it so it's you know actually being able to define something for us in a way where we can understand that it's going to mitigate the existing issues and max fish. While it was an institution because that's the business that was there, it did not have a good track record with the community who had many complaints about it, and the reason that we approved Maxfish was because it was a long-standing fixture in the community and needed to move into that location. That's why we approved it at the time that we improved it. I clarified what I was trying to say: I'm not addressing anything about whether they're, good, bad or indifferent. I was simply addressing you know the procedure if it goes bad, since it's a 30-day notice and it's way beyond 30 days at this point, what I'm saying is: do we still have an option of voting and creating stipulations, whether they're, good or bad? Or do we not have an option of doing that because they've already gone to the sale yeah we do because we they've already got their temporary license. They already intended to open with the temporary license as soon as the committee hearing happened, regardless of whether or not we voted for or against them. Okay again, that really doesn't address the issue, because a temporary license has to have the same stipulations as the current as the last business, and this would be addressing the new license. Just so, people stopped texting me eight million times yeah everyone to know that the applicants are still on. Normally, we do not let people other than board members talk during public sessions. So if our chair would like to have one of the applicants, unmuted I am happy to do that with the chair's discretion at this point. Yes, Michael and I. Thank you so much for that, but I also want I saw Trevor. Is there anything that you want to add to this? Or can we please allow one of the applicants to speak on this matter, so we can get clarification actually in reference to this, and I'm just asking for procedure-wise I. Think I, remember in person meetings that the applicant was there and was willing to work out certain stipulations. But what I'm hearing from Alexander is that there was so much community opposition that they would not even want it with the stipulations. Is that what you're saying Alexandra? So that was my clarification needed because I know we in person it's a little different. The applicant is usually sitting there and they can talk, but since they are here and if you want to let them speak- that's fine I just wanted to get clarification on that. Okay, Trevor! Thank you! So go away. I moved Cameron into the meeting so Cameron. Thank you. Okay, Cameron, please hi there all right. So I'm happy to answer any questions you may have as to the the issue that was raised about yeah the questions about the stipulations Cameron. Have you you've already started operation? Did you have stipulations in place? Are you still willing to work with the community board on further stipulations? So to be clear, we actually voluntarily chose to wait to open until the last community board meeting, so we could try to reach stipulations and make everyone comfortable. So we actually delayed our opening in order to facilitate that conversation. For that reason we still have yet to open. So the answer to your question is: we are absolutely willing to continue to have these discussions and we've shown that by waiting- and we were hoping last week to get a resolution and be able to operate under that resolution. Unfortunately, that didn't happen, but we're still happy to do so Alex your thoughts. This is this will be the third month that we hear them and if the community board wants to send them back, we've spent considerable time on this, and the residents were really reticent about working to construct stipulations between October and November, but they did. And yes, the applicant, which is included in the resolution, returned a set of stipulations that they said they could agree to which we worked from during the discussion in November, but we couldn't resolve stipulations that were palatable to everybody. That would keep the business operating the way it is and address. What's what was going on at the business and address what's going on in the community now, because as much as and I think you hear from Susan every month about this as much as businesses may be closing below Houston Street, the issues with respect to noise and people are, if not unabated, worse right. So all of us I don't know if there's an opportunity, I'm sorry, I'm speaking. Thank you. All of those complaints remain, so those are still things that we're considering. We haven't really denied anything up to this month in all the months that we've been sitting since we've gone virtual. We did deny this one, because we felt it was a very big. They may have experience operating or working in different businesses. They have no license experience we've, given them a shot on Houston Street, which is a an area with which would impact the community much less. We have yet to see how that business is going to operate. That location has a slightly smaller capacity than this location. This is a very big capacity. I mean we had all those discussions, including the discussions that they raised about whether or not we should be promoting businesses, because because we're in a pandemic, so we had all those discussions, I feel like we had them at length. I, don't know that we're going to get to the point of resolving with stipulations for this particular application, but if the community, if I may get out, I'm sorry I, don't want to cut you off, but I really for sake of time and all of the efforts on both hands. I just have to ask Cameron. Were you willing to sit down with the members of the community, the people that are complaining to come to some type of an agreement with them, because I think that to us is the most important thing? Is that the community members are the ones that are being affected by the business right, and so we want to make sure that they are the ones that are being heard. More and I know that's Alex's whole. You know her thought process and all of this is to make sure they're honoring what the community wants. We sure were and we did- and we had a long discussion via phone and via many email exchanges trying to reach resolution that addressed the community concerns and also allowed us to remain a viable business. So we made lots of compromises and in good faith, we submitted our SLA application reflecting those compromises, even though the even though we didn't reach a resolution with the community board and those community groups couldn't find the middle ground with us, we actually submitted under those compromises to the SLA, so we have been the most flexible and compromising and continue to be open, and just so, I'm being clear in terms of stipulations. We're happy to run through. What's on paper, I think there was a question of whether we would agree to something we're happy to confirm yes or no, that we would I, don't know, I actually agree with Alex I, don't know how productive it may be to go back and relitigate this in committee from start to finish, but if we want to you know, if there's a possibility to run through stipulations, and we can confirm if we agree, we can certainly do that and if we want to go back to committee, we can also do that. I, just I actually agree with Alex. We went through that in fairly great detail. So what are we saying here because it's it's already now quarter to 10 and we need to make some type of an agreement on this particular item. Aren't we still asking the question of whether we're going to vote it voted you just do that an up and down vote yeah? Okay, sorry, you still have a hand up from David Adams that you're, never okay, David Adams, really quickly David go ahead yeah. Basically at least you just said pretty much what I was going to say and Mr Cameron and Cameron. There agreed that it's not going back I would just move the table for a month to come up with a resolution. If but doesn't what's going to happen. So if we deny they can come back next month if they can get the piece. So let's go on the tornado going right through Arlington right now. Okay, so here we go. Okay, I'll do roll call and just a reminder: I guess that no is your! You don't want to adopt the current resolution. Yes, as you want to adopt the current resolution, okay, all right, David Adams! Yes, your own Hallman abstain. I see Beck no Dominic Berg, no Lee Berman, I'm voting to deny the applicant. So is that a yes or no?

Okay, yes, is that you want to accept that resolution. To deny no is that you do not want to accept the resolution to deny yes Good Morning Troy Velez Rodney Washington, yes, Kathleen Webster, yes, Jackie Wong, yes, Ricky Wong! All right! Thank you. Everyone for bearing with me I'll tally us up. Thank you. I'll vote now shoot sorry. David go ahead. Whoa! Okay, thank you chair! Can we move on while the boat's being tallied? Okay, thank you. I'm sorry, I was muted, so wow Michelle is tallying. That up Alex was there another agenda item that we needed to discuss. Alex. Are you there I do want to say, I appreciate the hard work that my committee puts into all of this and the time that they spend on this, whether they, this particular item any item, whether they vote for or against an item, because it involves a really long. Discussion involving community and applicant concerns. Technical issues of zoning issues of history of the location history of the applicant, so I really appreciate the amount of time that they spend every month. This particular one two months in a row and I just want to say that. Thank you, Alex, okay! Michael! Can you go back to the agenda? Please. Thank you. Okay, landmarks, I need I needed to interrupt. Landmarks did not meet, but I did want to say that, after the end of the committee reports, which would be transportation and Paul we'll have a report on the vote. Thank you very much. Linda you're welcome land use. Hi I have a couple things to report, so we did pass a resolution on the zoning for coastal flood resiliency test amendment, and this is a city-wide zoning application and we denied it. However, our result does not state the reasons why we deny that and- and this test amendment covers many land use areas and is also very technical, and we just didn't have enough time at the millennials meeting to go over everything. So I wanted to motion that we referred this topic back to the December land news meeting. Just to add the reasoning part and I wanted to know if anyone has problem with that, okay, seeing none we'll move on to the next okay. Thank you and the next item is on the 70. Marble retreat. As you heard, from Borough President Gail Brewer, the independent consultant has finished. The second round come community engagement and they are working on the final report, which is expected to be released sometime in December. It will be released through a community meeting, so public members can ask follow-up questions to d cast directly, but the day has not been confirmed yet and I'll share that information with the community once it is confirmed. And lastly, I just wanted to congratulate Troy Vales, who will be the chair for the nature circum meeting for the NYCHA subcommittee and I. Look forward to working with you in December and that's all I have congratulations. Thank you. Can I say something if Susan just vote, if you just vote on it as it is you'll be voting on the resolution want to change it to refer it back to committee or something you mean, the the motion of it right: yeah you're, just leaving it there, so you haven't voted on anything. So it's still there. Okay, so David should I motion to refer. The wrestle to back to the leg, to the land. Use committee is that the procedure I should go through yeah. That's what you want to have happen. Okay, move to refer to committee, and we take a vote on that. Okay do I need someone to second it. Thank you, okay, now discussion and then you can actually just say. If there's no objection, then we will deal with that. Okay, if there's no objection, then we'll do it in the committee. Thank you several minutes. The minutes will reflect referred back to the vision. Thank you Susan. Thank you David and then the last committee was transportation and then Linda would you like for instead of transportation for Paul to give the report the final account? What do you what you'd like to do? Let's give you a committee report, okay, application. First and hold you up, go ahead, Paul and give you a transportation report. I'm sorry I know I'm the bearer of all the users right now, I'm just trying to run through I'm going to try to run through everything. We did pass three resolutions two weeks ago, the first one be supporting the Houston Street Cargo bike crowd by the whole foods we did ask for Amazon to Amazon has committed to working with CB3 to resolve any issues. As the first resolution we worked on. Second one is the open restaurant situation on Avenue B between second and fourth street. We do need to make a change in the, whereas clause right before the second to last, whereas clause it does say. Fdny previously came to community board 3 in July of 2020 and September 2020, to express concern that closing parts of iub will lead to delays in their response times, as it requires units leaving the firehouse on new second street between Avenue and Avenue B. We must change that from Avenue a Wb to Avenue, B and Avenue C. That's the only change. Is there any objection to that change? That's the actual location of the firehouse. We just made that mistake. I was oversight. I want to thank Lisa Kaplan for catching that earlier this afternoon. That's the only change I want to make there. On that resolution. We did ask for DOT to step up their inspections of the restaurants that are operating that program, especially in regards to emergency net emergency access, maintenance of the clear emergency access lane, as well as anything else, that's going on with the restaurants to make sure the public space is going beyond their means and their limits that are prescribed. So that's what we did ask for in that resolution. Our third resolution that we went to that we talked about was the bike unit and bike protected bike lane on Avenue C be an East house in street proposal. What we did ask for in this was no specific area of support for it one way or another. It was more of we wanted D.O.T to come back, so they can reach out to the residents and the businesses that would be affected on Avenue C along the route, so understand the changes that would be created by those bike lanes. We did ask for DOT to design the safest possible lanes with as much physical separation from the travel lanes. On that narrow stretch van you see between house and then fourth also, a DOT should consider creating a separate bike lane separated by plane on the blocks where they're sandwiched between the moving lane and park cars and, more importantly, I- think. The final one therefore be for the result of Dotb has committed to community board 3 for an update on the design before any type of installation occurs. I'll take any questions on any of the three resolutions. Yes, I see a hand whose hand is that who's David Adams David go ahead. David yeah, I'm just you're, putting it up at Esc or Ascr being involved. Is this going to be a temporary bike lane? This will be permanent. Even after Esco is completed, they didn't answer that one way or another I, don't think it's temporary, though it doesn't look like it. The way, they're building this structure out, because they're taking away 112 parking spaces and the if it's only to accommodate a temporary situation, no I, don't think they actually specifically addressed whether or not it was temporary. It looks like it was going to be permanent. We do know it's going to take away several parking spots down in the down in the lower Avenue C area, but we didn't specifically support one way or another. They we do ask them. They reach out to a lot of businesses and the communities that would be affected by this, because we know they haven't necessarily done that just yet, due to the pandemic a lot of things going on. So we wanted to make sure that happened. Yeah they're having a problem with the handicap spaces, they're very they're, getting knocked down more and there's people spoken to me about that. We hope they come back before that with a different with whatever their new design is after input from the community. Hopefully they should come back to us at some point. I'll take any other questions, there's one more from Trevor, so for clarification, Paul, you're, saying that they will come back before they implement this design or, yes, they have committed to updating us on before the design before the installation to update us on the design. Yes, any other questions doesn't look like any. All right should I go straight to the other report. Linda you! Yes, please do Paul all right. Let me switch my notes, so I'm gonna speak on behalf of the nominating committee. I do have the final numbers. It was verified by Ellen after I. Did the first count Ellen?

Yes, we have to vote I apologize, Michael! Thank you! Michael, okay, go out and I can I've I. It took me a little while, but I finally counted item number eight from SLA. If you saw me squinting the motion well, the current resolution will pass with 24 yeses, 20, no's, three abstentions and three absent numbers, and now I will go into the final roll call vote, David, Adams yeah! Thank you. Correct abstain, yes and everything else. Okay, sorry Michelle. At my training with the borough president, it said that the absentees were counted as no's, the people who are present but are voting as absentee. In my training it says that it counts as no yes and abstention counts as a null. So yeses outnumber all the other votes right. So it's still. Oh so yeses must outnumber absent people and abstentions. Yes, 24 yeses, 20, no's, three abstentions and three absent cool, so ignore the absolute there were 23 votes other than the 24 yes's. Yes, okay, then it won by one vote.
