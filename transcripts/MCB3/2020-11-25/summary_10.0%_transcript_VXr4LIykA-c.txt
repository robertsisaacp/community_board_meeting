So we're going to go ahead and start public session with people that I know are here.
Let us know that the upland park could be delayed and they gave us no time source for that, because it is the only entrance to the ESCR projected construction sites, So all truck traffic will be coming through Montgomery Street and they indicated that could possibly interfere with future construction of the upland park.
Now critical to public health, NYC has pivoted to address Covid-19 and reinforced access to public space programs like open, streets.
And we are going to go to four speakers who signed up to speak against item number eight on the SLA vote: sheet.
Yes, oh just one second, soon, good evening, My name is Marco Macero and like Ryan and James speaking after me, I will be a principal and a part of the management team for 120.
I would like to start this meeting by thanking everyone for their time, especially during the holiday week.
We wanted to ask the full board to reconsider, on the basis that this is a standard application consistent with the transfer of assets of the prior tenant, who had been there with for six years as part of an 18 a year chain of uninterrupted use in substantially the same method.
The Licensing committee's proposed stipulation, doesn't take into account in sufficient insufficient notice, The mitigating factors that the fact that we took into account, while caucusing with the community and the community members over the course of over a month to try and address the perceived problems at the location and try and get out ahead and address any potential.
Don't think that those were properly given shrift in the in the sla's resolution and we'd like to respectfully ask the full board to reconsider thanks.
And, you know, with most estimates, saying 50 to 75 percent of restaurant hotel and nightclub operations going out of business in New, York, City.
You know our view- is the city, and the neighborhood really need folks right now to look at these types of investments and to hire local people in high-paying jobs and to avoid you know, vacant storefronts in the neighborhood and all those things that are really closely linked to negative outcomes and safe and poor safety and other bad conditions in the neighborhood.
If we have existing licensees in Community board three, who put together good applications and work with the neighbors and are taking over places that have been operating for 17 years, And, then they're getting denied by the Cbn Community board.
I. Believe my background at hotels will help tackle some of the issues brought up by the residents and operationally make our new proposed plan work for everyone involved just to touch again.
I, didn't realize I didn't do my official form, basically I just want to say thank you to the board for last month and your support in the Grant Street guild.
The president of the Grand Street Guilds, Residents, Association and I just want to thank the board for the resolution.
And I want to especially shout out Rodney for adding on to the resolution the need to have the community to assure that the community is used in the construction, giving the community people in the on the lower east side, A preference in getting jobs for the construction.
Okay, That's not so then the last public speaker is me taking off my hat as a board member and talking about the taking on my role vice president and friends of Pearlier, Park.
If you feel like getting your hands dirty on Sunday and working off some of that turkey meal come on out spoilers for park and.
So we're having sessions for the communities that want to apply, We don't we're not going to have a lot of money.
We got rid of all that, because I want people to have a laptop or a chromebook like everybody else in the United States.
This is a memorandum that came in today stating that you know, since they had so many problems in September and now they've reached out to 650 schools that receive funding and they're, trying to figure out how to spend it and so on, and so forth.
And I know I will in terms of escrow and coast resiliency project the same issue, blower Eastside Ecology center still needs support and we are working on that.
That Christina and me I also want to thank community board, 3 and Council member Rivera, because we're working on the catholic church, properties, of which there are several in district 3, to figure out how much maximum affordable housing open space and things that you want, and we did have a discussion.
Just so you know, certainly working with Val, with Cooper Square with the council member Community Board.
However, I see that you're going to take it directly to the court of appeals, so I just want to thank you for continuing the fight.
All, right, I think we have three other elected officials on I, see assembly, member Harvey, Epstein state, senator Brad, Hoylman and state Senator, Brian, Cavanaugh, Everyone, hope everyone's having a good holiday.
I think we gave out over 700 really impressive effort, but with with our centers and council colleagues and Congress people really good day likely that we're going to go back to avid, arguably likely we'll go back to Albany in the next couple of weeks, Just because we need to do high-income partner, attacks.
We're, going to have the governor grant clemency as much as possible and also to let people go who have been incarcerated, and so if people are online with doing that, I think we have real opportunity.
But I believe it's actually like 60 million that hasn't been distributed, and the reporter asked governor Cuomo about this earlier, The in the week and.
We put, we created a more restricted program because the governor wanted less money, And I think we should have a much more robust program with more opportunities for our people to apply.
That's, going forward that Senator, Rivera and Assemblyman Gottfried have put forward, which is really trying to require a health equity assessment before a certificate of need can be given to a hospital or nursing home for transfer, downsize or whatever or closing.
I have the same question for Senator Hoyleman, Cavanaugh, Assemblymember Glick, so I don't waste time asking again, but if, If you've looked at it thought about, it would love to hear.
Think Senator, Hoyleman and I wrote a letter, maybe six months ago or a year ago trying to get better representation on the board.
Remember Godfrey, who knows you've been chair of the health committee for decades and those issue.
One is that, Pursuant to the last question about I'll answer that first, the legislation that I passed with assembly member Gottfried to increase consumer representation on the public health and Health Planning Council, because right now it is far easier to close hospitals than it is to open a hospital, and we need more consumer representatives and that's what the bill that assembly, member, Gottfried and I passed.
I'm hopeful that we can work out a plan and have some public participation on that, but I just wanted to know that's top of mind for me.
Everyone, ranging from Bill Maher to miss America, These lawsuits, You know, have blossomed and they're, often used to target, not just critics but advocates like our own Michael Mckee from Tenex pack, who was sued for 40 million dollars by the Rent Stabilization Association, because he dared to speak out in support of the new rent laws at city.
I know we've experienced that in this neighborhood and across the entire city we're calling it the furious act named after that you know classic film, fast and furious, but it's going to authorize New York City to operate speed, camera program, both overnight and on weekends, to catch some of these jackasses, which is all like what I can call them, who are making it less safe and keeping us up at night as well as change the definition of what a illegal street racing is right now the statute requires you to actually sit down and plan your route in advance in order to be charged with this infraction that's crazy.
I think you know we're likely to see continued kind of robust representation in our majority and, of course, joining our assembly.
So again, This is a primarily been a function of the governor's executive order authority and some administrative orders from the courts, but either legislatively or through pressure on the governor to address that I think we really must achieve that to ensure that we don't have evictions and again they are beginning in limited ways, but that's going to grow over time, and.
Just you know, I'm, just I, don't want to cover stuff that other people talked about just a couple.
We've been working to try to we're going to try to address that Morton with Nydia Velazquez, and you know all of our colleagues, Yulin and Margaret Chin's offices, as well.
You know, obviously, we've been Tac, we've all been working on trying to get the balance right with nightlife and make sure it's not.
You know undue quality of life concerns on our communities, but we've also seen instances where there are private gatherings, including rooftops, and so my colleagues, especially Council member Rivera and Seminar Epstein and I, have written to the management of some buildings on east, 2nd and East 3rd street.
So I want to ask you also about the health equity assessment bill and the Fitbit question, because the lack of representation, you know the results.
I just want to make sure I heard it and understood it, and let you know that we're supporting 174 foresight as well.
So now, as the second wave is coming, and we deal with this in the coming months, We can make sure we can help give recommendations to tailor our public health response to our needs, So we'll continue to push on that and make sure that our city is responding as effectively and efficiently as possible to the health pandemic.
Along, with the reason led reports, she and Senator Gillibrand have joined forces together to put pressure on NYCHA and a congresswoman was on the ground of 174 forside street last week to visit the ground and then to get first-hand information from the residents and the management, And that's it thanks.
Thanks for having me questions for the Congress member's office, All right come and see: honey.
That's been a big focus of this week and you know logistically figuring that all out the other thing that she's been really focused on is the committee meetings for 70 mulberry.
On December 9th from 5:30 to 8:30 pm the New York City, voter Assistance advisory committee is going to be holding a hearing to gather feedback on early voting throughout this year.
Is thankful for all of her colleagues support and is committed to providing older, New Yorkers with the support they need in these difficult times, and you know, as chair of aging committee.
All right we're going to go to Isabel Chandler from Council member Rivera's office, hi, good, evening, Everyone nice to see you I will try to be very brief.
Councilmember Rivera, We are working to address heat outages, gas outages as they come up in the community, specifically Haven Plaza, As many of you may, know, has experienced heat outages.
And finally, As we are experiencing, You know a rise in Covid-19 numbers concerns about community health and Safety.
Well, I'm, going to ask the nominating committee because I know Paul had set a deadline, so Paul.
Creative ways to make sure we can vote and not be disenfranchised as Michelle has mentioned, but just thank you to the economy and committee for coming up with this procedure.
Thank, you everyone again for considering to continue to support me as your board chair, having an opportunity to serve you in our community as chair for the past.
Our leadership reflect that and the goal is to work towards appointing new committee members as they would like to be in leadership.
I also want to continue to review the operations of our board and the committees, and if there are any issues that are going, on.
I'd like for members to reach out to me directly and don't be afraid to tell me when something is not right, because that's the only way we're gonna fix things.
Just, telling you a little bit about me, because a lot of what I've heard from people is that they don't really know who I am.
We still did those Javits center, then transitioned into a career in non-profit, fundraising and development, Helping raise millions of dollars for various different organizations, including Broadway, cares Equity fight dates and gay men's health crisis and the Empire State pride agenda, and for over the past decade and a half, probably I've, been working in higher Ed Administration, specifically research, administration.
So again, I just wanted to give you a little bit of glimpse of my professional career, and maybe that helps you understand why I think I can transfer some of those skills into being the chair of the community Board.
I've also had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge of this community and how city government works when I served for six years as Rosie Mendes Councilwoman Rosie Mendez, his chief of staff, I've, been active in both staff and board.
Everyone I appreciate the opportunity to run for first vice chair, I know a lot of people.
Last, year, I, was appointed to the governor cab, which is the place I've been hoping to get appointed to knowing what a key role that hospital plays in delivering services to our vulnerable community I was just elected to first vice chair of that cab and very excited to make sure that the communication flows from the cab to the community board, so that we can work in tangent to make sure the services don't get cut.
Okay for second vice chair, We have Eric Diaz, hello, Yep, okay, great hi, Community Board, Three just wanted to introduce myself to some new committee members and also to the faithful community board members that have been with me since 2015, when I was first appointed to community board three.
I just want to take the opportunity to tell you that I look forward to being the second vice chair.
Or I'm, the vice chair for the transportation committee, where I get to support Paul Rangel, who is my friend and dear colleague, and I'm running for secretary this time around after doing a lot of the secretarial work since the beginning of the pandemic, because Eric has been working so hard in the neighborhood to support families in need, and.
Children, I've I'm on the health, Human Services hospital, seniors, homeless, Human, Rights, Committee, education, I'm, really interested in shifting education for our community and really looking into how to shore up mental health issues, because that's become a big thing.
We submit because, yes, What happened I made a mis I made a mistake in voting, Otherwise, okay, I think it'll go in, you know it might.
They said somewhere in the new year that they would be able to possibly put out more training and dates and times in the near future, but for right.
Resolution, training for December 7th and, as our borough president announced tonight, that the full board applications for community boards is going to go out and will be due for February.
First, If I'm, not mistaken, it will be a great opportunity for all of you to reach out to members of the community people that may have not had an opportunity to participate in the community board process if they're interested in becoming community leaders, people that you know, for whatever reason you might feel like hey.
I think it's a really important thing to keep working on, and you know I think it's just.
Sorry, any questions, please use the raise hand, function, I, think we're good Alicia.
The executive, like I, said before the executive voted on this one item and Lisa and Linda both worked on it.
Oh, how did you get that item on the agenda and sometimes there's no explanation on how information is given right, no resolution, so resolutions are allowed, but at times there might be a hard time getting the matter for legitimate, like gathering further information, You know, like a lot of people.
Is that what you're saying yes in essence, that people would know in advance that a resolution would not be heard at that.
It's been part of our policies already that certain things are just informational, often I, think only because there's only one perspective there, the issues you're talking about like the parks agencies, coming, that's never informational.
That can may require us to make a a resolution, David I think this is hard for, like Claire, I'm, sorry, Susan, I.
Okay, Thank you all right, Alicia, I'm, sorry to interject here, but you have three hands up from other community board: members.
Because, like Lisa says we're really talking about the other side of the issue, as opposed to items that we're going to vote.
If it comes to it that something surprising happens, but that I've been in multiple meetings when it really wasn't clear to people that it was really informational, that there wasn't going to be a vote in communities.
Concern is also fair, so not today, but we could also consider trusting each other and our various committees and actually presume that there can always be a resolution, but the committee chairs and the committee members will know if this is a first presentation and they don't want to deliberate yet because our difficulty at land use has been that at times we really wanted to say something.
There is an item in the agenda to do a resolution on it, You know as adults.
You know some items may be introduced to a committee where a subject is on the agenda and may be made public and may be voted because I think when it says resolution a resolution to me, maybe means something that's going to be voted on.
Is, that what we're saying is with regard to any item on the agenda resolutions may be introduced and voted on is so wording.
I thought it was clear, but if that helps Clint that that's what it means, it's just that the way it's worded here is that it's talking about the item on the agenda can can be addressed through a resolution at all times unless there's an asterisk after that item on the agenda.
Again I, think it should be agenda items can't maybe introduce and voted on as resolutions or something you know, or just or at least take out completely the whole that middle sentence.
Basically, So if there are any questions about that, first resolution, please let me know.
If you're on, If you'd like to talk about your first resolution, the first resolution was asking for the city to consider instituting WPA style work programs in order to help the arts community recover about 70 percent of the arts.
Community has lost funding and during this period of time, and so it was thought that perhaps one of the best ways to address the issue is that they needed support from city and state agencies, If possible, and if federal funding comes through to support this community by establishing work programs that would employ artists and arts organizations.
The legislation was introduced to the City Council to support arts and culture organizations and artists to be able to perform on the street, But it also stated that it would have to follow guidelines, there's a self-permitting process involved, so at any rate, as stated, It will go back to the committee on December 2nd and we will resubmit the resolution for after that meeting there.
To, The committee right, so you guys are going to further work.
They need to be aware that what happened at that meeting there were a lot of problems and that we're going to be working on that as a whole, with the leadership and.
Yes, I'm glad this is going back to committee, because I want to come to that meeting and again of this.
Glad that this is going back because I want to be in that meeting to I've been working on with the group of culturals on this legislation as well.
At, the same time, I've talked with our community Board office about seeing if we can get some construction meeting to have to grab hold of all these projects going on.
So, there's a something positive about that, meaning that they're likely to be completed on time, But we got to make sure that we keep the city honest about these deadlines because we don't want to lose those federal funds.
I need probably David's guidance on this, but I'd like to give the entire board an opportunity to vote up and down on number eight 120 orchard.
Yes well just because right now the resolution says to deny so obviously would I have to offer an amendment to it.
Okay, so I moved to amend the resolution to add the stipulations that are outlined in the fifth, whereas clause, starting with number one and ending with oh sorry, wait, I'm, looking at the wrong paragraph, I.
That was my question about how we should proceed with this, because I would like it to get an up and down vote on by the board, but I'm just asking what the best way to go about that is.
That, at the end of the resolution, because I wanted to have a fair, hearing, so I think one of the principals who spoke said we hadn't done that.
The things we think might be relevant stipulations for this type of business and do it in an efficient way where we can create a resolution with stipulations that the applicants could then sign.
Trevor has his hand up, and then I also wanted to ask whether you think this is worth us, maybe pulling the item since it's such a hardy discussion about it.
They don't necessarily reflect the way the new business wanted to operate completely or address their proposed method of operation, but this is still a straight-up denial, not on denial, unless even with that particular paragraph, and in order to do that you're saying because of the complexity, it will probably need to go back to committee.
Michelle, oh I was just going to ask what the best if we should pull it or if we should have people vote no against, but if I'll do a motion to man to committee, If that's the best way to do, it, yeah.
One item right at the end of this committee, report, I, ask a clarifying question, I, I'm, a little confused.
And I'm asking if we should do an up and down vote yes or no on this current resolution.
So I was going to second that, but it sounds like we need to vote.
I don't know if there would be need to be a vote for that.
The committee can I clarify, though we're voting yes, actually, because the motion is to deny.
If we vote no you're saying we are not going to send any resolution like this now Susan's hand, I want to ask your procedural, thing.
I, don't know that it may be that the stipulations get imposed, But the intention of the community groups that came opposed to this are that they're going to go to the SLA to be heard on this particular application.
I think they may be, but I don't know, because those issues still remained outstanding at the time that we constructed them, What I'm trying to say is procedural.
Don't think that we said that in the resolution and in fact we did hear them for a location on Houston Street and approved them for that location, and that has was issued that has yet to open.
Just so, people stopped texting me eight million times yeah everyone to know that the applicants are still on.
Think I, remember in person meetings that the applicant was there and was willing to work out certain stipulations.
Are, you still willing to work with the community board on further stipulations.
This will be the third month that we hear them and if the community board wants to send them, back, we've spent considerable time on this, and the residents were really reticent about working to construct stipulations between October and November, but they did.
And yes, The applicant, which is included in the resolution, returned a set of stipulations that they said they could agree to which we worked from during the discussion in November, but we couldn't resolve stipulations that were palatable to everybody.
I, don't know that we're going to get to the point of resolving with stipulations for this particular application, but if the community, if I may get out, I'm sorry.
Were you willing to sit down with the members of the community, the people that are complaining to come to some type of an agreement with them, because I think that to us is the most important thing.
Yes, as you want to adopt the current resolution, okay, All right, David Adams.
Okay, We are voting on SLA item number, Eight, right, I.
Okay, yes, is that you want to accept that resolution.
I. Do want to say, I appreciate the hard work that my committee puts into all of this and the time that they spend on this, whether they, this particular item any item, whether they vote for or against an item, because it involves a really long.
The resolution want to change it to refer it back to committee or something you mean.
They reach out to a lot of businesses and the communities that would be affected by this, because we know they haven't necessarily done that just yet, due to the pandemic, a lot of things going: on.
So I want to say thank you for that, and thank you for the entire nomination committee for the hard work we've put into this process and congratulations to all the nominees for the respective offices.
And I want to thank my fellow executive board members who have been with me for this past year.
There's a lot of work to be done in committee.
And I, look forward to our new members joining us and whatever that's going to look like, as many of you have shared, very detailed with me about the work that needs to be done.
