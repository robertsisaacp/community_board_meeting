Yes, good evening, hello, all welcome to the Manhattan community board, 3 health, seniors, Human, Services, Youth education and Human Rights Committee, meeting.
This is our monthly meeting and on today's before I start the meeting and talk about what's on our agenda, today, Larissa will just introduce what it is that you know some guidelines briefly, since I think we're all very familiar with the guidelines just to review pulling those up You are not a committee member.
Now now for the you know, the main part of our meeting, we're going to discuss district needs.
So I guess one of the things I would want to just state in this initial paragraph is about the amount of learning loss that has happened with these students, regardless of their grade, students with disabilities, Students in temporary housing, students, ENL students, whatever in all the different categories, that the the onset of like blended learning and online school has created a huge education equity gap due to due to inadequate access.
I know this has happened in many houses where you know, there's five people using the internet It's not working at a good quality for anybody, regardless of their income level.
I would also need time to read it because I was in meetings when it was sent so can, and you did offer that so I'm wondering if we could And, then people started talking making comments right, away, no shade, I'm, going back and asking if we could.
Okay, hello, naomi we're talking about our district needs statement and people are taking some time to read.
You know we're reading we're just reviewing this district needs statement, which is for the next fiscal year, 2001 to 22.
That's, the you know the budgets, the budget priorities of the different agencies that are involved in funding these helping with these unmet needs.
Is, that something that we would want to mention either budgetarily or in terms of the needs for the district like in the school level?
I mean you know, especially the theme of this whole section of the our district needs statement.
So, it's not to say we're changing the need for a new school, but you know focus in light of this.
I'm wondering if, like maybe naomi, could give us an update on that too, because I'm wondering, if that's just given the state of our schools, So much of our district needs, I know, there's a need, So just so you know we're not going to get this new school next year, but you know, I, will tell you, the school construction authority is not concerned with building buildings or they're more cons.
You know they have they're going to have larger issues, making sure that when it's flush and there's soap in bathrooms and the ventilation system works and windows open, because all those things have been in such disrepair for decades and they've gotten away with not doing it for so long that they have to address it.
I do not even know what's going to happen with the with those actual projects that are happening like in Queens that they were building schools, because we are such a budget.
The second thing is about the the issue of youth perk of the particularly the head start programs that you know there's this phenomenon where families are no longer qualified for the programs because of the income requirements.
Just, like what question on the pay disparity portion would not that be a budgetary issue, not necessarily a district, or am I wrong in that assessment It would not that affect budgets of nonprofits if the city, if dycd's, given an x amount of money but we're not looking at the specific budgets, here, we're looking at the general overall problem?
It's, going to cause a budget issue for non- profits they would have to receive they I mean they get funding from the city from DYCD , so DYCD would have to increase their funding to cover.
That was clear whether their funding would increase, because the salary changed I mean these are not mandates, though these are contracts right, so we're sure that they're going to fund it at the level to keep the staffing the same okay.
You talked about the funding they needed any questions about this whole senior citizen, we're basically beholden to what the city can offer.
Many of the senior centers are closed, so I do not know two years from now how this is going to look.
For next July we right Where is oh, no, it's in health, okay, Now we're talking about health care needs and services.
I'm not saying the need has decreased, but does it fit in here with the other things that we're talking about the second thing in terms of drug overdose, you know , You know more drugs, people seeing more drug use on the street, and so it's that's a symptom of a health problem that needs to be fixed, Maybe the health problem is being made worse by everything.
Maybe we can just call some of the substance, abuse Nonprof Nonprofits that deal with them and ask if they can give us any figures in increase that they're, seeing But I I'm not going to ask you because I was just rereading transportation's district needs We address some of those stuff from a different angle, more of a communication angle, than what we're looking to do here in terms of the homelessness and public safety.
You know it's different from the other needs that we're talking about the mental health and the drugs and the chronic illnesses.
Then we just need to clarify about the pay parity and we may, depending we may, take it all out or leave it in depending what Hey, I have a question or wanted to hear other people's thoughts too about the page.
Do it because they're also working on the other section from the other committees, and they need to consolidate something you know by October for the entire board to review Then also next, the month we will vote on the vote and discuss budget priorities right at the committee And It'll be all the budget priorities.
But let's not think that this is a public hearing where we have to let everyone talk as long as they need to talk now, you can give them like two minutes to decide whatever it is decide what you're going to do.
