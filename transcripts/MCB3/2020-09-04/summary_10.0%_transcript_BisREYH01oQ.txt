Hello all welcome to the Manhattan community board, 3 health, seniors, human services, youth, education and human rights committee.
This is our monthly meeting and on today's before I start the meeting and talk about what's on our agenda, today, larissa will just introduce what it is that you know some guidelines briefly, since I think we're all very familiar with the guidelines just to review pulling those up You are not a committee member.
Now now for the you know, the main part of our meeting, we're going to discuss district needs.
I guess one of the things I would want to just state in this initial paragraph is about the amount of learning loss that has happened with these students, regardless of their grade, students with disabilities, Students in temporary housing, students, ENL students, whatever in all the different categories, that the the onset of like blended learning and online school has created a huge education equity gap due to due to inadequate access.
I know this has happened in many houses where you know, there's five people using the internet It's not working at a good quality for anybody, regardless of their income level.
I would also need time to read it because I was in meetings when it was sent so can, and you did offer that so I'm wondering if we could Then people started talking making comments right, away, no shade, I'm, going back and asking if we could.
Okay, hello, naomi we're talking about our district needs statement and people are taking some time to read.
That's, the you know the budgets, the budget priorities of the different agencies that are involved in funding these helping with these unmet needs.
So, for example, I know carmen had a section about newark's and she talked about funding for newark's, so that'll be important, but That'll be for the budget.
Is that something that we would want to mention, either budgetarily or in terms of the needs for the district like in the school level?
I mean you know, especially the theme of this whole section of the our district needs statement.
So, that's not to say anything else is not important, but You know we just want to have a theme and make it more a little bit more focused just to let you know in terms of what the need for the new school , it, a lot, how we need more new school space.
So, it's not to say we're changing the need for a new school, but you know focus in light of this.
You know they have they're going to have larger issues like you, know, making sure that when it's flush and there's soap in bathrooms and the ventilation system works and windows open, because all those things have been in such disrepair for decades and they've gotten away with not doing it for so long that they have to address it.
The second thing is about the the issue of youth perk of the particularly the head start programs that you know there's this phenomenon where families are no longer qualified for the programs because of the income requirements.
Let's look at the legislation and see if it includes you know, increasing the contract, because that is a thing that nonprofits sometimes have that you know they just want to make sure that they get the money as well.
You talked about the funding they needed any questions about this whole senior citizen, we're basically beholden to what the city can offer.
You know more drugs, people seeing more drug use on the street, and so it's that's a symptom of a health problem that needs to be fixed, Maybe the health problem is being made worse by everything.
You know it's different from the other needs that we're talking about the mental health and the drugs and the chronic illnesses.
Do it because they're also working on the other section from the other committees, and they need to consolidate something you know by October for the entire board to review Then also next, the month we will vote on the vote and discuss budget priorities right at the committee And It'll be all the budget priorities.
What I actually did was get d.o.t and DOE and DOE to start talking to each other formally about creating a process for schools to be able to apply for open streets , You know, maybe at that point they weren't asking for outdoor classes So next month in October, as I said, we will be voting on budget priorities.
So there's going to be a lot of unhappy people, but you know, The situation.
They'll also need to do some work to prepare Yeah, make sure people understand what they're really doing, because there's also a lot of misunderstanding as well, but there's more to it than that.
But, let's not think that this is a public hearing where we have to let everyone talk as long as they need to talk now, you can give them like two minutes to decide whatever it is decide what you're going to do.
