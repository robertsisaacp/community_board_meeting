If you have the exact language, you may just say what your revisions are and thomas will type it in, but if you're really good at typing your revisions, you can drop it in the chat box and larissa will put it in The. First section is on education and youth, So I guess one of the things I would want to just state in this initial paragraph is about the amount of learning loss that has happened with these students, regardless of their grade students with disabilities, students in temporary housing students, enl students, whatever in all the different categories, that the the onset of like blended learning and online school has created a huge education equity gap due to due to inadequate access.
I know this has happened in many houses where you know, there's five people using the internet and it's not working at a good quality for anybody, regardless of their income level, and maybe this isn't part of district needs, but it's?
I, don't know, maybe this isn't the right place for it, but I think it's an important thing to think about right here when we're talking about this If you read through, we do have statistics about the amount of people in our community The inequities, particularly with I, think 25 percent- have absolutely no access whatsoever, but also focus on the fact that this statement is for the fiscal year starting next july.
I would also need time to read it because I was in meetings when it was sent so can, and you did offer that so I'm wondering if we could and then people started talking, making comments right away, no shade I'm going back and asking if we could.
That's the you know the budgets, the budget priorities of the different agencies that are involved in funding these helping with these unmet needs So. If you write grant proposals, you know the first question: : they ask you: What's the need faced by your community and This is only that first question and we took some of it out because it belongs in the budget priority section and she talked about funding for newark's, so that'll be important, but that'll be for the budget priorities.
I know it's going to be a need, but it's hard to know if it'll be a need within the next two years in terms of PPE Is, that something that we would want to mention either budgetarily or in terms of the needs for the district like in the school level?
, I'm hearing what you're saying about the new school section and how we can focus it more I'm wondering if, like maybe naomi, could give us an update on that too, because I'm wondering, if that's just given the state of our schools, So much of our district needs.
I make one comment: it's not vegetation, but let's Covid-19 it and I think you will particularly in health sections, so the next we're going to move on to the next section after education It's a subsection of this education You know, there's a problem in NYCHA housing.
Let's look at the legislation and see if it includes you know, increasing the contract, because that is a thing that nonprofits sometimes have that you know they just want to make sure that they get the money as well : Let's we hold off until we read it like tonight minimum income Can. You change that to maximum income?
All right next is seniors so for senior centers Our first section is just like a demographic that we, you know some demographics on the seniors which we lifted from last year, and then we have five different four different concerns: Concerns about isolation, food access, some wellness concerns and then just staying informed with accurate information.
She also had mentioned ageism, but I thought that was not a need, but something that people faced and it does impact the seniors, but it wasn't like So then so then we talk about senior centers and newark's and how they and how they provide programs.
It was just like some wording around the idea of the new school, but naomi spoke very clearly about the lack of possibility for that, and then we just need to clarify about the pay parity and we may, depending we may, take it all out or leave it in depending what Hey I have a question or wanted to hear other people's thoughts too about the page.
You know, maybe at that point they weren't asking for outdoor classes So next month in october, as I said, we will be voting on budget priorities We also, and also this district needs statement.
