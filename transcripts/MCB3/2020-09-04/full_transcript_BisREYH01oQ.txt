Recording, oh yes, good evening, hello, all welcome to the Manhattan community board, 3 health, seniors, Human, Services, Youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting. This is our monthly meeting and on today's before I start the meeting and talk about what's on our agenda today, Larissa will just introduce what it is that you know some guidelines briefly, since I think we're all very familiar with the guidelines just to review pulling those up right now bear with me computers, starting to behave, misbehaved, okay, welcome and thank you all for attending. I do have a few guidelines for tonight's meeting. This meeting is being recorded. If you are not a committee member, please make sure that you sign in with your name and affiliation.

Click the button labeled raise hand if you're on your phone. If you want to raise your hand, you can press the star 9 keys after each presentation for tonight's meeting. The chair will take comments and questions from board members first and then the public will have a chance to speak. Okay, so okay, so thank you so so the first just the first thing we're going well. Our agenda is very simple tonight: it's just to approve the minutes. The first thing. The second thing is to discuss the district needs. All the members should have received a draft like not too long ago of what we'll be talking about and then finally, we are going to well yeah, that's the main part of our meeting and then we'll go into any announcements and also any reports from cabs or other or Cec's that for meetings that we've been to in the past month, okay, so final and then we'll vote to adjourn. But in terms of the minutes I know that usually our procedure is to vote to approve the minutes. So we learned that a one of our training workshops that you do not have to vote to approve the minutes. You just approve it, but if there are any changes to the minutes, then those changes need to be approved. So so, first of all did everyone receive the minutes. It was sent out after the last meeting and just a few days before this one. Yes, okay, I guess that's a yes, okay, so good. Are there any changes to the minutes? No, all! Okay! No! I abstained because I was not in attendance last month. Oh okay, so surely we do not actually have okay. It's good to know, but we do not we're not actually voting on the minutes. Well, yeah we'll only vote on it. If anyone wants to vote on a change. Okay, great thanks, okay! So then, since there are no changes, so we are going to approve the minutes. We're going to have roll call, okay, yeah, but we will have roll calls. Okay. So that's the first okay! So that's our meeting. So the second thing we will do is to have roll calls. The roll call is simply a roll call. It's not a vote on the minutes. Okay, yeah, so Thomas will take the role. The attendance okay, Melee, Present, Larissa David is here: Eric Diaz, Charlie Fantasy, yes, Deborah Jeffrey, Glass present Tatiana President Paul, yeah Party. We are present ricky wong here and Carmen Perez carmen all right, we're down with that part. Okay, great! Okay! Thank you! Thomas, okay! So now now for the you know, the main part of our meeting we're going to discuss district needs. Okay, so we're going to show it on the screen, but you can also open it. You know in your on your computer and we the draft here we s after you guys, oh Larissa, do you want to show it? Okay, so Larissa is going to show it on the screen. The draft that you received is the latest revisions. It includes some information. It includes all the you know, information from the presentations as well, some updating of statistics. If you show the com- okay, I'll, go over it, because that we have some questions and comments or you know on some of the sections. Do people need some time to read it? Did you get a chance to we'll go over it, we'll do a Sec. So the way the procedure is we'll go over it section by section and then we will see if we have any changes or revisions at this time. The most helpful thing is to give exact language all right, and then it will be done on the screen, as you know, so, you'll watch it being done. If you know, if you have the exact language, you may just say what your revisions are and Thomas will type it in, but if you're really good at typing your revisions, you can drop it in the Chat, Box and Larissa will put it in. Does that sound good with everyone? Okay, so there are five sections. The first section is on education and youth. So I guess one of the things I would want to just state in this initial paragraph is about the amount of learning loss that has happened with these students, regardless of their grade students with disabilities, students in temporary housing students, ENL students, whatever in all the different categories, that the the onset of like blended learning and online school has created a huge education equity gap due to due to inadequate access. However, we want to say it, and then I would also I guess one of my other thinkings is so. This is a question that has been you know. I know this has happened in many houses where you know there's five people using the internet and it's not working at a good quality for anybody, regardless of their income level. So I guess one of my questions might be around. How do we- and maybe this is not part of district needs, but it's? How do we help to enhance the internet capability of all households, especially the households of these children who have experienced you know lack of devices, lack of resources, lack of access? I do not know. Maybe this is not the right place for it, but I think it's an important thing to think about right here when we're talking about this, I think we do. If you read through, we do have statistics about the amount of people in our community. The inequities, particularly with I think 25 percent- have absolutely no access whatsoever, but also focus on the fact that this statement is for the fiscal year starting next July. So we're not talking about the coming year, or this are particularly even being involved in remote learning we're talking about the years. That's going to start next July, but it definitely brought up the the inequity of internet and which is, I know, it's in there somewhere, okay yeah. I would just say that I think it's important to think about this as a possible new reality, and I think you know, even though it's next July and we think everything's going to be the same as it was before. I just think that there is somewhere that we need to. We need to really think about that, like the fact that there's been so much learning loss, there's been so much. There is okay, yeah, okay, so let me let me stop you there for a minute so yeah. I know all about the learning loss and all that- and I mean you know anyone who's, a teacher or a parent or kid themselves knows about it, but so, okay, so all these things you talk about, you know again think about next year and how it will impact next year. I mean probably I'm sure that has some sort of impact on next year and then also in terms of the technology. Did you look down to the bottom? Where we talk about four or four or five different priorities, and one of the priorities is technology, is that sufficient to address what you're talking about it's? Actually I sent this in an email. I'm sorry. It was only about maybe an hour and a half ago, but it's up here now on the screen. I just popped up yeah. I popped up the technology paragraph if there's anything that surely you'd like to change or add to this paragraph recording so technology support both providing interest in the investor equipment, Wi-, fi and technical support is needed to ensure yes, that is correct. Does it is there more in the next page? If you can just scroll down a little bit? Oh yeah, no, there's not yeah! I mean I guess this is insufficient. We really I mean this is a huge issue, so yeah. I think this is sufficient to explain the problem yeah. So what we're doing now is explaining the problem. Yeah. Remember! Okay. Tonight, can I ask you a question amazing? When we first started you offered, if folks needed a few minutes to look it over. You know literally some of it. Some people just got just got in from work, and I it kept the updated the update came in while I was at work. So I would appreciate I do not know three minutes of not. I do not know. If is it just me, does anyone else need like no? I would also need time to read it because I was in meetings when it was sent so can, and you did offer that so I'm wondering if we could and then people started talking making comments right away, no shade, I'm going back and asking if we could, if we could do that, because you know Shirley's reading, she made suggestions it's hard to sort of process it all yeah, okay, if every, how does everyone else feel about that about that? Can you? Yes, no does someone else also want to do that or not want to do that? Okay, I see a thumbs up from great brother would be great, heidi says. Yes, we need more okay, well Heidi, okay, at least oh tom. No David did you have your hand up David Crane I did earlier, but I think we should just wait until people have tried to read it. Okay, hello, naomi we're talking about our district needs statement and people are taking some time to read it. You know when everyone received it were there these comments on the side. You know, because in the Google Doc there are comments on the side, but I do not know if it comes out when I download it. If you go to the folder, there is one version that does have the comments on the side, not this one. I believe how many versions are there? Oh, this is the one we've been working on. Are you okay? I just want to make sure there's one last version: if you open it and drive the comments, are there? Oh, that's it! Oh! No! I have it open in drive right now. Maybe you want to open it up as a microsoft word document instead of a Google Drive Google doc. Well, we want to we want to edit it in the Google Drive right now copy yeah, sorry disregard it's. Okay. I can go over it with you. It's not like a whole lot of comments, but there'll be there's. You know like one or two sections, basically stuff that we got from before. Oh there. It is that we, you know, just lift it out of last year, but maybe we want to delete it or change it. So, naomi. You know we're reading we're just reviewing this district needs statement, which is for the next fiscal year, 2001 to 22. You know the next academic year. Yes, and we know things are changing by the hour and it'll probably be different tomorrow right. But if there's anything we really need to know about cec1 or the schools. You should let us know, but right now we're talking about next year. Two, maybe you think it's maybe may. Unless yes do, you think maybe it's worth mentioning earth kind of a repeat as well as this being for next year, that it's focusing on Unmet needs which will later be dealt with in budget requests, but not budget requests here or policy statements here and it's just basically noting the unmet needs right: okay, yeah! Okay, that's great! So I just want so, as Susan said just wanted to remind everyone. This is just about the needs. You know and the unmet needs later on. We, you know, may take actions or may endorse policies or you know, and then there we will also be involved with the budget priorities. That's the you know the budgets, the budget priorities of the different agencies that are involved in funding these helping with these unmet needs. So this is so. If you write grant proposals, you know the first question: they ask you: what's the need faced by your community and then later they ask you know, what's the solution, what do you want to do about it? This is only that first question. That's all it is so so you'll notice that some of you had submitted. You know some sections and we took some of it out because it belongs in the budget priority section. So, for example, I know carmen had a section about Newark's and she talked about funding for Newark's, so that'll be important, but that'll be for the budget priorities. May I had a concern, I know it's going to be a need, but it's hard to know if it'll be a need within the next two years in terms of PPE. Is that something that we would want to mention either budgetarily or in terms of the needs for the district like in the school level? You mean well we'll be having to wear PPE for like the next three years. I would hope not, but just to mention that, maybe that there is a need right now. I mean because we're going back into the buildings on the 21st with students and we have PPE for now. But it's you know, the burn rate has not been assessed yet because we have not had all the people in the building. I just mentioned. As an aside, maybe yeah, I would say you know so again we're talking about next July, but when you're looking at the major unmet needs that would fall, probably within a category but not as a major knee. It has not been three minutes or how is everyone doing personally, one more minute? I'm almost finished okay, and I can talk you through it too. If you know that makes it easier because it is like 12 pages. Thank you for that time, I'm ready when you're another friend yeah. I think everyone needed the time, but you know well, I'm glad it helped. Okay. So are we ready to go? Yes? No oh[ _ _], okay. So let's go back okay. So let's go back to the beginning on education and youth. We have an introductory paragraph and then we talk about the education and use used to be two sections, but we kind of we put it into one since it. You know blends into one another education there's an introductory paragraph and then it states that there are four different priorities. Four or five priorities for education needs for this year. It's the social workers and counselors, there's the technology and then there's the after school programs, and then we also put back in the need for the new school. So these are all you know. I mean you know, especially the theme of this whole section of the our district needs statement. Is you know, in light of you know, Covid-19 pandemic, you know what were the issues or needs that were exacerbated or highlighted. So that's not to say anything else is not important, but you know we just want to have a theme and make it more a little bit more focused just to let you know in terms of what the need for the new school and we've talked about it, a lot, how we need more new school space. So it's definitely. We still want to include it in there. Although you will notice what we do. Not the only thing we did was we lifted the whole thing from last year and just plugged it in there, but I believe that it needs some sort of consolidation or focus on what is happening now. So, it's not to say we're changing the need for a new school, but you know focus in light of this current situ. You know this whole pandemic, then all I believe that all these things that we said last year are still true. It's not like there have been improvements or changes. Necessarily it's just that yeah. We want to focus what do people think do they have any suggestions or ideas or agree with that or not agree with it? Tatiana yeah. I just wonder you know I'm hearing what you're saying about the new school section and how we can focus it more. I'm wondering if, like maybe naomi, could give us an update on that too, because I'm wondering, if that's just given the state of our schools, that I know it's a year from now, but that they will still be in a year from now. If that's something that we still want to be taking up so much of our district needs, I know there's a need, but yeah. So just so you know we're not going to get this new school next year, but you know, but we want yeah. This is a placeholder to say that we think we still need it did not disappear. The need did not disappear. Oh naomi, did you want? Oh Tatiana? Did you have more to say? No, that's all. I was just wondering if naomi could give us sort of an update on that. A question is being asked of: you: hey hi everyone thanks for that question. I am uncertain about a whole lot of things these days. Sadly, the days of me being in the new are not really existent. I will tell you, the school construction authority is not concerned with building buildings or they're more cons. You know they have they're going to have larger issues, making sure that when it's flush and there's soap in bathrooms and the ventilation system works and windows open, because all those things have been in such disrepair for decades and they've gotten away with not doing it for so long that they have to address it now with all our 1800 buildings. But I do not think at the moment. I do not. You know school construction authority's not looking to build anything new. I to be honest with you. I do not even know what's going to happen with the with those actual projects that are happening like in Queens that they were building schools, because we are such a budget deficit. I do not know if that was cut, because you know if you have to fund one thing and do not have the money, I'm sure they're playing a lot of like shifting money around. So I will definitely look into it I'll ask and I'll. Let you guys know. Okay, thank you. Oh David yeah. I was going to say I think, regardless we want this information because we should be strategizing but regardless. I think we need to leave this in here and it reads pretty. Well it kind of states the case. Maybe the case could be made differently or emphasize differently, based on what we think might have influence later, but I kind of like the section, as is for our purposes, there's no limit on the length of district needs. We do want it to be approachable, but there's no like technical limit. Well, they pref. What can remember they said. Try to keep it to 20. used to be could not be longer than 20 pages now they say, try and limit it to about 20 pages. So I do not know. I I'm hoping that when May said this section is 12 pages, I'm hoping it's only a four only because of formatting and there's really not 12 pages. It looks like 12. well if it's 12 pages it's over, it's over half of the whole board. So if we add stuff I would suggest you know taking away to I mean just to be strategic trick. It's Mike Peter. Can I offer a suggestion for something to cut the paragraph that begins the nycd DOE mandates, 120 minutes of physical education per week. That kind of explains the reason for not creating the cafeteria gymatoriums, but we can cut that out because that seems a little redundant, so you're suggesting to cut it out to delete that. Yes, those two lines for start because it's redundant, oh, what do others say? Yes? Does someone agree that we should delete it or disagree? I may I raise my hand. Oh sorry, unmute, or should I raise my hand you? Well, you should speak now, okay, just in general, just trying to do what I'm supposed to do so. Oh, I see I can't down. So I actually think that if this is if this is essentially a placeholder, which is what I think I'm hearing, I think it should remain as is and regarding Larissa's thought about deleting that one line. I think it's important, because it's a direct contradiction to it's stating in plain language that the schools as they exist are not meeting department of education requirements. So I do not think that line should come out. Sorry, Larissa, okay, so this is the okay. So does anyone have anything on comments on the education section right now? If not, we can move on to the next one a lot of silence. So I guess that means we can move on. I make one comment: it's not vegetation, but let's Covid-19 it. I do not think Covington is going to end. You know early next year, maybe this particular one, but I think that we're going to potentially have a series of pandemics that arose in the same way. This one did, and so you know we kind of. I do not necessarily think we should refocus the language here, but the fact is, I think we need to be prepared in the future for similar epidemics, so some things are rising tight. That's all right! Yeah, okay, thank you and I would say I think I think that's right and I think you will particularly in health sections. You will see that acknowledged, because I think the presenters kind of made that point okay, good. Okay, so we will okay, so the next we're going to move on to the next section after education. So it's a subsection of this education, youth and we're talking about Unmet needs in the youth programs. So this is the information we got from our youth presenters. I think it was mainly from educational alliance and we talk about the facilities sort of these contradictions with you know facilities they. You know poorly maintained facilities in NYCHA buildings, and you know that's something that you know these are needs that are that overlap? It's a it's! An overlapping need, like other areas, see the same thing. You know there's a problem in NYCHA housing. So then, therefore there's a problem with the youth programs and the senior centers that are located in NYCHA housing and there's a lot of you know: maintenance issues there that no one is paying attention to and nobody is paying for and then the non- profits who run the programs are left to deal with it themselves either by just trying to fix it themselves, which they're not really supposed to do. And then you know having to dig out money from you know their programs to pay for this from their operating expenses to pay for this. So then the second thing is about the the issue of youth perk of the particularly the head start programs that you know there's this phenomenon where families are no longer qualified for the programs because of the income requirements. So the income requirements are they're the federal guidelines. I do not know if it's a hundred or hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level for head start, but you know, but we have living wage so living wages, fifteen dollars and if you work full time, make fifteen dollars an hour. You make about 30,000 and that's before. That's gross you know and take home, you know, is a lot less. So you think of a family of you know even there's a single parent and one kid. That's not very much money and they still need these programs, but the income requirements have not been updated, so you have all these families who need it, but they can't get into the program. So that's what this is talking about and the final thing is about pay parity or paid this parity. If you work for a pre- k program, that's run by DOE, you get paid a lot more than if you work for a same pre- k program run by DYCD and the DYCD programs are often run by the non- profits. So you have these. You know I mean we ran into this issue before, where the you know, people with the same credentials, doing the same jobs, get different pay, you know depending upon the funding source and then whatever what and then you know these non- profits are running the DYCD programs. I know a lot of them do a good job to run it, but then they're ending up. You know they're competing with the doa funded programs. You know because they leave, you know so to go to the higher paying job. So it's it sort of hurts the non- profit, but then it generally, you know it's just a lot of shuffling around it and hurts everyone in general. So there's another contradiction that was highlighted to us that we put in here. Excuse me: may yes, Heidi hi, oh Heidi and David Well Heidi go ahead Heidi, so we recently changed that in terms of the pay price parity, it does not go into effect until next year in October, but there was a bill passed on that. Oh about the people. Oh yeah, there was a bill passed, but is it for this too, for the pay parity? Yes, oh okay, there was one, but was it for a particular group or was it for? Did it include head start teachers? I believe it included them? Yes, but it just does not go into effect until October 2021.. We should check on that then, because Alan just last month, you know I brought up this problem, so it'd be great. If it does happen, we could take it out, but do you know that? Can you find a bill for if there's anything and we have a few hands raised as well yeah? I remembered the bill being passed. Okay, so we'll check into that? Okay, so next David and then Paul. I think it's a one-. Word correction. If you look in the bullets, the second bullet about families no longer qualified, look at the phrase without corresponding raising minimum income requirements. Should that be maximum? No, oh, the income you're right you're right yeah. It is maximum income requirement, you're right cool! That's all! Okay! Paul! Just like what question on the pay disparity portion would not that be a budgetary issue, not necessarily a district, or am I wrong in that assessment because it would not that affect budgets of nonprofits if the city, if dycd's, given an x amount of money but we're not looking at the specific budgets here, we're looking at the general overall problem? Okay, how is he, though, I will David yeah, we'll push a little bit? How is how is it a need? Is it causing some? You know not quoting yes or something yeah. They can't maybe that's missing yeah. They can't hire staff because all the staff are going to the city, so maybe that should be added in to clarify it. Does it render them non- competitive? No, not exactly, okay, exactly that's a good way to put it. That would be very phrase. Put there and Heidi just dropped into the chat. The link super early for the change, so we might go to the legislation. Oh wait, there's a I mean, there's a few articles. I just picked one of the first ones that I saw it's great and that one came from that one came from the city, so yeah, that's great okay. So if this law is passed, okay, the law has been passed and we're going to just remove that bullet point. What we're is there something we need to find out, or should we just remove it now? Is there something else we need to know if you want, I could just read all this stuff to make sure everything's covered tomorrow. It's going to cause a budget issue for non- profits they would have to receive they would I mean they get funding from the city from DYCD, so DYCD would have to increase their funding to cover yeah. Is that something so these were so? The disparity is that they're city funded. I mean these are not we're not talking about privately funded, okay yeah, so the flooding would go up. I mean I imagine that I do not see any other way that it works. Well, there are things called unfunded mandate, so you know I do not I that was clear whether their funding would increase, because the salary changed I mean these are not mandates, though these are contracts right, so we're sure that they're going to fund it at the level to keep the staffing the same okay. So let's look at the legislation and see if it includes you know, increasing the contract, because that is a thing that nonprofits sometimes have that you know they just want to make sure that they get the money as well so Susan. I was going to say so. Let's we hold off until we read it like tonight, because the head start, I think, are federally funded right. So I do not know if it's also the case with the heads start. Is that true or not true well, head start is a federal program yeah. So we're saying if the city, if the city passed a bill for pay parity for cities, you know city funded issues. I do not know. If that also covers head start is what I'm saying Justin's head starts. Nuts is not a city funded right, that's correct! Okay! So we'll look into that. So it's yeah. It sounds like it's still going to be an issue. Oh okay, we could ask Alan too about. Is it like as a program all head yeah? Usually it is just head start. If it's head start, it's head start: it's not like a some kind of blend: okay, okay, we will move on to the next Should Thomas put a comment right there that we're looking into the legislation. Next to that, that's bullet points, so we know whether or not we're going to remove it sure. Can you change. I wrote a note on my good okay on my phone so to add that in the minutes, but if you want me to put as a comment, I can do it as well yeah that would be it does not hurt. It would be better, it would be yeah. You should do it. You can yeah. We forget change where it says: minimum income. Can you change that to maximum income? Okay, I see your hand Paul, I'm just thinking that you know. If this is the law that's passed and now the DYCD is going to have to up the money on salaries they where they'll probably take the hit at, is the amount of young people they're allowed to take into programs like they'll lower the amount, so they do not have to pay per seat depending on the program right yeah. So I think that may be where I do not know. If the need comes out of this, that maybe that might be the need, is that how many young people actually get to be a part of these programs and families? That's that is possible. Okay. All right next is seniors, so for senior centers. Our first section is just like a demographic that we, you know some demographics on the seniors which we lifted from last year, and then we have five different four different concerns. That was part of a presentation that you know that we got from the presentation, so those four concerns are con. Concerns about isolation, food access, some wellness concerns and then just staying informed with accurate information. She also had mentioned ageism, but I thought that was not a need, but something that people faced. That's right, yeah karma yeah right and it does impact the seniors, but it was not like yeah okay. So then, so then we talk about senior centers and Newark's and how they and how they provide programs. You know last year we had a lot of information about the carmen. Yes did you get the but the listing of the seven norgs? I know I said I did yes, I did yes. Thank you, yeah, okay, so, okay Susan, I was going to say: do you want the norks? Are you going to put them in this section, or do you want to put them in the Appendix? Okay, that's a good thing. I do not. I mean we could do either well, it could be in the Appendix. I know that Jim had asked for now the reason I asked for a list because we just want to know which ones she was talking about like, for example, you do not mention the one at Confucius Plaza, so I do not know if that's considered to be a nork or it's another category, or is this a special category of Newark's? That's different? Is this always maybe just city carmen? I thought Confucius was a senior center to North yeah confusion is it's new, so they received City council funding from Margaret, Chin and so the you know. Confusion causes that housing complex right, and I thought that there was a senior center in there there's a senior center close by, but there's no senior center inside it's a newark and they received funding like it's just one. It sounds like it's just one- year funding for what was it a social worker? I think we're about to lose. So sorry, okay, so maybe we just want to put somewhere in the senior or the north section to see the list in the Appendix yeah, because the other thing Jim I thought asked about, is that well do we know you know just to strengthen this a little bit about do. We know like the number of seniors that are being served by the total number of seniors that are being served by these norcs. No idea do not forget you have city ones, you have ones, that's how I got into like. Oh, let's get the list first and then we'll know the number, but you know David it's a small correction or maybe a note. But if you look for the four thousand three hundred and forty five percent it's earlier, it says they speak. It's either forty three or forty five percent, but it has four three four five percent, so it might be a footnote. The four five might be a footnote, I'm not sure. Okay, we'll look into it. Thank you so we'll make the these are. So the seven that you gave us carmen. They are city funded. No, it's a mix! City funding and also the discretionary notes, are there? Oh okay, so I guess yeah the the one I'm talking about Confucius Plaza. They got money from Margaret. Is that considered to be discretionary? Yes, because we're in the same category? Okay? So that's another, a new one that can be added to the list. Yeah. The first three are regular dip, the funded norks. The remainder are the new discretionary funded north okay, and then I know you in your. In your other thing, you in your other contribute. You know you sent us a document. You talked about funding so we'll put that all in budget priorities. You talked about the funding they needed any questions about this whole senior citizen, we're basically beholden to what the city can offer. My only concern is that you know due to Covid-19 many of the senior centers are closed, so I do not know two years from now how this is going to look. So basically it's the nordics that are keeping these programs. You know alive for lack of a better term. Has anyone talked about these senior centers next year? I mean? Are they just going to go back to normal, or are they not going to be open that much anymore or are they going to? Are they going to lose capacity because they can't take in that many? The last that I've heard from the department for the aging is that they're in discussions as to how they're going to move forward with their day program. Okay, so far, all trips have been suspended. The meal program is being delivered to the seniors. No one's been able to come in and get a meal right. Okay, so that's right now, but for next July we right, you do not know exactly how they're going to proceed with these programs. Okay, so, but since so, we do not have anything to add here right now, for that is what you're saying no not good moment. Okay was there more? It was something that oh could you guys grow up? Where is oh, no, it's in health, okay, all right! So now we're talking about health care needs and services. We have an introduction. We have a number of areas that were highlighted to us in terms of that they came from the speakers and their presentations and what are those areas about five of them? The one was telehealth, one was tel: oh, why does it say? Butance's health services, behavior, no behavioral, health, I'm sorry, okay, behavioral, health services, okay, so behavioral health, chronic care. There was telemedicine. This whole thing about the disparities due to the social determinants, and that was it right. Okay, keep going yeah. That was it so that so we just basically itemized those and we took it from the presentations and then the following thing: that's highlighted in this page is just stuff from last year: it's just lifted and put there. So it is the skilled, nursing and rehabilitation facilities. Do we want to take and then also some stuff about the unintentional drug overdoses? So the so? My question is about first of all, two things: the skill, nursing and rehab. Do we want to have it in there now we know that there are no changes. We still hardly have any nursing homes, I'm not saying the need has decreased, but does it fit in here with the other things that we're talking about the second thing in terms of drug overdose, you know Susan described how you know, I mean you know different meetings. You know she's described how there's been a lot of complaints about. You know more drugs, people seeing more drug use on the street, and so it's that's a symptom of a health problem that needs to be fixed, and maybe the health problem is being made worse by everything. That's happening now, so it's not simply just an intentional drug overdose, and so something about drug use or substance, abuse or use. You know could be included in here. Susan, I think for the priority. There is so much concern about drug use and drug use scene that we're seeing on the streets, and this was actually even before Covid-19. So I think it's worse now and we do not have the information, but I think, before next month we really should substitute for the drug overdose, the drug problem, the increasing drug problem in general, because there is no plan, there's nothing being done to resolve the issue. So we have to assume the way it's going. Now it's going to keep increasing at Economic Development Committee last night. They were talking about how this is even impacting the businesses but- and they were almost going to put something about crime and drug use, but asked to have it instead be in human services, and it made me realize that all the offices are getting complaints. We do not have enough services for this, and it's probably something that should be in here. Instead of the drug overdose, it was kind of overlooked, with all the many other things going on. Okay, so ricky! That's why we sent you the I sent you that email about you know. Is there any kind of information about you? That's correct! Sorry, can you guys hear me? Yes yeah, so the health department monitors overdose, hospitalizations and but they gathered the data by quarters and they were kind of reported out and there's always a delay in reporting. So if you're, looking, for example, if you're looking for information for the first quarter of 2020 you're likely to see it, probably by the end of this year, anything that you're looking that happened during Covid-19, so you're looking at you know from you know, may through you know, July or something like that through August, you probably you'll, be lucky. If you get it by the end of this year, you may see it next. You know the beginning of next year because they go through the information. They want to double check that it's an unintentional overdose or hospitalization, and then they categorize it by the actual drugs and then they, then they break it down by where the reports and hospitalizations are coming from plus it needs to be usually gets vetted through city Hall as well too, because they're really sensitive about reporting. You know drug overdose numbers and, if there's a spike or something like that, they want to see what the potential correlations were or something like that as well too. But it's generally, you know that something that's available from the health department. I would my suggestion is for Susan to contact the Manhattan liaison at DOH. So that's pauline and she can put the end. We need it before next month. Yeah. I do not think it's going to happen. It's not good. They would not have it available. So maybe we can just call some of the substance abuse Nonprof Nonprofits that deal with them and ask if they can give us any figures in increase that they're, seeing yeah, okay, yeah and it does not have to be- they do not have to be hospitalized right to have it be a problem. You know, oh so I'll call some of the centers. If anyone can give me any information, they think of places that I should call locally I'll. Do that, but I'll call that so that we can have something to put in by next month, because it is a huge problem. Okay, so right now so Susan said she would call the centers. I guess definitely you know. Last year we talked to the Educational Alliance Center on Avenue D is there? If anyone has any specific, you know center, they think that she should talk to you should let her know. If you know it right now, just say it, and so she has it. If not, you can send her an email. Is that correct, Susan? Sure, okay, oh Paul, did you have your hand up? Yes? No, I did I did, but I I'm not going to ask you because I was just rereading transportation's district needs and we address some of those stuff from a different angle, more of a communication angle than what we're looking to do here in terms of the homelessness and public safety portion. We did address it, but not to what we're looking to do on this district statement. So, okay, can I make a request section? Can we move telehealth to the top of this list, just because this is an innovation that we've been using during the pandemic? That has proven to reduce costs and increased access for people? Acrosss every age and demographic group- and it can be a tremendous way to reduce overall the overall budget for health care and also get more people to see medical professionals can that be moved up. Okay, guys there's. So what does everybody think this is? The proposal is to move telehealth up to the first one, so it has a so it's a little bit more prominent. I do not know I mean I'm not necessarily against it. I'm just going to warn that cost. Cutting measures do not usually increase access and, I'm pretty sure the same people or families who have difficulty with accessing remote. You know remote learning may have difficulty accessing Telehealth, I'm sure it's extremely challenging for the disabled as well. Actually, no telehealth has actually helped the disabled. I work in a pain practice and a lot of our patients have a lot of difficulty ambulating and they are older, a lot of them with knee hip back issues, so they can do telephone encounters, not just the video encounters, but if they have a telephone they can make a health care. I would just function. It's not in any. The list is not in any order, it's not in the prioritized order. You know what I'm just thinking about this a little bit more. I think telehealth is not like a need, but it is a trend and it probably will continue, and I do believe that Telehealth has its pluses and its minuses. Sometimes it's more useful and more convenient, and sometimes it's not, but it is a trend and it's not going away, so it is worthy of men. You know it's different from the other needs that we're talking about the mental health and the drugs and the chronic illnesses. It's not in the same category. So I think it's actually it belongs in here. You know if we think it's a trend to be dealt with, but it's just not a need. Hey, yes, Susan, and so I just I mean I agree with everything you're saying, but I it also does present needs because right now I mean among the negatives, is that clinics that depend on every penny from some of the insurance companies are not getting paid as much. They do not know what they're getting paid. You know they can't always afford to have you know to treat the people so there are needs associated the needs for the patients to have access. Internet access is a need, but so I'm not disagreeing with anything you're saying I'm just adding to it. Anyone else on this. Well, I would you know, just keep it where it is, so that the actually the express needs are on top and then this telehealth is also mentioned because, like you said it's a trend that can present some needs or you know so. As we said, this is not in any particular order, but it would, you know, help to group it. You know that way. All right. Anyone else have any other comments on this. We keep it there. We move it up. Yes, just keep it there. I think there's no comments. I think it's fine, where it is okay, all right. What is the next section? Okay, food security, okay, so Eric is there. Okay Eric gave us the section on food security. It looks. I know that one. I have a comment there on the side. One of the things it needs is just some up: it's talking about food security now and the way things are. I mean food security has been a problem a long time down here and it's going to be a problem next year and may even get worse if you know given the state of our economy so but he it. The whole thing just needs to be a little like updated for next year. For you know, I mentioned that to him so he's supposed to give us something like by next year. Target will have regular hours, I mean you know so, and we may not know how hopefully, and then you know the assault, I do not know about the associated, but there is this trend with the supermarkets. You know closing, and so that creates a problem. Does anyone have any comments on the food security section? I guess not? Okay, so we will move on to the next section, the homeless population, the homeless population. You know so, as we know, there's street homelessness, there's shelter, homelessness, there's the subways and this problem. This issue has been with us for a long time. It is getting worse and there is no plan to solve any of these problems. There should have been a plan a long time ago, as Susan repeatedly says, but there was not- and here we are and this pandemic just you know it made everything. It just showed us everything. So I could just note to people that the last hope count showed an increase of 55 in street homeless in Manhattan over the last year, and this is over huge increases in previous years. So it's not going to change anything in the statement. I'm just noting it, because it's just astonishing statistic, so that's a city- wide hope count right. Yes, but the person what I gave was in Manhattan. They give the statistics by borough, so in Manhattan street homeless has increased 55, and that was before Covid-19, that was in January. Oh okay, any questions comments, changes for this section, the entire homelessness section. I will say that the phrasing is a bit awkward. I'm trying to even figure out would have been a 40 increase in 2016, followed by decreases of 2 and 5, and then it increased to 50. I think if you're saying it increased and then it flattened and then it increased again, that would be a better way to say it increases the two five percent did they only have two reports between 2016 and 2020.. You know, for instance, I think it could be a little stronger because those are really dramatic increases and the decreases are negligible as well as they are. They are so yes, it was like flattening, but I just wanted to give the exact figures if you think there's a better way. Why do not you? Just? Can you email it to me? Unless there was a missing year, there is a missing figure, I'll check, I'll check that okay to see if there was one few years of essentially flat, might be better than okay to rewrite it. That way, we put a note in the margin all right notice, I guess being put in the margin. Okay, there we go okay, so this is the end of it right. We do not have any other section after this is the last section right, I believe so. Okay, I'm just trying to put that note in there. So, are we going to rewording this to include rewording, perfect thanks? That seems to be it. Oh Susan, oh you know, Larissa Thomas is having connectivity issues, so you may have to do this yourself, yeah, he just got kicked off. It seems and he's trying to get back on. Okay. So let me open a document really quickly, so I can start doing what minutes correct yeah. Can I just ask a really quick question: I'm going to apologize for this in advance, I actually had to use the restroom, so I stepped away from my computer. I used the away feature, but I do not think I did it right. I just have a point of clarification. The section on the section on skilled nursing and Rehab did that get taken out, because I noticed that there was something in the notes about it being deleted or a question about it being deleted. Did it get taken out or is it still there? It is still there. Okay! Thank you yeah. I do not know if you're still there I do not know I mean I asked about it, but I do not know if what we think I mean it would or no. We did not decide like no one said. Okay anything. So I was in the restroom when that happened and I'm going to advocate. If it's still a problem, it should still be there just wanted to put that out there. Okay is there anything that as it is or is there anything that should be changed? They're updated? I mean, I know we do not have any more than I know, there's no updates. We still have the same numbers as we had last year. Yes, we still have the same problems and I do not think you know. I do not know that it requires judging up in any way, because the situation is still pretty bad. So, okay, so does everyone agree we'll leave it in any comments, I guess we will leave it in okay looks like we will no comments. Okay! Thank you. Thank you! Okay. Oh I'm! Sorry, I'm just oh Shirley. Are you still on the on this call? Oh, she stepped away and she sent me a text message about something. You know she wrote I'm still here. I did not send you text. Did I send you a text? Was a text or an email? Oh, I do not know. I do not think I sent you a text. No, you sent me an email, you sent me an email, oh previously, yeah, but that's it's fine. I did. It was just like some wording around the idea of the new school, but Naomi spoke very clearly about the lack of possibility for that. Oh okay, oh yeah, I see you sent it came you sent it earlier, but I somehow just saw it now. Okay, so it's just what you talked about before right, yeah, absolutely, okay, all right! So so we have some things to do some things to update to look for and then we just need to clarify about the pay parity and we may, depending we may, take it all out or leave it in depending what the new legislation impacts and or if there's any other. If it's still a need for next year. Hey, I have a question or wanted to hear other people's thoughts too about the page nine. It talks about page five, all right, the safety section in the homeless section. I just lost it. Sorry, let me maybe share screen to dinner or we yeah. I can share the screen again, hang on copy button, open it up. What's basically about the safety, it is on page nine. It's the like second to last paragraph matter of security is also needed for both neighboring community members and shelter residents. I I'm not totally up to date on this stuff, but I wondering if anybody else knows much more about you know the defunding NYPD from being in the shelters, or you know, monitoring the DHS peace officers. How, if anybody knows anything else about that, because I just do not know. What's what exactly is happening with that? That's a really good question is that under shelters and supportive housing, it's on it's on page nights, on security for shelters, security for shelters thanks, that's a really good question, which I could probably get that from Heidi. Do you think I call project renewal security? They should know right yeah. You should probably know that a head guy- maybe he would know I mean you- might want to ask. I do not know if you want to ask Aaron drink water too, because it seems like it is a little bit higher level. I do not know if they know exactly I'll ask them both I'll ask them both. I never thought of that, because they're not actually part of the police, but they are trained and monitored by the police. So it's a really good point. Oh you mean the peace officers yeah. Okay, I mean they work for DHS, not NYPD, but they're trained and monitored by pd and recommended. You know, even when the shelters are analyzed to get peace officers, that's pd, okay and the way that advocates are framing it now is that NYPD is getting kicked out or pushed out of the shelter. So I mean it's just yeah. It's not really clear like what's happening a really good point: okay, thanks, heidi okay! So overall are there any other questions around any of the sections: education, seniors, homeless, health and food? Okay? So all right, so our next step is we are voting on this in October, along with the budget priorities. Is that correct, Susan, correct? Okay? So this is pretty much the finalized version. We have some statistics to update. If you have anything else or any other things to update, I think the office could do it. Maybe we should contact the office and they'll. Do it because they're also working on the other section from the other committees and they need to consolidate something you know by October for the entire board to review and there you know there are some overlapping things as well and yeah. So that's and then also next the month we will vote on the vote and discuss budget priorities right at the committee and then at the full board. It'll be all the but no yeah it'll be all the budget priorities. Okay, do not forget what else we're going to do next month. Yes, okay, so okay, so we're done talking about district needs. Is that correct. Yeah looks like it: okay, so, okay, so okay, so the next thing is okay. Were there any I'll talk about next month? But were there any whether were there any okay? So the next agenda item is the cab or the Cec meetings. Did anyone attend any meetings, cab meetings, hospital, cabs? No right, I think Shirley Larissa, it does not sound like it. Mine does not meet until after Rosh Hashanah, okay. I think I went to a cec meeting and it was all about school reopening and that was a while ago and it's probably all the information is outdated because, as naomi says, it changes every day, but that's an ongoing issue and just about school reopening. I just wanted to let everyone know that Susan really helped at the office. They helped a couple of schools in our you know in c they're, actually in Cec and district 2, but they're in the CB3 area, to get some well. Actually, it was just one school right to get some street openings or for a dismissal or arrival. What I actually did was get D.O.T and DOE and DOE to start talking to each other formally about creating a process for schools to be able to apply for open streets right yeah. So I think that was really good, because before there was no process so now they have a process, and it's rather all last minute, but still you know, at least you know you did that yeah and they did not have one. They did not think that you know they. I do not know what they were thinking, but so that's they did not not for that. They did not have anything they did not. There was not a process because the schools were looking for opening and closing ability. You know, maybe at that point they were not asking for outdoor classes but they're. The only process that existed where was like for events not for this everyday necessity for screening or that kind of thing, no. Okay, all right. Okay, so next month in October, as I said, we will be voting on budget priorities. We also and also this district needs statement. At the same time. In addition, we will have another agenda item. The do you guys remember the alliance for positive change. They are they're moving to East, Broadway they're opening actually next week on September 8th. So that's they're. Moving to the 35 East Broadway Location- and you know it's going to start operating, so they will be coming back to our meeting to sort of present about you know their opening and what they'll be doing there. Part of the reason why we're doing this is because well there's a lot of there's a bit of controversy in Chinatown about this right now and I guess they heard about it. So one of the organizations you know Ccba complained and there's a lot of about how this you know. Naloxone center, they said, was being moved into their community and they were not asked, and why are there old and there's also the lower east sides? They think it's all the lowest, it's very misinformed, so they actually issued a press release as they usually do and it got into all the media. So now there's this uproar about this. We have another rehab center on East, Broadway and they're very unhappy and they feel like they're being tramped upon, so they sent a letter to Alicia and to Susan and why they were not informed, and you know Susan did respond. We're going to have this meeting, but also it you know, you know, for all. You know, stakeholders in the area to hear about this, but it's you know so there's going to be a lot of unhappy people, but you know, but we did you know, but I think this is a worthy program, but you know this is this is the reality of this the situation and I think you know harm reduction. Well, the alliance for positive change. Will you know you know. They'll also need to do some work to prepare yeah, make sure people understand what they're really doing, because there's also a lot of misunderstanding as well, but there's more to it than that. Any questions about that so we'll have one of those it'll be all on zoom, but you know there'll be some controversy too. One question my memory is correct. This is there was some question about where they were going to be putting their needle return boxes. Is that part of the is that part of the stickiness? Well, they do not. No, it's not even that. Okay, because they that has not come up because it was not in our resolution right and then they still do not know where they're going to put it remember how they were going to put it over there yeah you know, and then they, I guess during the actually in the middle of the shutdown or right before it, they contacted our another location, which I do not think was that ideal either. So it's right, Susan, oh that's still up in the air, is that true Susan, the last we had. I believe it was a school and I told them to reach out to the school and they said they would, and that was the last we had heard of anything yeah. It was like on division or foresight, so it's a little bit under the bridge but down the block from 124.. So I guess they looked at the map and it seemed like it was really far away. But if you're there, it's really just down the block right, so they are rethinking that. But we're not even talking about the kiosk we're just talking about the office. I mean the building or the space that they rented well that's good context to have. I was not sure if that was a part of the they know, and they do not know the chaos yeah. This was going to become a controversy and I expected it when I first heard about it online meeting. It might be a little different, I suppose, than in person. I do not know how we want to if we want to prepare in any way. For that I know, for instance, at the full board meeting we have to invite people in to be able to on you that's sort of the two sides of the meeting situation. Yeah, it's a good idea to think about how to do it. Yeah. I think we will yeah I'm very worried about that. Sorry, it might be a good idea to have the chat restricted. So the questions go only to me and then I can read the questions and the board or the the alliance can respond. It might be a good way to keep it under control and keep it limited to the time I'd be leery of not letting people ask their questions because we do at all our other meetings. So why would we change it for this yeah? I'm not suggesting not ask questions. Yes, you could end up unable to have a meeting because everyone is yelling at once. You know, so you can unmute people as you want somehow. I do not know if there is I'm very worried about the time, because we often take over two hours to do budget the go through the budget priorities, and I think this meeting could easily the harm reduction could take a few hours, so I'm just very worried about the time, nothing to be done about it, but I'm worried about it. Well, okay. People may feel the need to talk for a few hours, but I do not feel the need to listen. It's a huge issue. They did not I'm the one that offered, after speaking of May, to bring it to the board, because it's becoming a huge issue in the community they're going to City Council they're going to elected officials, and it's, I think, really important to deal with it, and you know I do not. You know I can limit the time or not. You know amount of time each person speaks, but I think we're going to have to give it a lot of time, which is very unfortunate when it's happening. I agree, but let's not think that this is a public hearing where we have to let everyone talk as long as they need to talk now, you can give them like two minutes to decide whatever it is decide what you're going to do. I can do a screen share like they do at the full board, with the timer yeah we'll do well yeah we'll do all that. Can I make one announcement thanks? Yes, I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware that we're having our public hearing for budget priorities on September 15th, it's on the calendar on the website, if you could reach out to any of your nonprofits or community groups and ask them to please come, you know we're looking at expensing capital priorities from the agency, so this is very much parks. It's staffing issues and agencies, there's a little blurb on the website. That kind of says what it's about. So I just want to encourage people to encourage people to come. Okay yeah, so everyone do that. You know you're if you have contacts that other non- profits and even if typically there's a lot of like parks go there, but it's not just parks. It's you know, programs. You know run by non- profits that you know that really should come to this. You know as well as well as the parks, okay, anything else, any other news or updates. Okay. So the last thing we will vote to adjourn and make a motion that we adjourn. Second, all right. Okay may so we're doing a roll call. Yes, we're doing the vote to adjourn. Oh okay, so Melee, yes, Larissa! Yes, little trouble. David! Yes, still know Eric Right Shirley! Yes, Deborah! Yes, tatiana! Yes, Paul! Yes, heidi! Yes, ricky, yes and carmen yeah! Okay, so we will okay. So we will see you next month our committee October will be October. The 8th and full board is the September. Full board is the last September 22 or three the Tuesday okay, so bye have a good one: okay, bye, everyone all right, stay healthy and stay safe. Everyone, oh and Thomas, I'm going to send you my notes, I'll email them to you. Thank you. So much no problem.
