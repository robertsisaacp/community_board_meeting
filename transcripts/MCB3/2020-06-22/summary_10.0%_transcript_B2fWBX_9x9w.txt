A lot of conversation ensued after that last executive zoom meeting You know you're in a leadership position which all of you are in the leadership position, except for the people that are calling in, but you all in front of me- are executive officers and you are leaders of your community You know like there may be some things that you're very passionate about, and you have a situations where you know you feel like somebody could have handled something differently.
You know the actual elected official and you lanes office and we want you to keep it to the top three things going on that you need to report to us about The. As the member made the announcement about phase 2 and about outdoor dining Who then gave a brief presentation about what the guidelines are and took various amounts of questions from the board chairs, as well as the community, and so just some things for people Slash, open restaurants.
But what she was proposing was that we only allow the waivers for restaurants that are in commercial zones and they all want to have outdoor seating did I, say anything about restaurants, competing for space , There's, a border go from the door to door because I envision that all these restaurants, especially a straight Center load of restaurants, are gonna, compete for every inch of real estate because it's now extremely valuable That's on the street Their own restaurants are only allowed to use sidewalk space that measures the same as their frontage There might be some restaurants who, for whom participating in this doesn't even make sense, because they're only gonna be able to put one table outside They did say that if restaurants did have backyard space that they weren't currently using preceding that, they would be able to use that as well Linda So if they need an SLA wage or how did they get that it needs to come from as a letter from the community board So initially, when the first email I saw about this from Susan, basically was saying that every single with that the community board was being asked to produce a letter for every single restaurant which would have made us have to do hundreds, if not thousands of letters.
When we tell our community, that would be good, Linda I will say that sentiment that you just shared was the sentiment of most of the board chairs today on the borough board, meeting Park openings and you know, was an all-day job There was meeting in the past week to discuss the plan training sessions that we've been talking about for a while, and it was agreed that the first one would be held as we talked about before on the 29th, and that would entail basically the operation, kind of basic cp3 board operations and procedures, and the agenda for that has been as of this afternoon, of approved by the speakers who will be Susan and Michael and David Crane Susan I'll, do the role of the board office.
The first session that they're doing as you can see from on the screen now is on our community board meeting night I would never say a thing like that, so the expectation was that we would use the this presentation and offer it for our board members to access electronically, and certainly you know, If people had a chance to look at it by then, or we could take questions electronically and follow up on anything that might be more specific.
But that way we would at least we would have both an SLA and a landmarks section, and the second training I think that's a good idea, because you know that the land session from the borough president's office is going to be very broad, so I think if we do a little 10-15 minutes about You know how tv3 handles landmarks, it'll be beneficial and what those landmarks are So. What my plan was to just go through the detailed agenda in the first email and then say that there'll be a second email that will describe the second training that'll come out in about a week just so, because I feel like it's overload of information, but I will also mention the borough.
One I just want to note that some of those trainings, like landmark and land use that the borough president has is useful for all board members to go to whether or not they are on the committee.
In addition we have, our own specific office went to everybody on the board and the email that Lisa is preparing is actually going to go to are all of cb3 members, not just the new members right, Alex I will say that when I first started, which was a long time ago, these trainee- it's not the advanced one but landmarks training They were mandatory training and, if you haven't suggested it already, because I may have missed it, I would suggest that you strongly encourage people to actually go to the rudimentary trainings, especially the land use training if they're new members, because I agree with mainly I, think the mandatory trainings are the ones about like conflict of interest and used to be a mandatory training, and there was a resolution writing training that was mandatory, but I started in 1998 Michael Yes, the conflict of interest, Lisa I, just thought of one more thing: I should be sending this from my personal email, I'm, fine with it.
: Let's do the calendar first, Michael This is the vote sheet hold on there Can you scroll down please development, July, 8th Health and Human Services, July, 9th landmarks, July, 13th transportation, July 14, our first exact committee meeting July 15 parks and waterfront July 16th, SLA, July, 20th, June, Basia, land use, July, 21st arts and culture subcommittee, July 22nd and then our second exact July 23rd and our full board July 28th, The reason why we started doing the two executive meetings was because of kovat, and we figured out that there were things that may have come up that we did not get an opportunity to talk about in the beginning of the month or towards the end of the mom If we wait towards the end of the month, we might have missed an opportunity to share something or get something sher to the executive committee.
A larger committee might be useful to have all three but my- and I also discuss with Linda on many issues and sometimes I feel like that kind of cooperation is important for a committee because you would, like you know, A support form from your committee and Linda is also really involved in my committees, operation and I Just, because we thought about what you know what the June agenda was gonna, be like with the mountain people we were expecting and the amount of people we saw in You know I've yet to chair a committee meeting outside of my laptop so and landmarks as a tiny committee.
Anisha did they have anything not yet because they're gonna meet in July Chinatown neighborhood planning subcommittee, nothing to report They haven't met any old business, Any new business, okay I just want to just let everyone know I'm working the election for the primary, so Michael will be running the committee I mean like you, don't want people to feel like ah Yanks You know that was a horrible first meeting for a lot of them.
