I mean like I, really don't have much to report, except for the fact that Lisa Michael, myself and Susan we met to discuss the trainings Let Lisa talk about that a little further during her report.
A lot of conversation ensued after that last executive, zoom meeting You know you're in a leadership position which all of you are in the leadership position, except for the people that are calling in, but you all in front of me- are executive officers and you are leaders of your community You know like there may be some things that you're very passionate about, and you have a situations where you know you feel like somebody could have handled something differently.
First chairs report I did touch base with both Margit chin and Carlino Rivera's offices about co-sponsoring a town hall about workers rights, as we start returning to work, and they both seemed interested in that and Gigi Margaret's chief of staff is going to reach out to the agency to see if the Commissioner will sustain that again like they did for councilmember Levine once they have confirmation, we'll start working on dates.
They've been having, and a number of chairs did report that they've been seeing their meetings getting a little bit longer, as people are in the comfort of their home and whatnot.
Who then gave a brief presentation about what the guidelines are and took various amounts of questions from the board chairs, as well as the community, and so just some things for people.
The hotline to report issues, one of the other interesting things that I think will be an issue probably for some is that if the four restaurants that are setting up in the roadway in a parking space they're allowed to do so?
That was an issue for some other community boards who didn't want outdoor seating on side, streets and things like that.
Linda I will say that sentiment that you just shared was the sentiment of most of the board chairs today on the borough board, meeting Park openings And you know, was an all-day job There was meeting in the past week to discuss the plan training sessions that we've been talking about for a while, and it was agreed that the first one would be held as we talked about before on the 29th, and that would entail basically the operation, kind of basic cp3 board operations and procedures, and the agenda for that has been.
Meeting night I would never say a thing like that, so the expectation was that we would use the this presentation and offer it for our board members to access electronically, and certainly you know, If people had a chance to look at it by then or we could take questions electronically and follow up on anything that might be more specific.
I, don't think the landmarks one conflicts with any other community board meetings for us, so I think just tell the new members that we strongly encourage them to return I, don't think we can make it a requirement, but I think that we should strongly encourage them to attend the June 25th.
Just a blanket training like they do a great job of doing this great training, but at the same time I thought it would be a great opportunity for new members to and newly appointed members to get to know who As far as that, your committee I mean like it's more intimate, I Just.
I think that's a good idea, because you know that the land session from the borough president's office is going to be very broad.
One I just want to note that some of those trainings, like landmark and land use, that the borough president has is useful for all board members to go to whether or not they are on the committee.
I would suggest that you strongly encourage people to actually go to the rudimentary trainings, especially the land use training if they're new members, because I agree with mainly I, think the mandatory trainings are the ones about like conflict of interest and used to be a mandatory training, and there was a resolution writing training that was mandatory, but I started in 1998, Michael, I, think and even outdrink Covid-19 I Yes, the conflict of interest.
Can you scroll down please development, July, 8th Health and Human Services, July, 9th landmarks, July, 13th, transportation, July 14, our first exact committee meeting July 15 parks and waterfront July 16th, SLA, July, 20th, June, Basia, land, use, July, 21st, arts and culture, subcommittee, July, 22nd And, then our second exact July 23rd and our full board July 28th, so Well.
And I was also looking at trying to find the structure of each committee to see if we all have, or if the other committees have a vice chair and secretary, and how it's working So Every chair, every new chair of the community board, has the right to say: What's what and what's not?
Is that, if I'm not able to attend the committee meeting, the vice chair would take over.
Just, because we thought about what you know what the June agenda was gonna, be like with the mountain people we were expecting and the amount of people we saw in You know I've yet to chair a committee meeting outside of my laptop So and landmarks as a tiny committee, The vice chair is pretty strong, also in the same in the business of land use and can help with decision making and so on.
So know, typically in other community boards, the education and use, and sometimes the youth part, isn't a separate committee.
You know, play and take on a new role and learn something more about the community board We have quite a bit with district needs and we will be discussing it at the next two meetings.
We, don't normally go until 11:30 at night, so reach out and touch your committee members and just let them know like full board, is not the opportunity for everyone to get long-winded and get crazy with it.
