I know it's a lot to have to zoom meetings in a month, but as we needed to do this, to make sure that we're keeping up with all the changes that are happening in the community I'm going to have to add something to our agenda tonight.
We need to do a resolution, I'm thinking, because there has been an incident on the Lower East Side on Avenue on Saturday I, believe Carlina has called for a petition for us to get on board with for the removal of this officer, he has had several incidents on at the PSA for that the city has had to pay out a couple of like more than a lot It's just been a lot of money.
The reason it's coming up is because this came up at the lower Eastside ready meeting today and Carlino talked about it, and the resolution would be very specific and limited and which is the only reason it's timely because, as Alicia said, she's creating the petition, the petition is to have officer Garcia terminated immediately because of his history of eight-eight incidents of excess of the force That would be the whole resolution and that's the only reason we would be doing that it exactly Is that it's a timely issue because of this resolution.
This resolution, that's a very big and very important issue, we're actually in most of CB 3 having a lot of problems and complaints, because social distancing in all these areas, you're mentioning, are not being enforced, but for this resolution, and that would be something that could be put on the agenda for June, and you know many people in the city will be taking that up.
Carlina, okay, he's creating the petition and it will address one issue and that's the media termination of an officer with a history of aide complaints of excessive force, 8, so I think we could, and if we sign the petition, we have to vote on it right, Well, it is good to sign the petition, but it is also good to have it on the agenda of a future meeting, because I believe that this is not the first time it will happen and it still needs to be addressed.
You will vote to sign up not to sign on I understand They asked to reach out to the community Just anyone couldn't jump in okay to support council member Rivera's petition to have officer Garcia of PSA for immediately terminated due to his record of eight incidents of excessive force and the most?
To be honest with you still dealing with all the technology and zoom stuff for our meetings there with me, as we still figure things out on here, Michael Lisa feel like there's anything I need to report to the whole group I sent in a new format for attendance taking, but I Don't really think it deserves everyone Now we're going to go on to the treasurer's report.
We are already having people asked to be put on the agenda, Yeah I'm, just kind of following what season, because we've obviously had a few folks that want to get put some items on to parks which don't necessarily require a timely vote and or a city decision.
My hope is that you know, for the next meet coming up for each of the committee's I will make the chair a co-host so that they can see what the functionality is, but I'm hopeful that eventually, the chairs can take over running the technical side of their meetings so that I don't have to spend it every evening of my life on a community board zoom, especially if we're going to go back to every community tune, but I would how might that what Trevor said I would I mean I, don't see a reason why we can't start bringing some non vote matters to the June agenda, but I would want to also limit it so that we're not having an agenda It's, not the most optimal way to be meeting, especially when we're being given a slideshow presentation bias at the agency, so I would you know I would propose that if we do take non-vote items on the agenda that we limited, maybe to two or three non-violence, I agree.
may I can hardly hear you, so my committee I would prefer no I would prefer not to over non We. Don't have non vote items unless it's somehow, unless the information we are getting is somehow related to our district needs, which is you know for us If it's just people who want to make presentations about stuff I would rather wait, but if it's related to district needs and we'll help, you inform us and they have to come and give us and then the only ways for them to come and give us a presentation what I'm hearing is that unless something changes with the executive order, we will be having meetings in June on zoom' and non resolution.
They have discretionary distribution for state made hand, sanitizer Actually, gotten people request forms, but they are willing to give and it's very stinky There would like to know if we want to reserve a certain amount for organizations in Deborah's district, which is very small in our area.
You know the around where the community board offices I wanted to make a suggestion, since there's so few organ organizations within Deborah's area that we suggest Jessa and Cooper Square committee, I'm, gon na , say just thought of one more and that's the third Street man, shelter Fine with that I Just, think that you know those who first sound like the same bottles that were delivered to night complexes and the issue They really don't have a way to distribute it to people.
So I asked you all to start to generate some ideas as to what each committee would like to contribute towards the district need statement and what we should be focusing outside of sorts ways to focus: Yes, okay, so based on what has we've done in the past that have worked twice before, and this doesn't involve individual needs twice before the community The executive committee has set up sort of a format for all the committees to fall within One of it was we set up the actual format of serve being very six and brief and bullet points with just highest priorities, but the time most related to this was after sandy, in which the exec decided that every committee would kind of talk about what it took away from or learned, or what must be done because of Sandy, and you know the committee's would kind of know best for their committees, but I think there's a lot one of inequity and things that have become very obvious, that you know that relay to what we've learned from this pandemic that the committees might want to consider.
If there are issues that we can ask an agency that relate directly to community board three and that general like a senior program What do you think about like having the district needs as ready as possible in August, but not voting on it and voting on it?
You know, even after we all get back together, it may be a possibility that zoom will be around for a long time to come, or something like this , so now what so, then we go to public members have to be reapplied right, 45 minutes to an hour, training on something and who could help us design and create a little brief training and These are the things that should be on that office procedures for sure I know.
So we know that that's something that we are going to continue to work on like Susan said earlier, because we don't have to submit it until what you say: October racism right well vote on We have to vote on everything in October That means that we need to change this around the vote on the district need statement.
What I would, if you don't mind, I'd like to maybe put certain things and read the changes that are just for this year because of That was, we can go back to this timeline training and splitting it up into two I Think that what might make the most sense is that the first training is more about like the procedural stuff like the office stuff, the role of the chair, the you know how public participates and that and then the second one can maybe be the one where the chairs of committees do Everybody needs to talk about that and why it's so important.
For the first time right there I know there are a couple of committee meetings going on every night next week, Friday there's a committee meeting Linda is voting for 2 pm 2 pm we're gonna, lock that data in 5 24 at 2, pm, zoom Everyone, come and be festive, and whatever vivacious you like to bring to the table while you're at your house Let's go on to the next agenda item Going back to the agenda.
Thank you all right now we're going I guess in to a while committee reports transportation, anything to report, we're gonna, be meeting on Tuesday about open streets, and anybody wants to come into the zoo , It's important that we get a lot of opinions on what I raised this before.
We need to consult the exact, because, if you're going to be you're asking for things not to be heard in other committees and be on this committee, We have an agenda item coming up in June because the emergence am So. This is a agency related to public safety Should it go to transportation, Public Safety we've never had those kind of things in that committee like this But, then again you know it's a toss-up, so I had asked Linda about whether it be appropriate for her committee, but it's still a toss-up there.
Yes, I went out to everything the city, obviously we're expecting a lot of cuts in parks, and we are letter basically says and he's now in , we probably going to need more funding for parks Just, because that's where everyone is going Right now our crowded impact I This question goes a season in terms of our committee and I know, we've gotten a couple of quests for items to be on the agenda.
