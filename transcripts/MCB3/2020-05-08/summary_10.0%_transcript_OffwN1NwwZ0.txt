I know it's a lot to have to zoom meetings in a month, but as we needed to do this, to make sure that we're keeping up with all the changes that are happening in the community I'm going to have to add something to our agenda: tonight.
The reason it's coming up is because this came up at the lower Eastside ready meeting today and Carlino talked about it, and the resolution would be very specific and limited and which is the only reason it's timely because, as Alicia said, she's creating the petition.
Okay, I think well Susan sort of addressed my question, which is that I think that there's like a larger issue, obviously because what the coverage said essentially, is that there's no articulated guidelines for how police officers are supposed to be enforcing social distancing?
This resolution, that's a very big and very important issue, we're actually in most of CB 3 having a lot of problems and complaints, because social distancing in all these areas, you're mentioning- are not being enforced, but for this resolution, and that would be something that could be put on the agenda for June Many people in the city will be taking that up.
Carlina, okay, he's creating the petition and it will address one issue and that's the media termination of an officer with a history of aide complaints of excessive force, 8, So I think we could, and if we sign the petition, we have to vote on it right.
It is good to sign the petition, but it is also good to have it on the agenda of a future meeting, because I believe that this is not the first time it will happen and it still needs to be addressed.
I mean these officers has eight incidents in the past, but I just feel like there should be a trigger or a petition for a resolution.
They asked to reach out to the community Just anyone couldn't jump in okay to support council member Rivera's petition to have officer Garcia of PSA for immediately terminated due to his record of eight incidents of excessive force and the most?
What I was going to suggest I think we need to table this until we actually know what the petition says.
Does that in my office, but I think if you, if you search his name, the federal lawsuits are just supposed to pop up like under They are newly appointed members and they will be receiving committee request forms from me.
To be honest with you still dealing with all the technology and zoom stuff for our meetings there with me, as we still figure things out on here, Michael Lisa feel like there's anything I need to report to the whole group I sent in a new format for attendance taking, but I.
So one is the knight, sir one, which has one public member I did not contact that person because I don't know when that's going to be activated and would like direction from the exec on that and the other one is the Chinatown neighborhood which I can't imagine meeting anytime soon, And I was wondering if we should send a letter to the public members saying that we will be in touch with them when the committee is reactivated, but I think is important for us to stay in communication with the public members.
So I do agree that we should definitely send out a letter of communication, just letting them know when we resolve or regain a committee again that we would definitely like to have them on board.
Assuming, that we'll go back to all the committees meeting in June, because we talked about putting district needs on that And I'm, assuming that they will be unzoom unless the executive order, changes.
But I would like the committee to confirm that The exec had said that we were only dealing with agenda items that needed a resolution in June.
My hope is that you know, for the next meet coming up for each of the committee's I will make the chair a co-host so that they can see what the functionality is, but I'm hopeful that eventually, the chairs can take over running the technical side of their meetings so that I don't have to spend it every evening of my life on a community board zoom, especially if we're going to go back to every community tune, but I.
Don't have non vote items unless it's somehow, unless the information we are getting is somehow related to our district needs, which is you know, for us.
That's a chairs job They have discretionary distribution for state made hand sanitizer Actually, gotten people request forms, but they are willing to give, and it's very stinky There would like to know if we want to reserve a certain amount for organizations in Deborah's district, which is very small in our area.
You know the around where the community board offices I wanted to make a suggestion, since there's so few organ organizations within Deborah's area that we suggest Jessa and Cooper Square, committee Gon Na, say just thought of one more and that's the third Street man, shelter, Fine, with that I.
People are seeing have seen areas of need, like alicia, communicated to me this morning, that there were certain developments that weren't getting masks and because of the both district service council and lower Eastside, ready and other connections, I'm able to bring that information and really get it mitigated.
So I asked you all to start to generate some ideas as to what each committee would like to contribute towards the district need statement and what we should be focusing outside of sorts ways to focus.
One of it was we set up the actual format of serve being very six and brief and bullet points with just highest priorities, but the time most related to this was after sandy, in which the exec decided that every committee would kind of talk about what it took away from or learned, or what must be done because of Sandy You know the committee's would kind of know best for their committees, but I think there's a lot one of inequity and things that have become very obvious, that you know that relay to what we've learned from this pandemic that the committees might want to consider.
I mean I, don't even know how many stores are gonna, reopen or bars, or restaurants, or whoever even some of the little cleaners- We need to start with assessing our needs and what's happening before we get into asks, and you know I'm hoping that we might be able to get a lot of data and information in for those areas that those asks are you know addressing so in our mmm in the past We always do it by committee, so each committee, so we're going to do the same thing.
What I would like to suggest is that we have it finished by August, but not vote on it in case there are changes and things that come up between that in October that we could make those changes and I just also want to remind people that this is a document to assess our needs and that we will then afterward be voting on specific budget priorities.
We, should start to talk about what that needs to look like each chairperson of every committee should be on board for that to give a description of your committee and maybe give a little personal statement as to you know, your experience on the community board.
I. Definitely think that we need to think about how to keep them connected to you, know, being a part of community for three trevor My question was for Susan, but I can wait until my committee.
I. Think that something similar to what you did when you present it to the full board about what your committee does, but Alicia I, also think that we might want to include as part of this documents that we put together after our training with the outside facilitator about what the role of the chair is, how the public participate in our meetings and stuff, like that, okay, he's got his hand, Then we look at questions for the budget.
So we know that that's something that we are going to continue to work on like Susan, said earlier, because we don't have to submit it until what you say: October racism right, well vote.
Like the procedural stuff like the office stuff, the role of the chair, the you know how public participates and that And then the second one can maybe be the one where the chairs of committees do Everybody needs to talk about that and why it's so important.
For the first time right, there, Tipton, yeah I know there are a couple of committee meetings going on every night.
Don't have access to it anymore, I'm not going to share it with you, but anyway, Joe set up this great document that basically, what he did over the past few days was looked at all of the community Boys Facebook social media That's relevant, that people want to see and how we're comparing to other boards.
You all right now we're going I guess in to a while committee, Okay, so we'll just go down the line transportation, anything to report, we're gonna, be meeting on Tuesday about open streets, and anybody wants to come into the zoo.
We really need to consult the committee, but you know we're meeting this week.
We need to consult the exact, because, if you're going to be you're asking for things not to be heard in other committees and be on this committee, We have an agenda item coming up in June, because the emergence a.m. This is a agency related to public safety.
It came to Kim two landmarks, So well, of course, if it's in a park, whichever you may wish to continue handling the thing It's on pier 36 What's, the issue I didn't realize it was an issue They have to come before the committee be before the community board before they go to design Commission.
If it comes to my committee, But I do think that we need to think about this, because there are a lot of structures along the waterfront which are typically going to Park waterfront, because they're actually on a pier, as opposed to being on solid ground.
