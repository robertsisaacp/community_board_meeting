And as always just remember them, you can unmute yourself when it's your turn to talk, you can do that by pressing down on the space bar and hold it down and the whole time you're talking I'm good evening. Everyone. Thank you for attending Executive zoom. Today's date is May. The 7th 2020 so we'd like to have an approval of last month of April's meet minutes for executive matter most to prove anyone opposed any up stain, no I, just typed. The minutes that were sent out just had some weird just get corrected. That's it! Okay, that's good incorrect him! Well, the typos! Please! Yes, I see Thank You, Michelle, belcheck yeah, probably my fault, because I was the last one to make corrections and I did not use spellcheck I'm. Sorry, all right. Can you put up the screen for the agenda? Did you take attendance with a minute? Okay? So, let's see who's here, Alicia's here, Michael's here, Lisa Kaplan, are you in the house? Yes, I'm, muted! Thank you. It's Eric, Diaz in the house. No Eric is Michelle. Is here Thank You, Michelle Herman is here mr. Hewitt? Oh not yet. Let me show you in the house I'm here: Thank You, Meili are you here? Oh no, Meili Jackie. Are you here? Yes, thank you. Linda I see you're here, Alex is here Trevor. Are you here Trevor's here? Yes, okay, Paul! Are you here I'm here? Thank you. Okay, so far, we're missing Meili and we're missing Eric. That's it! Okay, so really quickly. I just want to thank everyone for coming to tonight's zoom. I know it's a lot to have to zoom meetings in a month, but as we needed to do this, to make sure that we're keeping up with all the changes that are happening in the community I'm going to have to add something to our agenda tonight. With your all permission, we need to do a resolution, I'm thinking, because there has been an incident on the Lower East Side on Avenue on Saturday. It was an incident with an officer from the PSA for officer. Garcia use excessive force on a young man on Saturday. The details are really just unnecessary at the moment. I think it's just for many of you. You've probably already seen it on social media, and it has been going around I believe Carlina has called for a petition for us to get on board with for the removal of this officer, he has had several incidents on at the PSA for that the city has had to pay out a couple of like more than a lot. It's just been a lot of money. I, don't know the exact amount to be to be clear with you all I, just don't know the exact amount, but I know he's had more than several cases of excessive force, and it was just so graphic and so horrifying to see the way he took this young man down on Saturday, unnecessarily, I felt but I mean I. Do believe that we should sign on to a resolution or create a resolution for this and I'd like to hear from all of you on what you're thinking about this. If you've known anything about the incident for those that have seen it on social media and also on the news, can I speak to the resolution sure so this came up. The reason it's coming up is because this came up at the lower Eastside ready meeting today and Carlino talked about it, and the resolution would be very specific and limited and which is the only reason it's timely because, as Alicia said, she's creating the petition, the petition is to have officer Garcia terminated immediately because of his history of eight-eight incidents of excess of the force. So that would be the whole resolution and that's the only reason we would be doing that it exactly. Is that it's a timely issue because of this resolution anything else might come up later, but right now the time issue is the resolution is the petition. Okay, I think well Susan sort of addressed my question, which is that I think that there's like a larger issue, obviously because what the coverage said essentially, is that there's no articulated guidelines for how police officers are supposed to be enforcing social distancing? And you know when you don't have rules? How do you hold them to it? So, but perhaps that's something we can address that the transportation meeting next Tuesday. You can't do that because it's not on the agenda. It would have to go in the June agenda. Oh I was going to say that there should be some differential with enforcement of social distancing. You have a big crowd in the West Village, no problem. You have these four guys on Avenue D and they get beat up absolutely it's not this Avenue D Linda, it's happening throughout the city. Unfortunately, this resolution, that's a very big and very important issue, we're actually in most of CB 3 having a lot of problems and complaints, because social distancing in all these areas, you're mentioning- are not being enforced, but for this resolution, and that would be something that could be put on the agenda for June and I. Believe you know many people in the city will be taking that up. But for this resolution the only issue is to have this officer terminated because of his history of 8 incidents of excessive force. You know he should not be I mean you say personally, I, don't understand how someone with a history like that can be on the force. I did ask because of Congress, say and I had with Paul I asked Carlene. She could figure out why they were doing this enforcement outside of their jurisdiction in the ninth precinct. But again, that's not an issue for this. We've got hands up by Lisa, Catlin Michelle coopersmith and may lead. So let's go in that order. We said Michelle than that. I just wanted to ask when you say it's timely, it's because our name would be on that petition. Is that what we're asking yes Michelle? Is this something that we can address at the next executive end like a larger resolution? Essentially, so thank you you're on Susan. It wouldn't be a timely issue. It's procedural, which is what Linden Lisa was just addressing. There would be no reason not to have it on there Juna agenda, but isn't that timely in the sense that people are getting beaten up in the meantime, no I don't think we're gonna stop people from getting beaten up by voting in May instead of you, and it really isn't the time. Procedurally, it doesn't give transparency if it's not on the agenda. People can't come speak to it, which is the main reason for it is to have transparency, so the community can weigh in Reiko we're doing that tonight. Aren't we! So if you go to our policy, this is what it says. We have an exception for timely issues. Having their name position is a timely issue. None of the other stuff has to be done in May and probably would be better done in June, because we'll have more information and it will be done. People can come speak to it. Okay, thanks so May and then Jackie and then Alex I saw you physically raise your hand. Does that mean you have a question so may jacking that Alex was a little bit. I was late, but so there's a petition to be signed now, but so there, what you're saying is there is a petition to be signed now and someone's asking us to sign a petition. Carlina, okay, he's creating the petition and it will address one issue and that's the media termination of an officer with a history of aide complaints of excessive force, 8, so I think we could, and if we sign the petition, we have to vote on it right. Okay, well, it is good to sign the petition, but it is also good to have it on the agenda of a future meeting, because I believe that this is not the first time it will happen and it still needs to be addressed. Yes, so before we go to Jackie and Alex, can I ask one clarifying question so do we have to create a resolution to agree to sign this petition or the reset of both that we sign a petition? You always have to have a resolution and it could be a one sentence. Resolution Jackie. So my question is that I understand Susan just said that a resolution would be focused on eight acetones that these officers involved in the past, but I, just not sure, I, don't understand why this particular incidence on Avenue D should not be include at all. It will be included. It's perfect, her petition is her, but you know it's her petition and she said her petition. I suspect that the reason she's not including that incident is because they want the investigation and they wanted to be very : complete. But her petition right now that we're being asked that we could not sign on to is to terminate this officer. There's gonna be a lot more information coming out, and you know that's what we have I mean: that's what it is I see. I just feel like there is that there should be a trigger for these resolutions that we are going to sign. I mean these officers has eight incidents in the past, but I just feel like there should be a trigger or a petition for a resolution. Cuz the trigger is the petition. Okay just feel like. If we're relying on the past incidents, I wouldn't need more information to understand whether or not I should be relying on them, because Susan said complaints, but complaints about happen in different ways and then I would need to know where they substantiated or unsubstantiated or partially substantiated complaints and then will as to what specifically, if they're lawsuits, which is what the press seemed to suggest where they lawsuits that only involved him and had specific findings as to him, because usually those lawsuits have like 30 cops in them. Some have find it. Don't some have settlements, so I would need to know just what the history really is and also settlements are sometimes settlements with no fault and are they settlements for lawsuits that have other officers names because then just one person in a lawsuit, I, don't know what his individual responsibility was by actually reading the document. We have none of that information. There are eight settlements in which the city paid out money. That is the only thing from it. Almost every cop that works in a park and makes the rest in a park or in a housing development or is a warrants Club or as a narcotics cop, has almost that many or more lawsuits, so I can't draw I can't derive anything from the mirror amount of lawsuits or from the fact that they're settled well I'm. Sorry, it is sufficient for us to express concern about the officer and his capabilities. But what were the issue? Is the timely issue signing on the petition? So you will vote to sign up not to sign on I understand mr. Rago. Oh, there is a lot of information. We don't know because everything is under investigation, so they're not gonna, say anything. I know they already did their outreach PSA for in that entire team to everybody, every elected official to say we're, not saying anything. Everything is under investigation. I understand what Alexander was saying at the same time. I think it's perfectly good to sign on to this, because there is some information out there about that. Everybody knows and there's a jurisdictional issue here, -, but that's not neither here nor there right now. Okay, they asked to reach out to the community Fortis okay, so there's no other hands raised so Alicia or Susan, or was one of you proposing language that we're going on I? Can just anyone couldn't jump in okay to support council member Rivera's petition to have officer Garcia of PSA for immediately terminated due to his record of eight incidents of excessive force and the most? And can we add the most recent incident that it's still under investigation and has them in there has admitted at the termination made yet the others are, you know, have been sold. Okay, treiber's got his hand up Trevor go ahead. If that is the only thing we're using, and that is the resolution, understanding the video and what happened this weekend. It's just difficult to not put that in there, because there, if we could say that, then there could be 200 officers with 8 complaints against them. That we might want to follow during the elephant in the room is, and that's the video of what happened and I'm just learning. If it's smart for the resolution he's so confined to. We want to terminate this person because there are complaints against him. Oh you're, it is her petition. Perfect I, understand that so the bar resolution, the resolution has to be for a timely issue, the incident that just happened. First of all, you can't remove somebody for an incident that is under investigation. The other has already happened and there were passed so that tells you something the one that's currently under investigation and actually mentioned trevor was at this meeting. Also, the one that's currently under investigation cannot be a reason to fire you when it's still under investigation. We make emotionally I'll, agree that, but legally you can't fire someone for something. That's under investigation and the timely issue. We can put all of that on the agenda. No one's saying that we know Susan I, understand that I get all that I understand but I'm looking at what we are proposing and we are proposing a resolution which says more of fire so on it because they have seven or eight past complaints, correct. No, what we're casting is a resolution to support colleagues decision to do that. Her petition doesn't include the current incident. Well, we're supporting I'm not talking about the current incident I'm talking about what her petition says in comparing that to all the other officers on the copy of what our petition says: yeah geez, that was all right, she's! Writing it. As we speak. Okay I mean you. Did you hear anything different at the meeting forever I know I did here, but I think you're missing the point that I'm making and I heard of that the meeting and because I thought we were, it was gonna, be a little more focused on the current actions. I understand. Why cannot be and I understand why her petition now will be narrowly focused, but we could take that same petition and apply it to a whole load of officers and I'm just wondering if we need to put something in there in our resolution because of whether her petition says something so we're not just saying that any officer that has seven or eight complaints should be terminated. Maybe that should be the case, but that's what we're basically saying even in supporting her petition I well, I, that's a very good point and what came up at the meeting, which is not being addressed in this petition and can't be addressed by us at this meeting, is whether an officer with a history of ate excessive force incidents should be on the force, but you're right, that's a whole different issue. You hold your microphone closer, yes, no according to, according to Susan, the petition is still being drafted by Carly in his office. Susan do want to add to that I'm gonna say based on everything, Pete all the points people are making. We could probably do this at the next exact and still get on the petition. I would agree with that. That's what I was going to suggest I think we need to table this until we actually know what the petition says. That makes sense. So we all agree that we're going to table this until the next exam request. If we can ask this of curly in his office, because it's clear that if they have seen the settlement amounts for the settlements that they you know, have public records of the lawsuits, if they could give us more information about what his specific conduct was, that in the charge lawsuits and whether or not they applied to him individually or him in a group of other officers, then to know what his specific conduct was would be helpful as opposed to accept excessive force lawsuits. Because again, they name usually need multiple people. A lot of them get settled with that even being served on the officers, and you need to know what there's the specific conduct is that they're being alleged to have done. It would be helpful to understand you know what we're asking him to be terminated for if we have more specific information, if they're able to supply it just and that's all public records, so it seems like based on what I've heard somebody's seen some or all of it to be able to make some, you know provide us with some sort of conclusions about. It is also a comment in the chat box from Lisa, saying, as she concurs with Alex, to say, unless it's our public record there's a website that you see those lawsuits not just some made-up website, but you can see the settlements and I think most of the lawsuits are him and one other cop from what I understand? Well, let the electeds and whoever is and Carlinhos writing up that petition. I'm sure they'll have that information. Hopefully, in that petition, can we just I mean like Paul you've been on the website? Can you just copy? There are two there's a state one and there's a federal one, so there are two different ones: are they all pop? If they're all popular? Could we just look them up and get copies of those, and we just have that ready for the next exact, but we have to say who's doing it. Okay, I'm Joel can I ask you to do that. For us, please sure I'll track it down. I'm! Sorry, you were breaking up connect. Are you talking about Pacers when you're talking about the public website? I was looking through one of the websites that has all the lawsuits, but I'll try to get a more specific website. That Pacers is the state one I don't get the federal ones in my line of work, I, don't I, don't get them myself. Somebody does that in my office, but I think if you, if you search his name, the federal lawsuits are just supposed to pop up like under Google yeah. No, that's usually what you can do. I think it's called cops that the website, but I'll track it down and before the next exact, but thank you, okay, I'm going to move in so I want to welcome the new members. They've been appointed and we have, if everyone is ready to hear who the new members are: okay, Wendy, Lee, Troy, Velez, Ricky, Wong, David, Louie, Louie's Andrea, who our deal Cardillo and Tyreke Ramos. So they are newly appointed members and they will be receiving committee request forms from me soon. They will need mentors to help usher them in. So please suggest someone if possible. If any of you are available to do that. I know that Meili is still mentoring. Mr. Thomas Rosa, so I'm gonna ask that Executive Board, please step up and mentor. There's one two, three four five: six of them, so you can lend a helping hand and mentoring. Anyone. Let me know I think that Ricky Wong we're going to ask that Heidi met I. Had he knows him, so I'm gonna ask Heidi to mentor him. If anyone else I think Wendy, I think Jackie, you know Wendy right. Yes and you can you mentor her? Yes, I'll do that Wendy Heidi's want to be I'm, going to ask Heidi to have Ricky I need someone to have Troy and David Andrea and Tyree trommels Alisha, so Eric Diaz and the chat is saying that you know is both Tariq and Andrea, so he can speak with them. Well, can you are you going to say that you're going to men to a both of them, Eric sure, okay and I- know Troy, but I know Tory from stuff, because his Park is right next to my Park, and so we do a lot of stuff together. So I'm happy to take him on too. Okay. So Michael will mentor truly. Thank you. Michael and I need one more for David Luiz one more one exact somebody has to help because they don't know a lot of them. They have never attended a community, some of them have, but many of them still don't know the voting ants in hand Michael any hands. I just want to put I just want to put David into context. He is a business person. Insurance company in Chinatown, I, assume he's going to be interested in economic development, and his family has been very active in Chinatown for years. Yes, I just want to say I know, David knew his family I'm pretty well I. His father is a close friend. So since I'm going to brief a Wendy about, what's going on with community board, maybe I can talk to David. At the same time, just you know just make it easier for you and Wendy. So everybody is right. Okay, I, don't have anything other than well. Everything else, I have to say is going to be covered later on in the agenda. Okay, let's go once of the next agenda item: yeah I! Don't really have much to report to be honest with you still dealing with all the technology and zoom stuff for our meetings there with me, as we still figure things out on here, all right. Thank you. Michael Lisa feel like there's anything I need to report to the whole group I sent in a new format for attendance taking, but I. Don't really think it deserves everyone. It's time all right. So now we're going to go on to the treasurer's report now nothing at this time, I think. After all, this stuff I will catch up with some of the stuff with Susan. Later, okay, no, okay, all right Susan district managers report. Okay, first up the public members I contacted all the chairs to see if they wanted their public members to get reallocations. They all said. Yes, they all went out the first one came back and they're all due by next Friday, so by next Friday, we'll know if all the public members want to stay on, we have two subcommittees without shares. One is not a active has never been an active sub community. So one is the knight, sir one, which has one public member I did not contact that person because I don't know when that's going to be activated and would like direction from the exec on that and the other one is the Chinatown neighborhood which I can't imagine meeting anytime soon and I was wondering if we should send a letter to the public members saying that we will be in touch with them when the committee is reactivated, but I want wanted direction from the exec on both of those well I think is important for us to stay in communication with the public members. So I do agree that we should definitely send out a letter of communication, just letting them know when we resolve or regain a committee again that we would definitely like to have them on board. So, yes and I do know, I think the other public member for the nitrogen section 8 was Camille Napoleone right, so we should send her a letter just letting her know the same thing as well, that you know the committee. It's not dissolved, but it is my active at the moment. Okay do that? Okay Alicia would it be possible if they could be active on one of the combined one of the committees like the Housing Authority could participate temporary and housing, and the other person on another committee in the meantime and her plan use yeah I. Think what Herman's proposing is that subcommittee members start attending the committee that the subcommittee falls under yes, what do you all think about that, because I think some of the committee's are quite full. They all report to land use, which is a huge committee, yeah actually I'm on that issue, can I think about it, and we pop back to you guys on the next executive committee because and what happened with land use is that I lost an NCO T's two months ago and because in the pen and to represent nature in the Land Use Committee right now, I only have damaris left. So I just need a little bit of time. The thing about whether we should just bring the Nitra subcommittee into attending the Land Use Committee would that be more productive to both venues and nature. So it's just give me a little bit of time to think about. It. Could I also mention at several. The new members are live in Niger and generally. What we do is appoint the new public members to a committee after the new members get on. So we see what's needed on each committee is just generally how that's what our timeline is. Oh, thank you so glad guys, next I, didn't assuming or I would like. I would like the exec to make a decision about June meetings now, because we really need to plan ahead for that I'm. Assuming that we'll go back to all the committees meeting in June, because we talked about putting district needs on that and I'm, assuming that they will be unzoom unless the executive order changes. But I would like the committee to confirm that and then I've also been asked whether we are going to go back for a while. The exec had said that we were only dealing with agenda items that needed a resolution in June. Are we going to be going back to regular agendas, or is there going to be some limitations? What do we want to do for June agenda? Just in general? Not specifics, we all we are already having people asked to be put on the agenda. We know this is coming up. Yeah I'm, just kind of following what season, because we've obviously had a few folks that want to get put some items on to parks which don't necessarily require a timely vote and or a city decision, so I'm curious to hear other members as to how we're going to handle this and whether we're going to take the full load agenda items that we were taking before the pandemic, assuming we're all we're going to be on them yeah. From my perspective, this actually brings up something that I should have talked about it during my first hair report and that you know right now, myself and Clint are really the two that are well versed with zoom Linda may be taking over as well after her meeting next week. So my hope is that you know, for the next meet coming up for each of the committee's I will make the chair a co-host so that they can see what the functionality is, but I'm hopeful that eventually, the chairs can take over running the technical side of their meetings so that I don't have to spend it every evening of my life on a community board zoom, especially if we're going to go back to every community tune, but I would how might that what Trevor said I would I mean I, don't see a reason why we can't start bringing some non vote matters to the June agenda, but I would want to also limit it so that we're not having an agenda. That's you know, 8 items long and 8 presentations going over a zoom which is you know you know as effective as it is. It's not the most optimal way to be meeting, especially when we're being given a slideshow presentation bias at the agency, so I would you know I would propose that if we do take non-vote items on the agenda that we limited, maybe to two or three non-violence, I agree. I would ask for some criteria to base fee note to choose those I mean obviously I would say to the chair yeah for each committee, I mean it's up. It's totally up to you, guys I'm we're putting it back to you as to what it is that you would like to do because you're, the ones that have to deal with it and zoom. You know someone definitely has to be sitting behind and regulating people's watching who's, raising their hands. Who has questions? Reading the dashboard, so I mean I think that this is all stuff that you have to consider when you know make your decision. If you yeah may I can hardly hear you yeah, better okay, so my committee I would prefer no I would prefer not to over non. We don't have non vote items unless it's somehow, unless the information we are getting is somehow related to our district needs, which is you know for us. I mean we have a lot in on that. But if it's just people who want to make presentations about stuff I would rather wait. So it depends what it is so I. Would you know that's what I'm saying, but if it's related to district needs and we'll help, you inform us and they have to come and give us and then the only ways for them to come and give us a presentation. Then I would do it. Okay, so basically to confirm what I'm hearing is that unless something changes with the executive order, we will be having meetings in June on zoom' and non resolution. Items will be decided on by the committee chairs, I. Believe that's what everyone's saying, because two hands up first is Alex and then Trevor well. I will say that you know having had a meeting in the past month, although it only had three agenda items. I do have klimt on my committee, so I already have the benefit of him. Being the person who operates everything, but if it's helpful for everybody, what we did is we just scheduled a zoom meeting the Friday before and we you know we did like a mock. You know zoom meeting where we tried to figure out where we would speak when the applicants would speak, how Clint would call on them. You know how I would convey information and when would we get when we would actually get to the making of a resolution, and since we had that you know define for us when we then had the meeting on Monday was much. It was very helpful. The only thing I would say is and I understand. The need to pull in items is that do we need to have consensus on this as committee chairs, because there might be some folks saying well, they heard my item at one committee and it was vote or didn't need a vote. Another committee had a different opinion. If that's fine, we can keep it that way, I'm just worried. That's all I may ask that question as to our procedure. That was the reason I actually asked for criteria, but also I would say. Every committee is different and has different needs and that's a chairs job I just wanted. Oh, yes, I have something I have to ask that did bring my other computer Charlie Anderson, who works for Deborah Glick contacted me because they can. They have discretionary distribution for state made hand sanitizer and it's a big deal, look they're actually, generally, it's request forms I've, given I've. Actually gotten people request forms, but they are willing to give, and it's very stinky I got to tell you that it's really stinky. So there would like to know if we want to reserve a certain amount for organizations in Deborah's district, which is very small in our area. It's you know the around where the community board offices and I think they go to First Avenue. They can reserve up to three gallons for organizations in our district. They would be distributed in gallon jars and the organizations would have to put them in smaller containers and that's basically, it I wanted to make a suggestion since there's so few organ organizations within Deborah's area that we suggest Jessa and Cooper Square committee, I'm gonna, say just thought of one more and that's the third Street man, shelter, three bottles in each have one and I mean I'm. Fine with that I. Just think that you know those who first sound like the same bottles that were delivered to night complexes and the issue. There is again because it's a gallon bottle. They really don't have a way to distribute it to people. Unless somebody comes with a little tiny bottle, they can pump it into it and they may not want it. For that reason, but those are the only organizations I could think of in Deborah's area. It's also GMAC I'm, sorry, the village society, whatever their new name, is Angie GV HP and the Third Street School you're. Absolutely correct, I, didn't think of those as needing hand sanitizer in the same way. Well, sorry I'm! So I was thinking. Maybe there aren't too many organizations like that, but are there organizations that would use it on-site because they're still seeing a lot of like members from the public, so they need to use it right at the site as opposed to distributing it. To you know: individuals, not that I know that you know I yeah, okay, because I am you know, I teach at the settlement house uptown, and this has a huge gal and in office I, don't go there very much, but when I go there and it's really for all the people who are still working there. This is not the area of our community. Then it's a lot of social services. Okay, Sarah, [, __ ] may be in her district to I'm, not sure I'd have to check, but I think it's like I think you're right. So that's Arabic, NASA, surrogates and Jessa, for everyone are both senior residences and Sur, which also has senior programs always assumed not right now, and then it's the shelter and Cooper Square and Greenwich Village. So that's that sounds like six now, right or seven, so you know I could ask if they want to give to court stage, I mean I, don't know if that's worthwhile I don't know, I, don't know how you want to handle this. So you have three five I think five sites, maybe Lisa mentioned another one I'm, not thinking up, but how do you want to handle there? I say just give the contact information. If you have access to the contacts there give it to Charlie, so he could reach out, or at least let them know that they're, you know if they're in neither if they wanted, they can get it and how they go about it because I think was it something that was said that you have to go and pick it up or something like that: they're not dropping it off. We may be able to distribute in gallon bottles, so it can't be five. It can't be more than three because they're not going to break it down so Charlie's asking us to identify who to give it to you're correct. Yes, it won't we want to. So we need to decide who to give this to and tell Charlie there's three organizations but I guess. My question is Susan, since there are more than three organizations now what it makes sense. If you have the time for to reach out to these organizations and say, do you even need this like we can? No I do not have time to do that if I were choosing I would sooner the ones that are most needy. Yeah me too I agree. I was like I know for a fact that third street men, shelter they're, probably in need of all kinds of you, know sanitizing items and you know protection items, so I would definitely go with them for facts, Jazz's that our elders and they are the most vulnerable, so them as well, and what was the other one that Lisa said: yeah I would the three most vulnerable and the three that I think there are most that need and suggest that what I can do is give them those three and say if any of them don't want it. These are the two to followup with yeah, but just say that I, don't think Greenwich Village societies need is on the same level as the third Street men's shelter, so put them at the bottom of the list. So just one more thing, I wanted to mention in this part of the report. People are seeing have seen areas of need, like alicia, communicated to me this morning, that there were certain developments that weren't getting masks and because of the both district service council and lower Eastside ready and other connections, I'm able to bring that information and really get it mitigated sometimes quickly. So I just want to make sure that people know they can give me that information. It's not dealing like with one person that needs something that organizationally something that's falling through and that should be corrected. You know, I can do that after I mean I've, gotten three elected officials now because of Alicia's communication to say: hey, that's a great idea from now on, whenever I distribute food, I'm going to distribute, masks, gloves and sanitizer. So please, let me know if you no, it's a real situation, not just someone. Grumbling about something they heard. Do you have a real situation? Please let me know so that I can deal with it on a more on an organizational level. Thinking Thank, You, Susan, okay. So now we're going to talk a little bit about the district needs statement, I, don't Susan! You said some so wanted to talk about the district need statement. I know that our district need statement is not going to look like it looked last year. That's for sure, with Kovac going on. We know that the needs are going to be quite different right. So I asked you all to start to generate some ideas as to what each committee would like to contribute towards the district need statement and what we should be focusing outside of sorts ways to focus. Yes, okay, so based on what has we've done in the past that have worked twice before, and this doesn't involve individual needs twice before the community. The executive committee has set up sort of a format for all the committees to fall within. That has worked really well. One of it was we set up the actual format of serve being very six and brief and bullet points with just highest priorities, but the time most related to this was after sandy, in which the exec decided that every committee would kind of talk about what it took away from or learned, or what must be done because of Sandy and I thought just based on what we're hearing- and you know the committee's would kind of know best for their committees, but I think there's a lot one of inequity and things that have become very obvious, that you know that relay to what we've learned from this pandemic that the committees might want to consider. Okay, do I have any hand raises Michael I just wanted to answer your question. I was actually going to say this in with my report, but just to answer your question since you're, asking Alicia is that we I have received. Actually the Asian community organizations have started this. They have. This was an Asian neighborhood rebuilding clan, that they are that many organizations citywide are signing on to including the ones from here, and it covers five different areas, three hours in my committee and who are in other committees such as housing around News and economic development. So it's a list of asked for, like you, know, rebuilding. After all, this happens and it's and missus stuff that would take place, of course, in twenty one, twenty two, it's not finalized. Yet, so that's why I didn't pass it around. It's gonna be released next week and they're still getting organizations sign, ons and just some tweets. So it's actually a useful document to look at many. Other communities might have this list of asked to, but I'm not aware of it, and some of these asked are you know they couldn't be applied to any ethnic group, not just the Asians yeah I mean that definitely the economic development piece is going to be a big factor, and you know: rebuilding small businesses they suffered quite I, mean I know our district has suffered quite a loss. I know we have I mean I, don't even know how many stores are gonna, reopen or bars, or restaurants, or whoever even some of the little cleaners, and you know laundromats and stuff. You know so. Anyone else had the hand raised. Okay can I just say in relation to maze. We couldn't use that as a basis, but for the district needs. We need to start with assessing our needs and what's happening before we get into asks, and you know I'm hoping that we might be able to get a lot of data and information in for those areas that those asks are you know addressing so in our mmm in the past I know we didn't break it up according to subject Susan I do remember being we all do. Yes, we always do it by committee, so each committee, so we're going to do the same thing I'm going to ask all of you to when you think about what it is. Your committee does and how your committee fits into the district and our community. What are some of the things that you can think of that we could benefit from now. We want to be post, Kovac right or in Kovac. Just like Susan was saying about what was discovered after sandy. We need to think about what is being discovered now, definitely food and shelter. You know some focus definitely needs to be on that. Now we're going to look at crime safety, you know. So what are some other things that we could be focusing on the needs of others, because, right now, unemployment rate is through the roof. Many people are going to go post, go bad to nothing, they have no jobs, and so you're going to have influx of people that may not be able to pay their rents and I'm, not just talking about their housing. Some of them is their businesses. Are they they're not going to be able to pay the rents so we'll lose them? I mean like what else could we be thinking about? These are things that we as an exact. We have to really start to talk about because it's like you know if we don't start this now, we're gonna be stuck at the last minute, trying to figure it out and that's not cool. You know we really need to start planning I want us to really plan this out and really think about it, so that we can move forward any thoughts from anyone out there. I hear crickets, [Laughter], dunno, yeah, okay, I, so I haven't been part of a district needs from this side before so, I was wondering if you could sort of just in, like a minute, explain the process of how this is supposed to work. A little bit. I've seen it obviously in committee, but what happens before it even gets to committee for everybody to talk about I. Think the challenge, certainly for economic development is going to be that, like we don't know right, there's a lot of stuff that we just don't know yet and I think everybody is sort of taking it. You know not only day by day, but like it's hard to project where the city's economy is going to be the next month, the next year, so on. So it's something that you know, I'm working on to figure out put some guiding thoughts together on that with Megan still, but I think you know it's gonna. Take some time to fully know what's gonna be happening. Could I suggest that when we meet Monday that we go over the process and like Mae was talking about the social or social service organizations? I? Think if you connect with Megan on this, the there's a lot of business organizations that are also coming up with very specific needs and asks - that could be used as a basis. I am so I don't have. This is not really about a need is just that, because opposer colvett, our focus will be on revitalizing. The economy and I just want to see. If there's any way the city can reduce enforcement or just cut the rape tapes, specifically with the Department of Department of Health and Department of Building. The reason is because construction is a big part of economy and restaurants is a big part of a small business. So in and I over the years, I've been seeing a lot of excessive enforcement, so, but at the same time we want to make sure everything is safe and sound. So how to make that balance. I want to see if city does anything, City can do that's already part of what the business groups are coming up with great. Thank you he's specifically addressing that. Thank you. So you know I appreciate that we may be focusing sort of on economy and business and we should, but it's so expansive what we have to sort of undertake it and we have to decide you know. Are there gonna be a little I guess we'll have to look at the different plans to see if we should be adopting components or all of certain plans, but it's as expansive as how much capacity should like you know, a restaurant have that had a capacity of 74. What kind of traffic should there be honest Street in terms of you know: podesta pedestrian traffic I appreciate that the mayor is opening up avenues, but what do we do with all of our streets and how do we? How do our people like flow through the streets? What is the population of this? A parks supposed to be like there are so many sort of fundamental things we need to be thinking about, and we're only into you know, month, 1 plus, even in sort of contemplating like Anisha, said what the what the outcome might be or what, how it will look as we go on and how it will change even day to day and week to meet well see. This is I'm. Sorry, I'm Michael can I just say something. I think this is great because we do have to just have the conversation I mean we won't know anything until we stop the conversation around it, because we cannot just sit back and just watch it unfold in front of us, and then it leaves us all in a very bad place when it's time to really generate everything and sit down and start to really plan out what this document has to look like you know, we've had we've had issues in the past where we've like struggled with trying to put it all together with having statistics, and the statistics are right in front of us every single day the mayor and the governor just go at it and they tell us all kinds of stats on stuff, so I think we just need to start documenting some of the things that are happening and, like you said, yeah, it's specific things that we're going to need to talk about that. We never really focused on before. Thank you, Alex for that budget related stuff. So yes, I was gonna, say you know, following on what Alicia just said, I think people have to be careful. Not to be anecdotal, but to have that data to back it up, but also based on it. You know what Alex was saying about only being a month or few two into it. I've been worried about the same thing and I had suggested that we delay the vote to August and what I'm going to suggest I revise my thinking and I'd like to make another suggestion. We don't need to turn in into October. We can't wait till October to do it, because then it's going to lead into the budget priorities. So what I would like to suggest is that we have it finished by August, but not vote on it in case there are changes and things that come up between that in October that we could make those changes and I just also want to remind people that this is a document to assess our needs and that we will then afterward be voting on specific budget priorities. So then we will vote for youth program, senior programs. That kind of thing that follows later in conjunction with that there are budget consultations that the 12 Manhattan boards have with agencies in September. I have the dates, but I don't have them handy, because my calendars in the office, but I will get those to you, and so the chairs do attend those with the district managers. We make up agendas ahead of time. I need any questions for agendas by the end of June. We don't that's, not something we have to vote on we're not taking a position. We're asking questions. I will get to you the agendas from last year, so you have an idea, but basically, if you want to know the status of a program, if it still exists that kind of thing, we should put that on the agenda to ask about it. You can't vote on a bunch of priority without knowing about the status of something and committees can also have one-on-one district-level meetings with agencies. Parks does this every year we usually do it in July. They want to do it in August this year. Other committees, if there are issues that we can ask an agency that relate directly to community board three and that general like a senior program. But if it's about something specific like streets, certain streets or projects, let me know- and we can set up a meeting- they can be during the day. I guess they're going to be by zoom, so that's just sort of covering the breadth of their process that I wanted to get through if there's nope. So what do you think about like having the district needs as ready as possible in August, but not voting on it and voting on it? At the same time, we vote on our budget priorities in case there are last-minute changes that need to be made. I'm, sorry, no day, I'm, gonna, look I agree with Susan. I was thinking that maybe something should be. There should be some sort of a deadline there for you. Maybe it's your draft district needs or something that should be assembled so that arcus the art that needs to be in August, because in September and October you're gonna be voting a bunch of priorities. I understand I just want there to be a milestone in August, that's specific in committee yeah and you well, I would use Jim or whoever should sit. You know Jim or I will be rad all the committee knows it has to produce them that it so yeah. My question to that is typically in normal times. We don't need it most. We don't need what committees typically don't meet in August and normal times, except for SLA. So right it looks that way, but you can make that decision. - I mean you could confirm it. I would like to plan on it, but you can see where you were happy July and you know you could always, though, on the cd3 website and look for the past district needs statements that we worked on before you know always do that and start to just generate some ideas from last year's district. Yes, okay, so Jim has already gone through it and made comments on it and I need to get it from him and send it to all the chairs. Okay. Thank you. Alright. So here we go we're going to look at our time line and I'm. So sorry, I for this one I had a copy of the time line which I know. What's all it's also on the website, so we did the timeline, the timeline. Okay, it's on your screen on your zoom screen. Okay, here we go so right now we are in May and we are right on schedule with the new members. They just got on board. So next, what was pointed out to me was that we are missing something in our timeline, which needs to go right after the appointment of the new committee. Members is that we need to have a celebration to welcome two men, the yeah somewhere in between now and June, or June, the beginning of June I'm, open to suggestions. We could do a zoom party for the new members. I mean we're not going to be getting together, obviously, but definitely we could do a zoom party right and what should that look like? We should start to talk about what that needs to look like each chairperson of every committee should be on board for that to give a description of your committee and maybe give a little personal statement as to you know your experience on the community board. If you'd like to do that, may be a nice idea or you could just think of something in general that you would like to share with the new members, because they don't know you they don't know your committee, they don't know what you do so I mean just keep all of this in - I talking to a perfect stranger right, it's like when you get together with people. You just want them to know a little bit about yourself. You don't have to go on and be more winded about it, but, like maybe given about five minutes, you know a little five-minute statement about your committee and you know who you are. What you do- and you know like I know, Anisha- is a new chair and Paul is a new chair, but you know you can give your experience of being members on the community board and sitting on your committee and I also would like us to think about. You know what that could look like, because we could be festive with. It doesn't necessarily have to be very though, like a meeting, I've never been to a zoom party but I'm hearing great things. People are telling me all these wonderful things that they're doing on Zoom and I heard about Cinco de Mayo parties on the other day, so I mean I, mean I'm open to suggestions as to what this could look like for the new members, because we don't want to scare anyone away because they just got here and we want to keep them and how to stay connected. I. Definitely think that we need to think about how to keep them connected to you know, being a part of community for three trevor's got well Trevor had his hand up, but he put it down. So my question was for Susan, but I can wait until my committee report. Okay, so we need to we need to add in between May and June. There needs to be new member party or new member celebration, or something like that. Let's add some wording to it in there between. We need to make an amendment I just wanted just included in the minutes, if you be sure, including the minute old its Michelle. Please include this in the minutes that we agreed to add back to the time line for future reference. This is something that courtesy of the office this was created to kind of help us, because actually we members of the exact should be looking at this quite a bit and focusing on it and seeing where we can also make amendments to it and say during this time, like now we're in the midst of Co bad right, so we could be adding some other stuff for future reference. You know for the time to come, because we don't know if we're gonna have another bout of this stuff right. That's what they're saying so we probably be using zoom in the future. You know, even after we all get back together, it may be a possibility that zoom will be around for a long time to come, or something like this. Some type of engine like this right, okay, so periodically, can I ask for someone to help us by looking at this I mean I. Don't often look at it. I'ma be honest with you. I only looked at it when it's like Oh smooth, it's it's June. What are we doing in June so, like I, go back to it and I'll refer and I say: oh yeah, the new members are coming on and like all right, so now what so, then we go to public members have to be reapplied right. Okay, then trainings. What do the trainings look like? What should we be training, the new members on or all the members? What should we have trainings on now that we have zoom? We can actually say: oh, we can actually do some training on Zoom now right, like maybe 45, minutes to an hour training on something and who could help us design and create a little brief training, and it should always be something about SLA, something about land use, some parlamentary procedures, things like that. These are the things that should be on that office procedures for sure I know. Susan, you know, is a big stickler on office procedure and making sure we honor those things so yeah. So a little bit of everything right. We need to like kind of mush it all together and make it look like something and turn it into no more than an hour so that people don't lose. You know, focus they don't want to. You don't want to bore them to death where we know there are certain things that they need to know. If they're sitting on certain committees or even if they're voting on a vote sheet, they need to learn certain languages right. So, who could maybe help me to generate a training on this because I think that it's important, especially SLA land use, so that would be Alex Jackie? What else Susan for sure or maybe yeah David and I always used to do a combination, one on how to write a resolution and what does the office do? The documents are already made they're actually on the website, so we could easily do that. Okay, so that sounds like something good and those shouldn't take any more than like 20 minutes, apiece right so see. So that would be like 20 minutes of that and 20 minutes of the other and then Alex. Could you give me like a 20-minute or like a 10 minute, something yeah sure? And what do you want it to look like to me again? So it should be like general language that they should know about when they're voting on the vote sheet on SLA items. When you talk about 500 foot rule when you talk about going before the SLA board things that things like that, I mean like week, things that we need to know when we're voting on a vote. Cheek when we talk about SLA items, yeah no more than 20 minutes tinnitus become one in 20 minutes. Go ahead. I think that something similar to what you did when you present it to the full board about what your committee does, but Alicia I also think that we might want to include as part of this documents that we put together after our training with the outside facilitator about what the role of the chair is, how the public participate in our meetings and stuff, like that, okay, he's got his hand, yeah I was just gonna say: I can also put together a presentation for Europe applications and PSA applications that should take like 15-20 minutes. That should be fine. Okay, that sounds great. Okay and I. Just tell Jackie that under member resources, there's information from BSA presentations from BSA, you might want to look at used for reference. Thank you. That would save me a lot of time. Thanks. Anyone else have any suggestions. Let's see, that's two, four, six! That's an okay! That sounds like a plan doctor that does sound like a plan. We could definitely break it up into two separate trainings and you know have them live on those okay and then we look at questions for the budget priority Susan. Are we gonna still keep that in June? I just actually talked about that, and what I mentioned was Ed in June I need the questions for the agenda. Do we have submit questions for budget priority consults? So that's what I just discussed and said I would get last year's to the to the chairs so that they have a good reference and what kind of questions we're talking about and if Michelle could put my promises in the minutes to help me. Thank you yeah and July. We're definitely not going to be voting on a district need statement, so we know that that's something that we are going to continue to work on like Susan said earlier, because we don't have to submit it until what you say: October racism right well vote on. We have to vote on everything in October. They want everything generally by October 31st. So that means that we need to change this around the vote on the district need statement. For the month of July, we'll continue to work on the district need statement, so we can edit that Michelle and just but we'll still be working on the district need statement. What I would, if you don't mind, I'd like to maybe put certain things and read the changes that are just for this year because of Co vid, maybe I can add. Those in red is covert only scheduling, okay, so okay. So when everything kind of goes back to maybe a little bit of way, that was, we can go back to this timeline training and splitting it up into two I. Think that what might make the most sense is that the first training is more about like the procedural stuff like the office stuff, the role of the chair, the you know how public participates and that and then the second one can maybe be the one where the chairs of committees do their dog and pony show okay plan, because that'll probably be a little shorter than the procedures and Rezo writing. Sure one slave might be too sure and Mike I, don't know it might not be enough form on training I. Just want to briefly say that we should include in the basic training something about the requirements for attendance. Oh yeah, sure great idea, I think that should come up during our party, the Xoom party. Everybody needs to talk about that and why it's so important, so we couldn't put the attendance in if you want under procedural with the resolution in the office and make attendance another category if you want yeah date, that's what I'm just about to say Susan! Thank you for taking those words out of my mouth. Yes, we have to talk about some dates here so, and we talked about first, the date for the zoom gathering and we sent some dates. Please everybody look at your calendars. Go to your calendar, pull it out! I'm, going there right now and are we looking in this month or should we wait until I think we should wait until June after the full board anyone else for suggestions, they're attending full board for the first time right there, Tipton yeah mm-hmm makes sense to do it. If we can before that, then so they have some so before full board. I know there are a couple of committee meetings going on every night next week, Friday there's a committee meeting okay, so we will have. How are you all with having a Sunday zoom I mean Sunday afternoon I'm, normally free after I? Do my worship so like the 17th or well, that's cutting it too close are the 24th and or the 3rd. The 24th would have to be the ideal date because full board is going to be the 26. So what are you all? Thinking can I have some hands up? Okay, that's one for Michael anyone else. Who else is that good? For me, Oh me that was May. That's to the 24th Sunday to 24th, and should we say at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, what time guys so that's 524 and dad I'm sorry go ahead. Linda is voting for 2 p.m. 2 p.m. anyone else. Thinking are we all in agreeance for 524 at 2 p.m. Lisa Kaplan says 2 p.m. also you guys can just put it in the chat. If you want all Rangel spine and Eric Diaz is fine. Jackie Wong is time is clarified. This is for the introduction party- yes, yeah, yes, Thanks right. This is the zoom gathering zoom party new member party as what we normally call it new members gathering or there's nobody. So that's the locked-in date we're gonna lock that data in 5 24 at 2 p.m. zoom. Everyone come and be festive, and whatever vivacious you like to bring to the table while you're at your house, you could do it your way. It's your day up to the full board. Maybe some full board members would like to join us, so they can meet the new members as well. You know cuz, we'll all be able to see one another. So I think that Michael you're gonna have to send out a blast, a big zoom blast for that one. Even we can invite. Maybe you know I mean we don't normally invite the elected officials, but I mean Margaret and Carly know for sure they'd like to attend just so they could see who they appointed. You know, no. They have been invited in the past right, mm-hmm, oh yeah, okay, so and Gail too right, Susan Gail has been invited. Okay, so let's invite the three electives: okay, that'll, be nice all right, so we're locked in on that date, 524 at 2:00 p.m. I'll see you sharp. Okay, let's go on to the next agenda item. Going back to the agenda. We'll continue to look at the timeline. You know as we go on. We should look at it periodically, like I said. Maybe every other month give it a look over. So do you want me to keep it on the agenda as a standing item? I think we should Susan, because then that way it says all focused: okay, yeah, okay, Joe moved over and talked set up an amazing document that I was going to share with you guys, but I seem to have closed it. So I don't have access to it anymore, I'm not going to share it with you, but anyway, Joe set up this great document that basically, what he did over the past few days was looked at all of the community Boys Facebook social media and what they were posting, what they weren't posting and how they were using Facebook. So you can compare it to ours so that we have a better idea like what we're posting is stuff, that's relevant, that people want to see and how we're comparing to other boards. As far as how many followers we have and whatnot Joe, do you want to say anything more about it? He was there hmm. Where are you? Okay? What's I bring this up because I do what we're going to do is Susan is gonna believe, take this document out to her district managers meeting and to see if we can sort of beef it up a little with kind of who's responsible for doing social media. You know, because we're very lucky that we have Joe and that we have Tati and myself to do this stuff, but some other boards don't have community board members that are savvy to do it, so the district manager is doing it instead. So we're going to try to figure that out and then possibly share this document with the borough presidents office, since it's pretty detailed, I think just finding with Joe and there it is Joe hi. Yes, I have a crazy background. Do I'm going to quickly share the screen, so I can give people a sense of what I did yeah Oh nope, you I, think you disabled it, but I can send it over the chat. If that would be helpful, why are ice yeah I sent it over the chat, so you should be able to open it up. Yeah I mean it it's relatively. Basically what I did is I looked across the 12 Manhattan community boards just see what they were. Posting I think Susan, Michael and I had often had discussions about just is this appropriate for us to post, and so it's just trying to get a sense of. If you look at the benchmark across everyone else like what is everyone else posting and we just started posting, so we are far in a way. So if you look at the spreadsheet column, D is just the community board column. E is just the link to their Facebook account, and then I roughly try to get a sense of how often people were posting. I would say we post multiple times a week, but community board for actually posts multiple times a day, particularly there in coab is 19 and like 9 and 11 also are posting multiple times a day. We because we just resumed the Facebook account a couple months ago only have about a hundred likes or followers, and the highest is community board 9, which has more than a thousand and then consistently across all the groups. You'll see that everyone posts, kind of calendar and meeting updates and community boards I think 7 and 8 are actually posting videos, embedding videos of the full board and actually embedding videos of the full committee meetings which I thought was interesting, because very few people are actually doing that and then, as you move across I, think it's relatively consistent, which is we have chosen not to post kind of New York City wide news, because we're trying to post things that are relevant to our community itself. Some community boards do post that, but we do not, and we try to post news, that's relevant to the neighborhood and try to post news. That's relative! That's kind of electeds announcements or elected events, and so that's columns, J onward, is just kind of documenting what various groups are doing across the different community boards. Thank you, Joe yeah I was going to ask that I know. You talked about talking to Susan about doing like some shoutouts and did you ever work on that document yet about the shoutouts and what that would look like. Well, that's why he did this because see what she was talking about is that I proposed to Lisa and Susan as a possible post that we hope something congratulating our five new members and Susan had mentioned that was sort of unprecedented and it was something we had never done before. It was sort of shot in that particular community board members. So that's why Joe started working on this grid that he put together to see what other community boards were doing and I think yeah I can see, I think it's column Q to the last literally the last column in the spreadsheet. It basically no one posts anything about they're members, whether or not it's people coming on board or just kind of anything. Around kind of new members, or anything like that, that's not what anyone is posting. It was actually kind of interesting how consistent that was across all the community boards. It's mostly kind of news, elected events, relevant kind of webinars or calendar or video of board meetings. Why that's? So? Maybe you just want to remain as private as possible. I, don't know. Yeah I, don't know for a community board its outreach and important news. It's not it's, not a social. It's not! A social document like your personal social media, is media. First of all, I wanted. You can't laugh at me, but I was really ignorant and figuring out. What was where and I couldn't figure out. Why all this stuff from other boards were there and then I found out. That was a community page as opposed to our page I want to say, even though we don't have the board videos on social media they're all on our website, we now have on our website. Do it put on top of community resources, he put links to our Twitter account. They put links to our Twitter account a Facebook account, so hopefully that we start being better crossover. I think after this code, stuff dies down, it'll never be the problem. You know to keep it up the way. The way it is now I would like to ask just if we could do one thing: if it's possible I was looking, you know some of the posts. It seems to be very limited on what shows on a post before you, click more and I was looking today at the Transportation Committee one and started off like with open streets, and then, if you more it, then when you go inside it tells people to go the transportation committee meeting and I wonder if we could, as a general thing kind of reverse that order- and you know first, you know, find that people first yeah and get people to our board meetings, and then you know sort of promote why they should come and give input kind of coordinating, yeah that make sense, yeah I think it's also helpful. Susan I think that this came up also with some of the other stuff that you were forwarding for posting and that you know it's helpful to let to let Joe, know and Taji know sort of what you want that like. What's the most important thing from that, you want them to highlight, otherwise they might just post the whole thing that you send them and that's sort of I'll be happy to do. Thank you other than that I mean other than profusely thinking Joe for taking this over and for doing it in such an amazing way. The end of our social media report. Thank you, cool. Thank you all right now we're going I guess in to a while committee reports. Oh let's acting here I saw a star so Alex, okay, my meeting is next week next week. Yeah well, does anyone? Okay, so we'll just go down the line transportation, anything to report, we're gonna, be meeting on Tuesday about open streets and anybody wants to come into the zoo. Please come in give your opinion. It's important that we get a lot of opinions on what I raised this before, but obviously the community boards are being left out of the process of selecting streets, how you're going to discuss that or we're just going to discuss what streets have been proposed. Well, there's already a couple of streets that are already in the pilot that are down here, but we are discussing and putting a resolution together of which streets we want to see close that we would recommend me it was closed from 8 a.m. to noon. Yes right now the pilot is 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. but we'll talk about it on Tuesday I, just say to Trevor that the mayor's it's phase 1, we you're right, they've left us out of the process for phase 1. They are specifically asking us for suggestions for the next phase and you know hopefully, I've asked our Lena's office they've, gotten a number of suggestions and they'll forward us to us by tomorrow morning. I should have them on the way say: I got a feel from Margaret's office. Also, unfortunately, we didn't get any we're not getting any from the community. I wish we would if people want to do outreach and try and get people to send in suggestions. It would be great. Unfortunately, you know any suggestions, you're gonna get or when people complain. That's the only time well for two got loads of suggestions. So I, don't know why people they also had a committee meeting before they implemented the streets. Gotta move one for the sake of time, I'm, sorry, economic development. This is anisha's first, so we're not meeting this month, but in terms of sort of general economic development things. As everybody knows, the city is starting to host those the council's the working groups to figure out how to reopen various parts of the city's economy so hoping that buildi, some things that come out of that to inform sort of our June conversations. Thank you. Anisha health, Human, Services, youth may I had to yeah I had to unmute myself, I'm, sorry so I. We are not having a meeting in May and, as I reported before we're going to be getting more a list of the you know, ask and budget priorities for many health and human services organization, although mainly in the Asian community, but the other interesting thing that came up is that on some of the I think it was mainly in the settlement. Houses across the city sent a letter to the city that human service workers should also be considered essential workers and should also we see the hazard pay and the incentive pay and all the other things that you know at the hospital workers and the firefighters are receiving because, as you know, some of them are still working and you know putting their health at risk, but the agencies haven't, we see destra funding for that yeah. That's it Alicia says: yep I'm, one of those people, okay, land use. So last week I attended a presentation organized by D Kazan. Seventy Mulberry Street. It is the nonprofit building that was burned down by fire. Basically, the dicas people towards the building needs to be depressed because of a safety reason, and we asked them to present it again at our lanius meeting on May 14, so that the public can be updated as well and so I also attended an H at Town Hall yesterday in nature, chair that the new nitra chairman and Gregory wrote rules who was there too? So he talked about his vision of nature, including recapitalizing their portfolios and we organized nature. There's one thing pretty interesting: I found, but I lost very familiar with that, because when he talked about nature privatization, he also mentioned something about Cohen quo. Releasing the potential of nature, families and I'm really not sure what that and I probably would have to consult Eric on that and that's all I have Thank You Jackie, okay landmarks. We did not meet, but we are going to meet this month. Yep talk about your committee request form for Tamila, I haven't formulated it yet Susan did he request she's gonna change, her committee request, form and Alicia needs them to send out to the new members. So we have to wait until it's amended: okay, Linda. We really need to consult the committee, but you know we're meeting this week. Is that okay? But we need to consult the exact, because if you're going to be you're asking for things not to be heard in other committees and be on this committee, I think that's a discussion of the exact okay. Can you can you remind them exactly I'm going to let everyone know what this is about? We have an agenda item coming up in June, because the emergence a.m. I think it's a mt building on the waterfront is going through is going to be renovated because of still because of Sandy, but it's going to change the outward appearance. So these kind of issues like there have been parks buildings and they have always gone to parks. So this is a agency related to public safety. So should it go to transportation, Public Safety we've never had those kind of things in that committee like this. But then again you know it's a toss-up, so I had asked Linda about whether it be appropriate for her committee, but it's still a toss-up there. It would be going to the landmarks committee, although it's not a landmarks or whether it would go to the committee concerning that agency, which there's also a precedent for so we expect I'm sure this kind of thing will come up again, and so that's why I thought it was it's a cross committee issue, which is why I want a direction from the exam and Linda had thought. Maybe it could be worded in the committee request form to allow at least allow that to be in that committee. Yeah I, don't know of any other committee other than parks that handles these kind of it has to go to the public Arts Commission for approval. We have done that occasionally, probably for you know, somebody said: where should we put that and it came to Kim two landmarks and it's allied? You know it's not it's not completely different. So well, of course, if it's in a park, whichever you may wish to continue handling the thing, it's an I think it's an it's on pier 36 and it's I think EMT workers staff, so Sapir 36 building, it's one large building at 270, South, Street, I, didn't realize. What's the issue I didn't realize it was an issue, they're renovating it and they have to come before the committee be before the community board before they go to design Commission. So it's really could be across three different committees and I just thought. You know. If we're gonna change, the committee request form so that it could go to landmarks or it could go to the others. It should be done in a way that all the committees would agree would agree on. I, don't see all the way other than a joint committee. Is that what we're talking about? No I'm gonna, be honest, joint committees! Never work, never show up. You can certainly have people come. You know they can come to a committee. But if you have joined committees, you generally don't have corn I, think 95% of the time you won't have a quorum. So the issue is there: we need to decide what committee is most appropriate for this building's renovation to be heard by and what it sounds like you were saying. Is that Linda always proposing sort of loosening up her committee description to allow for these types of things to just sort of fall into landmarks and there wasn't and like? Obviously, if it was a park bathhouse or conversation, it would go to parks, but this is a park building that's being used by human services. Is that word it's not a park building, it's not a parks building. So what so, I actually contacted Linda, because it's what her committee does and what we had discussed was and what we had discussed was changing her committee discussion so that these could go to her committee and we're not saying that they have to, but we're saying that they could go to her committee, that they would. That would be an option that you know the exact can decide when they come up. The other issue is that the parks committee also has waterfront under the title, so we also look at water from issues this is actually and as the public safety it's the fire department is the one that called me, which is why Orden will also go under public safety because they have the fire department. So it goes in a lot of places. Linda's I guess a Linda commits the committee has less work and they know how to do. You don't want to take anything away from another committee Trevor. If you want to handle it, it's yours, no I'm just about it. That's well. It never occurred to me because it's not a parks building and it is a fire department building. That's the fire department is presenting I'm trying to envision this building, but I. Isn't it just a boxy piece of nothing? Building it's not anywhere distinctive building, I! Think the issue really here. First of all, maybe the first question is: what are we talking about? Are we talking about the definition of committee, or we talking about what committee this particular issue so I'm speaking on what I don't think was the issue that brought this up in the first place, but it seems to me that what's really the crux of the issue here is whether or not the renovation is gonna serve. It needs it's really not making this a pretty building it's a garage, but it's not really a design thing. It's really a functionality thing I would argue. So that's my point on who should tear it. I, don't think generally that we should change definitions of committees, for you know, oddball things like this I think that the definitions of committee two are pretty well established. So if I could say, the issue is not the functionality that we're going to be doing. A resolution on the issue is the changing of the outside appearance. So that's it's probably irrelevant and unimportant in everything. You say: I agree with you, but that's what they want us to write on. We have every year slightly change. The committee descriptions and I wasn't going to change it. For this we can always make a one-time decision for this. What it was just broadening the committee a description, so it isn't just landmarks and to reflect what it actually does, which is not just landmarks and certificate of appropriateness, but other design commission issues that would be help trying to move on here. Trevor. Do you want this in parks I'm just finding out? That's? Why I'm asking questions because, like for example, of basketball city, which is actually the same type of big ugly boxy structure, has a design change which they will come before us because they want to put a sign up there? Are you saying they should handle that or should it stay with the world? Ask about basketball city is a DC and EDC always comes to parks. Waterfront I was going by the agency, and this is SBS correct, which is but a DC owns the property. The building is a fire department building and they are the ones that are hiring the architect and doing it and they're the ones that need the support. Letter from us, no I know Susan, but just follow my dream. Basketball city also owns that property. Edc owns the land. Fire Department owns that building they would bring their own architects. Just like basketball city would bring their own architects, but there's no difference. Is it it's an SBS with the land lease from EDC I'm, not saying that I want this in a committee or not that I'm just asking questions for clarification. It's absolutely right and all of that and as we've discussed before, SBS is actually involved in all of this, but they never participate. Like basketball city, we always deal with EDC. In this case it's a fire department, so could put it I didn't, assign it I, wouldn't even tell the fire department a date until I talked to the exec, so you have wide open options. Do you have a preference? Do you think this should come to your committee or are you okay? I'm? Sorry, there is no I didn't give them a date. It's an I'm! Sorry! It's in June it'll be I'm in June agenda. They actually are holding up the design commission for us for our letter, because I told him we couldn't do it without a go I. Don't have either for against if it comes to my committee, I'm fine, if it doesn't have time but I do think that we need to think about this, because there are a lot of structures along the waterfront which are typically going to Park waterfront, because they're actually on a pier, as opposed to being on solid ground. We need to think about because basketball city would fall into this and some of the park structures are following. This then have traditionally going to parks and water agree. I think that's very helpful. They have a criteria so to get us moving forward as much as I would love firemen to come to Parks and Rec. Just so, I can look at firemen during our meeting. I would say that, because landmarks typically doesn't have as much of an agenda as parks does that my proposal is to put this into landmarks. Could we also agree to just kind of broaden they committed a description to sort of officially allow these kind of items? A little about that season? Like I said then structure, it's like basketball city and any pier things will all go to landmarks and I. Just don't think that's the area to allow them not to say they should go there, but to say that I think well how I feel that I think that's problematic for this particular item. Considering the timing I'm, not you know it's not that big a deal but I think that if we're going to have a parks, waterfront resiliency, because I imagine designers, also talking about resiliency that we kind of need to keep that under the water project. It's just yes, otherwise we're gonna move all the structures out of parks to landmarks and I know they're, not busy, but that's the nature of the beast of parks and waterfront. It's busy we'd have a lot of items and because we have a long and expansive waterfront I, don't think we should just move stuff off that area, because the community doesn't have a lot to do. That being said, if that's the way, we're going I don't think I should have had a parks and about that I was just going to confirm that we wouldn't change the committee description, but that this one would go to landmark. So now, you're saying something else right, primarily because I just for consistency, which I thought the bus since the beginning of this meeting, that we kind of need to be consistent if we're moving it for because the community doesn't have a lot to do, that's a different story. But if we're looking at it, that was not the reason we don't. We don't want no I'm, not saying that someone hadn't mentioned I'm, not saying that you said that Linda, but I just want to putting it in Hartford for June. That's what we're doing parks we're not doing anything. The committee description and now it's time to give his report. Okay, that means said: I guess we're. Gonna have a firehouse in June, but we did write a letter, I Susan I, don't know if we distribute to everyone. No yes, I went out to everything the city, obviously we're expecting a lot of cuts in parks, and we are letter basically says and he's now in do we need, we don't want the cuts, but we probably going to need more funding for parks. Just because that's where everyone is going, we'll have a lot of social, distancing problems and in parks right now our crowded impact I, don't know if anyone lives near Park on a nice day, including to the head parks of pack. So the fact that the city would think about cutting maintenance and staff is sort of incredulous. This question goes a season in terms of our committee and I, know: we've gotten a couple of quests for items to be on the agenda. I guess we can move them to agenda now for not looking for not just looking at items that need to be voted on, but we had discussed in foreign city agencies or said that they were not meeting after 6:00 p.m. or regular work hours. Have they changed that? Yes, so was enough the agencies- it was just one and after I got very upset. They called me and they changed it. Okay, so that being said, I think just to add to the June. We have some time that we need to put ser and I can ask everybody. Please send me emails with your June agenda items. Okay, Linda, you've, you handed up is that a leftover from our previous conversation or the ever question each other. Let me think that if Seward Clark we're working very hard to try to get Seward Park opened and so far we're not we're hitting a blank wall. So if that's still an issue, it wouldn't hurt to mention it. So I'm gonna put that on the agenda with the assumption or an assitant agenda, with the assumption that might be resolved right. Okay, no, test task force, NYCHA, no arts and cultural. No, nobody met any other old business, any old business. Just say we do business. We also send out the letter against SYEP cuts. Okay, yes, the letter swipe lets went out, Thank You me for working on it and he knew any new business. Okay, may I have a motion to adjourn, so we can go into the next meeting motion to adjourn. Thank you all in favor good night. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, don't go anywhere with me and seconded by RTS.
