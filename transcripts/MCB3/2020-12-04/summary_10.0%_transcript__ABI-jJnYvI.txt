The second thing is: will be about Covid-19 testing at department of education schools, particularly with the special education students and the district 75 students, and all the issues that are involved, and we have two speakers.
You know, talk about the new initiative that Defta is offering to senior citizens all right.
Here to talk about our friendly programming, which includes friendly, visiting and friendly voices and because they're both to address social isolation among our older adults.
We have friendly voices so which one what's the difference which one's right for which particular client or volunteer so friendly visiting, is for our homebound, older adults that have additional needs.
They have a lot of other things going on, whereas friendly voices is for older adults that do not have additional needs and they solely need help with social isolation and loneliness.
They first need to complete an intake with a case management agency that serves their community and also an assessment where the case management intake person will review with them other benefits and entitlements that they may be eligible for once that is completed, then they're going to make that referral to the friendly visiting program.
We can introduce ourselves we're good, but usually people feel a lot more comfortable when there's that initial introduction- and usually the coordinator, stays on the phone just for a few minutes to kind of help them ease into the conversation and then often excuses themselves and lets the volunteer and the client continue to get to know each other on their own.
What's, going on with that older adult and being able to address that issue much quicker than if we were just, You know, kind of waiting for the older adult to let us know the volunteer always knows things a lot sooner and then the coordinator is going to check in with both the client and the volunteer regularly, meaning like once.
We excuse me really encourage volunteer, participation, And then, of course, We also have volunteer recognition and fun events, and one thing that's been added since the pandemic is the programs are starting to have monthly, like zoom gatherings for volunteers, to just come together and have their volunteer community online.
Voices, like I, said virtual opportunities, improving connections with elders, and we have it's a little bit similar and a little bit different to friendly visiting.
We also provide training and ongoing support to volunteers and clients to make sure everything's going well, while friendly visiting programs are embedded within the community in different agencies, friendly voices is run right out of Gifta, please.
That said, you know, I, don't really want to be matched with a younger person.
This is brand new, so we don't have any groups that have started yet, but we have a lot of interest in that so groups of people who are maybe immigrants from the same country, groups of people who maybe have a shared interest like they love classic movies or they love cooking or they want to talk about life, history or things like that.
You, know we're open to all different kinds of groups, But again that commitment is gonna, be eight weeks and after the eight weeks or as it's coming to an end, group members will be able to decide.
Gonna also connect with them one-on-one once every one to two months, just to kind of have a little bit longer of a conversation and a deeper dive into what their experience is like and also just like, with friendly visiting.
They provide what we like to call friendship with awareness, meaning friendship with letting the coordinator know: hey my older adult is seeming down or we've got the issue with the bathroom ceiling again or you know, being aware of those types of things and knowing that there is help here and there.
Don't consider them in this volunteer program to be an expert in social services to be their counselor, to report everything or to do errands chores things like that.
The volunteer was able to come in, and just be this, like amazingly beautiful, loving, consistent presence in Carmen the client's life which carmen the client at the time did not have.
Although this presentation is not about the virtual senior center, I think it really speaks to how powerful belonging to a group can be so Ann loved friendly visiting like I, said, and then she became involved in self-help's virtual senior center and she became involved.
Well, Besides the case management organization, some of the nonprofits who probably have other contracts with theft, you know to run senior citizen centers, for example, specifically for friendly visiting.
It's, okay, answer because I know that, with my particular set of seniors, there'll, probably be more apps to be volunteers than actual clients.
Now we are going to talk about all the things you know the issues regarding Covid-19 tested testing and the schools and the testing of these students.
Who, actually is, You know, works at one of the D75 schools, but could you maybe give a just a little introduction to what's happening now with the testing.
Let me start by saying that the city-wide council for special education is an advisory board to the DOE, we're elected by parents.
We wish we had presentations to give you, but unfortunately, The DOE still has not released a formal letter about what the testing will look like for our families of students with disabilities or our d75 community.
You know a lot of the parents they've been concerned about the way the testing is happening.
It's a very tricky, so we're working very hard and diligently to make sure that when it comes to the testing that there it's done where you know, parents are actually okay with and happy.
So I mean we're talking about like going on nine to ten months.
I wish I had better news for you, but you know, like I, said, keep the fight going and definitely loop us in, so that we can help elevate your situation in the situations of all of our d75 schools, results.
I know that there are a couple of other districts that are actually trading devices for giving devices out to those other schools who had extra whoever needed, But my concern with that was well a lot of the Ios updates.
If it, if it's maybe like hovering below 10, but that being said, That does not mean that we have stopped advocating for more programs to extend a career or more ability based curriculum for our children, who are aging out of 18 19 20.
If we can collectively put our powers together to make that happen, I think it'll address a lot of the issues that a lot of our students are being faced with right, now, whether they're special education or not.
So, just considering like Iep or D75 students goals, you know any child who's needs a lot of accommodations in a normal classroom like an in-person classroom.
I. Don't know that there's been a lot of exploration around what the new needs are with remote or hybrid, or online learning and.
You know I, just like I, my children aren't d75 children, but I look at the kinds of accommodations I had to put in place in their iep taking into consideration.
So I'm just thinking my question is kind of posing like how are how is the DOE.
How are we thinking about new kinds of accommodations that need to be put into place in order to give these children a sense of success in school.
We could definitely think about what possible ways are different resources that we can pull together ideas so that we can make sure that and basically come up with some kind of addition to the resolution or whatever, to make sure that we get these students needs, met, assistive technology also.
I know that one of the D75 schools actually purchased manipulatives different stuff that they actually needed because they knew that they needed it and that parents couldn't afford certain things.
Is there some kind of like an idea around a blanket policy with offering these kinds of accommodations I sat in a few months ago on a the Cec 2 meeting, where you know a parent was working full time and her child needed ot.
I just want to know if there's a way that we can figure out, if there's some kind of a blanket reconsideration of basically all IEPS, all d75 kids, If you have a child with autism, if you have a child that needs ot.
I know, I can't help, but not ask this because I didn't mean to open Pandora's box, but when we start to talk about this I think it's not about swabbing your nose, anymore.
And I want to be respectful of the time of this of the community board as well, because I know that you have other things on your agenda.
I'm fine with me and my own children, but I'm thinking of the larger question of people who maybe don't have the resources or the connections or the know-how.
You know it's going to be this right and IEPS.
So the question is: How do we help inform the parents around so an iep that made sense in person is not going to make sense now in a remote situation, because the situation is completely different or a d75 kid who has autism, you know.
Like, the you know, The learning needs of the students with IEPS.
We need to really make sure that there is a global thinking around the difference in accommodations between hybrid or remote learning and in-person learning and what accommodations are given and whether it's informing parents like that would be great.
It shouldn't be on parents to try to figure out how to do ot if they have a full-time job, and you know they have to like they get a little packet from the DOE.
Okay, So that sounds like the you know, The making of a resolution does it.
I mean I, know that there's a lot of people trying to get.
You know during the pandemic for the schools, but it does need to happen long.
Like I know how many families out there are struggling right.
Do you think Cc1 would be interested in something like this, or is there a need for that in this area, this information session or workshop, or you know, parent, sharing, parent, resource.
You know back in May, So if we do have some of these folks already coming, I think it would be great to like talk about it.
The audience is for parents and like a Q&A, thing, I guess I'd want to know if something like this isn't already in the works so that we're not like just.
I mean I, don't know, I, guess more right.
The persons on this committee and, like I, mentioned in the chat, there's just some parents who show up to things.
