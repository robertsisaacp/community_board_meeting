A summary of the two videos tomorrow, except that Lgbtq yeah he was the first guy. Not yet, is he really so between 1968 and 1978? It furthered the concepts and general concepts of the 60s because of the war but yeah really between 1970 1973 I was in Canada yeah, maybe even before so, between 1970 1973 was that prime period. It happened to be the time period of the greatest movies that ever made, but from 73 onward, all of a sudden it got up to sub cultures. It got into it. This is not going to work. We really want to make money and then dilute it very quickly by the early 80s okay, but if they still had many things happening, so 1773 was good. So when I was in there from the tail end, I had those features, I truly believe hi, hello, Heidi, hi Verna, oh hi, there still connecting hello. How are you hey? How are you this evening?

So, let's just okay before we dive into the meeting any public speaking or community announcements, okay, I guess not all right! Okay! So let's just go to the first, our first presentation from defta: that's the department for the aging. We have Verna Arthur and also Aaron Newman Keys, there's a presentation and a slideshow, and they will. You know, talk about the new initiative that Defta is offering to senior citizens all right. Thank you. Good evening. Everybody I am Erin Neubauerkes from the department for the aging and I'm here to talk about our friendly programming, which includes friendly, visiting and friendly voices and because they're both to address social isolation among our older adults. I'm going to speak about both of them. Please just change this. I'm going to make this panel a little bit smaller, so I can see more okay, so just a couple of little facts. Before we start did you know that loneliness and social isolation can be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and those who are isolated are at an increased risk for cognitive decline, dementia and depression. I think we all right now have a better understanding than ever before about what loneliness and social isolation can feel like. But these two are really striking to me and so I always try to give some perspective when I start talking about social isolation and loneliness. Please, oh, can you go back one. Thank you so, like I said before we have two programs we have friendly visiting and we have friendly voices so which one what's the difference which one's right for which particular client or volunteer so friendly visiting, is for our homebound, older adults that have additional needs. Like case management needs, they might need home, delivered meals, they might need home care, etc. They have a lot of other things going on, whereas friendly voices is for older adults that do not have additional needs and they solely need help with social isolation and loneliness. Please so. First we'll talk about friendly visiting which again is to address social isolation among the homebound and just a quick note before we dive into friendly visiting I, recognize that the picture in front of you is two people very close together and we are not doing in-person visits right now, since the pandemic, everything is on the phone and virtual, so I've adjusted the presentation a little bit to take out the in-person component, but just keep in mind once it is safe to do so. We are planning on visits happening again in person, please. So what is friendly? Visiting programs are throughout New, York, City's, five boroughs. We match homebound older adults with volunteers in their communities. Those volunteers call at least once per week for six months or longer, and they provide socialization and companionship. We have 14 programs that cover specific geographic areas throughout the five boroughs, and then we have one program at Griot circle which serves city-wide Lgbtq, older adults of color and diphthong became involved in friendly visiting back in 2017 and since then, more than 1500 older adults have been visited by a friendly visitor. After six months of visits. 42 percent of those reported a decrease in feelings of loneliness and 54 reported a decrease in isolation. Please. So how does friendly visiting work? Each like I said before friendly visiting is for folks who receive case management so prior to receiving the friendly visiting. They first need to complete an intake with a case management agency that serves their community and also an assessment where the case management intake person will review with them other benefits and entitlements that they may be eligible for once that is completed, then they're going to make that referral to the friendly visiting program. That is either within that case management agency or linked with that case management agency. Once that referral is made, the friendly visiting coordinator for that program will complete an interview with the older adult, and that interview is all about that client. What do they like to do? What are their hobbies? What's important to them and also they'll work with them to understand what their expectations are for participating in the program? Everybody comes in with a different expectation of what they want and for volunteers and clients on both sides. In order to have the best experience possible, we want to understand their expectations. Once the coordinator has completed that interview, they will identify a potential volunteer they'll, let both parties know hey I, have somebody picked out for you and if both parties agree they're gonna schedule, the first phone call and the coordinator will be on that call to make the introduction every once in a while. Both parties say no, we don't need you on the call. We can introduce ourselves we're good, but usually people feel a lot more comfortable when there's that initial introduction- and usually the coordinator, stays on the phone just for a few minutes to kind of help them ease into the conversation and then often excuses themselves and lets the volunteer and the client continue to get to know each other on their own. For that first call please. So after the first phone call, the coordinator checks in with both parties- and hopefully they both say yes, and if they do both say yes, then they are going to continue to talk one to two times per week and we ask them to just talk for as long as it feels comfortable when we were doing the visiting in person, we asked them to visit for about an hour, but on the phone. Obviously, it can be a little bit awkward to like set a timer or try to talk for a full hour, so we ask them to just talk for as long as feels comfortable, often times the beginning of the friendship. The conversations are a little bit shorter and then, as they get to know, each other more, the conversations become longer and deeper. Like a lot of you know, conversations and friendships do the volunteer is going to report. Those calls to the coordinator. Excuse me, as well as any issues that come up during the call, and that can be all types of things right. It could be I'm concerned about the older adult mental health. I'm concerned that the bathroom ceiling fell down and the landlord won't come fix. It or you know, runs the gamut. All different types of things come up, and this is a really good way for us to know. What's going on with that older adult and being able to address that issue much quicker than if we were just, you know, kind of waiting for the older adult to let us know the volunteer always knows things a lot sooner and then the coordinator is going to check in with both the client and the volunteer regularly, meaning like once every one to two months. That coordinator is going to connect with each of them. One-On-One and just you know, find out how's the friendship going how's the experience going. Are there any concerns or anything like that? We also offer ongoing support to the volunteers as well as training, so the volunteer in the beginning, which I'll talk about a little bit later, is going to get an orientation in the beginning. But then, throughout their time in the program, there are trainings on issues that older adults might face, such as cognitive decline, elder abuse, other benefits and entitlements. Things like that they're, not mandatory trainings, but we do get a pretty good turnout and we excuse me really encourage volunteer participation and then, of course, we also have volunteer recognition and fun events, and one thing that's been added since the pandemic is the programs are starting to have monthly, like zoom gatherings for volunteers, to just come together and have their volunteer community online and also they can address and talk about different things that maybe they're struggling with one thing that comes up a lot right now is some people feel like they're running out of things to talk about on the phone. So it's been a really positive gathering for a lot of volunteers and an opportunity to connect with other volunteers. Please so, like I said earlier before, covered things were a little bit different and I do want to reiterate that again they were visiting once a week for at least an hour in March. We asked them. Well, we told them. Please don't visit in person anymore until further notice and for folks who joined the friendly visiting after March before they visit in person in the future whenever that's safe again to do so, they are going to need to meet in person with the coordinator first just so, we can do our due diligence and have met everyone in person and also made sure that everyone's home is appropriate for a volunteer to go to please. So that's it. On friendly visiting shifting over to friendly voices. Excuse me we used to like I said before we were serving homebound older adults within friendly visiting. But there was this really large population of older adults that were contacting us saying: I, don't really have any other needs, but I'm lonely and I need a friend and as social workers we would have to try to like help figure out a need. So we could put them in the program or we would just have to say no, and that was painful. Frankly, I really hated saying no, because I was a coordinator for about eight years and that was a very frustrating, difficult, sad part of my job to turn away lonely people. So when I came to gifta, one of the things that I advocated for was an opportunity to be able to address this with older adults that didn't have any other needs. So we came up with friendly voices which stands for virtual opportunities, improving connections with elders, which is just what it says, it's a virtual opportunity, so friendly voices is meant to only be on the phone and on video we recognize in the future. Someday people probably will visit in person, but that's not. Obviously we don't want them to do that now, but it's also not a part of the structure of friendly voices, please. So what is friendly? Voices like I, said virtual opportunities, improving connections with elders, and we have it's a little bit similar and a little bit different to friendly visiting. We do match older adults with a volunteer, but we also have another aspect of it, which is matching older adults with each other or matching them with a group which I'll talk about a little bit more in a minute. But again we also provide training and ongoing support to volunteers and clients to make sure everything's going well, while friendly visiting programs are embedded within the community in different agencies, friendly voices is run right out of Gifta, please. So the types of connections like I was just mentioning. We have what we call a classic, which is volunteer to client matching volunteers that are at least 18 years old up to I, think our oldest volunteer is 92 or 93, or something like that. Calls are held for a minimum of six months and they happen on the video or on the phone. But we also had a lot of older adults. That said, you know, I, don't really want to be matched with a younger person. I want to be matched with someone like me and I used to have to say you know: I, don't have any volunteers that are 85 90 years old I, I'm not able to do that, but now, with the peer-to-peer model, we're able to match them together and we're trying to match older adults that are within a 10-year age, difference of each other if possible, and we also realized that we needed to shorten that commitment. Kind of setting two people up to be friends for six months, really felt kind of overwhelming to a lot of folks, and so we decreased that commitment to about eight weeks with obviously the option to just continue after the eight weeks. If everything is going. Okay and again, those can happen on the video or the phone, and then we also learned that there were a lot of people that the one-on-one matching didn't really appeal to them. It felt like excuse me a lot of pressure or not really the experience that they were looking for, and so we decided to establish this group engagement, we're gonna, volunteers run those groups and the groups can be about a shared goal, interest or purpose. So we and we're developing the subject or the interest of the group based on who wants to be in the group. So we have ideas such as and again this is brand new, so we don't have any groups that have started yet, but we have a lot of interest in that so groups of people who are maybe immigrants from the same country, groups of people who maybe have a shared interest like they love classic movies or they love cooking or they want to talk about life, history or things like that. You know we're open to all different kinds of groups, but again that commitment is gonna, be eight weeks and after the eight weeks or as it's coming to an end group members will be able to decide. Do they want to stay in the group? Do they want to change the group? Do they want to allow new group members in etc? We really want that the kind of the structure in the future of the group to really be based on what the group wants and what the group is looking for. We do have a preference for video, but we recognize that a lot of older adults do not have the technology, so some of the groups are going to be based on the phone and speaking of technology. I often get the question: are we going to be able to provide technology, and the answer is yes, we really want to and we're working diligently on it. I do believe in the future. We will be able to have some technology. We don't have it in hand right now, but it's in the works. It's on the way it's happening, please. So how does it work it's very similar to friendly visiting so I'll just go through it a little bit more quickly. The coordinator is going to complete an interview on the phone with the older adult is going to need to sign an agreement just that they understand everything and how the process is going to go. The client and the coordinator together are going to determine which engagements are the best fit. Some people might want to be in a group and a one-on-one. Some people might only want to be in one particular engagement, and that is fine. The coordinator will identify whichever volunteer or peer or group, sounds like and seems like the best match, they're going to schedule that first call or group and then introduce them similarly to the friendly visiting, please and again, just like in friendly visiting after the first group or call the coordinator is going to check in make sure everybody agrees, everybody's feeling good about it. If they all agree to continue, then they're either going to talk one to two times per week or the group is going to meet each one time per week for 45 minutes to an hour just like friendly visiting. They will report the calls or the groups to the coordinator, as well as any issues that come up that the coordinator can follow through on follow up on rather and they're. Gonna also connect with them one-on-one once every one to two months, just to kind of have a little bit longer of a conversation and a deeper dive into what their experience is like and also just like, with friendly visiting. There's ongoing, volunteer support training as well as I, don't know if you can see it on the bottom there, but the volunteer recognition and events please so just a brief little part about the volunteer, because a lot of people ask me, what's a volunteer have to do what's the commitment, etc. So, we'll just talk a little bit about that. Please so volunteers in visiting and friendly, visiting or and friendly voices. They provide what we like to call friendship with awareness, meaning friendship with letting the coordinator know: hey my older adult is seeming down or we've got the issue with the bathroom ceiling again or you know, being aware of those types of things and knowing that there is help here and there and we're here to help address those issues. We also need the volunteer to be a consistent presence in that older adult's life, with that commitment of the once a week and just a friendly ear to talk to like we all need as a friend, but the volunteer is not to be whether they are in real life or not. We don't consider them in this volunteer program to be an expert in social services to be their counselor, to report everything or to do errands chores things like that. We talk a lot to the volunteers and the clients about boundaries and what we need to respect the role of the volunteer. What they're here to do and what they're not here to do, and that's really important for everyone's. You know everyone's success and everyone's positive experience, please so to what's the process. What's the commitment to become a visiting or voices volunteer, the process is very similar. Volunteers need to complete an application. They go through an interview with the coordinator. They need to do a reference check, a criminal background check and then an orientation and the commitment again is to do one call or visit per week for six months or longer, as well as to communicate, weekly or monthly with the program coordinator, whatever that program coordinator deems appropriate and necessary for that particular match. So sometimes people are really good at doing that call and that visit every week but they're, not quite so good at communicating with the coordinator and that's why I put this that on here whenever I do these types of presentations, because that communication is equally as important, so we can help provide the best service we can to the older adult please so I just have a couple of quick little stories, so the first one is Carmen and Carmen. I had two clients, rather a client and a volunteer. Both just happened to be named Carmen and they lived very close to one another Carmen. The volunteer did not really speak very much English. She was a home health aide and just I said a home health aide, my goodness, you have time and energy to also be a friendly visitor. She said yes, absolutely I love older people, so I matched her with Carmen, the client and Carmen. The client was very homebound, very mobility impaired, but spoke English and Spanish, and so it really became this beautiful reciprocal, helping relationship where Carmen the client helped Carmen the volunteer with her English and things related to you know needing to understand different things in English and then Carmen. The volunteer was able to come in, and just be this, like amazingly beautiful, loving, consistent presence in Carmen the client's life which carmen the client at the time did not have. They were matched for about four and a half years until unfortunately Carmen the client passed away, but they both loved each other and they also loved that we called them the Carmens. They thought that was so cute Yvonne and Yvonne client and volunteer again Yvonne. The client was about 85 years old and Yvonne. The volunteer was about 20. and when I'm, when I met Yvonne the volunteer I already had met Yvonne the client and I knew immediately that they would be a great match. Their personalities reminded me of each other, their energy reminded me of each other and when I told Yvonne the volunteer about Yvonne the client. She said. Oh, my god, I've never met anyone named Yvonne ever before in my life, and she just thought that was the best thing and it was really lovely to see how they their friendship, just grew and was it was beautiful and as far as I know, I believe they are still visiting, and it's been I think about three years now. Martha and Mildred were both older adults. Martha was the volunteer and Mildred was the client. They lived about 10 to 12 blocks from each other. They both had husbands that had fallen ill, that they had cared for and that both husbands had passed away and they both came to the program saying you know, I need a friend. I need something to do. Martha still had her mobility, but Mildred did not and they were in friendly visiting and the coordinator myself would go with the match. The volunteer each time to do the in the introduction in person and I'll. Never forget this. Martha and I walked up the steps to Mildred's apartment. We walked in the kitchen and Martha said Mildred and Mildred said Martha, and they both started yelling and crying and all kinds of things they knew each other 50 years earlier, I still get chills. When I talk about this, they knew each other 50 years earlier and they had lost touch, and you know they didn't grow up in the time of social media, and so they just you know they had their children in their lives and they cared for their husbands and all of those things and they just hadn't ever been able to connect again and at that point I was like wow. You know I'm a great matchmaker, but it was awesome and they both said. You know what this is such a great program and you know we love it, but we're good. We don't need friendly visiting because we have this history to build on, so unfortunately they did leave the program, but I still felt like that was like an amazing success story, one of my favorites and then the last one real quick is Anne and Ann was one of the biggest cheerleaders and lovers of friendly visiting that I ever met. She was one of my first clients she loved friendly visiting and then she became involved in the virtual senior center. And although this presentation is not about the virtual senior center, I think it really speaks to how powerful belonging to a group can be so Ann loved friendly visiting like I, said, and then she became involved in self-help's virtual senior center and she became involved in this group. I, don't remember what the group was about. Maybe it was about books or I'm not sure it doesn't matter, but there were about five to six people in the group and she started telling me about the group and how cool all of these people were from all different places and backgrounds. And then, after a few months, she said to me Erin I love. You but I don't need friendly visiting anymore. I have a community now I have all these friends. I've got. You know Betsy from this place, and you know Sally from this place and as much as I want to keep doing this I don't need to because I have this great group of friends now and selfishly I was a little bit sad to say goodbye to Anne, of course, but really that's. What we're here to do is help people not feel isolated and feel like they belong and feel like they have connections and that's what that group really did for Anne. So just a few stories that I love to tell and were some highlights of my time as being a friendly visiting coordinator, please so how to make a referral or become a volunteer. You can pass on this contact information to anyone that you think should have it. You can call aging connect or I'll also listed my contact information here. If anybody wants to reach out to me, my phone number and email is listed here and you can feel free to do that anytime. As you can tell I love talking about friendly programming, so I welcome any questions, comments, etc, and that's it well. Thank you very much Aaron for such a you know, thorough presentation. Now we will take questions and you know we can have a discussion. Oh so those of you will start with the committee members and please raise your virtual hand if you can't then wave in the screen, oh Thomas, that was so refreshing to hear in these times. Thank you. So much for the work that you do. I was writing down questions in my notebook, but you hit most of them with the presentation, but thank you, I did want to ask. Do you accept volunteers, citywide or is it more like in this district? Only citywide, and actually now so friendly visiting, is often based on geography right, because if, when we're visiting a person, it's got to be convenient, but with friendly voices we have people from other states. You know somebody who lives in Florida grew up in New. York really wants to connect with a New Yorker, so yeah and volunteers by the way, do need to be 18 years old or older and we take any languages so sometimes we'll get a an older adult. That speaks a language that maybe we don't have a volunteer at that time. That speaks that language. We do outreach for that language and it's awesome just to see how people just rise up and say: hey I, speak that language I'll do this, so we can, if we don't have it we'll, find it excellent. Thank you, Eric hi, guys, I'm sorry about that. Aaron I got a question and forgive me if you answered it, my son was having a little episode. You might have said it. My question is about the number of seniors in this district that are enrolled in the program. Do you have that information? I? Don't have it offhand, but I could absolutely find it. Yes, pardon my ignorance, but which areas do you cover in Manhattan, so this would be so. We covered two community districts, we're like part of two, but it's community board three districts, so the boundaries you can find them online at our website. Rather than doing it, but it's kind of like southern Manhattan, though yeah definitely yeah, so that whole area is covered by encore community services for friendly visiting and then for friendly voices is just all at difta, oh Eric. What are you talking about? The community Board district or the area that you serve? I mean your organization serves district community district, 1 parts of community district 2 that make up community board 3. just that kind of area: oh yeah, so it's like below Houston yeah, that's Encore, East, Village, lower east side, Chinatown East London. Here that case management agency is called New, York Foundation and then the friendly visiting program that works with New York Foundation is called encore community services. Okay. So for the friendly visiting you're saying that people have to connect with a case management organization, the designated one correct, and for you all that is New York Foundation. So, okay, that's smooth! That's helpful! That's more clarification! They have this case management service. Yes, so you can also always call out aging connect. Like our catch-all, you know of all the questions. So how do they know? How would they be connected with it to start with, they can call aging connect and agent connect will do a warm handoff and introduce them to the intake coordinator at New, York Foundation, oh and your foundation. Has they have operated senior housing before? Is it that New York, Foundation I believe so, but I'm not as familiar with that part of it? Okay, all right, any other questions. I may I have a question. Sorry I was waving my hand. Sorry, okay, so do you reach out? We have a lot of norks here in the neighborhood. Do you reach out to the norcs and get clients that way? Are you connected with them? Yes, we are connected with them. Some Newark's actually have friendly visiting built into their programming and some don't, but friendly voices is open to everyone who does not need the case management and friendly visiting those that do have it and, yes, we do outreach to them as well, but do you contract with any non-profits? Well, besides the case management organization, some of the nonprofits who probably have other contracts with theft, you know to run senior citizen centers, for example, specifically for friendly visiting. We just we have contracts with the different agencies, but and we engage with them, but it's really covered by those specific programs, those specific friendly businesses. Well, okay, the friendly visiting that you had before that's the face-to-face visiting you do contract with different non-profits, but the friendly voices is run directly by difta and staffed by different employees. Correct all right. Are there any other questions, especially from those of you who may serve seniors or not seniors. Yeah I know that I saw this programming as part of the commissioner's newsletter. But do you have an email address? I also run an org by the way, oh great I personally. Do the friendly voices also has its own email address, which is F voices at Aging.Nyc.Gov I know my last name is so long it you can't even memorize it to remember my email address. It's okay answer because I know that, with my particular set of seniors, there'll probably be more apps to be volunteers than actual clients. Great, and you know thanks for bringing that up. However, an older adult comes to us and wants to be that's where we take them. If we get a 95 year old, actually, I did today. I got a 95 year old. Who wants to be a volunteer great? She can be a volunteer, I'm not going to try to make her into a client if she wants to volunteer. That would be great yeah, because I'll certainly be because I every week, I do send out to them like a whole email blast of information and for the most part they just really basically want someone to talk to yeah great we'd love to have them all right. Thank you. By the way, this is great. Information have voices at Aging.Yc.Gov, correct, F voices, yes, okay, anyone else, committee, members or perhaps members of the public, but you know those of you who are not on the committee. Do you have questions for Erin? This is Verna I, don't have a question. I just want to say. That is why I brought Aaron up to make the presentation, because she has all the stories and the information in the specialist and thank you again, Erin you're welcome thanks for having me. Oh, those were amazing stories about especially about those two friends who knew each other 50 years ago. It was so cool I couldn't believe it, okay, great okay. So we have your information and we have the slideshow, which we can. Certainly you know pass around to the committee members, and you know we will send that up to them as part of the minutes. Okay, so if they can always review it and just contact you directly, yes, absolutely, okay, great okay! So then, okay! Well, thank you very much all right. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome to stay for the next one, especially if you're interested in all the going ons at DOE I. Am I'm gonna? Listen up! Okay! Thank you all right! Okay! Thank you! Okay, so our next agenda item will be. We have Paulette Ha and Grisel Cardona. It's a grisella, you're Paulette right, I'm Paulette and I'm Christopher Donna. Thank you. Okay, so they are from Paulette is from the city-wide council on Special, ed, yes and Riselle is from the citywide council on district 75 schools. So now we are going to talk about all the things you know the issues regarding Covid-19 tested testing and the schools and the testing of these students. You know we, you know. At the last meeting we had talked about how DOE had said there would be this random monthly testing, but it isn't exactly happening that way and I know it's very complicated. So we're just. Can you at first well, I first came up to a song from Thomas. Who actually is, you know, works at one of the D75 schools, but could you maybe give a just a little introduction to what's happening now with the testing sure I'll start I'll see how, because I know that you know I mean they're supposed to be this testing and, for example, they're supposed to be this permission given, but you know giving the permission is and getting. It is another thing right, yeah that that's been an issue yeah so well. Let me start by saying that the city-wide council for special education is an advisory board to the DOE, we're elected by parents. We are all parents, as is my colleague here Gazelle, who is representing the D75 community. We wish we had presentations to give you, but unfortunately, the DOE still has not released a formal letter about what the testing will look like for our families of students with disabilities or our d75 community. However, we do have some information that we are able to share. We wish it was more. We all wish it was more because we, as parents ourselves, are just as frustrated and confused and stressed out and worried about what the reopening is looking like. So I do want to acknowledge that, first and foremost that we're all experiencing some form of trauma one way or another because of the abrupt closing and because of the rush to the opening. So in that vein, I, you know we're here to provide whatever clarity that we can we're here to help share re resources that we have available. As of right now for our parents and whatever we can't answer, we will bring back to the DOE and try to get further answers for you, but we are hoping that there will be some guidance sent out officially from the DOE by the end of the week. So that being said, Grisel am I, forgetting anything yeah. So you know a lot of the parents they've been concerned about the way the testing is happening. How often, and what does that look like, especially for students with special needs, some of our students? Don't they have sensory issues and a whole lot more. So it's testing around students of special education and district 75 is it's a very tricky, so we're working very hard and diligently to make sure that when it comes to the testing that there it's done where you know, parents are actually okay with and happy. So that being said, well, I guess we'll open the floor to questions hey how you doing this is Thomas Rosa, I'm a special education teacher and you know we're living in this in real time. I'm actually assigning my building full time because I'm a dean of students in a special education high school and I'm so grateful for our staff that we've done an amazing job. Even when they've been close calls with people in proximity to some of the staff, we've been able to follow the protocols and everyone's been safe in our building. So that's been helpful. A concern that I had I understand. There are medical accommodations that can be given for some kids. We don't have that necessarily happening in my school. But what we are concerned about is they're expected to be back. Thursday I, keep saying it's tentative, because it's gonna change a lot over the weekend. But if a student does not have the does not happen, will they really be put on remote or only that's the question that we have? Okay, so as of the latest information that we've gotten from the Doa and from H, because ideally they're the ones really putting down the guidance in terms of testing, the guidance that has been given out is that there is a medical waiver that the parents can apply for their child to exempt them from the random testing. There is also a special education waiver that can be initiated by either a parent or by someone at the school, for instance Thomas. If you know for a fact, you have certain students that just will not submit to random testing either for behavioral reasons for sensory issues for various different accommodation issues. Things of that nature, then you yourself can actually apply for a special education waiver for that particular student. Now, once the a special education waiver is initiated, that student is exempt from random testing. Even while waiting for approval of that particular waiver, the medical waiver itself needs to be filled out by an actual physician. So that's slightly different and that's more about if the child has constant nosebleeds obstructions in the nasal cavity, that would prevent them from getting an actual swab. That's where the medical Waker would come in, but the special education waiver is something and again. This is something that is still not totally concrete, but the guidance that we've gotten as of this week is that for those who applied for a special education waiver, whether it's been approved or is pending, the family is responsible to have that child tested outside of the school within seven days. If that particular child is chosen to be part of the random sample and I will be happy to put in the chat the link on the DOE site on where the waivers can be downloaded and assessed. If you want to share it out with your community, that's really helpful because you know we're concerned. Thankfully, my school we're equipped, we've actually been remote seamlessly. We have the mechanics for that and the kids who don't have tech is maybe about six in the entire organization. But this is great yeah, but some schools are struggling, mightily and I'm very concerned because I know for a fact not being negative. Just some parents are not going to have these consents, so you know the conundrum. If, on your side, have you heard anything about enhanced tech because they, you know they could provide the tech I, don't know why it's taking one of my kids. He has an iep. We put him in an inclusion program, he's doing phenomenal for the first time ever, he's had a chance to get credits and he hasn't had a device for about six weeks, but he's literally participating in the curriculum over the phone. Like that's I, know since March right, because we we've been in quarantine since March, so I mean we're talking about like going on nine to ten months at this point of this is the form of education he's been getting well. I just got him into a credit bound program in September, so it's like a ticking top ticking clock, he's actually getting credits, but so I mean if we can do something also to enhance the turnaround. It's just taking too long. Yeah I mean I. First of all, I want to thank you for the work that you're doing with your students, being a parent of a d75 child, I value and appreciate our teachers so much, and we know that their success hinges on making sure that they have all the supports. They need, whether it's in a teacher, whether it's related services, whether it's assisted tech, so we parents understand immensely how important it is to make sure that our children have the devices in place in order to even participate. Unfortunately, this has all been centralized through DOE. It's through purchasing it's you know. We keep hearing the same numbers over and over again, 350,000 devices were ordered. Another 100,000 children are still waiting. 60 devices are supposedly at the Ue right now and we're on route for distribution right before they close our buildings, close November 19th, so I can tell you from the special education office. They have been working diligently, trying to expedite those devices to schools that have had long-standing orders and especially to our d75 and our students in temporary housing. First and foremost, so the only thing that I can suggest to you Thomas is to continue the conversations with your principals trying. You know these principles have outlets that they can reach out to either the district 75 superintendent's office to help escalate and try to figure out. You know eight etas on when your site can anticipate these devices and feel free to you know: Cc our councils, both Grizzle and my council, so that we can elevate the concerns and we've been trying to kind of grass root it out. Since the anything to you know, trying to get data from the Theo is kind of like asking for like government secrets, but we've been grassrooting out, and we so appreciate the partnership that we have with our cecs and our president's councils in the various districts who have been trying to give us numbers from their individual schools so that we can kind of collect that data per borough per district. But it's a long process and it's we've been doing this since I want to say May and even now the numbers haven't shifted at all and that's very scary, considering that the majority of our students enrolled in schools overall are remote. So we recognized that concern- and you know that's my advice to you as of right now. I wish I had better news for you, but you know, like I, said, keep the fight going and definitely loop us in so that we can help elevate your situation in the situations of all of our d75 schools results. Do you want to add anything am I, forgetting anything I think yeah. As far as devices go, I mean we're all very frustrated. They're I can give you an example, my son who's in the Cpsc program. His program still have yet to get devices and I still get yelled at for not him not growing up for attendance or him not coming to therapy. But you know: I have three kids, I'm doing it by myself, we're all using devices, because I too myself go to school. So it's a little difficult. You know that the devices have yet to be given to the schools, for that I know that there are a couple of other districts that are actually trading devices for giving devices out to those other schools who had extra whoever needed, but my concern with that was well a lot of the Ios updates. Some of it can not go past a certain update because of how old the iPad can be so suggestions that I had made was for teachers to use programs that weren't too much up to date, because some of the devices didn't have the capability to use them so I, it's very frustrating and I'm so sorry, it's happening around and across the board, but we're here I mean we're. Pushing and I promise you that so, okay, great Paul, hey I, had my hand up a long time. It hurts even virtually I'm just I'm messing around. Thank you for coming on tonight. Much appreciated. Thank you for posting the link in the chat that actually answered a bunch of my questions from earlier two, but I do have two questions right now: how many students from the D75 portal per se crossover and are in district 79 programs? Do you know that off the top of your head or top like, if you guys know that because I work in partnership with the d79 program, I am a former d, but I do work closely with a d79 program, so I just I know there's a lot of students from that population that are also affected in d79 programs, they're, primarily high school students, though I don't know. If you have any of those numbers readily available. I know the DOE. Has it unlocked now, but thank you hit it right on the head Paul. We have asked for these numbers because we always feel like D7. D79 is kind of like the forgotten stepchild. When it comes to the DOE- and you know advocating for students for disabilities, our students are getting educational services to the age of 21. So the from what I know anecdotally, because, like I said, you know it's like if we can't get it from the deal. We're gonna try to figure out how to get the information somewhere. So I have reached out to certain people in d79 the transition from d75 to d79. It's not often only because the way that these some of the d79 programs are structured. You know whether it's a career oriented program, whether it's an affinity program or you know, there's different models right, yeah, yes, so with the D75 program, because the majority of the students that are in d75 are there because they, you know, they're classified with developmental delays or multiple disabilities, the abundance of programs available to them after your traditional high school setting after the age of 18 are few and far between. That's the reality of it. So the numbers are going to be low. We don't have definitive numbers, but I wouldn't be surprised if it if it's maybe like hovering below 10, but that being said, that does not mean that we have stopped advocating for more programs to extend a career or more ability based curriculum for our children, who are aging out of 18 19 20. You know things of that nature only because we realize that you know it's important for them to know that there is an option for them outside of going into. You know a particular group setting, or you know, living in assisted living for the rest of their adult lives. There has been some success with co-op tech from what I, remember and I believe that there was talk about expanding the program to Coney, Island and Staten Island, but I think once Covid-19 hit some of those talks were you know, they're still, because it's all about funding at this point right, so I, I'm gonna, keep asking for those numbers and if, by some grace of God that I actually do get them from the DOE, I'm more than happy to share them with you Paul. Thank you. I may I. Just have one final question maybe made that maybe you can answer this out. What specific support are you guys looking for from us as a committee and as a board that we can maybe eventually turn into a resolution? Maybe next month, as an agenda item, may I don't know if you want to answer that or if anybody else wants to answer that I just want to get a clear idea of where we want to go with this at some point well, I mean if I could make a suggestion. You know we've. I've sat on quite a few of these different committees that are community based and community-led, and my personal ask- and this is you know- I mean I- I'm not going to put my counsel under the bus or anything about this, but this has been my own personal ask is that if we can get our community leaders to partner with the local politicians to make broadband universal across the city, that would be instrumental in terms of not only eliminating the digital divide that has been so apparent once Covid-19 hit. But the reality is right. Now, 75 of our students are learning remotely, and the latest survey from the Citizens Committee for children released that 60,000 children are still waiting for a learning device, but 90,000 children don't have access to broadband whatsoever and 230,000 children have spotty or unreliable internet service. So anything that we can collectively do to make universal broadband possible will address a lot of the inequities that we are seeing in education, and you know Lo and behold: we've got a vaccine on the way within two weeks, but that's only you know it's like we don't know what that's going to look like. We don't know how available that's going to be so we don't know how long we're going to be in this learning environment. So if we can collectively put our powers together to make that happen, I think it'll address a lot of the issues that a lot of our students are being faced with right now, whether they're special education or not yeah I, agree I mean we need to there's something that we have to do, but first of all, I think Shirley is trying to raise her hand or say something sure. Yeah I have a concern that I wanted to raise. So just considering like Iep or D75 students goals, you know any child who's needs a lot of accommodations in a normal classroom like an in-person classroom. It's there's a lot, but when it comes to looking at online learning, the accommodations are much bigger and broader and I. Don't know that there's been a lot of exploration around what the new needs are with remote or hybrid, or online learning and I. Just I'm wondering how we can consider that and then think about ways that we can make more global recommendations. You know like for some kids toggling between you know a google classroom and an online document and a YouTube video is too much and maybe they would need two devices, but they only have one device or they don't have any devices. So I'm kind of thinking about what are the considerations around students with disabilities and how are we thinking about what kinds of accommodations could we generally put in place? You know, depending on their iep, depending on their diagnoses, in order to better support them. You know I, just like I, my children aren't d75 children, but I look at the kinds of accommodations I had to put in place in their iep taking into consideration. You know remote learning, so I'm just wondering how we can help with that or if there's a you know, a citywide initiative or if D75 is reconsidering this or if the DOE is reconsidering how IEPS are looked at in terms of remote, hybrid or you know this kind of learning situation yeah. So just Paulette and Grisel just a little background. So you know that's. You know the school district that we're in you know I mean our community board had long identified. You know english language learners, you know students and temporary housing, students and homeless, shelters and temporary housing, and also students with disabilities or with IEPS. As you know, that's what our the high needs are in our area and before the whole pandemic started. We were going to do actually like a resource fair. You know partnering with Cec1, for you know something simple. You know just to reach out to families of these kids just to tell them what you know to you know. Let them know more about the resources that they have. So that was before. We even knew about the pandemic and we were to do it in May and of course, we never did it. So I think that what Shirley is talking about you know follow is follows up with you know what we talked about before and surely so you had a question for them right. That was a question you had. You wanted a normal one, it's a question, but it's also kind of a posing a problem that we need to really think about. Just an Iep or a d75 diagnosis is one thing in an in person situation, but when we're looking at an autistic child or a child with emotional issues or a child with looking at the needs in the remote situation is very different, and so I'm just thinking my question is kind of posing like how are how is the DOE? How is district 75? How is how are we thinking about new kinds of accommodations that need to be put into place in order to give these children a sense of success in school? So I know that this is one of the questions that I did ask the district on. How are we looking into the IEPS and how are we making sure that the goals that the students have on a case by case are being met, especially for the ones in remote, because I know that there are students who aren't remote that fell behind right? So the question is: what can we do to assure that they're not falling through the cracks as well, because these are students, these students are vulnerable, and so we could definitely think about what possible ways are different resources that we can pull together ideas so that we can make sure that and basically come up with some kind of addition to the resolution or whatever to make sure that we get these students needs, met, assistive technology also, those kind of devices I know that there was one organization actually giving out free assistant technology for students who actually needed it. I have to look through my emails for the name and I'll. Get that to you guys, but I know that there was one company doing it because of the pandemic. But if we can get folks to you know, I, don't know, help out and stuff I know that one of the D75 schools actually purchased manipulatives different stuff that they actually needed because they knew that they needed it and that parents couldn't afford certain things. So I know that specifically my son's school they sent out they're just gonna, send out like a little backpack of stuff with different dices and things so that they can do their ot their services. The other hard part is the parents actually doing the and so what organization? Or who can we reach out to actually help parents help their child when it comes to therapy? So that's like another thought that we should also think about so basically teaching us how to do the ot teaching us parents and maybe even providing a certificate so that parents can even use that, if they're interested in taking that even further so diff creating opportunities, while also making sure that we're going through the through this hard time to you, know yeah, so I guess I. What I'm thinking is like is there some kind of like an idea around a blanket policy with offering these kinds of accommodations I sat in a few months ago on a the Cec 2 meeting, where you know a parent was working full time and her child needed ot and she had no ability to provide it and you know, was struggling because no one could come to her home. So I'm just thinking like are there ways or are we thinking in terms of like the broader picture, with both d75 kids and with children with IEPS with this remote situation? I'm you know so, hopefully, there's a vaccine and by next September everything will be back to what it was. We've lost a lot of time and I guess I just want to know if there's a way that we can figure out, if there's some kind of a blanket reconsideration of basically all IEPS, all d75 kids, if you have a child with autism, if you have a child that needs ot. So how is the city? How is the DOE considering? How are we helping these children because we're losing time and many parents, like yourself and I, are like working all day and we can't provide these services and there's no outside services to be given, and yet the Iep or the accommodations that they've been offered are not sufficient in the remote learning situation, so I guess that's kind of where I'm thinking like what what's in place and what are we considering? What's the deal we considering what's d75 doing like? How are we combating this issue and how are we getting in front of it so that it doesn't become? You know even more learning loss for next September, where the kids are sliding? Even okay, I'm going to stop something right here. So, okay, just a little bit about the timing and the process. So the agenda item was really just about Covid-19 testing, but you know actually, when I was thinking about the agenda item, I could easily see how you know. We start talking about all this other stuff, because it's all connected and related. So now we're talking about you know, possibly you know having some kind of resolution or you know decision and we're also talking about you know the needs. The learning needs of all these students should we have a more put it on next month's agenda and have a more thorough discussion and more speakers, and maybe Paulette and Grisel can come back or maybe there's others that we need to bring back to give us all these information and ask answer all these questions that Shirley's asking like. How can we do this and how we can do that and then I mean our next month's meeting is in January. So it's not that far away I mean and surely I hear the frustration in your question and in your voice and yeah I know I can't help, but not ask this because I didn't mean to open Pandora's box, but when we start to talk about this I think it's not about swabbing your nose anymore. It's really about like how are we servicing our children in the daily yeah and I? You know I. Think I'm gonna make sure that I give you my information so that we can continue this conversation offline because your specific situation, there are solutions for it and I want to be respectful of the time of this of the community board as well, because I know that you have other things on your agenda and I'm more than happy to come back with other resources I. You know we have connections over at advocates for children as well. If you want to talk, no thanks, I'm sorry Paula! You misunderstood! It's not that we don't have anything you're, the last thing on our agenda. This is going to be a short meeting. Okay, we have other things. It's just that I mean it's. This is I mean our body is probably like yours. So it's all of our agendas are publicly announced right, okay, and we only talk about what was publicly announced, not other things, because it's in the name of transparency. So maybe there are others who are interested in the other issue and we wouldn't want someone say well. You know you talked about this, but you didn't even publicize it on your identity. I wanted to come and how did you know? Why did you? Let us know let the public then I just want to say so. That's why we could I'm asking if we could continue having a more thorough thing next month, because I think that's not too long. So for me, this isn't a personal question, I'm fine with advocating for my own children. It's really thinking of the larger the people that don't know how to advocate for their children. So I'm not really asking for me, I'm fine with me and my own children, but I'm thinking of the larger question of people who maybe don't have the resources or the connections or the know-how, and that's really where I was asking the question about so yes, maybe we should table until January, but I wanted to bring it up because I think it's important, because it's really on my mind, yeah I, agree with Shirley and I. Think we really do need to put this on the agenda for January I know when my son was in school if he missed a month or two months of his ot, he regressed, and there are so many things so many points on the IEPS that are just not being met during Covid-19. How can we address them? Are there plans? Are there discussions to address these to meet these needs for these students? I'm sure Thomas you're, very interested in that. What's coming down the pipe, because who knows how long this pandemic is going to go on, I think it's definitely worth pursuing and I heard. The expectation is that the schools are going to be like this until the end of June. You know it's going to be this right and IEPS. You know they're getting ready to redo the IEPS any time now for a lot of stuff. They started yeah. They started. Oh, my oh gosh right. So the question is: how do we help inform the parents around so an iep that made sense in person is not going to make sense now in a remote situation, because the situation is completely different or a d75 kid who has autism, you know. Maybe the supports were great in school, but if it's remote, their supports are completely different. Now so I guess that's my thinking around. Maybe we really need to explore this issue and see how we can support it. Okay, David and then Tati yeah I was just gonna. I'm gonna speak to the point about not having it on the agenda. I mean strictly what that means is that we can not vote on something on it tonight and I understand that we've strayed from the you know from the narrow. You know topic of the agenda, and so maybe we should defer it. But let me just say if it would be productive for us to continue talking tonight for like planning purposes. We can go ahead and do that if it would be more productive to wait because we'd have better input, then we can obviously do that as well. We can't not talk about something, I'm sorry we're not forbidden to talk about something just because it's not on the agenda. That's my point. Okay, thank you! David for clarifying Tati hi everyone and thank you. Paulette and Grisel Naomi connected us via email. So thanks so much for joining us. I really appreciate it and yeah. So I think that we should move this I mean not this discussion, but I think that we should be working towards a resolution in January and I agree with David that if there's like some planning questions, we can do some like preparation now and I. If we are allowed to do that, I do have a question. You know I'm hearing that this resolution would be mainly about broadband technology. Accessibility, enhanced technology, things like that. Is there something else that's missing in that and also you know, since this agenda item did originally start. As you know, the Covid-19 testing do you think there's also a benefit to that being some resolution about the problems in schools around Covid-19 testing yeah. Those would be my questions. If may you think it's appropriate to talk about those yeah? No I didn't say we couldn't talk about it at all, but if we're okay, yeah but we're having a resolution, you know we should we and we certainly can plan for it. You know the Covid-19 testing, it's yeah, it's two different things and we can have two different. You know types of resolutions, it's not just an update one thing just so that you know the city's test and trade I mean this doesn't pertain just to the schools, but the city's test and trace program has been meeting with the community boards, including the Manhattan boards, about just getting more help in terms of you know, testing or tracing you know in the general population in general, because you know there's just concern all around about the rising numbers. So the question is: what would a resolution look like if we're doing it in January? You know we need to plan for it. We want to have more information and what is the information? And what exactly is the resolution? Because there's different things like Tati, you talked about three different things: the Covid-19 testing, the broadband and then just this. Like the you know, the learning needs of the students with IEPS yeah. Sorry I wasn't saying that those would all be one resolution no I know I understand that, but it's yeah I mean maybe the broadband and technology accessibility could be combined into one but yeah I. I'm just wondering if there's something else, that's that we haven't discussed that we should also be doing research on to prepare, for you know our meeting next month and then another thing. This is not resolution wise, but Shelley talked about the need to inform parents about something so that doesn't require a resolution. That's but I! Think for me. It's more like a I think that there needs to be a reconsideration of accommodations for children regarding remote learning or hybrid learning, because maybe there will be a vaccine and next September we'll go back to the other thing, but I think in this environment. We need to really make sure that there is a global thinking around the difference in accommodations between hybrid or remote learning and in-person learning and what accommodations are given and whether it's informing parents like that would be great but I. Think, like more on the level of how we're considering learning in this environment, I, guess and you're saying that we need to advocate with the DOE and therefore this is a resolution that they should that they need to consider that they're not considering enough this difference. It shouldn't be on parents to try to figure it out. It should be fun yeah exactly so they're not doing enough is what you're saying, and it is on parents right now more and it shouldn't be on parents. So much is that what you're saying correct? Yes, I it shouldn't be on parents to try to figure it out. I mean I. You know, I am other parents more know-how, but it shouldn't be on parents to try to figure out how to do ot if they have a full-time job, and you know they have to like they get a little packet from the DOE and they have to certify them like it should really be on the DOE and us to figure out how to help them. Okay, so that sounds like the you know, the making of a resolution does it? Oh David is your hand up again January, it's not for now. It's like a thing to think about, like we could get some experts in January and think about it. No I didn't say no, I'm just talking I'm talking planning mine is back up. Is your back is your hand back up, yeah, okay, so something that you said about Sorry Paulette said about the pandemic, making it you know it's like revealing the digital divide, how deep it is more than just schools as well. So I'm thinking and the pandemic is not going to be ending soon, but if it does end, this need still continues, and it's more than just schools right, there's employment opportunities, for instance. That people are, you know, don't have access to so I, don't know if it's a separate resolution or if it's a longer term thing I mean I, know that there's a lot of people trying to get. You know traction with this anyway, it's a moment to emphasize that it is needed and it may not come to fruition. You know during the pandemic for the schools, but it does need to happen long term. I. Don't know if that is helpful comments, but, okay, there are things okay, so oh Thomas your hand is up Thomas and then Tati yeah to piggyback on what David was saying. That definitely could be one of the. Whereas is if we're talking about broadband, we just had a presentation on seniors and if some of them actually had connectivity, it would improve some of the outcomes that that's already being done in the district. One thing I wanted to bring to the to everyone is starting in January we're going to start distributing hot food for the first time in the schools. They have special containers, so they're going to be serving hot meals. I'm just curious. If, because of the students being isolated, is there a food need? And if so, are the schools distributing meals anymore, or has that already been discontinued for the food, because I sit on the lunch for learners call? They there are schools that they still distribute food. The only concern is the cold lunches right. So there are some schools that are there. They claim that they're supposed to give halal food but they're, giving cheese, sandwiches instead, and so it's the food situation is a little bit tricky. I can invite you guys to the next luncheon call if you guys want to join, but it's something that we've been discussing, especially with Chris who's in charge of the food stuff and so but yeah it's the food. Is it they're still giving it, but it's very the issues with the cold food some schools had they changed the milk, because some schools received milk that was already old and it's because of how if it's left overnight or they forget to put it- you know. So it's just you know 50 on a scale but yeah. Well, the hot meals are coming, so maybe you guys could explore that might be another option for some of the kids yeah. Definitely all right! Tati, yeah I was just gonna kind of echo, a lot of what Thomas said, but and David, but I do think this yeah. Clearly, this is pointing to a larger issue. You know all across the board, and I was just thinking you know hearing about this- that you know when I go to the Cec one meetings. There's I, don't know his position. I know his name is Elvis and that he works on like devices, and you know he always comes to the Cec meetings and gives like a pretty informative presentation about. You know the updates on devices and schools and stuff like that. So that might be somebody we might want to invite to next month's meeting and yeah and I would also be curious, specifically about like headphones for students in temporary housing, because that was that's been raised many times in Cec meetings. As you know, a concern I like that, okay Eric did you want to say something: no I, just I liked what tattoo said so next month. We want to hear more about the technology. Sorry, all right, I can reach out to Naomi and Ccu may. If that's wanted about connecting us to Elvis, okay, and then we are talking about also how Deo what Shirley was talking about. How do we needs to kind of step up more to you know, support the students and the parents with the IEPS and figure out what their? How did they get through this year? Right, I, don't know who would be able to help us with that, but I feel like there should be somebody that can guide us and guide parents and guide all of our constituents on how IEPS and how accommodations need to change because of the situation that we're in right now and I, don't know who that would be. That would could help us, but I'm sure they're thinking about it. I mean I, know that I completely reconfigured my children's IEPS considering this from my observations, but there has to be people at the DOE that are thinking about this in depth and can help us to direct our constituents as to how they can help their children. Okay, so they're saying they already know how to do it just help. Well, I'm hoping they already know how to engage I think they do I'm guessing. They do like I can't imagine that I'm the only parent that's made like accommodations based on observations, but there has to be people in the deal who have been considering different accommodations for children due to the remote learning. Okay, so is, should we have a speaker more apparent speaker or someone from DOE or a parent advocate or a DOE? Can we get person from DOE I think that's important. We could yeah. Let's do that. I can find out unless you all know someone already, but I can talk to what's her name Michelle and ask let's ask Michelle in the interim I did put in the chat, different resources that you can extend out to families in the meantime, until you can put it onto the agenda and have a broader discussion, but I'm a solution driven person. So it's like I can't imagine like I know how many families out there are struggling right now and I know how many families are hungry for guidance, so I put down whatever I had readily available that you can share out right now. The DOE did create a beyond access series to help parents transition from in person to remote, and there are additional webinars on there about different behavior tips: how to support your child who's on the autistic spectrum, there's about 12 or 13 different seminars on there right now. So it's a band-aid for a much bigger problem, but it's what I can offer at this time so and there's also I put in a contact from Cenrigia. They started doing weekly parent engagement forums in order to inform parents next steps if they felt like what they were getting through. Remote learning just wasn't conducive to their child's situation, so that might be a helpful resource to share out as well and I. Put that all in chat, so I don't know. Senator Jaya has been doing this before I mean that this is kind of their specialty here right, so guys, remember, okay, so the other thing is remember how we were supposed to do that forum in may. Do you think it's something you know with Cec1 or you know the in-person parent resource fair? Do we still want to do an event for parents? I mean it will have to be virtual, I. Imagine and you think cc. How do you think Cc1 would be interested in something like this or is there a need for that in this area, this information session or workshop, or you know, parent, sharing, parent resource. Sorry I have my hand up. I, speak yeah, okay, yeah go ahead, all right, I, don't want to talk over anybody. Yeah I think we should I could ask Naomi. It seems like yeah. It seems like we're inviting some folks anyways, for you know a resolution next month. Maybe we could like say we're thinking about doing. If this is something that we're interested in we're thinking about doing a forum you know, would you maybe be interested in being a speaker because we'll have some folks there already? Who could be speakers? I know Paula mentioned some about somebody from advocates for children, I, think and I know we talked about inviting them. You know back in May, so if we do have some of these folks already coming, I think it would be great to like talk about it. I think that yeah, I'm envisioning this as like a resource virtual resource, obviously virtual resource, fair, that's the audience is for parents and like a Q&A thing, I guess I'd want to know if something like this isn't already in the works so that we're not like just I mean I, don't know, I, guess more right. No, we should find out if there's a need or if it's not, if it's already being done and there's yeah, we don't have to that's fine too, but you know we're since we're talking about it now and I'm just thinking back to the things that we had planned before yeah, but I do think it's a good idea. If it's not being done between all of us, there's people that we can invite and yeah Paul, oh Paula, you know feel free to speak out. You don't have to speak up. We like we don't use the chat box a lot because we just want to have one conversation. Could you just repeat what you had said in the chat box? Yeah I just wanted to share that both ccsc and ccd75. We hold monthly public meetings, just like all the other Cec's do and it's a great way for the public to have access to the special education office. Our speakers vary every month, depending on what the big concern is that particular time, but we recently had John Hammer, who was the executive director for the special education office, and he was able to provide a lot of clarity about the pads and the rads or the program adjustment documents and how they're being utilized and adjusted for our children that we're transitioning into remote because the closing of the building. So that's an additional resource that, if you wanted to share with your community, feel free to do so. I know it's very difficult to send an email to the special education inbox and wait. You know weeks upon weeks for a response, so anything that either, as I said before myself or Grizzle can do through our channels through sitting on these councils. We definitely want to be able to do so and offer that services to you guys and when is the next meeting. Ccsc is December 17th, okay, we're trying to get Josh Wallach. So we'll see, okay, all right, great okay, so we seems like we have a bit of a so. We have some planning to do for our January meeting and there's a lot of resources that have been shared in the chat box on this issue. Okay, is there anything else? So we have some possible resolutions next month and we need to bring in some speakers next month and the possibility of planning a resource fair all next month. Tati did you have something to say: yeah I know, I just had a comment that if you know, if there are you know these monthly meetings that are public and parents can go to and ask questions you know. Maybe this is something that we can help with like outreach to families in our district to make sure they know that those meetings are happening so that they can get cued in. You know more immediately and with like the experts who are going to be there anyways, so yeah I think maybe this is more of like an outreach role that we can play to families in our district to get to those meetings and also with our CB3 social media and stuff. So we should outreach about these other about these meetings, because that's where these parents can you know be directly in contact with these experts is what you're saying right: Tati yeah. Should we still do this resource fair? If it's needed, we could outreach about it too I mean- or maybe you know they can be a guest speaker at our resource. Fair I would say the resource fair would be beneficial because we have a different range of influence. The persons on this committee and like I, mentioned in the chat, there's just some parents who show up to things, but how can we reach the ones that are oblivious to what's going on? You know, and we have ways of in our spheres of influence that we could kind of bring them in I, think it would be worthwhile. Okay, all right is there anything else, hey I know, I. Think. Last month we talked about a few issues. We want to kind of revisit for this coming year, even in the Mississippi okay, before we get into the other issues anything else on this okay, oh yeah, well, you're talking you won't! You want to talk about the other, not this right, Eric right! Yes, okay, just wait! One minute going once going twice! I, don't see any hands raised. Okay, so we're done with this agenda item and now we are what we okay. Before we talk about this old new business, do we have any cab or cc reports? I just want to say thank you for having me I do have to jump off if there's no other questions but I know that, may you have my email along with Tati, so please feel free to share that and I also put it in the chat. But you know in case you didn't see it but definitely reach out. If you need some assistance, you know gathering more resources or if you need someone to come in from advocates for children or include NYC or parent-to-parent, I'm more than happy to make those connections for you, and just you know, thank you for holding the space for your community. Okay. Well, thank you for coming and you know being so helpful tonight. I wish I had more answers, but yes, yeah I know what it's like: yeah: okay, great, okay, Eric Diaz! Oh there you are hi, so okay I just wanted to revisit again the topic for an agenda item. Maybe it's not next month or maybe it is just following up on the lore group. I, don't know if there's been any updates in the district office, if Susan found out any information just to see what they're up to during Covid-19 and that whole thing that we pursued with them to restore to the community because of what happened, I think she was supposed to call we're supposed to talk to the attorney general's office, but I don't think it's been done yet so I'll remind her about it. Okay, excellent sounds good all right. Anything else, okay: if not, then we will have the final vote and vote to adjourn. Does somebody want to make a motion? Okay, so Thomas right, give me a second I'll be right there. Okay, me Larissa David, yes, Erica Shirley, yes, Tatiana, yes, Paul, yes, mighty, yes and Carmen! Yes, was that it yeah it is. Okay can I say one thing may about the thing about a motion to adjourn the chair actually can make motions. What the chair does not want to do is make controversial motions that take sides in any way because you'll lose control, but so, in the interest of when it's obvious that that's the motion to be made, you can just make it. Oh, okay, thank you, yeah cool, okay, all right, then so good night, everyone, oh full Board, is earlier. This look on your calendar. It's a little earlier this month. It's before Christmas and also everyone look out for an email regarding the holiday party. I will be sending something out tonight. So put your thinking, caps on and get your ugly sweaters out of the closet. Okay, all right! Thank you. Okay, bye thanks. Everyone good night.
