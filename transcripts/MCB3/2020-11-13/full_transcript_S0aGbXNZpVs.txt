All right, folks, it is 6:30 we are going going to start the show on the road we're going to go over some zoom stuff. First. So as a reminder, if you have not signed in already for attendance purposes, please open the Chat box and sign in with your name and any affiliation that you'd like to if you have an affiliation with an organization or an agency. Otherwise your name is all we need. We use the chat box for attendance purposes only as well as a way to notify myself and trevor if you are having technical issues with zoom other than that, we do not use chat box for any other purposes. In this committee, some zoom functionality things when the sheet when the screen is being shared, as it is now with our agenda, if you'd like to swap that you just need to go into the upper corner of your screen, and there should be some functionality there for you to swap the screen share or resize the screen share if you'd rather see people's faces, rather than what's being shared on the screen at any given moment after each presentation. The way that our chair typically runs the meeting is, he will take questions and comments from board members. First. At that time we asked the board members only to use the raise hands function to let us know that they want to make a comment or ask a question. After the board members are done. He will ask for questions and comments from members of the public and again we use the raise hands functions for that. If you do not know where the raise hands function is, if you go to the bottom of your screen, where the participants tab, is you just open the participants tab, and that is where you find the raised hands function if you are having trouble finding it just send me something in the chat and I will try to help you. We have a limited view on our screen. So if you try to wave your hand or raise your hand or raise your hand physically, we might not see you as a reminder. Public comment and question is kept to two minutes and we do have a timer that we will time you on, and this meeting is being recorded for open meeting law and I believe I've covered everything trevor. Thank you Michael. Yes, that was excellent as usual, and thanks again for running the zoom portion of this meeting really appreciate it. Also I know that Ryan is taking minutes for us. We appreciate that and Kay is also the vice chair. This is the November edition of Parks Recreation, waterfront and resiliency for CB3.

Thank you! Hopefully we can keep going at that clip next up is the parks manager, update I. Believe tomorrow was on the phone yeah hey good evening, everybody, the first part of Saturday, the Stan Street Playground, is now closed due to the extensive drug activity, we're working with pat to kind of remove all the homeless encampments and drug dealers and addicts out of the park. Unfortunately, they've kind of filtered to the pathways into the front part of Houston, where we're working with Petey and pep to improve the situation over there. Tompkins seward and Sarah D continues to have hairy heavy vandalized vandalism with black lives matter, anti-police graffiti at seward. It's extremely bad. On the essex side and on the library side, sewer parks, the bathhouse it's finally has gas, so it has heat and Corlears Hooks door grinding is expected to open soon this past week we had a successful volunteer project at tompkins and this saturday we're having another one at Sarah D and that's it for the parks. Thank you. Jamal. I've got a very small screen today, so it's a little difficult for me to see the ray's hands a hand from Kay I'll help you out, Trevor, okay, hi Janelle. Thank you. So much I have not seen any black lives matter. Graffiti and Sarah D I could have missed it so maybe offline. We could talk about that I. You know. We've tried to get the MTA plywood barricade to. Let us paint and I think one of the ways you stop Graffiti is to ask people to do something that honors that movement. So maybe we could talk Offline and vis-a-vis. The you know. The folks who are struggling with addiction in the park would be good to have to ask the park to the commissioner to come again and do another meeting, perhaps so that we could our community effort together and have they been reaching out to goddard homeless outreach who's. That has the contract for here. The police and pep I think they've been I. Think they've been going through the park kind of I mean I'm seeing an increase over by Sarah d, the hester hub office in the in the track area over there, it's very bad. That's where usually the graffiti starts at. We found a lot under central communications, which is the yeah right before the pit right before you have the the bird sanctuary, but we've been doing a good job of cleaning up as quickly as possible yeah, but it's not as bad as tompkins and soda are very bad. Okay, thanks so much to mel no problem. Thank you jamal any other questions from committee members. Yeah I had raised my hand, I do not know if they saw it. Hi Jamal I would like to know why Lillian World Playground is being closed during the week. It was always open, I mean always, and suddenly it's closed during the weekend, only open on weekends, so just to correct things. Lillian, Wald and Lillian Dewald are both jops said they should be closed during the day. I have staff going out at 3:30 reopening the park for the public, so those sites are def are closed for school purposes during the day, so typically from I would say seven to about 3:30 it's closed for school at 3:30 we have a crew that goes around and we open up reopens all the Jlp sites. No, they have not been opened at all, they're not opened until Saturday and Sunday. That's it. I have a special crew. I mean I'll, ask them now, but they should be good. They usually go out about 3:30 4 o'clock, I'm not sure what time they get to the site, but they do all of district 3 to reopen all the sites, because one of the issues we're having also is we're not getting the cooperation with DOE to reopen the sites at 3:30. right I do not think they are opening them up because I walk my dogs about four o'clock and it's not open. You know so. Typically they probably get to that one after fall, but I'll touch base with them and see if we can push it up earlier. I would appreciate it. Thank you not a problem, one last question, and this is related to a later topic- we're going to discuss, but most of the parks have an opening and closing time correct and you open and close most parks in district 3. Yes. Well, we have. We have a list of parks from the commission that he wanted to leave open, so we have some parks that should be staying open all day, but I'm talking about at this particular time in the evening. So yours, usually our lock-up crew, goes out at five o'clock. We lock up the bathrooms at five and then they go around starting to lock up all the playgrounds. So most of the playgrounds in our district are physically closed at some at some time during the evening, I would say between 6:30. Yes, they start to get locked up around then right. But okay, that's enough information on that particular thing. Any other questions from committee members there's no other hands up all right. Thank you. Jamal all right, you're welcome. Next up is the monthly update from DDC on the ESCR project. Keep in mind that this particular update and this team has come before CB3 every single month for the last few years. So this is just an update. We're not going to get into a lengthy discussion about everything that's going on. We just try and keep it to an update. So we can move this meeting along Michael I believe they're going to screen, share or you're going to screen share I. Have it so I do not know Q. What's your plan, can you hear me? Yes, hi desiree Gazzo on this list here, she's going to share her screen. If you can give her access, sorry I failed too, but you know earlier. Thank you accepted I, just chatted, you too, okay, thank you should have access now, always a last-minute thing. I'm used to it with you. Yes, cute. It's always last minute. I'll leave something last minute right does not ryan I, get it too, as quick as I can. But it's always last one it's the nature of this project. We can't help it anymore at this point. Sorry anyway, so hi everybody, Q and Miri with Ddc's culture, Resiliency unit, as Trevor mentioned, our monthly update here, I just wanted to kick it off and I'm going to hand it off to our Pmcm consultant team here, desiree, John and Mike with Ulti cover, but I wanted to talk about this slide in the after this. So this is sort of our table of contents. If you will for tonight, I'm sure almost everybody at this point is aware: we've been getting a lot of requests to share the soil test data and for those who are members of the cag that we had the meeting last week. Tuesday and any of you folks who listened in as part of the live stream on Facebook I, do want to acknowledge that I did not really clearly address the questions. Last week, unfortunately, and I should have clarified these points that are up here, that you see on this slide and the that will show so the soil test data, it's all included in the eis. That's up on the website that went through, obviously a very exhaustive process in public review period. We included the links in this presentation that this, obviously this presentation will go up on the website as usual, but wanted to make sure everybody's aware and just remind folks of that, all the information that was found during the project, design and environmental review process. The all of that is including this Eis document in the different chapters and I'll expand on that a little more on the also the same type of information is going to be included in mass mailings, so mass mailings is in case you're, not aware of the DDC standard practice. We issue this sort of package of information that we hand off to the contractor. We issue that to the elected officials to the community boards to stakeholder groups it's publicly available and that package includes the construction drawings. A lot of the information that's in the eis and namely the soil test. Data is also included in that so mass mailing one, I'm sorry the project area, two mass mailing, which is in the again CB6 district, that mass meeting already got issued because the contractor has been registered and awarded and we're moving forward with that piece of the project, so that mass mailing and that information has already been provided and project area. One when in this district is going to be the mastermind for this, the project area, one is going to be issued once we have the contractor registered and we're sort of predicting that's going to fall somewhere around January February of next year, when we can issue that sort of mass mailing package and that would include the soil test data for the project area, one stretch which also includes the park and coming up in the s. We have a couple of updates on the website. We'll show you and we'll show you the project area, one in project area, two construction schedule updates and our consultant Trang Bui will talk about section three and Nwb goals and again that's a pretty technical arena that she's been helping us, try to communicate and clarify what the goals are and what our plans are to meet them and there's been a lot of questions with the community members and also with the amongst ourselves too internally. So we tried to work through the slides that a lot of them that were presented previously but try to expand that and work through it to make it a little more simplified and be able to clearly answer the questions. So Trang is going to talk about that and obviously, if there are any questions after that, we can discuss it tonight and we can come back again next month with more details. That's right, the please! So this is just a quick reminder of, what's included in the environmental impact statement. That's up on the website. The links are there: the chapters are referenced there and I just wanted to remind everybody that a lot of the soil test information is included in there and again. Mass mailing package for project area one and for these river park will be submitted to community board three and all the elected officials and stakeholder groups and everybody. So those that's once we get the contractor submit registered, we submit that package to the contractor, and that goes out to the public. So with that, I'm going to hand it off to desiree and Hmcd lira folks they'll take over and we can take questions afterwards, thanks, Q Trevor. Can you hear me? Okay, good great I see the heads nanny. Thank you hi everyone once again, desiree gazzo from h, TV liro for the community engagement I just wanted to let everyone know that we do have some website updates. If you have not been to the revised website, you should definitely check it out. We have a new page where we introduce our Pa2 Community construction liaison. We have posted the construct. The first construction notice for Pa2 we've updated some of our work with Us resources. We have a link right on the home page to the New York, City parks, neighborhood, recreation resources, and we will shortly be updating our faqs with some of the questions that we've been receiving from stakeholders and from the community. We're looking to take some of the frequently asked questions and add them to the website, so that information is more accessible to everyone, so just kind of going off of what I just said: the New York City parks, neighborhood recreation resources is right on the front page there and it links to the parks website and there's a map and there's some information about recreational activities. You know throughout the city: okay, desiree, I'm up right. Yes, good evening, everyone, I'm John Lynch, I'm the construction manager for the Pa2 contract working for DDC, and so what I'm going to do is just quickly go through the project. Pa2 I introduce our Ccl Nadine Harris and then she'll hand it off to Mike pridgey to talk about pa1. This is just the overview. You've seen a bunch of times of the four projects in the ESCR portfolio. You go to the okay, so this is what what desiree was talking about. The construction start advisory can be accessed on the on the web. We've been handing them out in the neighborhood, and the rccl nadine who will speak in a bit has been on site this week. You can go to the so this is just you know: we've been showing this slide in various forms, so right now the Pa2 contract. We have a notice to proceed, Monday the 16th, so that's coming up. So once that happens, excuse me once that happens, we'll start construction on the site and we would be starting an aster liby playground and the area just north of Stycov Park, where the solar one facility is so with that I want to introduce Nadine Harris, our Ccl hi everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. John I'm, the community liaison I will be actually on the site once the construction begins. I will be there as much as possible. I know that there is. We are leaving a special time, but I'll be I'll, make sure I'm there at least four days a week at least so. Anyone that needs to get in contact with me will be able to see me on the side. I have been going to to the neighborhood walking talking over to people and form them and hitting out informations of the upcoming project. So if anyone wants my informations, please drive or you can give them info again. I'm the team here is the construction he's on for Pa2 Project Hey dean. If you're going to, if you're going to speak, some more you're going to need to speak up because we can barely hear you can barely hear me, I'm sorry about that. I thought. I thought you guys were able to hear me. I'm sorry! No I was saying that I have been on the side for a couple weeks now I've been walking around and talking to people and handing out some flyers about the upcoming project next week. So I was just saying: if you guys are welcome to pass on my information as well to the community. They can contact me call me emailing me if they need any information on the project and nadine. If you can put your contact information in the chat to me and then I'll send it out to everybody else through the chat. Okay, I'll. Do that all right! Thank you. You're welcome! Thank you. This is. This is cue again thanks nadine, for that I just want to highlight that nadine is our designated Ccl for the project area, 2 sort of again Community Board 6Th district, since that one. That piece is starting construction first and once we go in to project area, one the contractor gets selected and sometime towards the end of this year, when they come on board into early next year. We'll have the designated Ccl for this particular district that will introduce and make sure that everybody has access to so and again. I know a lot of folks, it's easier for us to determine between project areas, one and two and where to draw those lines, and it's not as easy for many of the community members, but just a rule of thumb. You can think about community Board, sixth district versus Community Board, three district. Each one of these two areas will have their own separate ccls, but also want to mention that all of our ccls will be obviously very tightly connected and coordinated with each other. So they can get information across and make sure that your the community folks are being connected to the right person and right source just wanted to highlight that a little bit cute just for clarification, you're saying that the ccl that is particularly assigned to Community Board 3 will probably be on board at the end of December, beginning of January, most likely early next year. January time frame sometime in that area, yeah I do not think we'll have that ready for the December presentation to see the cv3 okay, yeah I just wanted to make sure that it was clear because I understand that nadine will be able to obviously handle questions from the entire project era, although more focused on Pa2 and that the ccl for Cv3 will probably come on board early to Mid-January. Yes, thank you. Hi can I ask a question. Then nadine you said you were giving out some flyers. Yes, so where is the vicinities that you've been giving flyers out at the park? The Asa Levy Park around them by the gas station, so I walk around the buildings across the Avenue sea, so I've been talking and just I. Also yeah I also went inside of the facilities around the neighborhood and did not just sending them out to people. Okay, I thought it was in my area. Thank you. Where is your area by my basketball city? But let's do this. No I thought it was my area. Okay, forget it I tried to. Let me just stay, I'm trying to do this right here. I'm sorry yeah, sorry! So let me just better clarify here. So again, nadine is being introduced tonight. Just to let everybody know that our first ccl for the project is on board. But again her designated area is for Community, Board, sixth district for community boards, three districts, the river park, Basketball City area, all that whole area, which falls under project area one. We do not have a ccl, yet that person will come on board in the next couple of months sometime in January. So but again out of courtesy. We just wanted to make sure that everybody is aware, because I know a lot of communities. Community members join different Community Board meetings and across sort of check each different areas. So right now the advisory desiree. Can you go back to the advisory slide? Please one so yeah, so this advisory just got issued and distributed this week to Community Board six, the elected officials to the public and nadine has been tremendously helpful, with posting this or getting this out to the community members, but it's all focused and community Board, sixth district, around Skytown area and Cyprus and Coke Park area, sorry and that northern piece of our project, so your area is coming in sometime in January, we're not there yet. Okay. Well, now, I see a slew of handrails and committee members, but I'm going to ask those folks to hold those hands until we finish this presentation. It was one initially we're up to about four. So let's continue the presentation. First thanks nadine sure, anytime, so we're going to hand it off to Mike pudgy now to discuss project area, one yeah thanks desiree good evening, everyone. This is my first opportunity to come meet you folks, I have my position here is exactly the same as John Lynch's who's, the construction manager up north in Pa2, I'm the construction manager for pa1 and I'll be joining your meeting every month to give you an update on the project as things progress for those who are unaware. The slide that we're looking at now shows the limits of pa1, which goes from Montgomery Street in the south up these 14th street in the north. Please. This is very similar to a slide that John showed earlier to give an idea as to where we are in the process right now. Pa one is under bid. We're expecting bids to be received a week from tomorrow, and the bids will then be opened. The following Monday, that's our real progress is that we're kind of coming to the end to of our advertisement and bid process with like I, said bids due next Thursday be open the following Monday. What follows that is the contract registration period, which is a internal city process which begins immediately and will probably extend till sometime late January early February, please. What we would like to point out is one. The one of the things that will occur now is that East Road park will remain open for the rest of this year with the first closures of the park, probably beginning sometime in mid to late February of next year. Please so that's kind of where we are with pa1. We should have a lot more concrete information for you next week as we'll have open bids and have an idea who the contractor is, and at that point I'm going to turn this back to desiree. Thank you Mike. Thank you for that. Sorry, it's q again, I'm jumping in and throwing people off. Sorry back to the previous slides desiree. So I just wanted to also clarify here that there's been a number of questions and a couple, publications that the project is delayed and I want to emphasize here that, like I did at the Cag meeting last week that our project is not delayed. We are moving forward with the project schedule with the project funding that's in place and committed everything is moving forward as we have planned. This particular piece of the puzzle here that you see in project area, one with the East River Park area. The bid period for this area got extended by a few weeks to allow quality time for the contractors to review and get their bids in and typically with some projects at DDC, we build in some cushion to be able to sort of estimate and predict for those kind of events, and that's what happened here. So our bids submission date got extended and we are our construction. I'm sorry. Our contract registration period is just a few weeks later than what we had anticipated. So that does not mean the project is delayed. We're still going to deliver the project based on the same schedule that we have. The final deadline is the final deadline and everybody's moving ahead. So I just want to clarify that. To make sure everybody's aware, the project area 2, which always was planned to go first in construction, is moving forward this month and this piece of project area 1 is coming right after. Thank you. Thank you. So this is just a quick reminder. We've had this slide up previously. The community outreach that occurs during construction. When we have community updates, we notify the elected officials. Then we notify community Board and the Cag, then there's a series of public notifications through the Ccl, through social media, through email, blasts and flyers, etc. And then you know the notification continues throughout construction to the end of construction, and during that time we give ongoing updates at community boards and cad meetings and throughout. All of this is the ongoing section, 3 and mwbe outreach. I know there was a question about that at the cag, so we're looking to help address some of those questions here with the S that Trang is going to take over thanks desiree. Can everyone hear me? Yes, great so again, I'm trying bui owner of bowie studio and we're in mwb firm and section 3 business. This is just following up on the previous slide, with the ongoing section 3 and Mwb Outreach. We are in the early stages of the project, so you're not seeing a lot of visibility in terms of being on the ground with actual events and outreach, but just to go through the sequence of how the program progresses. So the section three requirements have been determined that they apply here, because the projects are funded by HUD and then the Mwb eagles are established by the agency, and the city has committed to 25 mwb utilization and with the initial bids for both consultants and contractors. These goals are included in the bid documents and it's in it by responding to these bids, there's an acknowledgement that the consultants and the contractors are aware of them and they will be working to meet those requirements. So right now we're at the selection of consultants and contractors for the initial phase. So the liro and hntb team have been on board for a while and then the contractors are joining us shortly and at this point this is where we would have known based on the bid responses, whether the teams that have bid on the project are either already in compliance with these goals, because they've assembled a team that meet the requirements or that they know that they will need to hire in the future, whether in its individuals or subcontracting opportunities, and this is our chance where we would be giving them on the initial meetings. As we will be doing with the contractor. In the next couple of weeks, we will review what the goals are. Look at, what their plans for staffing and subcontracting opportunities are. If there are any and then start monitoring their goals based on what they they've submitted to us for their plans and then, as the project progresses, we'll be monitoring to see if they're on track with what they've proposed or if they need help with additional resources, or they need to do some remediation to catch up with their numbers. So based on feedback from previous meetings. I think we need to drill down a little more on the section three requirements and I think everyone in the past has been focused on the 30 of new hires, our section three individuals, but there are two other components of the section three goals and the first one is for non-construction related contracts. Three percent of the total dollar values need to go to section three businesses and on the construction side it's ten percent of the total dollar amount of contracts and then the higher the new hires applies to all of the parties that are involved on their project. And it's important to note that the HUD regulation is not an entitlement program. So there are no guarantees. There is a preference for section three individuals and businesses, but the caveat there is that they need to demonstrate the ability and the capacity to perform the work, and we will work with all of the contractors and individuals and local stakeholders and other local, recruiting and employment organizations to make sure that we give the opportunities that are there, including training for any upcoming opportunities. Yep, just real, quick, so yeah thanks, Trang hi everyone. This is ophelia so just to add to that. Yes, there's a lot of people in this meeting, so I do not know, I'm not sure if everyone understands or knows who you are. Oh. Okay, sorry about that. Oh this is ophelia rivas from DDC hi. Everyone I, just wanted to add tranquility mentioned in section 3- is not required. It's a goal. However. We are committed to meeting these goals and will push to fill the quota that we said for section three requirements and we'll be working with Trang. That's what we brought her along on the team so that we can make sure we reach our goals. So we understand it's important to the community, so we'll do our due diligence and also work with elected officials to push to reach this goal. Sorry Tren go ahead. Sure I think we're on to the so this is just a visual representation of what we were just talking about so right now we're on the verge of meeting with the contractor to talk through their plan, look at any hiring and subcontracting opportunities moving forward and then as needed in the next step. We'll take a look at what types of positions that and subcontracting opportunities there might be and then we'll tailor our outreach to find those individuals and also look at the existing pool of candidates or just local training groups, to see if there's anything that we could add in preparation for future work and contracting opportunities. And then the compliance will continue both so that we could report to DDC and then there's also an annual report to HUD on our activities and at the previous meetings. There's been some questions on the exact definitions of what a section three, how a section three resident is defined and the qualifications for section three business concern and there are three different ways to for a business to qualify as a section, 3 business concern. And then there, the section 3 resident determination is based on income calculated either by individual income or based on household income. And then more details are actually on the slide here with how firms could actually register with NYCHA and also with HUD as a section three business. And then they could start getting on lists for contractors and other interested parties to to reach out to when they have opportunities. And then it's also a good resource for section three residents to also look so then they could look at who who's on the list in their area and who could be potentially hiring section. Three individuals as well I, think you've seen this before with our typical outreach events and communications and strategies for going out to the industry. One of the questions we received was about just general outreach to mwbes and DDC has an office of diversity and industry relations and their mailing list, along with coordinating with this department of small business services, is pretty comprehensive, with getting all of the getting opportunities out to the mwb forms that are on their list and if anyone has ever met all right and if anyone has ever downloaded information from Ddc's procurement website, then you're also in within their system, to receive notifications in your inbox from Ddc's procurement opportunities. So that's another way to just start getting familiar with opportunities with the agency and also being able to look at. Who else has expressed interest in the project and those are additional teaming opportunities, and then we've separated some of the information you've seen before into section 3 resources and mwb resources and a lot of the faqs on HUD and section three requirements are under the section three resources and that could be very helpful with giving specific examples for you and New. York City also has its own faq section for explaining what programs and how contractors are reporting out the opportunities, as well as agencies, responsibilities. And then this is a list of events that the first one is the statewide mwbe virtual forum and that's coming up in early December and then hntb has finished their three-part Webinar Series and that's now posted on the website as well and NYCHA has their events calendar with various events and training and resources for employment. So again, all of this information is available on the ESCR website and if you go there we'll be updating our information as opportunities and positions come up with as the product project progresses, I think we're ready for Q&A. Okay, thank you. Trying I see three committee members. First of all, thank you for that presentation. I think we all have a pretty thorough lesson on section three requirements: it's probably the first at parks and waterfront, but it's nice to understand how this process works. Let's start my screen is smaller but I see case hand, so I'll start with K. First thanks. Thank you. Thanks for the presentation, I just wanted to ask you to put in the chat the website for the soil test results that you mentioned Michael's already put in. Oh, he did yeah I heard somebody went there and could not find it there. So in fact he put up two links: they're links to Pdfs they're, linked to pdf chapters from the eis, oh okay, I, guess, I, guess, yeah and they're also do it three times. Sorry they're also included, and so back to that very first slide that we showed in the second slide or the second slide. It's I included the links in there too. So when we post this, it's all the same website links but we'll circulate this again too. Thank you. Next up is that wow yeah, I'm coming. I'm sorry two things there were several articles, I think you somewhat addressed it the fact that about delays, there were two articles that people sent me that there were delays and then, when I, look at the September 10th zoom that you did here, the community engagement page, which has the timeline I, have to say it's a little difficult to follow. So I think that people get a little nervous when they see in the paper that there's a delay and knowing that the funding has some time. You know some time constraints and so I do not know. But I think that one thing that might be good is something a little simpler for people to see the the timeline so that if they read someplace else, if there's a delay, they do not get nervous. You know so that that's one comment. The other comment is in terms of this section: three employment, one of the things that states is that for most construction sites you need a 10 hour construction course, and someone just said that you're offering training. So do you offer training for this 10 hour construction course? That's generally needed and that's one question. The other question is that it's basically to public housing residents and other low and very low income residents. How are you doing outreach to public housing residents and very low and low you know and other low and very low income residents in our district? How are you going to do the outreach so that people know about this and know about any training that would help prepare them. So valentino, thanks for that feedback- and this goes for everybody out there too, board members and everyone else. If there's any of these slides in the area that we can simplify or clarify as far as presentation the format anything yet. Definitely please let us know this is very helpful and appreciate that valentino for bringing that up desiree, maybe you can just fast forward quickly to that green bubble, slide that we have for project area one and in the Appendix of this presentation we have what we presented in the past, that big schedule slides that I think Valentina you might be referring to that. That's very complicated and sort of confusing to follow and break it down. So this slide that you see here was our attempt at watering that down to very simple steps and more details is included in that other one, but also the delay that was sort of publicized in those articles were I. Think that's right. Maybe the sorry 2016. I think those got published after this slide, particularly when we said that the park is remaining open for the rest of the year. I think some folks took that as the project is delayed and is not starting until the early next year, and that's not the case so just want to clarify that your questions on section three that you just had the other two or three questions Trang. Would you be able to clarify those, or is this something that we should come back with details next time? I do not know? No, that's fine! Actually, desiree. Can you go to the typical outreach event in communications, so I'll take the training question. First, just as a normal course of bringing on new staff and consultants, the team would usually offer in-house training for 10 hour OSHA, if that's required, for the team members to be on site. If they do not already have it, so we've done that in the past, with Mwb firms or any anyone, that's on the team that would need it, and it's my understanding also that some of the local organizations are already doing that as well. I know part of the lower East side, employment network, I, think good old, lower East side. I think has been mentioned in the past, that they usually offer OSHA 10. But we'll look at all of the local resources see what's out there and then we could expand that or complement that, depending on what the need of our program is and in terms of outreach to section three individual low and very low income, individuals will start with existing resources on the ground and that's the NYCHA reese offices, but also with small business services workforce one and in higher NYC. They have experience with helping with recruitment of low-income individuals and trying to hire locally. So those are starting places for us, but we can also post with other stakeholders, whether it's other local nonprofits elected officials. If you're going to have town halls community meetings, we will post it on our escrow website, but if there are other suggestions of where else we can be posting our information or participate in some of your events for community information, where we're willing to help out and participate wherever we can I guess my one. My one point there would be that they be posted in the various nature developments down here, because my nephew lives in Ruckus, and you know, there's always things posted when you walk in the building and so I think it would be good if you had it posted in the buildings in NYCHA, so that you know the young guys can know that. There's that this is available. I think it would be really good if you could do you know the NYCHA developments down here on in district 3. Thank you, val, and I'm going to follow up quickly before I go to Robin on that I think it boils down to the question of if I'm an individual who is either in NYCHA or low income. What do I need to do to be able to work on this project? I, think a lot of projects have come in this district and it's been sort of hard to look at those metrics to see if it's actually working so I know. You mentioned that you're willing to sort of partner with other groups or agencies on the ground, but I'm hoping that we get some type of job fair just for this particular project where people can go to, even if it is virtual in this new Covid-19 environment we live in because I think a lot of opportunities are missed. It's weak nycha's, a little easier because you can put them in the lobbies of buildings that can target young men and young women, but the other low-income folks who are spread it throughout the district are a little more difficult to reach and I we're sort of straying from our lane in the parks about helping people get jobs, but I think it's important and I do not know how what that fair might look like, but I think it's something to think about. You know I think the other thing would be to post in stores, because we tend to use the stores down here. The bodegas any place is selling. What is these lottery tickets? You know they're generally, a line outside those stores, so I think the stores would be another good place to target, especially those two stores on Ruckus Street, because there's, usually you know, crew folks hanging out there anyway. I think that you know sounds good trying. If you have no further comments, I'm going to go to the next question. No thank you for all the feedback. We will definitely keep all of those in mind and also learn, as we watch more virtual matchmaking forums for Mwb firms and trying to connect virtually we'll, definitely look into those options and see where we can take them right, because I'd really like to see you know this sort of story of where you take one individual who does not have a job and has no experience who lives in a neighborhood and follow that person from wanting to get a job and see them work on the project itself. That'd be really nice. If we could get a couple, individuals like that next up is robin yeah hi. Thanks for the presentation, I have two comments or one for trying I guess you know, aside from the traditional kind of jobs that you're looking to fill, I'm just also thinking about all the ancillary things that might pop up all the food vendors who might pop up and service the construction workers, and is there any way you guys are going to monitor that? Or is that just a free-for-all, and is that also comes through sort of recruiting community people? For that? That's just something. I'm thinking I just thought about I want to get also just mention ask about the CB3 going back to the postering and firing that took place up near astrolevi. If there's it sounded to me like there's some equipment being brought in that's going to be affecting a little bit of that Waterfront area. Is that right and I just think it's important that it does not the people just in that community are not should not only be told, but the rest of us should be told. There's bike lanes that all of us use you know a lot of CB3 people use the bike lanes and the bike paths and the parks. So in thinking about how you do your ccl, letting people know what's happening. I think it'd be important for that to happen in both districts, not just in one district I. Think, that's a that's more of a question or a comment for Q yeah, hi, Robin, I, absolutely agreed and noted the project area 2 advisory went out to all the elected officials and trevor I just want to confirm with you that I think your office have received that as well. My office has not but I believe the Cbc office may have oh well, Cv3 so I mean I'll, be all checking with Susan but yeah. So this is the we'll try to blast out these advisories to everybody I. Just we we're trying to figure out what the best way is to handle this, because there are two separate sections and you see us kind of going back and forth with Pa1 Pa2. These little abbreviations and I always tried to clarify pb6 district cv3 districts and I want to make sure that when we issue an advisory, that's outside of your district, it does not get confused that it's happening in your district. So this advisory, this first initial construction activity, that's had that's going to happen coming up soon, the ccl that we have nadine right now. All of this is for the CB6 district, but robin you're right. There's the bike lane there there's a the green graph, there's shared infrastructure and amenities between the two districts, so we'll take that back and be sure that everybody's notified, but make sure that it's clear clarified for everybody. Thanks for that, you're welcome! Thank you carolyn! Yes, all right, I live between b and c everybody on my blog that has a car utilizes Avenue C, which goes into 14th street and goes up that little highway, the FDR between 14th and 25th street to enter into the FDR going north. So I would like to recommend that you have notices sent to all the block associations in the neighborhood, because I'm sure that my block is not the only block like that people utilize that area with cars with walking with trying to access the ferry at 18th street. So it would be really nice to be kept abreast of what's happening and what is available and what's not cute, you can get. You can get a list of those block associations from the Community Board office. Also, okay! Well, the we'll note that I'll check back with desert and we'll reach out to you. Thank you because it also impacts on bus lanes as well, and is the bus route going to be changed because of that, because the m9 goes up to 20th street on that FDR frontage road and turns goes through Peter, Cooper and Steintown between Peter Cooper and skytown to first avenue. It's a major route for a lot of people, particularly trying to access bill view. So yeah be aware of that, and you know you need to keep people informed about how what changes is going to be made right and as far as we know, right now, I do not think any of the bus routes are being impacted, but John Bench and D.O.T colleagues are on the call feel free to jump in if I'm missing anything here, but any of those sort of traffic pattern intersection bus routes, any impact to anything like that will definitely have to be coordinated and approved by D.O.T, with our pmcn contractor, all of all of them coordinated so we'll be sure to, and that's the point of these advisories, so the advisor that we just showed on the web on this presentation. That's that will be a typical templates or style of advisory that you can expect to see for the duration of this project, and you can expect to see a lot of those coming out with details on bus routes or intersections or sidewalks or anything that's going to be impacted. All of that will come out right, but the other thing that you have to realize is a lot of people exit on Houston Street to come up, Avenue C, to circumvent traffic on the FDR and go to the frontage road at 14th street to re-enter into the traffic stream that goes into the FDR. It also goes across to crosstown on 20th street. So at any rate, how are you going to notify people about that? Because that's not just our neighborhood phil I think what we're hearing, because I want to sort of wrap up. This particular section is that, although we have two different project areas, a lot of things that may happen in the other project area may affect our particular district. So I think when these advisories are issued, that we need to carefully think about if it should go to both districts. I know it's a lot of information and people are going to get confused, as we even saw on this particular Zoom meeting, but I think it I think that's the probably the safest bet just to make sure everyone is informed about. What's going on, I understand what carolyn is saying about? You know bus routes or bike routes or even pedestrian traffic, because it's a border that you know we share that just might be easier to give us more information right, absolutely agreed and that's what robin just brought up too and I totally agree with you and that's. That is our strategy, and maybe I was not clear. This advisory that went out this week is specifically for astrolevy playground and the area around solar one on the northern end of Stuyvesant cove park. So there's no impact to the traffic patterns or to project area one to CB3 disc, like there is no impact to anything outside of those two components for this particular first step, but as we move forward and anything in any area that is going to have impacts to a wider group of community members or stakeholders or business owners, and it totally agreed and noted that would be a wider outreach and publication to everybody. Yes, all right, you would also need signage on the FDR, because, as I said, we have a lot of people who exit on Houston Street. The FDR come up avenue, seed to enter into that frontage road that goes up by 23rd street, which is by asser levy and by the solar one park that is. Have you looked at the traffic there? Recently, it's really pretty intense carolyn I think he understands and any traffic going forward that, just because it's one particular area where people might exit may affect them, but I think there's an understanding that any type of advisories will go out throughout the community and not just for one particular area with this particular advisory. It's only for the playground itself and the solar one facility, not necessarily affecting traffic, but going forward I think there's an understanding that they will provide us. Information on the industry causes my neighbors as there was a large number of trucks on Avenue, D and 10th street that she assumed had something to do with the proposed construction that the trucks were feeding into that. So, at any rate, it is something that impacts on our neighborhood a lot and there needs to be again. Let me let me just clarify again: our construction has not started. Our construction is starting in project area to Community, Board sixth district, with the first advisor that just went out a few days ago and we'll we we're taking your feedback and we'll definitely be sure to inform everybody of any sort of closures, any impacts to any sidewalk any street, any home, any business that that's definitely our first priority. It's the first priority of our ccls, who are standard practice with our agency, and we have a very large project management, pro program management, construction, Management, group, Pmc and who are here with a very large team behind them to make sure that everybody's being informed of every detail in the most accurate way that we can. So if you see trucks out there right now, that's not our project. If you see closers out there do not assume it's our project. If you see a contractor walking around in the park, that is not our project. We do not have a contractor. Yet these are all points that have come up in the past few months in the past couple months that we've received questions and feedback that the esker the e-cycles resiliency contractor, is walking around on the park and they're going to close it down. That is not our project. We do not have a contractor just yet and if you do have any kind of question like that, please feel free to reach out to myself. Ophelia rivas from our communications group is here. We have a whole host of other colleagues from other agencies that are on this call and you have all of our emails if you do not happy to provide it. But if you have any question, please just reach out to us and ask us if it's true or not or if there's something that we can clarify and I just want to encourage the web blogs social media. These platforms, it's easy to get wrapped up in conversations. That may not be clear so everything that we present to you at every month that we come and obviously trevor and everybody else can attest to that all this time that we spend here. This is the most up-to-date, the most accurate information that we have at the moment, and we promise to come back every month with more advisories and notifications issued in between to the elected officials, offices to the cv, the CB folks and everybody else to make sure you're all getting the information that is accurate and that's up to date all right. Thank you, sorry, Trevor! Thank you just that real quickly! Caroline, we understand you know your community safety D.O.T definitely does put up signage anytime. They change their traffic patterns. The colleague my colleagues like T, can speak up to that as well, and if you ever, if the community or you ever have questions, of course you can reach out to us, but also we have the web inquiry tool which you submit your questions on our website and then we get back to you. So you know always if there's questions feel free. We have multiple venues where you can submit your questions. The last time I submitted a question and asked about the soil sample. I was told I had to FOIL it I. Okay, so I do not know who you spoke to no I did not speak. I entered it on your website, a request for the soil samples and what I the response that I got was that I had to do a FOIL in order to get it okay? Well again, that this is q again, so my apologies that I mishandled this at the Cag meeting last week. We were not clear with this previously and I'm apologizing about that, but I hope what we, the information that we provided tonight addresses that and we can move forward, because that's the information that we have that's what's been publicized. It's all on the website from the Eis, the environmental Impact statement and happy to dig deeper into that into that document and provide more details if needed, all right. Thank you. We're going to move on and we have some other questions and we spent quite a bit of time on that last topic. Are there any other committee questions we're next to the move to community board members and I? See Lisa Kaplan has her hand raised yeah very briefly. I just wanted to mention that with regard to Mwbe and section three, there's a community-based employment network in the neighborhood, the lower East side, employment network and lovingly known as lesson, and they have been working hand in very closely with the Essex Crossing project and they've had very good results. Reasonably good results anyway, with regard to community outreach and hiring so I think it would be really important for you to use that mechanism that it's a group made up of the not-for-profits, the settlement, houses and other community-based organizations that have direct contact with low-income and NYCHA residents, and if you do not have that contact information, the community board can provide it. Yes. Well, thank you, we're they're on the list and I've already spoken with Henry Street settlement, who I think is the lead group in that network and and we've had initial discussions about how this will move forward in terms of okay, that's it and how to get all the information to them. Yep all right, thank you, Lisa for bringing that out. We have I, do not know if Michael's on present moment. Okay, I do not think we need to clock laser questions, but I really want to keep this okay all right. So just let me know if we get to the point of where it gets a little long. I think there are only two questions from people who are not other participants, so I see three. So I'm going to start with Lewis K I believe he had his hand raised First, Louis K, that's how your name reads so I have to I understand. Thank you. Trevor I might have misunderstood something, but I'm a question regarding notifications and updates and whatever, when you send out the updates to the Community board. Do you also include all of the folks who have registered for information on your website? Yes, thanks. This is Q again DDC and desiree. You can expand too if needed, yeah. So we have a very long database of community members who have signed up either through the design phase that we went through or just recently through this inquiry tool that we have so yes, there will be. These advisors will be blasted out to that database to all those emails, as well as the electeds and CBS and the local community groups that are out there. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Lewis Tommy hi. You mentioned that the negotiations have been extended with the bids on project area. One number one, I'm wondering if you could let us know how many contractors have bid on project area one and secondly, in these extensions, have there been any negotiations or changes that we should know about with the contractors with the plan, since the original bid was submitted. So we had it's not a negotiation and we have not received any bids just yet we're receiving the bids. Next week, as Mike said, Mike I think you said it's a day a week from tomorrow yeah it's next Thursday. The bids are due next Thursday. Next Thursday there you go so you said: you've been talking with them and answering questions, so I'm wondering how many bidders have you been answering questions too? Well, it's hard to say, because we just respond to questions that any of these contractors send to us. We do not know how many are out there that are interested. This is this bit. Is a public document on the website that anybody, for example, project there anybody could have been on yeah you. This is John. I, do not know. I do not know John. If you want to explain, I can jump in for a second so for project area, one so for project area, two we're about to start construction Monday for project area, one we have not taken the bids. Yet there were six firms that pre-qualified for that contract and during the course of them putting their bids together. They have a bunch of questions, so we have not actually taken bids we'll take bids a week from tomorrow, so the contractor has not yet been selected. So those questions came from the interested parties of firms that actually made the effort to pre-qualify with DDC to be able to bid on the project. So it's kind of a two-step procurement. First, you select the six contractors that you'll allow to bid, and then they ask questions during the bid phase after the initial drawings go out to them. Does that clarify your question? I hope, yeah and just one other thing on the signage, even if it's as Olivi park, which you're slated now to begin soon, you always put up large signs, and rather than relying on somebody handing out a couple of flyers, why are not there large signs, as with every other construction park, whether it's ghulic or any other project, that the parks Department in the city does? Where are those signs? Why are not they up yet the contractors have been approved so for okay, so the contractor was approved for Pa2 and that's what Q was talking about for Astra Levy, Stifle, Park, North area that was approved, pa1 still not approved, so there's no signs up the signs for Pa2 will go up so typically when the fence goes up, that's when they put the large like typical DDC. This project is happening in this area and it tells people like the name of the project. What exactly the you know, the location of the project and then the list like the mayor, the local elected officials, so those signs will be coming up. The issue is again the contractor everything will happen since for Pa2 Ntp is November 16th. So until then, no signs can go up for the project yet so we have to wait, but all those signs that definitely we're to have signage to go up to show the community. This is where this project is. This is what this project is all right. Thank you. Felix next up is Daniel hi. All right, I just wanted to comment on something that is omitted from this update and that's still the lack of open space and green space mitigation that, as this project is getting closer to being started that we do not have I went. I was a part of the transportation Committee of Cv3 media I was at it on Tuesday and they presented a bike lane for Avenue C. That does not connect above and below the project to the greenway, and it's not adequate for casual bike, riders, runners and and casual walkers in the park. So I'm hoping that they can update us soon on that. Thank you. Thank you Daniel before you answer that I understand that was presented to the transportation committee and that's the appropriate committee, but if at next month's update we'd like to not only be able to address what Daniel is asking, but just enough a brief update on the relocation of the bike lane for that area trevor, if you do not mind I think we have our D.O.T colleagues here. If you folks I, do not know Neg or Jennifer if you're here, if you is there anything, you would want to clarify on that points, or should we come back next month too? Thank you. I could speak a little bit on that queue. Hi everybody. This is Nick lacou, I'm with New York, City Department of Transportation. Just to reiterate that what was said already, we did present to the transportation committee earlier this week the committee passed a resolution in support. Yes, there are some issues that we are working out with the connections to the existing greenway and specifically to the existing network on 20th street and we're actively having these conversations with DDC and the project area. 2 contractor on how to accommodate that. The presentation that was given on Tuesday can be found online. We can share that link, so everybody has access to it and, as we continue to move forward with updates, we will make sure that we update the community board before implementation happens, which we are still planning for in 2021. all right. Thank you nick. If you could send that link to Michael and he will send it out to everyone all right, thank you. I just have one question and I know. We I think we've discussed this topic every single month with at least three or four resolutions. Is there any update on the the lower East side, ecology, sensors, compost yard, so our colleagues from sanitation should be on hi. This is bridget Anderson from Department of Interpretation yep hi. So we are working very closely with the parks Department and with it's an interagency effort to try to identify an alternative site for a lower aesthetic ecology center. They are able to remain at their current location through the end of the year. So that is a good thing and we are actively looking at both city sites non-city sites, to see if we can identify as quickly as possible an alternative location. Do you have any update on that progress because I know sikhi it's. The extension is only till the end of this year, which is next month right. Well, we have. We have a number of sort of irons in the fire. We were very hopeful about a site under the tribe or bridge ramp and unfortunately, after a lot of back and forth, the Tribridge Pryborough Bridge Authority raised concerns and we are no longer pursuing that location, but we have been looking at alternative sites both like I, said within the city agency portfolio we've also been reaching out to Hudson river park, MTA and other non-city agencies to identify sites that meet the minimum footprint and preparation requirements. So we do not have a final location yet, but we are actively speaking with Loris Psychology Center to make sure that what we are looking for meets their requirements. Okay, thank you keep in mind. We still have three more waterfront and parks related items on the agenda, but I'm going to allow christine to ask her question so christine you want to mute your microphone, sure yeah, thank you and thanks trevor for asking that question. I just want to remind everybody that Parks is also an agency that should be really asked for space for the compost yard we've been in this park for 22 years and parks has not really stated the reasons why all of a sudden they can not host us anymore, and so I just want to you know mention that all right, thank you and trevor you've got Katie Lope from Council member Robera's office wanting to hi katie hi. Yes, thank you so much bridget for coming and I know. We've been talking about lower East side, Ecology Center's compost yards staying until the end of the year. As that was mentioned. That was one month. We've done a lot of you know, city land projects it takes oftentimes more than one month. Is there any guarantee from either parks, DDC DSNY or the mayor's office that the lower East Side Ecology center will be able to remain in their current location until an alternate site is not only selected but ready for occupancy and operations? Well, I'll defer to Parks Department on the current location, but what I will say is that we are actively and highly motivated to find an alternative location from the department of sanitation's perspective. We are funded to do food scrub, drop-off, programming and lori's. Psychology center is one of our nonprofit partners who are funding to do that work. So we are you're very motivated to find an alternative site. Like I said we do not have anything set in stone yet, but we are communicating with lacw to make sure that we are meeting the requirements, but I will defer to my colleagues at parks Department around the current location. So we have a lot of parkies on this call. So I do not know which one of us wants to answer that, but I you know the compost operation. Excuse me, sorry, you want to identify yourself. Oh I'm, sorry, I'm Sam Biederman, I'm assistant, commissioner, for Community Outreach and partnership development at the Parks Department. So the we do not have a drop dead right now for the for lessek to depart the compost operation within the park. I think it's you know tied to chiefly tied to construction, but I, and you know I'd also I hate to create a further chain of deferral, but I would further defer to my colleagues at city Hall for more clarity on that. Well, we you know so thank you. Both Sam and bridget. I know: we've worked together in the past on composting and how much of a priority. This is for the department of Sanitation and obviously for our office, who fought for that funding and they're very excited that the city is still able to do composting within the five boroughs, thanks to lower East side, Ecology Center. So thank you so much for that urgency and anything that our office can do even non-city properties that might be acceptable, like we work very frequently with the catholic church, so there might be a a site at St Emmerich's that could be possible. Just please be in touch we're happy to be helpful in any way, and thank you Sam also for your comments. I think that some assurance, the lower East Side ecology center can remain in the East River. Park is going to be really essential moving forward and there is a request from our office and other elected officials. State Senator, Brian, Cavanaugh, State Assembly, member Eulen, New and Council member Margaret Chin have all requested a meeting with city, Hall parks, sanitation, DDC and lower state ecology center to really work this out. This is a big priority for us and we're really going to make sure that composting, both as I think really essential to this project is like a resiliency and a climate change protection for New York City composting has to be primarily considered as part of that long-term goal, and so we're here to be a partner to everybody, because I know that we all have the same goals: moving forward for resiliency, for combating climate change and for a really community-based park and amenity that gives back to the community and involves the community. So please this is a very important and let me know how we can be of assistance we're more than happy to help in any way that we really can. Thank you, katie I, think, for the sake of time that we're going to temporarily or just place this on the agenda for December as a separate agenda item, because we spend a lot of time on this particular topic and sometimes we just go in a hour circle. So I think we need to get some definitive answers and it's been a difficult process for all of us, but I need to really make sure we pay attention to the other items. So I ck has her hand up and I hope she can close this. So we can move on to the next attendant items. Okay, if you're I took my hand down I think she decided not to talk after you're I was I was behaving for a change. I do thank Katie from Council member Rivera's office, and the one thing we had also proposed in our resolution was to let it stay throughout the construction and work around it. So we and trevor Chantelle from Senator Cavanaugh's office was on and it looked like she wanted to say something to you, but I think she just wanted to piggyback on Katie's comments and say that the senator's in support as well right, thank you and hopefully there'll, be an update. Well, there should be something by December, so we'll place it on the agenda as a separate agenda item for an update thanks. So much and thanks to everyone for your support solving for this. Thank you. I do not know if the if there's a slide presentation well, I know that you're on for the bmcr update, but as we figure that out. Thank you for that presentation and update from the ESCR team, and we will see you next month with, hopefully some more information. Thank you. Everyone. Thank you for having us. As always, and again, thank you for your patience. Appreciate your help. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, I and I will I have it in this order, although you can feel free to change it, but I have bmcr Outreach, first and pier 36 and then pier 42. Is that order? Okay yeah? That works just fine for us. Thank you all right. So if you want to start with the dmcr outreach update, great I just need to share my screen here hold on well. I need to give you permission thanks, Michael and for those who are new to this meeting. Bmcr is the book of Montgomery Coastal Disease project, the other coastal protection project in our district, which goes from Montgomery Street to the Brooklyn bridge area great good evening, everybody, my name is: will fisher I'm with the economic Development Corporation and we have like Trevor said we have three items tonight. So the first is a very brief update on the resiliency project. Next we're going to talk about Peter, 36 operations and then, finally, it's a separate presentation from this, but we will be talking about pier 42. So thanks everybody for for joining us this evening, I'm going to run through some quick slides here so like trevor mentioned for anybody in the audience who's not acquainted. We do not have time today to go through a full presentation about the project, but to just show two very quick renderings here, like Trevor mentioned everything south of Montgomery Street down to the Brooklyn bridge, is going to be covered by this coastal resilience project. So, as you can see here from this figure, we have you know doing our best to maintain the everything that is great about the public access at the waterfront, while also protecting against sea level rise and storm surge. So if anybody has any questions about this, my email is at the bottom of all. Of these slides and you're welcome to send me a message for more information on the design. This is the sunny day condition, and then you can see here that, from within the from within the park itself, the flood protection device can be deployed in the event of a emergency management declared storm event. So a few brief updates- and you can see over here to my right or to your right- the project area over the past four or so years- we've done more than 25 public meetings and presentations between Community board, 3 and individual meetings out in the community. The design contract which we are in right now allows we have scoped out to do three large public meetings, the first of which we had last October. We would have had one in April. Have we not had the Covid-19 crisis? So we are now focusing on doing a sort of alternative to a big public event in December, which is more of an outreach campaign strategy. So what this is going to look like, and we had a hosted a call a few weeks ago, with a number of community leaders to solicit input on this and feedback, but we're going to be working with various community centers schools and residential buildings to host project posters with some basic materials explaining the purpose and goals of the project in lobbies, of a bunch of different buildings and community spaces, etc. We're also going to be hopefully identifying a few locations on the waterfront itself to be hanging large, weatherproof banners which will enable folks who are down on the esplanade to see what the what the esplanade would look like once the project is implemented. All of those materials are going to point towards a website where we're going to have more information and it for the folks who do prefer to do sort of a webinar type experience where they're. You know, interacting with the engineering team and asking questions and all that we will also be hosting one of those within those dates on December 17th. So we'll have more information about that. But again, this campaign will be running for about two weeks in December and folks should expect to see a lot of that. I'm also really excited to announce that we're going to be like harp strategies. Our outreach consultant is going to be looking to hire someone from the neighborhood over the next couple of weeks for some on the ground, support with distribution of materials. I think you know, especially since we are working with individual buildings, and you know we really need somebody who knows the who knows the community best. So as soon as we finish this meeting. In addition to this presentation, I'm going to be sharing the job description with the group of community leaders. We spoke with last week, as well as with the Community board staff, and anybody who is interested or knows somebody who might be interested can also just send me an email we're going to be having that person will be doing about 10 to 20 hours a week for about three or four weeks of work. Finally, at the board's requests and as we've discussed in the past, also as we've done in the financial district and Seaport area for a separate resilience project, we're going to be preparing a sort of virtual reality, 360 view experience so similar to how we're going to have banners posted along the waterfront to show you what the what that location would look like once the project is complete, we're also going to have links to sort of 360, Google Street view style views of what the project will look like that anybody can access over the web. So we're looking forward to rolling out all of that content in December, and you know, look forward to seeing you all there at our virtual webinar and hopefully you will see some materials around the neighborhood. Are there any questions about or trevor? How do we Wanna yeah, I'm going to pause here and asked for questions from I? Have a couple? Obviously, but I have some questions from committee members before we move on to the next agenda: okay, well, I'll, just in no particular order go over a couple of things number one! Thank you for the 360 views of the virtual reality. I think that will help, especially in this area where space is really constrained, and it's hard to imagine a flood protection system. The banners, if you're, if they're, going to be outdoors, if you could find a way to put them at the high water mark or to indicate where the high murder watermark is. It would be helpful in visually stunning. I know that might be a little high in some certain areas, but I think it's important for people to understand where the water was because most people were indoors and did not know the height of the water. I've heard the term the wall from the ESCR area and I do not particularly want to copy that particular phrase. But I think it's important here, because there are a number of buildings along the waterfront who are directly who were directly impacted by that the storm surge and that those make sure that those buildings are targeted because they were flooded and were severely damaged and I. Think it's important understanding that this is a neighborhood project, but to make sure that we target in this Covid-19 environment those buildings that were impacted by impacted by impacted by a superstorm sandy I. Think that's it for my list of questions and comments right, yeah 100 agree with all of that we're looking to we're looking to get as close to the project area as we can with all of this all right. Thank you. I see, there are two questions, one from the committee member val, I'm speaking on behalf of the lower East Side Power partnership. We sent a letter on November 9th. We had a meeting, and some of the residents who are from I would say up to about Delancey Street expressed that they would like to be informed in terms of outreach and concerns, because a lot of them do especially older people, do use that fitness area and use the area, and so they want to be informed. So if you can, in terms of banners and materials, especially posted in lobbies, think about at least up to like delancy street, because you have a lot of seniors that walk over there and use the fitness area right. Yeah and absolutely valid did get your letter in regarding the design, questions and recommendations you had in there I passed that along to the team and then yeah I think I. Think it's a good point. You make and I think you know, there's always sort of a balance here we, but we do want to you, know, concentrate our efforts in the project area as much as possible. You know if there's no reason that we should not. You know, overlap to some degree with the with the coverage area of the outreach that the ESCR team is doing so good feedback. Thank you, I see. There's one participant has their hands up Michael. Can you call because my screen just shrank, you're, muted, Michael? Sorry I was eating dinner grace. Do you still have a question grace hi hi will I was just wondering like? Will you also be posting like in terms of community outreach? Will you also be using the and try to communicate that as well as perhaps maybe citizen app or something like that, where you could probably that's a good idea? Do it within like Zip code area or yeah? That's a that's a really good point. We are looking. We are looking to use link NYC I, have a meeting on Monday to talk about using the NYC station. I forget exactly where that is within that within the area also looking at getting the word out through some some ad placements in in local papers and on local publications online, but that's a really good idea with with the citizen. If people use that out there I, we had not thought of that before. So that's a good idea! Thank you. I do not see any more questions. Well, you can go to the next agenda item. Great. Thank you. So moving on to pier 36 dockside operates, I'm not sure if, if Don Maloya from New York Waterway.Nyc was able to join I do know that we have Felix ceballos here also from EDC we're going to be talking here about the peer apron that wraps around pier 36 and pier 35. given that it was veterans day yesterday. I want to take this opportunity to wish everybody happy veterans Day particularly Felix, on our team, who is a veteran of the Coast Guard. So with that I have a map on the next page that we can talk about for the to get into the specifics, but the community board. Three. We noted we discussed the resolution back in August regarding enforcement and maintenance actions at pier 35 in response to a number of quality of life concerns we had. We had heard about there pier 35 just for everybody's clarity, the newly constructed pier 35. It was constructed by EDC and is managed by New York City parks in close cooperation with us, and then the pier 36 so-called apron area is managed by EDC and by our operator doc, NYC, which is the one that operates the the recreational vessels that depart from there. So we have sort of a and a there's a sort of a we're right on the edge of two jurisdictions here and I think we want to be responsive to concerns to make sure that we keep the keep the area operable and accessible to the public, while also maintaining you know, public safety to the degree possible, so I think we'd sort of like to get a good sense from the Community Board of Euros interest and how we can balance those things. I think right now at EDC, obviously we're in a pretty difficult fiscal situation, city wide for things that we're not already budgeted. So we do have some constraints that are in place that sort of restrict the optionality that we have, but I also do want to know as well that we do have. There is a requirement for public access along that area from I believe 9 am until dusk, so we do need to do at least that and maintain that sort of access, so just going to leave this up for our discussion, pier 35 and I'm going to move my cursor around I do not want folks to actually see that pier 35 is on the left, that's the public area and then every everything behind these two warehouse structures is what we call pier 36 and that wraps around and that's publicly accessible over to Montgomery Street in front of basketball city. So the area that we have the ability to close off now on both ends is between the the border of pier 35 and 36, and the the Montgomery Street and so I think we want to just open it up for discussion and I'll defer to you trevor on how to do that on how we can sort of balance, public access and public safety. Yes, this is I, did not really want to kind of start this way, but understand where you're going just for some clarification when pier 36 was transformed into a doc or where it would receive doc operations. The community kind of thought that we'd see historical ships and educational opportunities for the. For you know, residents who live in this area and that really has not materialized. It's probably one of the only places where a 200 million yacht can pull up and use that spot and the community is unable to access it. It's I'm trying to be very careful here about this particular area, because I really care about it and I know it's important and we should have access to it, but just if we give them one example July 4th last year the only people who were able to see the fireworks from that pier were the folks in that billion-dollar yacht. That was sitting there for a week, and that was not what we thought this particular period would shape up to be understanding that we need open access to this area, because that was part of what the community agreed with, but also 35 and 36 are probably the only areas in our district which actually do not have a closure time. All other parks and I know that 36 is in the hybrid area and 35 is managed by parks, although they do have closure times, they're not actually closed, as other parks are at any particular time. So it's a bit jarring for some people when they see this pier actually being closed. But there are a number of issues that we had at 30, pier 36, which really do not. You know. I do not know if everyone's aware of but I mean the police have pulled several bodies from that area, including one I, do not know if it was two weeks ago and there's been a number of legal activities going on late at night. But that's because we do not really have a closure time. Not in dusk is probably a little early. Even though this winter but I still think that's a little early, but I'd like to hear comments from other committee members about opening enclosure, time right and trevor, if you do not mind really quickly, I I'll say that we, the doc NYC team, does not maintain a a presence here. All of the time when there are not ships docked. However, they do at Skyport Marina at around 24th street. One of our sort of constraints, at least that we're operating in for this fiscal year is that we're sort of tying the ability to open and close the gates here to the beginning and the end of the shift at skyport, because that that employee of Doc and Wessey is able to come down and open the gates here, concurrent with the with the shift at skyport, so I think we're open to conversations around. You know potentially doing something in the future, but we are sort of locked into a pretty austere budget situation right now. What time is that, though, I believe right now? That's sort of on the 9 8 on the 90 into dusk, because I know that I think I saw wendy here on the list. I think wendy I'd like to hear what time wendy went the other day when she sent me a note if it was if it was earlier in the morning, the nine if it was sometime during the day because we do need you know this is something that is is a new ability that we have to close it and I do want to make sure that the operations are going as expected. Thank you. Will the I was there at 11:30 in the morning, and I've talked to other people. Who've been there at common times when it's closed and I agree with Trevor dusk is much too early, especially when dusk. Is it five o'clock now 5:30? This is a very important public health amenity. There is a pandemic going on. This is a place where people can be out and get fresh air right next to the river, not right. Next to the freeway and it's unconscionable to close it off. There's going to be no public space between more or less right here in the Seaport all the way, once both projects are underway. I really do not understand why you would not make this why you would allow it to neglect it and allow it to deteriorate as it has this year. I I've been talking to you about this for a year and I sent you condition pictures this spring. When I was out there every day, now, you're closing it off please this is public space. This should not be like this wendy. What time are you suggesting, because, although it is public space as our public parks, this is one of the only areas. I know where it's open at four o'clock in the morning and all types of activities happen behind there and I can assure you, because I know you were out during the spring, that you were not there at two or three o'clock in the morning, so we're just trying to figure out some closure times understanding the dock, with the limited ability for their staff. To do that, we may not find a solution today, but we need to think about what a good closure time would be for this particular area right. Well, you know I'm out really early every Tuesday, and there are so many people running and biking on the greenway I have not checked there. Specifically, so I would say open it back from 6 A.M to 10 P.M, something like that, a minute at a minimum and in the summer later and longer, because we do not know how long this is going to go on yeah I would I'm a little. Those times are challenging and I know we'll can attest to that, especially in the winter time, but I I'm trying I asked the parks manager early on about opening enclosure times, because if we could follow that pattern, especially for 35, then it would be more in line with what other public open spaces are doing. But it is a challenge and well there's you're telling me that the only time that is available for opening is 9, A.M and dusk and there's no other times to opening closest parts. So again, I do not know. If dawn from docking Yz was able to make it on this evening or felix is on Felix, are you there I think I'm here? Well, how much further we're doing I know? That's the I know we can. We can consider times beyond that, but that is the time that's consistent with that. The original basketball City public access area times so one to be consistent with that and two acknowledging our fiscal constraints. That's why we think that those times could work. I hear the concerns that dusk, especially in the winter, is probably too early for closure time, but also being mindful of pd's request. I'm not sure if 10 P.M is an appropriate time in the winter that might be too late so and Felix I would ask if there is not something we should come like what the constraints with Doc NYC being the one that operates. Those gates are because I do know that we have, you know they're confined by you, know, staff on hand and the contract that we're in with them feel except muted because of all the background noise. So you have to unmute yourself again Alex. If you could unmute well there you go yeah if the group can get back to us with a time with hours that are more consistent, I guess with to I think Trevor's point with park hours that maybe that is the approach we take. But again the fiscal constraints are limit us, but if it, if it's something that can be more cons consistent with how it's done elsewhere, then that's one way to try to justify the those hours. Let me ask Michael real quick Michael generally, the parks in the area opening in closing times well, most of the par with the exception of Henry M Jackson. None of the other parks are, can be closed. Like corollaries does not have a fence or a gate. Talk about the playground, portions that are actually I do not know if, like I know suit park has a particular program. Henry and Jackson have playgrounds which yeah Henry, M Jackson closes, usually I want to say it's usually like 10 p.m, but I think I. Think theoretically, I mean I walk by it almost every day. I should notice by heart, but I think the sign does say. Dusk, they closed very early. No, they closed at about six o'clock. 6:30. okay, you were going to say something. Ours also say dusk, all the I think all the parks say dusk, even the parks that do not have the ability to be closed because they do not have a fence, says that says they close at dusk in the summer they close later, sometimes at nine. Probably because that's one more question yeah! Well, let me let me do this because I did not expect I did not know. We were going to have a discussion like in this format. I'm really I think not 6 am is a bit challenging for that staff and I'm just trying to figure out a time that's early before nine, it's workable and a time that's later than dust, that's also workable and I think you know once one solution we might explore and I think we would be happy to join. Another interagency call on this, like we did a lot ago if we would rather sort it out with everybody else on the phone, but I think one. You know just sort of shooting from the hip here, but I know that we talked about, could parks, Department staff or the seventh precinct or someone else who is also going to be in the area operate the gates, if they're going to be on site regularly later I do not I do not know if we can do that necessarily, but that's something we should talk about, because you know I absolutely hear wendy's and other folks. Point of this is public space. We should, you know, make it accessible and you know allow people to circulate there, especially during our public health crisis. Here, so look. Maybe we table this and you know have an offline conversation with the other agencies to see. If there's somebody else that we can partner with to operate those gates right and I know in ypd at least the sector atom NCO officers were willing to at least carry open or close one portion at I mean one time either was the opening or closing and I do not know if they still have that offer, but that's willing they're willing to look at that and I know. There's a late staff that sits out there, they sit around basketball city or the edge of pier 36, so perhaps they'd be willing to at least lock it. But let's do this because all right, let's have I, have a question and also there's one member of the public. Who has that? Well, I'm wondering for people who might not be very familiar with the area that we're discussing. Can you just quickly talk about what amenities we're talking about? If any that are at that section? Well, I would not say there's too much in the way of amenities back there. It's it's quite a long. It's quite a long walk between pier 35 and pier 42. there's not much in the way of amenities, but I've gone. I've been back there on my bike and on foot and it's lovely. You've got a great view of the river and there's a lot of space to run or walk or bike, or for all of that to Michael's point. We were hoping and I've seen the comments with wendy that this would become a much nicer space sort of the issues with Covid-19 hit. So we're challenged with improving the area. I know there were a number of planters back there and all those plants are have not survived either but I. Maybe you know we look at the space going forward, especially consider Covid-19 that we can do some improvements. But let me let me go to participate one time yeah, so I I'll have to check back and I know. It's been a little while, since we've given the committee, an update on the on the basketball city entranceway project, but I do believe that there are some some improvements to the backside of that pier associated with that project. I'll have to confirm that, but we can get more into the scheduling of that during our next presentation, which is about pier 42, but there's sort of a kind of waterfall of various projects that need to be staged in order. So that is something to look forward to once we're able to work with basketball city to complete that project all right. Thank you. Okay, Diane hi! Thank you. I was actually just down at pier 36 and pier 35 tonight, and they were actually open. Past dusk I was able to walk all the way from the you know: northern entrance there, by by the DOT yard of basketball city, all the way down to pier 35 turn around and come back all the way. You know back up again out into the pier 42 area and what I've noticed is that it seems to be dependent on what day of the week it is and when the cruise ships are docking, because they're expecting people to at least Disembark and you know lead through both ends to go back to their vehicles or to go home. So I'm wondering whether understanding some guidelines or some scheduling about when the cruises are departing, would help us understand a reasonable end time for that area. To be closed, you know, because it would work around that and I will second wendy's comment that yesterday around 11:30 it was still closed up and I was not able to get back there, but then tonight after dark I was so it seems kind of random and I'm just wondering what factors are influencing that. And what can you tell us about that might help us make a reasonable, workable proposal for when the space can be open? Thank you, yeah diane, that's really good feedback. I'm glad! I'm glad you mentioned that just now, and that's good for us to hear, because again, the gate at the southern end was just recently installed. So I think to hear quirks in the operating plan like that are is really good feedback, so the boats and the vessels do not have a set schedule, as you can imagine so. I think that is something to work around, but I think at the very least like it would be nice to be able to project sort of a minimum hour at each end of the day at the beginning and the end of the day and have some sort of signage to that effect, because you know I would love to get a. You know bit improved from a situation in which you have to go, walk back there to see if it's open or not so it you know, I would hope that we can endeavor to have at least a consistent minimum hour. Opening and closing hour understanding that the vessel schedules are going to continue to be. You know all over the place. Thank you well and with that. If we could restart that weekly newsletter that was sent to the Community, Board and other members I know we do not have the same amount of votes departing from that, but at least we knew when they were arriving and departing. We no longer get that schedule from the doc team. Okay, that's extremely helpful and I'll echo what Dianna said about it's inconsistent some days it opens late early and some days does not seem like there's anyone out there at all. We have one more question: go ahead, grace hi regarding open access. Perhaps I can probably envision like something where to improve it on the back. Can we possibly do like a track and field? Would you consider something like that, because there's a lot of avid joggers and it would be nice to see an extension where you know it can be also extended past like to pier 42 and it gives it would draw people you know and draw people like the joggers and everybody. You know just around as an option beyond the pathway that they, usually you know, jog right by the street level, and it's also like kind of it's more of a safety too so, and it would help activate the the back way and perhaps like sweep like the negative activity, that's really more like in the daytime. But yes, we do have to figure out like closure, because once come night time, my fall. That's when all the negative activity happens just this week there was fireworks again and this is not July 4th. You know people are just you know in that back way, there's a lot of like negative activity that is not wanted. So closure is important during the night time, but that's just a suggestion. If you can consider maybe making a very nice attractive, you know track feel that wraps around as an option right. Thank you grace and yeah I. Think, as you were, as you were hinting at, there's a there's, a balance here, somewhere in the middle between making sure that it's open and inviting and a nice place to come for people while also maintaining public safety and like I, mentioned before you know, unfortunately, because of the fiscal situation it we are in right now we really have no ability even to envision, or you know, to envision paying for at the at the very least, even temporary activations that were not already budgeted, but I think that's a conversation that we should very much keep alive and I do appreciate wendy for having sent a lot of creative ideas on that over the past few years. So grace I'll, add you to that. Appreciating the ideas on that and I hope that there is a day soon where we can continue to talk about that and how we can be creative and make that a nice place to be all right. Lighting is also very important. Yeah, absolutely I think I'll have to check with the team. I know that, because there's a the sanitation and basketball city operated buildings, the jurisdictions get kind of jumbled back there, but I can check on who on who manages the existing lighting back there and see if there's anything simple, that we can do there one more suggestion. It's like there's a lot of people who love to use the grass and lay out during the sun yeah. Perhaps you can make that more of like a synthetic feel where you know they there's more of an extension where people can. You know, enjoy the sun as well. As you know something a lot that nature where it's more, you know active and try to you know, trigger more activity. Relaxation- and you know something along that nature. Yeah I think what we're hearing well is that we need to look at an earlier opening time and a later closing time. So, for the purposes of I, know that there's someone from doc on this call 9 am is a bit too late. I mean I'm really thinking about seven or even eight and a closer time closer to 9 pm, and then we can have another call and involve New York 7 precinct to see if they can extend those hours which I know they can they just have to go and do it and a lot of times they're pulled away, as you know, from other activities in the city which has made it extremely difficult for them to sort of be in that area. But let's do that and we'll have a small update next month, hopefully on where we all with that, because I know we still have to talk about pier 42, which is up next, I'm going to I'm going to stop, sharing, really quick and switch to my other presentation. I have we have nikita also from Abc's capital team on and I'm going to go to this other position. So this is a presentation regarding pier 42 right next door, so we're covering everything today. So this is an update to the committee regarding the sort of past design activities which have now completed. We are very close now to starting construction on pier 42 and very much to the points that everybody made regarding pier 36. This is a place where we actually do have. We do have the funding in place. We do have you know we are getting the contracts in place and we have designs completed and everything to move forward with the construction of a of a brand new park for the for the neighborhood. So we're really excited about this and we'll be walking through quickly the sort of previous outreach on this, the the project design just a couple of things and then we'll get into construction schedule. So this is just sort of a quick rECAB before I turn it over to Nikita. Well, just a partner interrupter just to get some clarity, because for the past few months we've been talking about upland and interim deck, so everything has been merging into pier 42. So we're saying 3:42. we'll get into that as well. I think the might have a sort of diagram, but yeah. That's a good point. There's sort of multiple phases here to this project: the upland park, which is a permanent park fixture and then we're also working closely with DDC and parks to do an interim activation of the pier deck at the part over water in order to help mitigate for the loss of open space during the ESCR construction. So yeah, you can see here the previous meetings that we've done much prior to this I know dating back to maybe 2012 and 2013. The Parks Department was working with the community on a master plan for the area. Edc was brought in 2017 to complete the design and construction for the first couple of phases. So, as you can see, we just started coming this year for the interim peer deck, because this was an idea that very much came out of the ESCR project. So we've moved very quickly on that here we are presenting tonight and then at the end, we'll have some more information. But given that I know that the CB3 agendas get crowded, we're going to have a more in-depth discussion of the. What folks should expect to see during construction next Tuesday evening and that's open to the public that we'll have more information on that later? So with that nikita? Are you on and yep? Can you hear me? Yes, hello good evening, hi hello, everyone good evening. My name is Nikita Sharma as well. Sorry I hit my mute button by accident. I'll start over hi everyone. My name is Nikita Sharma as well mentioned. I worked at I work at EDC and well. Thank you for giving that introduction. So on this slide, we really just wanted to give everyone a bit of an update. I'm sure many of you guys may be familiar with the phases, but so just to kind of rECAB quickly. Pier 42 is being implemented in three phases. So when we do say pier 42 we're encompassing all three of these phases. Phase 1a, which was the abatement and demolition of the existing shed, has been complete as of phase 1b is the design and implementation of the new Upland park, which is slated to begin summer of 2021 with completion summer 2023 phase 1c is the design and implementation of the interim peer deck that will was just mentioning, and that is slated to also begin summer, 2021 with completion summer 2022. So that's a year ahead of the construction of the actual Upland park on this slide as well. We thought it'd be really helpful to give you guys a visual representation of these three phases. As I know, it could get a little confusing. So the blue bubble that you see that's phase 1a, which I mentioned, is complete up top, which I'm now realizing might not be the best visual for everybody, but in the black and white. That's in the red Rectangle, that's phase 1b thanks will and then the red Rectangle, that's with inside the blue bubble is actually phase 1c. So that's the pure deck that we're activating in the interim while escrow is is in construction. Well, you want to go to the so this picture we thought is just a really neat rendering to show you guys kind of what we anticipate the pier 42 to look like once construction is complete, so you would enter will if you want to move your mouse yep, you would enter from montgomery, make your way in the middle, and then you can access the pure deck if you'd like or if you keep making your way down the park, you can also access the corliers hook ferry, which is all the way to the right yep there. You go thanks. Well, so we thought this is a really nice representation to show you guys so we'll just two renderings I believe many of you may have seen the top rendering. This is what we anticipate phase one b to look like once the park is complete and then phase one sees the pure deck rendering of what pure deck. We anticipate to look like once that's open as well, so in terms of schedule. At this time we do have a construction manager on board and we're currently finalizing our baseline schedule with them. But we do feel comfortable with the schedule that we're presenting to you today to date, our construction manager has released two bid packages, one being the seawall rehabilitation and the second being the sewer package, and if you guys remember, the sewer package is basically the resiliency improvements that we're doing. This is a subgrade work that technically needs to happen before we can actually start construction above ground, which would then be the upland park and the interim pure deck. So as I mentioned earlier, these are approximate project durations, but we do feel comfortable sharing them at this time. We are finalizing the actual dates with our construction manager and will probably speak a little bit more about this and I believe the. But we do have scheduled next week on Tuesday, where Rcm will be present, so they will be able to speak a little bit more in depth with what we're planning. So, as you see here, the park is slated for summer as well as the interim deck, and the interim deck is slated to begin a year before. Excuse me is slated to be complete a year before the park. Completion in 2023 Brayden, just a couple things to add, really quick, since we had everybody solved before, which is where the construction management firm, that is working with DDC and parks on the east side, coastal resiliency project- we think you know the coordination is absolutely key here, so we brought lero on as well to be our construction manager for this project, because the projects are immediately next to each other. Like Nikita said they're this. The sewer improvements piece that you see here is a is essentially part of the ESCR project, but that happens to run through the pier 42 project area. So, for you know for folks who are who are walking by and seeing the construction site it is, it was all going to look like one construction site, but we are doing a small amount of the sewer work on behalf of DDC as part of this project and then also as Nikita mentioned, we have it. You can see it divided up here. The sea wall, rehabilitation, which is the section right along the waterfront, and the sewer improvements both need to come. First, that's a lot of heavy construction below ground. You know a lot of the sewer work is below ground and that needs to happen in advance of beginning construction on the upland park and the and the peer deck. So that's sort of the broad layout of the schedule there so I think. Let me check what the is actually just one more thing. So folks may I folks should notice a construction trailer, that's on site right now. That is the a trailer for the for the construction manager lero, as Nikita said there are going. These are individual contracts that come under the construction manager, so I appreciate that DDC earlier showed you know, sort of the instruction manager and then like the bidding process for the individual contractors. So we do have. As nikita mentioned, we do have on board the the contractor for the seawall. The sewer work is still out to bid and then the other, the other work will come will come after that. But you know what folks should expect to see is that the construction manager is currently on site and we have. We still do anticipate beginning the seawall rehabilitation by the end of the year, but we'll have more details and the construction manager will was able to make it for the meeting that we have on Tuesday. So, if you're able to attend the meeting on Tuesday, we'll have a little more granular detail on what to expect during construction and with that nikita did I miss anything or should we should we go to Q&A in discussion no I. Thank you also hit all the points. So yes definitely happy to answer any questions. I, I'm going to first go to the committee members. If they have any questions about this 342 update, I do not see any hands. I do not know if you see any Michael. Oh just a few questions. I mean I actually have a question. I guess is that sure so? But so is this? Coming back to us at some point for a resolution about the design? No, the design was reviewed with the community board in the the final design for the Upland park was approved in July of last year and then the pure design was presented earlier this year. Okay, yes, we're we're essentially at the construction phase. Okay and I knew that we had. We were sharing the agenda with some other items tonight, so we do have more in-depth materials that, if folks do want to see more detailed, renderings, more detailed drawings. We have that available. We are actually, since this is sort of a multi-agency project we are EDC is the construction manager we are working on. This is a park that is going to be, you know, held and maintained by parks and then we're working with DDC so anyway, regardless I say all that, because right now we are working on getting a page up on our website on Edc's website, where we're going to have this and all the previous presentations hosted. That should be up in the next week or two, but we do not have that right now. If anybody would like to see materials in the meantime now you could, you can email me and I'll. Send you the design packages that we've presented in the past just a couple of quick things. Can you remind me of the area for sewer improvements, the area so generally in nikita? You can correct me here if I'm wrong, but the the sewer improvements are going to tie into the ESCR project at the northern end near the court, any of the clearly cooked ferry and then they're going to come up here to Montgomery Street, and then there is some work in the street nikita. Do you happen to know the extent of that? So the sewer work is really. There are a bunch of manholes that are located all over the park which at some point you know this was under Escrow's scope and so because escrow is happening a little bit after we start construction. It made more sense for EDC to take on that scope. So there are, there are a few manholes within the Park Upland Park area that or that pier 42 project will be doing as part of our project in terms of strengthening and flood proofing, yeah more concern primarily because I know, there's a there's, a meeting Tuesday that will discuss this, that just in that particular era, there's some other buildings that might be on Montgomery street that are really need to be targeted. I know, there's lines in one which has really not been involved in this process, and they are in Montgomery Street, also along with 286 South street and the town homes that are on montgomery and just want to make sure that we target those buildings also because they're directly along the you know, along gouverneur they're directly along this right, absolutely and so Nikita that the do you happen to know the footprint of the extent of the sewer work once it goes up because, over to your to your point, I think the I know that the work does connect into that intersection of montgomery and South Street. The I do not imagine that it goes very far down. South street I. Think, nonetheless, to your point that the meeting on Tuesday is designed to get more into the details, because, even though we're early and the sewer work is not slated to begin until next year, we do understand that residents, you know, do want to be in the loop in regard. What they're going to see, especially as it comes to any sort of traffic rerouting pedestrian safety. You know light and noise that they might see. We understand all that's all that's critical to understand so so yeah, the meeting on Tuesday we'll get more into that and I think as we get towards the spring. Once we have the sewer contractor on board, we may have a better idea. Nikita anything I left out there, no I think you definitely answered that. We'll definitely work with the Sam to make sure that this is something that they're talking about on Tuesday and just for more note, I mean the community has pushed for this for this area to be a part. First of all, which was goes back before my time on the board on and has spent many years designing and refining this particular park and that upland or the interim deck is interim and still needs. You know 60 to 70 million dollars to complete the park. But this is a huge project and if you look at the footprint it spans quite a large area that we really need to talk about. You know I do not know if we're going to get into as much detail as we would with ESCR. But at some point we would not even talk about how this will affect the community and whether we're going to have ccls and how all that's going to work and I understand you're, going to discuss that on Tuesday yeah could I give a note on that trevor sure. So. Actually, so, actually your first point. Yes, it's very exciting, where it's not often that we get to say that we're building a new park on what was never really accessible to the public, so really happy about that regarding community construction liaisons, because we understand that it's important for folks to have a point of contact on the ground if they see or hear something or have a question about construction. Like DDC said earlier. Regarding the difference between project area two and one, we are looking to work with the with the same set of people, if not the same person, that DDC is going to have as their community construction liaison at this most southern end of the esker project. So you know, given that, like I mentioned earlier to the you know to the passerby, this will look like one big construction project when both it and ESCR are in progress. We do want to make sure that we have one point of contact that can discuss both projects and can be you know, fluent and and to not have any sort of agency silos there. So, while just like DDC said since we're working to get that same set of people on board, we do expect to have that, probably by the end of the year, but there will be a community construction liaison on site in the meantime. Folks can just reach out to me since there's not going to be much happening on site until we have that person anyway. So please feel free to reach out to me, but yeah. We will have a ccl that will be shared with ESCR and before we go to the participants. Just one last thing, and I've been asking for this for probably seven years if we could have a groundbreaking for pier 42. folks have spent a lot of time that goes back before pastor, pier 42 and there's a lot of work. That's been done and we've done other stuff in parks. I just went to a ribbon cutting for with acrylic no speeches just ribbon cutting, which is pretty nice actually, but if we could do something to signify that this construction start yeah absolutely- and this is this- is really something again that you know we are thrilled about. I know a lot of folks in the community have worked on this for a lot longer than I have so we do want to celebrate the moment. I'm actually waiting to hear back from a few folks. We are trying to finalize the policy within EDC for how we deal with you know, public events in light of Covid-19 ongoing and you know sort of the recent uptick in numbers. So we do really want to celebrate this as well. Trevor just need to figure out how and when to do that most safely. Thank you. I'm going to go to folks who've been waiting to ask a question and I think I may get this wrong, but I think wendy was first. Thank you. The I'm most concerned that you're again restricting access to the water's edge. Can you go back to number four? Please? Yes, that's good! So if there were a walkway, all the way around were pier 42 and if you could make it connect to pier 36 simply by taking 10 or 15 feet of the DOT yard, it's could be reorganized, so it's not so quite so spacious there. But then you would give people a third of a mile long, waterfront walkway there and I would also like that walkway to not have the fence so high, like in, as you show in your renderings of pier 42, the fence is quite high: a chain-link fence, pier 36. That's the fence is I. Can you know it's like four three and a half feet high? So, yes, these fences give this a feeling a little bit like a jail, I hate to say it, and you know the commissioner has been so much about parts without borders. This really gives it a sterile feel. There's no shade there whatsoever and you know there's some things about health. If you think people are going to be out there more that you're like, as you said, need to be considered now before this is finalized. Mm-Hmm yeah wendy, absolutely those are oh, go ahead. I do not mean to cut you off all right. Well, I really want to make sure other folks get a chance to I will I will and if you go there any time you'll see people dancing and there's no space here for the dancers, but there's plenty of space for people who want to play tennis and I. Just they want you to think about the inequity and the ability of people who live in this neighborhood to be able to do healthy activities there. Thank you right, absolutely so Nikita you happen to know if this is representative of the final condition of the fence, I'm not sure I know that the tennis courts, of course, and the basketball courts have a taller one behind them. But I do not know what the Waterfront defense condition is I, believe the fencing is there because it is so close to the water water's edge, it's more of a safety, so the rendering that you do see here is I want to say it is very realistic to what outcome would look like. Okay and I think you know some something important to mention. Also in response to your question. Wendy is that, like trevor mentioned earlier, there is sort of a longer term master plan. So that's why we sort of refer to the to the deck portion as interim or temporary. This is this is something that we were able to put together. You know relatively quickly the appear like many peers in the city. You know we do need to inspect it. We did need to inspect to make sure that I could handle the loads. So there's not a lot of heavy construction. We can do on top of it. So this is a this is an interim activation that again we're going to be building a lot more quickly than we otherwise would a park, but understood that there are. You know things that looking into the future, we would improve about the space well and if you look at the esplanade going north or south, it's about two and a half feet high the fence three feet: high. There's no reason to make people feel like they can't see the water I do not think, and especially I understand. You want that around the ball courts, but you probably do not want it right around the edge. So that's my point there. Thank you, okay! Thank you. Next Amy did you lower your hand? No, it's still up nope still up, okay go ahead and okay, so this is just building on to what wendy just brought out, but I just want to point out that people that are playing in ball fields are keeping their eyes on the ball. Those of us that are not playing in ball fields. What we want is access to the water, that's why we go to a waterfront park to have access to the water so to take half of that park and close it off in fences and restrict that for ball fields and to have the upland park, be sandwiched in between the metal fence for the ball fields and the highway on one side. You know to me that just seems really irrational and you may have a long-term plan that differs from this, but many of us who frequent the waterfront parks do not necessarily have confidence that we will live long enough to see that long-term plan come into existence. So I just want to reiterate that people that live in the area really crave that access to the waterfront and people that play ball games do not actually need that access to the waterfront they need access to the ball. Thank you. Well, can you just I think there's a this is just a little bit of misunderstanding about the interim park and how we got to this, because without this being a mitigation for ESCR, we would have still just had a deck that would not be complete unless we found another 70 to 80 billion dollars to complete the proxy. Can you just explain this intern park and why we have ball fields and attendance, courts and the reason for it sure I do not know if parks is still on. If all this here- and she is welcome to jump in here- because she will do a better job explaining it tonight- I'll pause just a second to see if she is I'm on so yeah trevor, thanks for thanks for flagging that so the interim deck, which is on the water side of the upland park. That is something that about a year ago, the city you know announced that, as part of the sort of Esker mitigation and interim recreation discussions, we had worked with EDC done. Some quick inspections of the deck realized that there was a way that we could quickly activate this space, and so really this upland deck. Had we not had that announcement not been made, what it would have been or what it would be in the future would have been a fenced off deck that there would be no waterfront access to, but we are making some investments and some quick fixes so that the deck can host public access and to meet a lot of the recreational needs that we were hearing from. The esker side needed some sort of displacement plan. So for folks who have been part of these meetings for many months or years, you may remember many of the discussions about you know permitting, and so this is one of the sites where we were able to place sports facilities that we did not have alternative sites, for you know recognize that there are a lot of competing needs and desires for our open spaces. The pier 42 upland site will introduce a lot of passive open space and we're excited that, through our partnership with EDC on the interim deck, we'll be able to get folks onto the deck much quicker than we had previously thought would be possible and also be able to offset some of the losses of the recreation needs that we know will be impacted when Esker's under construction all right. Thank you all! I'm going to go to Frank next! Thank you trevor. Thank you, CB3 parks and thank you all doing. Well, just it's more of a I guess. It's a point to raise, which is when it comes to construction and when it comes to lighting in particular. I just want to emphasize that I hope that you guys will reach out to governor gardens because, as you can see on the mapping up there, three of our residences are right against that and I did bring to your attention and I appreciate your responsiveness. I believe it was last July 2019 when DSNY had a emergency, ticker tape parade and essentially all of our residents were subject to feeling like we were in a movie studio set because the lights were so blinding and they go through all our curtains and stuff and throughout the night, and so I just wanted to highlight that fact, because I think it's often not really understood unless you are actually in the zone of being directly impacted. So thank you right, absolutely and thanks frank good to see you yeah absolutely I. Think, especially when the status quo, like we've discussed, has been that the pier is largely vacant and empty to have that sort of activity, especially suddenly is got to be disturbing, so yeah, looking forward to keeping folks, updated, I think the seawall rehabilitation, the work that's going to be starting over the next month or two is certainly the lowest impact. I think that the sewer work could be noisy and it like I said we'll potentially cross onto the streets and potentially have a traffic impact. So we'll definitely keep you all in the loop as we as we close to that, and then you know, like DDC, said once the contractors come on board, we have a better idea of the schedule and the means and methods, and all that so appreciate that and appreciate you all helping you getting the word out for the event on Tuesday as well. One question on that: well, you mentioned something when you were talking about pier 36 about the basketball city, improvements and I know that the walkway improvements have been on the shelf for probably nearing a decade. Now. Do you have any update on that era, because that is a very tricky place for anyone across the street and, I'm sure frank, is aware of that cross point. So if you have any update on that, it'd be helpful. Yeah. It's a great question, especially now that we're looking at this figure so for anybody who does not have the background basketball city here, which is an EDC tenant, has a has long, been designing and working on a project to make some pretty significant improvements to their drop-off area in the form of pedestrian safety, some sort of greening and that kind of thing, and as folks, can see that and to Wendy's point about the D.O.T lot, there's a ton of different uses. Here we have sanitation, fire and police have uses on the other end of pier 36. We have DOT here we're building a park here. Ddc is building ESCR here. So there's a lot going on, but trevor to your specific question, this sort of triangle- that's left out of the greening of pier 42, which is the basketball city entrance area project like I might have mentioned earlier. But when we did not have a figure in front of us to refer to the heavy sewer work that has to come through here for the ESCR project does need to happen first, so you know, because of the basically it's going to make most of most of the peer site, which is you know, is going to be under construction, will be a construction zone, but that's going to be inaccessible, so just as we're not able to begin work on most of the upland park here and on the pure deck. Until that sewer work is substantially complete. The you know, since all of this ground is going to be ripped up anyway. The basketball city improvements are going to need to wait until after the sewer work. However, I recognize that I do not have a date right now for when exactly afterwards they will. They will happen. I just know that they do need to wait until afterwards and that had been coordinated. I know that there was a internally I think we had a meeting about that, maybe two or three weeks ago to discuss. So we have that information somewhere and- and we'll get that to you, but my point, just being that, once the sewer work is complete, it will unlock all of the other great stuff that comes on top of it. Okay, thank you. Well, we have one last question from diane before to the next into an item so diane I. Will. My question is about the shared use path that runs between the FDR and, what's going to become the upland park? You know in connection to the pier 36 discussion that we had a few minutes ago. What will that path be open during the pier 42 work and will you know pedestrians runners, cyclists still be able to get from the lower areas of East, River, Park, behind pier 42 and then back down to the pier 36 area, or will that close nikita? Do you have the answer to that on the bike lane and also for pedestrian access, of course hi? Yes, so the bike path, we're working with our construction manager to provide to maintain access, but once escrow does come along and escrow is under construction, which I believe is sometime next year. The bike path will be closed and at that point, escrow is the one that's technically supposed to maintain the bike path thereon, but yeah I think thank you so I think diane. The answer that to your question would be. We need to I think we still need to figure out the exact timing, but I understand that there would be interest from the community in learning if our project would not hesitate at closing earlier than it otherwise would because of the Acr yeah and whether you know and whether that's tied to the phase of ESCR that you know covers the lower portion of the park, because you know it may not be on the same timeline as the rest of the park. Will you have more information about that by Tuesday? Do you think, or if that song is going to take you a little longer to figure out, we will have Dan Bradley who's. The main liro project manager on site for us I am pleased that we were able to get Lyro on board to build this as well. As you know, following on their selection for the ESCR contract, because you know for exactly that sort of thing, it will be two sides of the same coin that can hopefully talk to one another and coordinate to reduce sort of unnecessary delay and enclosures. But Dan may have more information next week, but given that the sewer contract is still out to bid- and you know, the information still needs to come back in terms of in what order and on what timeline, the contractor plans to do the work. We may not have that on Tuesday, but I think discussion of that, at least in reiterating that it's a it's important to the community that stay open for as long as possible. I think we can certainly discuss. Thank you thank you and thank you diane for raising that, because we're going to put that on our notes to follow up on that I. I'm also looking at this pathway, and there also needs to be access to the ferry and I do not know if you're going to be able to access the ferry from the southbound area if those bike and pedestrian pathways are closed. But I understand that the construction companies are saying we just want to flag that for later discussion, absolutely and the ferry will remain open during ESCR as we as we've discussed, but to your point Trevor, just depending what what direction you'd be able to exit access it from and when. Okay. Thank you trevor. What about traffic going on to the FDR on South, Street and coming off the SDR drive? Is that going to be Diver? Diverted rerouted or you know, people are that you're going to be doing work in that area also right! So sorry for the sewer reconstruction. We'll definitely have our cm on Tuesday to speak more to it, but for when we're doing the part that is near the FDR, there is I believe night closure, so that will be we'll be coordinating with D.O.T on that, but we'll definitely have our cm speak a little bit more in detail on that they'll be best to address this question, for you great I, think do you have anything you have anything to add and Michael. Do you see any other hands raised? My screen just changed again. Grace has her hand up grace. Go ahead, quick question. Grace I do not have any I'm sorry, okay! Thank you thanks all right. Thank you. Everyone thank you will and the team from your team for that presentation on those three agenda items hosting us and for anyone who wants to learn more about the construction portion of pier 42, both the upturn, upland and the interim deck portion. If you could put up that screen, one more time that show a meeting on I will do that and I also send to Michael to put in the chat. The the information is that my oh yeah, so it's 11:17 and if you could just put do you have, is there a registration required for the zoom link? There is yes, so well, there's nothing in the chat from you did you just send it? Oh I I was caught between the the screen share and all right. So as soon as the screen stopped sharing we'll he'll send it to you all right. But thank you. Thank you, nice to see everybody and for we're going to end on that agenda. We just have one more that I do and unless I'm missing something. That is a motion to adjourn this meeting motion to Adjourn Yay I, do not take it. Tennis, reindeers! Yes, I want to see the Puppy David Adams good night you're on altman, yes good night Carl and Chan, yes, Ryan Gillum, yes, Valentina Jones say yes val. She said yes, she just yes great Michael Moreno, yes, Caroline Matt Cliff, yes, Robin Chadell, yes, Josephine Velez! Yes, we're done a wonderful weekend! Everybody you too y'! All thanks see you next time we ended at 907. So pretty good.
