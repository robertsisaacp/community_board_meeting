Hey, good evening, everybody, the first part of Saturday, the Stan Street Playground, is now closed due to the extensive drug activity, we're working with pat to kind of remove all the homeless encampments and drug dealers and addicts out of the park.
The folks who are struggling with addiction in the park would be good to have to ask the park to the commissioner to come again and do another meeting, perhaps so that we could our community effort together and have they been reaching out to goddard homeless outreach, who's.
I have staff going out at 3:30 reopening the park for the public, so those sites are def are closed for school purposes during the day, so typically from I would say seven to about 3:30.
Obviously, this presentation will go up on the website as usual, but wanted to make sure everybody's aware and just remind folks of that, all the information that was found during the project, design and environmental review.
We tried to work through the slides that a lot of them that were presented previously, but try to expand that and work through it to make it a little more simplified and be able to clearly answer the questions.
Mass mailing package for project area one and for these river park will be submitted to community board three and all the elected officials and stakeholder groups and everybody.
We have a link right on the home page to the New York, City parks, neighborhood, recreation resources, and we will shortly be updating our faqs with some of the questions that we've been receiving from stakeholders and from the community.
Looking to take some of the frequently asked questions and add them to the website, so that information is more accessible to everyone, so just kind of going off of what I just said.
Yes, good evening, everyone, I'm, John, Lynch, I'm, the construction manager for the Pa2 contract working for DDC, and so what I'm going to do.
I have been going to to the neighborhood walking talking over to people and form them and hitting out informations of the upcoming project.
This is cue again thanks, nadine, for that I just want to highlight that nadine is our designated Ccl for the project, area, 2 sort of again Community Board.
That piece is starting construction first and once we go in to project area, one the contractor gets selected and sometime towards the end of this year, when they come on board into early next year.
I know a lot of folks, it's easier for us to determine between project areas, one and two and where to draw those lines, and it's not as easy for many of the community members, but just a rule of thumb.
They can get information across and make sure that your the community folks are being connected to the right person and right source just wanted to highlight that a little bit cute just for clarification, you're, saying that the ccl that is particularly assigned to Community Board 3 will probably be on board at the end of December, beginning of January, most likely early next year.
I just wanted to make sure that it was clear because I understand that nadine will be able to obviously handle questions from the entire project era, although more focused on Pa2, and that the ccl for Cv3 will probably come on board early to Mid-January.
We just wanted to make sure that everybody is aware, because I know a lot of communities.
This advisory just got issued and distributed this week to Community Board six, the elected officials to the public and nadine has been tremendously helpful, with posting this or getting this out to the community members, but it's all focused and community Board, sixth district, around Skytown area and Cyprus and Coke Park, area, sorry and that northern piece of our project.
First thanks nadine sure, anytime, so we're going to hand it off to Mike pudgy now to discuss project area, one.
We should have a lot more concrete information for you next week as we'll have open bids and have an idea who the contractor is, and at that point, I'm going to turn this back to desiree.
The bid period for this area got extended by a few weeks to allow quality time for the contractors to review and get their bids in and typically with some projects at DDC, we build in some cushion to be able to sort of estimate and predict for those kind of events, and that's what happened.
To, make sure everybody's aware, the project area 2, which always was planned to go first in construction, is moving forward this month and this piece of project area 1 is coming right.
Then you know the notification continues throughout construction to the end of construction, and during that time we give ongoing updates at community boards and cad meetings and throughout.
Then the contractors are joining us shortly and at this point this is where we would have known based on the bid responses, whether the teams that have bid on the project are either already in compliance with these goals, because they've assembled a team that meet the requirements or that they know that they will need to hire in the future, whether in its individuals or subcontracting opportunities, and this is our chance where we would be giving them on the initial meetings.
So right now, we're on the verge of meeting with the contractor to talk through their plan, look at any hiring and subcontracting opportunities moving forward and then as needed in the next step.
Three individuals as well I, think you've seen this before with our typical outreach events and communications and strategies for going out to the industry.
Who else has expressed interest in the project and those are additional teaming opportunities, and then we've separated some of the information you've seen before into section 3 resources and mwb resources and a lot of the faqs on HUD and section three requirements are under the section three resources, and that could be very helpful with giving specific examples for you and New. York City also has its own faq section for explaining what programs and how contractors are reporting out the opportunities, as well as agencies, responsibilities.
So I think that people get a little nervous when they see in the paper that there's a delay and knowing that the funding has some time.
Definitely, please let us know this is very helpful and appreciate that valentino for bringing that up desiree, maybe you can just fast forward quickly to that green bubble, slide that we have for project area one and in the Appendix of this presentation we have what we presented in the past.
I. Think those got published after this slide, particularly when we said that the park is remaining open for the rest of the year.
Just for this particular project where people can go to, even if it is virtual in this new Covid-19 environment, we live in because I think a lot of opportunities are missed.
You know this sort of story of where you take one individual who does not have a job and has no experience who lives in a neighborhood and follow that person from wanting to get a job and see them work on the project.
Guess you know, aside from the traditional kind of jobs that you're looking to fill, I'm, just also thinking about all the ancillary things that might pop up all the food vendors who might pop up and service the construction workers.
Robin, I, absolutely agreed and noted the project area 2 advisory went out to all the elected officials and trevor I just want to confirm with you that I think your office have received that as well.
So I would like to recommend that you have notices sent to all the block associations in the neighborhood, because I'm sure that my block is not the only block like that people utilize that area with cars with walking with trying to access the ferry at 18th, street.
So yeah be aware of that, and you know you need to keep people informed about how what changes is going to be made right and as far as we know, right, now, I do not think any of the bus routes are being impacted, but John.
People are going to get confused, as we even saw on this particular Zoom meeting, but I think it.
Disc, like there is no impact to anything outside of those two components for this particular first step, but as we move forward and anything in any area that is going to have impacts to a wider group of community members or stakeholders or business owners, and it totally agreed and noted that would be a wider outreach and publication to everybody.
Where people might exit may affect them, but I think there's an understanding that any type of advisories will go out throughout the community and not just for one particular area with this particular advisory.
Our construction is starting in project area to Community, Board sixth district, with the first advisor that just went out a few days.
In the past couple months that we've received questions and feedback that the esker the e-cycles resiliency contractor, is walking around on the park and they're going to close it.
I just wanted to mention that with regard to Mwbe and section three, there's a community-based employment network in the neighborhood, the lower East side, employment network and lovingly known as lesson, and they have been working hand in very closely with the Essex Crossing project and they've had very good results.
Let us know how many contractors have bid on project area, one and secondly, in these extensions.
What, exactly the you know, the location of the project and then the list like the mayor, the local elected officials.
All right, I just wanted to comment on something that is omitted from this update and that's still the lack of open space and green space mitigation that, as this project is getting closer to being started that we do not have I went.
But if at next month's update, we'd like to not only be able to address what Daniel is asking, but just enough a brief update on the relocation of the bike lane for that area, trevor, if you do not mind I, think we have our D.O.T colleagues here.
If, you folks, I, do not know Neg or Jennifer if you're here, if you is there anything, you would want to clarify on that points, or should we come back next month, too.
We are working very closely with the parks Department and with it's an interagency effort to try to identify an alternative site for a lower aesthetic, ecology, center.
After a lot of back and forth, the Tribridge Pryborough Bridge Authority raised concerns and we are no longer pursuing that location, but we have been looking at alternative sites both like I, said within the city agency portfolio we've also been reaching out to Hudson river park, MTA and other non-city agencies to identify sites that meet the minimum footprint and preparation.
And so I just want to you know mention that all right, thank you and trevor.
And we're really going to make sure that composting, both as I think really essential to this project.
Is like a resiliency and a climate change protection for New York City composting has to be primarily considered as part of that long-term goal, and so we're here to be a partner to everybody, because I know that we all have the same goals: moving forward for resiliency, for combating climate change and for a really community-based park and amenity that gives back to the community and involves the community.
Thank, you, katie, I, think, for the sake of time that we're going to temporarily or just place this on the agenda for December as a separate agenda item, because we spend a lot of time on this particular topic.
I. Think you know, especially since we are working with individual buildings, and you know we really need somebody who knows the who knows the community best.
We spoke with last week, as well as with the Community board staff, and anybody who is interested or knows somebody who might be interested can also just send me an email we're going to be having that person will be doing about 10 to 20 hours a week for about three or four weeks of work.
We're looking to get as close to the project area as we can with all of this all right.
We had a meeting, and some of the residents who are from I would say up to about Delancey Street expressed that they would like to be informed in terms of outreach and concerns, because a lot of them do especially older people, do use that fitness area and use the area, and so they want to be informed.
So if you can, in terms of banners and materials, especially posted in lobbies, think about at least up to like delancy street, because you have a lot of seniors that walk over there and use the fitness area.
There's always sort of a balance here we, but we do want to you, know, concentrate our efforts in the project area as much as possible.
It was constructed by EDC and is managed by New York City parks in close cooperation with us, and then the pier 36 so-called apron area is managed by EDC and by our operator doc, NYC, which is the one that operates.
And I think we want to be responsive to concerns to make sure that we keep the keep the area operable and accessible to the public, while also maintaining you know, public safety to the degree possible, so I think we'd sort of like to get a good sense from the Community Board of Euros interest and how we can balance those things.
This is I, did not really want to kind of start this way, but understand where you're going just for some clarification when pier 36 was transformed into a doc or where it would receive doc.
That was sitting there for a week, and that was not what we thought this particular period would shape up to be understanding that we need open access to this area, because that was part of what the community agreed with, but also 35 and 36 are probably the only areas in our district which actually do not have a closure.
I know that 36 is in the hybrid area and 35 is managed by parks.
But I'd like to hear comments from other committee members about opening enclosure, time right and trevor.
We may not find a solution today, but we need to think about what a good closure time would be for this particular area.
Specifically, so I would say open it back from 6 A.M to 10 P.M, something like that, a minute at a minimum and in the summer later and longer, because we do not know how long this is going to go.
But I know that we talked about, could parks, Department staff or the seventh precinct or someone else who is also going to be in the area, operate the gates.
You know we look at the space going forward, especially consider Covid-19 that we can do some improvements.
That is something to look forward to once: we're able to work with basketball city to complete that project.
Past dusk I was able to walk all the way from the you know: northern entrance, there, by by the DOT yard of basketball, city, all the way down to pier 35 turn around and come back.
You were hinting at, there's a there's, a balance here, somewhere in the middle between making sure that it's open and inviting and a nice place to come for people, while also maintaining public safety and, like I, mentioned before you know, unfortunately, because of the fiscal situation it we are in.
Yeah, I, think what we're hearing well is that we need to look at an earlier opening time and a later closing time.
Can they just have to go and do it and a lot of times they're pulled away, as you know, from other activities in the city which has made it extremely difficult for them to sort of be in that area.
And, then we're also working closely with DDC and parks to do an interim activation of the pier deck at the part over water in order to help mitigate for the loss of open space during the ESCR construction.
The Parks Department was working with the community on a master plan for the area.
This is a subgrade work that technically needs to happen before we can actually start construction above ground, which would then be the upland park and the interim pure deck.
Completion in 2023 Brayden, just a couple things to add, really quick, since we had everybody solved before, which is where the construction management firm, that is working with DDC and parks on the east, side, coastal resiliency, project.
It was all going to look like one construction site, but we are doing a small amount of the sewer work on behalf of DDC as part of this project and then also as Nikita mentioned.
You know a lot of the sewer work is below ground and that needs to happen in advance of beginning construction on the upland park and the and the peer deck.
These are individual contracts that come under the construction manager, so I appreciate that DDC earlier showed you know, sort of the instruction manager and then like the bidding process for the individual contractors.
Because, over to your to your point, I think the I know that the work does connect into that intersection of montgomery and South Street.
Yes, it's very exciting, where it's not often that we get to say that we're building a new park on what was never really accessible to the public, so really happy about that regarding community construction liaisons, because we understand that it's important for folks to have a point of contact on the ground if they see or hear something or have a question about.
We are looking to work with the with the same set of people, if not the same person, that DDC is going to have as their community construction liaison at this most southern end of the esker project.
This will look like one big construction project when both it and ESCR are in progress.
We do want to make sure that we have one point of contact that can discuss both projects and can be you know, fluent and and to not have any sort of agency silos.
And I, think you know some something important to mention.
Sure I do not know if parks is still on.
Thought would be possible and also be able to offset some of the losses of the recreation needs that we know will be impacted when Esker's under construction, all right.
I think that the sewer work could be noisy and it like I said we'll potentially cross onto the streets and potentially have a traffic impact.
We'll definitely keep you all in the loop as we as we close to that, and then you know, like DDC, said once the contractors come on board.
That's left out of the greening of pier 42, which is the basketball city entrance area project like I might have mentioned.
But when we did not have a figure in front of us to refer to the heavy sewer work that has to come through here for the ESCR project does need to happen first.
The basketball city improvements are going to need to wait until after the sewer, work.
And I do not know if you're going to be able to access the ferry from the southbound area.
Diverted rerouted or you know, people are that you're going to be doing work in that area.
