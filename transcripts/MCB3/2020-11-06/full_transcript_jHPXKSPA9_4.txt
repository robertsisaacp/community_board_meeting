Okay, good evening, everyone welcome to the Manhattan community board three health of the monthly health seniors, Human Services, Youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting today we have on today's agenda. We have. One of our main items will be a presentation from the center for sustainable development at Columbia University, it's about an educational proposal that they have before. We start the meeting, though I'll hand it over to Larissa who'll, give who will give an introduction to how this meeting is being run? Okay, good evening, everyone and welcome to the meeting as May said, this is health and Human services committee for CB3. The meeting is being recorded. If you are not a member of the committee, if you could kindly put your name and affiliation if applicable, into the chat room, this is our our way of keeping attendance. We will be going over several like some items today during the meeting after the presentation may we'll be taking questions from the board members first and afterwards she will open it up for public questions. If there is time if there are any questions or if you're having any difficulty connecting, you can put information in the chat and I can try to help you, okay, thank you larissa, okay. So before we start, the main thing of the main part of the meeting I did want to have a little bit of a public session to see. If anyone has any community announcements about things, our organization is doing. I know that Eric has something. Yes thank you may and I'll take the committee's two minutes. I won't take much time just a brief update on vision, urbana's food pantry, since we have not given a report just a couple of updates for the end of the year, so I'm just going to I prepared a little statement here. So I'm just going to read off it. Give me guys so first, one is regarding our seniors just wanted to know that vision, urbana signed up to join a program moving for New York City called the silver service nutrition program funded by the state for one year to serve 8,000 seniors across the five boroughs in 2020, with about 20 pound boxes of groceries on a monthly basis. This began in December 2019 between December to March vision, urbana provided monthly distribution to a little more than 200 seniors, but during cobia 19 vision, urbana scaled up to provide more than 1700 unduplicated seniors in the lower East side, with more than 10,200 home deliveries. This, during a time when almost 40 percent of all pantries were either closed. City-Wide. As we speak vision urban is responsible for serving more than 20 of the total number of seniors registered in this citywide program. Vision, urbana will continue the program for the next two months. Two saturdays of the month, November 7th November, 21st, November, 5th and December 19th right food bank NYC does not know if this program will be funded again by the state. But if it does vision, urbana will look to continue. This program for the next coming year, although this next statistic is a modest number, the 1700 unduplicated seniors amount to around five percent of the total number of seniors living in community board. Three last thing announcement is that vision: Urbana is working with Cec one lila mejia, my cousin, as well since October, to distribute food to families in district one schools. Our first distribution was at the University Middle School, the former junior high school 56 on Saturday October 24th for more than 100 families received pantry. Our next event will be Saturday, November 14th at Manhattan charter school to serve over 300 families. Lastly, vision Obama is invested in serving the senior and youth of the lower East side with food security. We will continue to provide updates to the committee for additional support and advocacy when needed. So thank you guys for the time. Okay, great, oh eric kind of just a question about the food and the skulls. You know how the oe says that and Alicia probably knows about that too. You know that the you know they were giving out like food to everybody right and then, when school opened, they sort of moved those places. So you can't do not. So if you, if you're, not connected to the school, then you have to go somewhere else. So is this part of that, or is this just an addition to that program that you're doing right? In addition, I think vision? Urbana has, although we've been attempting to be more integrated in how the city rolls out it's it's food security initiatives city-wide so with the city at least so, we've taken it upon ourselves to leverage our existing relationships with food banks across the city and engage in new partnerships like with city harvest, our recent partnership that took way too long by the way to get a partnership out of them. We've been trying to get one since 2018, but apparently it takes a pandemic before they pay attention. But you know, do not get me started, but to answer your question, it's it's a separate thing from what is doing so we're trying to meet needs and where the gaps are as much as we can. Okay, great. Okay, any other questions for Eric or any new announcements about community programs. Okay, seeing none okay, we will start the meeting. So the first thing we will do is to approve the minutes. The minutes were sent out. Does anyone have any changes to it? If not, if they're, okay, as you got them, then we will consider them to be approved. Well, Thomas has his thumbs up and on myself, Larissa has two and I up Paul okay, thumbs up all right so, and everyone else seems okay, so it seems to be okay with everyone, so the minutes have been approved. Okay, so the next thing that we will do is that Thomas will take the roll call okay good evening, everyone we're going to start a roll call. Maylie is obviously President. Larissa President David Crane Okay Eric is President Shirley, Deborah, Jeffrey, Glass present I do not know if you heard that I put my thumbs up when you were asking. If there were any questions or whatever and I was like Nope Yay thumbs up I do not know. Maybe my mic was not working, but okay reported my vote. I'm here, thank you, tatiana yes, Heidi Schmidt Heidi was here she's here she's here she signed in, but she's muted, Ricky Wong here and Carmen Perez present. Okay. Thank you, okay! Thank you very much. Okay, so we will have a. We will start with our main portion of the meeting. We have several guests here today from the Columbia University Center for sustainable development who's going to present to us about this educational proposal. They have. Can you all introduce yourselves to us? You can start your presentation and also Larissa can assist you with any slideshows. If you need it great or are you going to? Are you going to show it yourself? Do you want us to show it because I think we have to do something if we want, if you want to show us, if you want to share your screen, do you need to share your screen or not? Yes, that would be great unless I think Larissa was saying something. Larissa started, oh great! Oh thank you. So much perfect hello. My name is hi. Sorry about that, I was muted. Thank you. So much hello. Everyone! Thank you so much for your time and especially to Susan and May, for really making this happen and for this opportunity for us to share our education proposal idea. My name is Hayen Shin, I'm the education advisor of the center for sustainable developments, education team, I'm here with Dr Radika Yangar, who is the director of education of our center and Tara Stafford Okanze, who is the senior education technology, specialist and they'll, be speaking later on in the presentation as well. So thank you so much. We were hoping that, while we want to share our proposal idea that there would be some time at the end for really to get feedback from you and to see if you have any questions so we'll do it in that order. So a little bit about us, we are housed within the Earth Institute of Columbia University, which conducts and blends research and in physical and social sciences. We have over 800 scientists and staff who conduct research, a big majority of them conduct kind of the hard sciences and the earth sciences our center. We focus more on the social Sciences, including education, health, economic development and the environment, and all of the focus in the institute is on sustainable futures. So our center is led by the Economics Professor Dr Jeffrey Sachs, who is has also served as a special advisor to the U.N Secretary generals and I mentioned that to say a lot most of the work we do. We align it to the global, sustainable development goals and specifically for education. We have worked internationally to provide international educational services, both in research and policy advising and some implementation, as well targeting low resource settings and hard to reach communities, but with Covid-19. We have really seen how educational needs are everywhere, not just in the countries where we worked previously, so we are being more inclusive and now we are exploring partnerships and conducting research and work locally and within the Us as well please. So our reason for reaching out today is really to see if a collaboration on community-based learning proposal, which is meant to address challenges during Covid-19, especially on learning and the learning communities, is something of interest and something that we could partner with community boards and given the current circumstances, you know with education, our home, our work, all the spaces kind of merging together we're exploring ways to better connect, the learning community, even outside of the physical and virtual classrooms. So, as with most of our centers education work, we really attempt to design our programs with community as the focal point and as the main base. So we wanted to reach out to Manhattan community boards to understand if this idea is something that would be fitting and aligned to Manhattan communities through the community boards, the please on the knees you could slide. Yes, the okay! Thank you. So you are probably all aware of the need the dire need currently. But what we're really trying to address is the strain that Covid-19 has put on many learners and the broader learning community, the families, the educators, the teachers and, as you know, the New York City, 1.1 million students now doing remote learning and the type of strain that it has had on the families and also the hardest hit areas in terms of Covid-19 cases, but also kind of the projections on children and youth trauma and behavioral wellness is that includes upper Manhattan and New York City Adjacent North New Jersey counties. So we know that these are not just figure, but we know that there is a real need for education, relief and different diversified programs. So from the pilot that we have done and from the educational contents that we have reviewed during these months, we have not really come across too many linkages of the current pandemic to environmental degradation and climate change. Learning contents that are really comprehensive. So that is something that we are trying to do. We can go to the please. Thank you. So with that. As the backdrop, our aim is to support learning quality, especially during Covid-19, to address the learning laws and the digital fatigue, with curriculum, aligned, home activities and we're aiming for these to be available, some components of it to be available online and for there to be physical activity kits because we recognize that everything is going digital and sometimes there is it's actually good to take a break away from that. So it's kind of a blended model and tara will share a little bit on the educational contents a little bit in a few slides. So we thought a great place to start would be with steam skills, as most of you probably already know, that's science, technology, engineering, arts and math skills that is kind of all-encompassing, but also that is a national education priority. That's being really pushed in all curriculum, so we thought that would be a great place to start, but really trying to embed climate change, education and social emotional learning, because we know that the type of burden that Covid-19 has had on learners and parents as well, and then teachers too, so really everyone. Next, five, please so our target beneficiaries, as I mentioned before we're really trying to start from community as our place to understand what the needs are. What is possible? You know what is what is going to be most useful. We have had some discussions with some school districts and some school district leaders, as well as teachers in both Manhattan, as well as New Jersey Millburn, particularly melbourne Milburn township we're targeting lower grades first, but the full spectrum would be grades. K-12 and learners with limited access to internet would be prioritized even within the city of New York. 16 of households actually do not have internet and, through a summer pilot that we did with upper Manhattan youth. Even within the group of about 15 youth, there were numerous students without access to internet, so we would prioritize access in providing some resources for online access through that, but also again, as I mentioned before, merging online contents and offline contents. So with that, we'll just give you a quick overview on the education contents and tara will go over these slides. Thank you. Thank you. So much and I'm tara on the team with Dr Radican Han, thanks again for having us so just to go into a bit more detail kind of highlight some examples of what we're thinking with the content. You know the concept is hand outlined we're thinking both long term as well as immediate term. You know thinking long term as we're addressing this. The challenges we're facing right now with Covid-19 and blended remote learning. We also want to be building sort of an online repository that can be useful over the long term to help educators integrate this. You know education for climate action, education for sustainable development into the core curriculum across subjects. You know focusing on steam, as well as the social, emotional learning, so that kind of online repository would be something we would be developing and then aligning to that. We would be developing these education kits. That would help address this digital fatigue and help create these opportunities for more hands-on action-oriented learning that gets the learners really thinking about how they can be part of the solution to some of these issues, Covid-19 climate change, etc. So, while we are thinking about how this can be useful for teachers in a formal education context, we're also thinking about you know working with community partners, we want these kids to be flexible. You know teachers can use them to supplement and integrate into what they're already teaching in terms of aligning to education standards, but also be able to have them stand on their own. So if families are able to use them on the weekends or after school to supplement what's happening in school, that's also something that we want to make this used in that way as well. So, for example, we heard earlier about the food distribution going on. These kids could go out as part of that you know through community partnerships. So that's something we're interested in potentially and another thing that we think is unique about. This is, of course, there are a lot of learning resources that are already out there that can be found online they're tackling these subjects of climate change, but they're not always linked to the curriculum. So how can educators think about how to use these materials in ways that kind of take some of the planning work off their shoulders? So if they know that they're covering this subject, the scope and sequence is covering this month they can say: okay, here's a here's, a lesson that will address links between coping 19 and biodiversity loss, etc. That I can use and kind of plug in this way to the learning standards that they need to cover so as hand mentioned. You know we're thinking about steam, so you know in this slide we can kind of see in terms of the science technology, engineering, math, learning about climate science, learning about energy efficiency, but not just theoretical, but providing tips and worksheets to think about how we can save energy at home, soil health and the links between things like doing kitchen composting and what that can do to help capture carbon and help address climate change linking these kind of at-home everyday activities. We can do to solving big problems and then linking that also to arts and social studies. You know, instead of just learning about the branches of government learning about you know what can I actually do? What kind of action plans can I make with my peers to push for solutions to these challenges and kind of bring that action? Civics component into social studies, learning things addressing environmental justice issues, for example, you know Covid-19 is exacerbated by for communities who live in polluted areas, so we can address science standards by learning about pollution and we can address. We can learn about math data analysis by looking at asthma rates in communities that live closer to polluting power plants, for example, and kind of explore those links across subjects and then with a social, emotional learning component. You know an example might be. We mentioned the kitchen composting idea and where can students and families find local compost drop-offs and you know locations around New, York, City I know a lot of the official ones are not operational right now, but there's still some community gardens and things like this around that are collecting things like that and taking that opportunity, when you're outside to practice some mindfulness activities and bring in some of that social, emotional learning and well-being to support all the challenges and emotional challenges that you know, young people and their families are facing right now. So yeah, that's just a little bit. Maybe if you go to the it kind of just walks through sort of an example of how the how we would think about organizing the online component and linking the kids to that, you know so, there's the state learning standards and then how that's translated into the scope and sequence that educators follow and then how our online content can be curated. You know, for example, if there's a standard on conservation of energy and energy transfer, which is something students are learning about in a third grade. That's the example. This is pulled from our online content, could include videos about clean energy tips for saving energy at home tools for tracking you know the little actions you're taking at home to save energy and then the hands-on activity components. You know, there's very inexpensive kids out there to make many wind turbines and do little experiments to see what's more effective, little solar cars that can be raised to study. You know different factors that make solar power more effective or even simpler activities for very young children. Construction paper make a model sustainable town things like this, so these would be the kinds of hands-on activities that we could develop. That could be distributed through community partnerships and would be linked to the curriculum so again, flexibility if teachers want to kind of integrate it into what they're doing in classrooms that's possible, but they also stand on their own and can help make learning more exciting and fun at home during this blended learning period. So that's just a little bit about that. Thank you. I'm back to hand now- and this is just a small example of what the kit could look like the bottom two pictures. We had actually used in a kit that went out for our summer pilot program to the students, but you know just as a quick summary this team concepts and some kind of guide sheet that tells them what the main concept is, that they're learning, along with a scientific method, worksheet and very easy accessible materials to make some of these kits and the barcode idea is something that would come in handy for later. As these kits get distributed for students who have access to internet, they can just scan their barcode on their mobile devices to find more information online related to that or additional resources, and there would be some kind of a checking back mechanism enabled through the barcode where a quick survey could be done by the by the learners, maybe even the parents who are supervising it and the teachers if they are using it, whether they use it in or outside of their classroom. So that is our main idea. So we'll open it up to questions now and then we have our director of education. Dr Eradica with us I have a couple of questions. Actually, the first one is, my name is Shirley by the way I. How are these kids going to be paid for? Are schools paying for them? Do you have a corporate sponsor or yeah I guess that's. My first question is: how is who's funding the kids very good question? This is, we will be applying for grants and we will be applying for various research grants. There will there's always a research component to whatever we do to so understand what these kids are good and what the children are. Actually, what are our expectations and what the children are actually learning, so it will be paid by the grants and but to write a grant. We also need to know who are our partners who will be willing to do this. So that's why we wanted to have an initial brainstorming session with you know: community groups like you to see whether, if you would be interested in this, then we could apply for a grant together and see. If we can, you know, write your reference in the grant to say that. Okay, this is a community board. This is willing to do this, and then we can. You know we try out different avenues. I open! Your question is what if somebody else wants to ask a question: yeah hi, my name is Thomas. I have a question: do you have resources? Because in our district we have a lot of students that are multi-language learners, formerly known as esl, as well as a lot of students in district 75 and especially the district 75 students have been hit very hard by the lack of internet connectivity in the district. So do you have resources available for these types of students as well? Thank you for bringing this up and it was actually it's very good that you brought it up, because when we design the kits, this is the input that we require so that we can. You know, make sure that we have. You know multiple language, translations and other things included in the kit. So we will make sure that we have. You know we've taken note of this comment on multiple languages and before, in fact, we'll put it in our proposal and every district and I think every community is different. So these are the inputs that we require to make a proposal song stronger and to make sure that we reach out to the most you know to the maximum number of for children, so we'll make sure that we will have multiple languages as the script, because, along with the kid there will be a short you know, instruction slip given and that instruction slip if it is in a language that the students are easily able to understand and the families are able to understand it. Obviously it will be more effective, so we'll make sure that it is in multiple languages before we. Actually, this is just a concept note and when we actually operationalize it, we will be speaking to you all much more. We will actually be talking to the school principals and any other partner that you think is very important to get these insights so that we can integrate all their ideas into the execution of the you know, proposal and if I might I'm sorry go ahead. Okay, we wanted to finish that and then somebody else has their hand up. Yeah I just wanted to add one thought to that. We're connected to a youth group called climate cardinals that does work to kind of crowdsource translation of climate education materials, and this could be something that they could support with on this project as well: okay, Debra hi! Thank you so I guess this is all great and I think that the ideas are amazing. I, think my question would be for you. Can you outline what a marker of success would be? So this is a very broad program. It's a very ambitious program. It covers multiple aspects of how we work with kids, to use the internet, how to engage them and work. But what would success look like for you, because they're what I'm seeing is they're this idea of having kids to get to kids and that's going to be a thing. How do you get the kids to kids there's this idea of? How do you have translations for kids in multiple languages? There's this I? There are a lot of wonderful ideas, but what do you see as like the first measure of success in this program, because it's so big and so amazing- and we want all of this to happen? But where do you find the moment that says this was successful? What's your first goal right, so we have indeed in our proposal, we've included, or at least brainstorm so far, very basic indicators to very complex indicators. So one of the basic indicators that we have is that our students are we going to. Are we reaching out to the number of students that we have proposed and whatever that number is, let's take that number x, so just the outreach have we done that or not another very basic thing is indicator. Is: are the students completing the activities? Are they having a lot of challenges, and so we will, you know, have a online, maybe completion of activity, photograph that the students or parents can take and upload it very easily either we'll do it through whatsapp or we'll make like a very simple portal with us to where the parents can upload it. So how many pictures of completed activities are we getting so very simple indicators? And then, of course, we in our proposal if we are lucky to have a much more detailed research plan, and if that is funded, we will do a lot of you know complex indicators in terms of social, emotional learning. We have a array of tools that we look at so surveys. We can do other. You know understanding of cognitive learning of students and so I, but I feel that for now, I think this round should be very basic, simple lean and mean indicators to know. Have we reached out? This is a pandemic situation, so I feel that very basic things you know can be tapped into right now and have the program in place just to get the intervention going and then we can build upon it and have various different layers so that we can, you know, make it much more robust and make it much more expanded. Our goal is actually very simple: it's basically to use steam as a mechanism to ensure that we do a lot of environmental education because that's clearly left out and it's very linked to Covid-19. So our focus is here: environmental education, with the backbone of using social, emotional learning and yeah. So that's I. Think basic. Bare bones. Is this and two or three indicators, which are very simple, are just the outreach and uploading of the photos and some indication of whether the students are having trouble with the kit itself? That's about it and but then we can of course build. You know huge compendium of tools that we can add on with the research component, but just to try out things doing. A small pilot is where we are right now and just to add one more indicator when we were talking more about more extensive indicators. One thing that we had discussed as a team is also the satisfaction level among parents as well, because really this pandemic has huge a huge burden, of course, on this on the learners, but on the parents in the home, moderating and facilitating the online has been huge, so our parents also seeing that the amount of time and activities that the student, the learners are using on these kids and on the contents. That is part of the kids. Is that useful? Or do they find that also useful, so parent satisfaction? Also it's one indicator that we would like to include if nothing else, I feel that you know, if someone gives a kid to my child, who is occupied not watching TV and using this kit at home. That will be a big success. So you know sim very simply put speaking like a mother and not like a researcher I feel that you know someone gives her something to do which engages her to do something which is non-tv and non-straining to the parents. That is a big success for all so given where we are. Of course, it needs to expand to much more other things and getting conscious about the environment and bringing all the environmental education part is something which can be easily integrated with very non-expensive kits because anyone have any other questions. I have another question, so obviously you're aligning it to the ngss standards. Have you thought about in New, York City, since there's a core curriculum for K-8 for science? Have you thought about partnering with amplify or foss to you know, make more seamless curriculum for, because what I've noticed with my children in school is that you know either the teacher is cobbling together a bunch of great activities or it's sort of this seamless transition from one activity to another, and I'm just wondering if you've thought about that, making a partnership with one of those core curriculum organizations that the DOE is already invested in a very good question, and we are in currently in discussions with a lot of people, including the Sustainability Board at the school. You know at NYC schools. There are also other superintendents and we are just trying to understand what the challenges are. How can we get integrated into this? What are the gaps that currently exist? So, yes, we've started the discussion, but if you have any inputs on that, definitely let us know I think we are open to all ideas right now, but the school superintendents in East Harlem district is very involved and very interested in getting this started. So that's one good sign that they saw that yes, this is filling in some gap. They actually want to use this as like a weekend activity that the teachers can discuss on Friday and how it is linked to the curriculum. The curriculum is already on. You know, put in place so how this activity is linked to that to the module that they are doing and then giving them giving the students this activity over the weekend coming back on, Monday and discussing it again is how they are wanting to integrate. But yes, we are still in discussions very preliminary discussions on curricular standards and how do we integrate there? And you said you had a pilot in the sum you had. There was a pilot in the summer at a school in Harlem, so that one was through a youth hub that is run out of near presbyterian. The module was a little bit different. It was on public health and community education, but for that one it was youth between the ages of 15 and 25, who were trying these kids and then kind of as a training of trainers using it with their younger siblings, who are kind of in that k through 8 age range and giving us a little bit of feedback on which activities worked. What they liked about it so yeah it was a small pilot with 15 youth. Okay, great any questions here, I do not see any hands raised. Yes, I know what we're so we're saying that you know we have, you know, are the students, the ones that are most in need? Are you know the english language learners? You know the district 75 students. You know this area is the area that it's deemed to have like a low. What is it called internet, a participation rate like people? You know there is broadband, but you know people are not on it for different reasons: it's not affordable or you know you live in a NYCHA building or just you know, everything does not work and then the other thing we have when we're talking about the neediest is are the students in temporary housing, so they could be in a shelter or they could be in double housing. So they live with. You know. Multiple families in the same house so I think that it would be great if they could benefit from this, but then there needs to be some more like support built in for them as well, like you can't just give them these kits necessarily. You know, because the parents might not, you know being there, and this is the album with the kids. Does anyone have anything else to say, or you know, is that correct? What I'm saying committee members yeah go ahead? Thomas I was going to say the the kit is a very helpful tool and I agree. It does help with the focus and but a lot of it too. If you're going to have a whatsapp or a different kind of platform that they can use. If we can partner, if you can find a partner who'd be willing to expand some of the internet connectivity that be a very powerful tool that could lead to the other results that we want to see with the environment and otherwise, so you know giving them access along with it would be wonderful. I know, that's a huge thing to ask, but it's a it is a pressing need and it's not going to leave anytime soon right and you are actually on target. We are speaking to verizon to see if they can give us some extra bandwidth or other things. But again we I have presented to various different team members in Verizon, and so I'm waiting to hear back to see they like the idea, and they you know, want to go ahead with it. It's just the geographic location and plus. We also are not very sure what the geographic location should be. It depends on the interest in the community. It depends on the need, so you know so I think there's. A lot of combination that comes together will have to come together. So, yes, we are in discussions with verizon, and hopefully they should be. You know coming up with the solution on to this thing very soon. Deborah did you want to say something? Yeah I just had one more question so in terms of how I guess, in terms of the implementation of what your ideal is, how are you connecting with directly with teachers or directly with educators? Are you in partnership with you know, I know that there are specific schools that you may have reached out to, but in terms of scaling it up, can you talk a little bit about how you've reached out to educators beyond, like the small communities that you've contacted with right? So we have actually reached out to the there is a sustainability department within the New York City School school system, and they are have you know, we've had this discussion with them and they seem to be open, but I think personally, I feel that it needs to be much more of a community-led, parent-led thing, because right now the school system is overloaded with new things and new changes to get one more thing to them. I feel that they might just be too overwhelmed, or it might just be very teacher specific one or two teachers I spoke to you know in east Harlem. They were fantastic, they were already doing it and they thought that okay, this is a great way to expand, but others are all dealing with you know all the great threes have to do everything together, so it requires so much of coordination and hybrid and online and in present and lot of different combinations, currently going on Deborah, so I. So right now, I feel that if we can, you know build this in through wherever the children are or wherever the parents are congregating, even at grocery stores. If they can just pick this kit up, it would be a good model to test out to see whether this kit can go with very little instruction and then see what comes out of it and then the second level probably could be getting the teachers involved, but I hear you because it has to be integrated into the curriculum. It has to be integrated into the standards and it has to do you know. Other things are there. We realize that the environmental aspect is neglected or is teacher dependent. So how do we actually bring in the environment? Because it's not just teaching math, you know just doing mathematics. It's also teaching environment topic through you know through the subject of mathematics, so we are trying to do a lot, but I think, let's focus on what we can do reasonably without straining too much of anyone's time, because we can do you know there are so many different combinations that we have here, but I feel that you know simple model with the communities involved with students. First, you know children at home and then with few teachers who are interested. Who can just give us feedback? We do not even know whether the kids will be. You know useful or not at this stage. We have this idea. Let's try the idea out with the short proposal or something that we can. You know try to get. You know some funding for and then see if it is useful for children, let's get their feedback. If it is useful, then we can say: okay, you know this is something of importance. Maybe out of ten kids, five kids will be useful. Five kids will not be that you know interesting. So we have a lot to try here, but we need all the feedback from you all right, you're asking the right questions to see where we can go with the with this. Thank you very appreciate that thanksgiving yeah, it's a oh one. It's a lot of wonderful ideas and you know right now. You know school has started and I mean you know, and it's I mean it's a mess. It's a mess right now right and there's a new change every day for the teachers, so they're just going this way in that way, I'm sure for those of you who are teachers, you know so it's a little I guess. I do not know about you, guys the other committee members, but we're having I guess a little difficulty. You know you want to recommend schools which one I do not know. You know, I know that some schools, just because they're more well-equipped will, you know, be able to take in more kits and more resources and more information. So student teachers are sometimes overwhelmed with resources. You know as well. You know so there's too many resources to choose from, but but then you know we have others. Where there's a need. You know other schools, you know like Thomas School, for example, you know where there's you know greater need Mm-hmm. So we can there's. Also here you know we also have so some of us are. You know our parents, or you know, are connected with the school I. Do not know if you guys have ideas, yeah, I, personally, teach in adulthood, so it's a whole different thing and I personally also know more about the the older English language learner schools. You know, but that's you know yet another thing I mean I mean the english language learning schools for older students. You know the 16 to 21 age group. Have you talked to the Cec Here school district, one? No, okay, our original idea was actually through grocery stores and churches, and you know, through other places where people are and through New York Presbyterian, like the hospitals when we had originally discussed this idea. But then we actually spoke to a lot of school districts and you know east Harlem, as well as the sustainability administrator office, and they became very interested. So we were actually leaving out the schools, but then they thought that, oh, why not schools? We can distribute it in our schools on fridays and there will be more context- and you know students can do this at home and we can come back so they became more integrated into, but some have given a positive response. Some have said that, okay, we need to do. We need to see the standards we need to do this. We need to do that, so we are doing it parallely, but I think we need to have a multi-pronged approach. Communities as well as students, I mean sorry as well as teachers and then board of education I mean well. There are the food pantries, there's. Certainly a lot of food pantries here and you know vision. Urbana is one of the largest ones and there's also food pantries in the chinese community as well, and there are community organizations that are running after school programs. You know for youth, so it may be a little bit easier to you know start there. You know, you know start with their programming. Since you know the school programming seems to be right. I do not know, it seems to be such a I. Do not even know what to call it, but yeah I think those are some very brilliant ideas: food pantry, wherever you know, people are there and it does not require too much. It's mainly like I, do not know if you guys have seen you're in Melbourne in New Jersey. If you go to the library there are all these activity kits in brown bags. You can just pick up that activity kit, bring your and bring it to your. You know home. You do not have to do anything with it post it not. You know you just do the activity with your child, it's a very similar concept. So, if we can pour, you know, keep these brown bags somewhere, but there needs to be some I guess. You know reaction in terms of uploading the photos and telling us whether it worked or not worked. You know so something like that, but it can be done easily through community organized or organizations, or you know, neighborhood groups that are active, even volunteers who are doing you know neighborhood cleaning or other things place them somewhere. Susan yeah I was thinking how about family shelters- and you know, along with you know, particularly organizations like Henry Street, that both run family shelters and after school programs. You know I would think, be good contact, okay, great so yeah we do have a list of the the organizations that run that so Susan you're saying we could pass it on to them right sure. I'd be happy to pass on some of the after-school organizations and family shelter. Okay, thank you all right. Anything else. Committee members, may sorry one thought. Also what about the public libraries I know? The one here steward park runs a terrific after school program with several children. I mean not right now in public, but in person, but they do run a lot of programs for the youth in the community and classes. I think that will be a great resource. I know their librarian. There is terrific she's, very hands-on, okay, so Larissa, maybe you can I, could definitely pass on your slide presentation to the librarian and let her know about your program. Thank you, okay, great yeah, so we'll follow up with that. You know, and you know we like to you know you know please keep us updated about. You know how the program goes, that's great and then maybe for writing. You know for grant writing other things. If we can, you know maybe we'll require one paragraph or you know whatever. You feel that is important from your site to include the community organizations that are being referred to here. I think it will basically give a house to where this project will be based, so I think any input from your end, in terms of which community organizations will be helpful, where we could do this. What are the names? Any connections will make our proposal. You know enriched in terms of the context yeah, so yeah we're often you know we're sometimes asked to support. You know various proposals for projects, and so the only thing is just to think about the timing. So you can't you so the timing is very you know you want to think months in advance, sometimes so it susan how much time three months two months well think of it by we schedule the agenda items in the middle of the preceding month. So in order for us to support a grant, it has to be posted on the agenda. So if I could know in the beginning of one month for the following month, that would guarantee that we could get it on the agenda great and it never hurts to do it earlier. It's never too early, okay, great, okay, so level. Thank you for coming, we'll follow up with those the organizations and like, and if you have you know any proposals, you know again, you know contact the off the office contact Susan. You know in terms of the grant proposals. Great. Thank you so much for your time today. Okay! Well, thank you. Thank you. So much thank you. So we will so we'll move on to the next agenda item, which is the cab reports. You're welcome to stay, but you're welcome to go as well. I know you want to, you know, have the rest of your night Free Cab, Reports, Cec reports, yep I have one we I did attend the governor cab. This is our first cab meeting with our newly installed officers. One of our biggest items has been. Let me get my notes up. Sorry, one of our biggest items has been our question about outreach to the community, especially in NYCHA surrounding governor. Regarding testing for Covid-19. We did get a follow-up from Dr Gagliardi regarding his outreach. They are part they are on Google search as an available test site and the Google search also links to their my chart, which is phenomenal because they can immediately go into my chart and look literally 24 to 48 hours after getting the test administered to find out their results, which is wonderful. They also list on the Google search hours of operation and they have a map with directions to get there to the testing site. They have also distributed over 3,000 flyers in the NYCHA buildings and they've also reached out to all the elected's office, and then you know they said they let reached out to eight electeds offices to give them the information I'm putting them in touch with Henry Street, who does food pantry Outreach, and they will be adding their flyers to the food delivery bags. We also received a an update on the tests. For example, they gave us one week which they tested 1,353 people only 12 turned up positive for the last four weeks. They have had zero positive tests for staff and, let's see and now also regarding the Covid-19 testing intent, the current location is going to be moved to make way for construction of the ambulatory center. We also got an update on their annual visits. They, the hospital, is on track with the number of patients visiting the facilities per year. It is not dropping due to Covid-19, which is great, which means that people are getting care they're, not postponing care during the pandemic and making sure they take care of themselves. There was also a ribbon cutting for the mural, and the judge in Judson Dr Gagliardi was very pleased, said. The our or Susan said the artist had done a wonderful job, capturing all the different faces of our community, and if anyone gets a chance, please stop by and see it is a really nice mural and we also had questions regarding the flu shot right now. There are concerns that they may run short on vaccines, so they are reserving those for community members who are over the age of 65 and for staff and there's also a program they're, also working right now to put together a plan to deal with patients who come in with a combination of both flu and Covid-19, so that action plan is being put together right now. As far as a potential vaccine. There is a plan in place to just to store and distribute a vaccine should that become available. They are going to distribute it first to healthcare workers and then those with co-morbidities and then it would cascade on down to the community. They are working on upgrading their electric system to support the freezers needed to store the vaccine and the distribution. Let's see what else, and as far as the nursing home members we have, they are working very hard to make sure that all the members stay engaged they're very concerned with the isolation of members due to limitations of you, know, in-person visits and they have been working with their physical therapy and the recreational therapy to develop small group activities and to get them out of their rooms and into small groups whenever possible, and that is about it. Any questions yeah. It does not look like it great, very good, meeting. Okay, great! Are there any reports from the Cec Community Education Council, the this ec2 meeting is next week on the 10th, so I'm planning to go to that. Okay, Cc one is the 17th, so I hope to go to that one as well: okay, great all right and no other cab meetings. No I have not been to any all right, so we're almost at the end of the meeting and I just one more thing since you know this is a very short meeting, as I mentioned in the email. I thought we could. You know, spend some time if people have ideas for future agenda items transition. Do we want to look at this crossing school Essex, Crossing School? We will. We still have to talk about getting more time. We never had that meeting yet so we said the letter was sent out so right before the shutdown we send out the letter we sent out the letter, maybe in January. So right after we passed the resolution that we wanted to ask for more time for the spate for the land and but we have not followed up in terms of having a meeting susan I think what was the idea that we could try to get someone to help with us with that I mean who did you want to have the meeting with? Was it state elected officials? Oh, no, it was with essex crossing about the Essex crossing people themselves. Is it delancey associates? Well, maybe we can talk about who is the best person to have the meeting with yeah I think I think we need to find that out because you know I think the property now is with delancey associates, but I'm really not sure of the city, and you know the interconnection of city involvement and delancey associates. Okay, I am in touch I. Have someone from delancey associates actually coming to my district service next week? Maybe I could ask her to you know to investigate who at delancey associates. We could speak to start there. Okay, that's the question to ask to say who do we speak to about? You know extending the saving the land for us extending the time on saving the you know, holding the land for school may I ask a question: deborah yeah, I guess: I know that over time there have been, we've talked about this a lot and there's been conversations. I. Guess I'm not clear on the actual timeline. Is there a timeline that says what I know that we're running against a clock or the sands running out of an hourglass? What is the deadline? What are we looking at in terms of the deadline itself? It was 23 or 24. That's probably in our district needs statement. Yeah it's in there it's 10 years from when it started, so it's probably 2023 or 2024. yeah. We just have to look it up, so it's coming soon. Does that answer your question. I was just sort of saying. Thank you Eric. Does that answer your question? Or was there anything else? You had to say yeah that also there's that community group and football for the life of me, oh goodness, the whole the benefit, the whole mountain Mount Sinai on Rivington house. There's that whole group that we're supposed to keep accountable well, man. Somebody help me anyway, I just wanted to follow up with them on that what their, what their plans are, did this? What are you still talking about the skull? Are we talking about something else? No moving enhancements. I'm sorry! Another agenda item yeah! You just changed the subject: Right Mount Sinai group. So that's a report that you could give me. Okay, so you're talking about that Bethesda's Montana best Israel Task force yeah. So they had a meeting a few weeks ago. You know it had not met since the shutdown it was like the first time ever. It was on zoom. So it was the elected officials there we were there, somebody from CB6 was there and you know the best Israel they're, you know their team, you know it's Dr Ball and you know the two brats you know Sabrina and somebody else or the the doctor from the Psychiatry Department. So they had. They said that they are re-looking at everything that you know the pandemic has told them that they from the pandemic from the whole situation. They learned that they need to re, they are rethinking their whole plan. You know about the downsizing about moving, you know. Everything is up for discussion again, so they're having internal discussions. First, you know they did not. You know say like they had not come to a decision about it, but so that's more around the downsizing. You know you know the they found out they, you know they need more bids and then you know more beds are needed. You know at the very least so in terms of the Rivington House. They are still going ahead with it. The only thing is that the construction I mean the opening will be delayed because of the construction has been delayed, because during the shutdown there was no construction, so I think in instead of I think originally it was supposed to open in 2021, so it'll be a year later they said, and then there was an issue with this clinic on 25th street that they said they would have to close it because it had been audited and there was a fine. It was a way that it was about Medicaid and they felt the you know. The audit was very unfair. It was just a couple of mistakes and it's something that happens often and they're trying to fight it. But but the result is I'll have to close that clinic it's on 25th street and Second Avenue. So it's not in our area, but the other are I. Think it's a methadone clinic, it's a methadone clinic right, so it was had to do with state audits. Question yes, Deborah! So that's it. So they said they would, they did not have a lot more information and would come back to us soon. Not you know I mean not too not like next week, but they would not be waiting too long either yeah go ahead. Deborah! Sorry, you finish and then I'll ask my question. Oh so it's someone asked if it would mean that the certificate of need would need to be like redone or resubmitted and they're. Who knows okay, so my question is: are these changes publicly? Are they announcing these changes, or is it only changes that are being discussed in meetings like? How do people know that the impact of Covid-19 on what they were planning to do in terms of downsizing is changing and I know you can't publish things because you're in the co in the in the in the process of having these conversations, but like I, guess I'm a little confused if things are changing in a way that impacts what the expectation is for care in the community, I'm wondering what their plan is for letting people know what's shifting I think they still need to do that. That's but they're. Just like letting us know something is coming, something is coming so yeah right, so I think that we should fall. We can follow up, I mean you know. Some minutes were sent out, you know, but you know we can follow up there, there's no future meeting schedule, but we need to follow up about how that's going to happen. Yeah I think it would be helpful to folks in the community to know if there's a possibility that things are shifting, yeah, no I think they should know, but you know, but the general at the meeting, the general you know, consensus was well we're glad you, I'm glad you're, seeing it this way because before they were not- and when was this meeting just out of curiosity, it was it was in March, no, not March, but two or three months, I'll, look at my calendar was it October yeah we found out I found out about the day before yeah I yeah I mean I. Guess I'm just. It was very recent for information to be asked at when they're ready to share the information of any changes that may be coming positive or negative. As it impacts the community and community care, it would be great to know yeah no I how they're trying to share that information with the community, because I know that a big part of what was happening with them was the idea that they needed to be transparent and open with the community, so yeah, no, absolutely okay. Thank you. Okay may, yes, also same vein on, but Rivington House focus the what we need to know what's going on any updates or if there's any more information on finding an appropriate building for a nursing home in the community. Well, as I said, they said that you know it's going to go ahead and accept the construction. I mean the opening is being delayed because of the construction and the I'm sorry, his name just escapes me, but he was at one of the meetings you know he's the doctor who's, the head of the psychiatry department, he'll be the one who's like leading, or you know, sort of heading off the hospital clarification. Please do you remember him, I'm sorry his name escapes me, but he was at the meeting the one that was at union settlement. Remember I mean university settlement, yeah, no I guess my clarification is for Larissa's question. Yeah, no I think you're yeah, I'm talking about actually a new nursing home, not a mental health facility. But are you changing the subject? Yes, sorry: okay, let's just okay, let's not jump from subject to subject. Let's just finish this one: okay, Susan did you raise your hand? Oh I was just going to address what Larissa is addressing. Okay. Are we done with this any more questions about Mount, Sinai, Beth, Israel, all right Susan, so I was just going to say: I think what Larissa may be referring to is the meetings we were having with Margaret Chin about the possibility. We were looking, it's the name of a trying to think of the name of the nursing, home and I blocked it out the one, the one that was not Rivington allure. So there were conversations with the lure, particularly with the attorney general. Maybe what we need is an update from the attorney general because has Covid-19 put pause on their timeline. You know to spend the money and you know, and give back to the community. Yes, that was the group I. Okay, would love to know. I know that there were questions about whether allure was going to be able to do something at Confucius Plaza, so I know that Covid-19 has upended everything in life, but it has not changed the fact that you know there were things that were supposed to happen and I understand that a lure group was dealing with a bunch of other things in terms of what their responsibility was in care of patients and how that looked with Covid-19 in the in the nursing homes that they already have. But what does that mean in terms of their timeline of making right for this other piece? So I get that we have to allow them to fix the stuff that needs to be fixed in terms of the care of patients related to Covid-19 and dealing with that, but where? How does that impact the timeline in terms of what they were supposed to supposed to do by law? So I think that's a question. We can go back to the attorney general okay, so that is a to do follow up with the attorney general on revenge on the nursing home, I guess. The question is in terms of the settlement. What does it mean in terms of the settlement and what they're required to do? Oh yeah guys? Yes, okay, so we will yeah. We will contact the attorney general Right Susan, yes, correct, okay and we'll get back to everyone about this. Okay, so anything else. We also I'm going to change the subject again, so we will also need to you know, remember before the shutdown we said we were going. This is about education. We said we would do a an event with cec1 regarding students with special needs like it was like a parent resource fair. So maybe we should just follow up and see what, where we want to go with that, do we want to wait till everything is back to normal when we can do it in person or is there something else we want to do also tatiana? Could you ask them that when you go to the meeting yeah I can ask I thought we said last month that we decided on doing it at a later month? I'm not remembering right now. What month but I remember last month he did discuss maybe doing a similar event later. Well, no someone just suggested, maybe in the spring gotcha. Okay, all right but I. Think there's you know a lot of I mean I thought we'd be back to in-person meetings by now. So yeah there's a lot. You know a lot to think about yeah I'll ask them what they think and what they think of the needs for like a partnership event. Maybe yeah, because you know these loom meetings are nice but they're very limited as well yeah all right, any anything else that we need to follow up or talk about. Oh Susan, the the homeless partnership provider idea, I'm sure I can just let people know about a conversation. I had with Eric Rosenbaum he's the CEO of project renewal, which in our community board runs the third street men's shelter and Kenton Hall, and we were talking both about how the community gets involved with the shelter they're, the ones with the our residents going into the hotel Lucerne on the upper west side. All the commotion is about our third street residents and they're now, working with some really great community groups there and he's been actually very inspired about that and talking about opportunities when they move back, which could probably be anytime from February through late spring and he's very interested in being much more engaged with the surrounding community in programs years ago, the shelter I think was more engaged with the community. That's kind of fallen out recently. So you know, I said I would bring that to the board. I thought people would be interested. We really do not know what that looks like, but you know it looks like they will be coming back into the shelter you know. Possibly we could have them come to the committee and have people bring ideas on how to interact I think it might go even though the community, it's mostly cooper square residents around there, have been generally very supportive. There also have been issues and I think it would be very helpful in sort of getting rid of the Us and them tensions. I do not know if there's any thoughts about that or any ideas. Is it something that people think they would want to pursue I think it would be worth pursuing. This is Larissa okay, and was there something about I, I'm sorry, Heidi did you have something to say? Yes, I was just typing yeah I was just saying that I do think. It's a good idea. I think it's good to do those types of things before you know before an issue explodes into the communities that relationship building kind of destigmatizing humanizing. All of that stuff. Okay, May did you want me to also mention about the networking of agencies together, oh yeah! That would be good okay. So another idea that came up- and this is something gail Brewer tried to implement on the upper West side because of the move into the hotel- was to get all the providers working with homeless in any connection, whether it be Shelter, Street, homeless, other service providers, substance abuse to have all them, create a network for the community and be able to possibly coordinate care information, which is always difficult because of confidentiality. But more can be done than is being done. So that's another possibility. Gail said she would be happy to try and help us down here. If we were interested in trying to help facilitate something like that, I spoke about it to the supervisor at goddard. Riverside, which is in charge of the street homeless, outreach down there down here, and she said she would try and think of how that what that would look like and also speak to people at goddard who had been involved with it on the upper West side, because I do not even know what at this point, what the agenda would be. It's you know it's basically, a networking of the professionals working with that population. So you know it's something: to pursue they're, you know going to come back both Gail's office and goddard I think we'll come back with thoughts about it. If it's something that our board would like to help facilitate if it seems like a productive thing. Okay, any questions about that. All right, any other agenda items to suggest yeah may I had an educational concern. We were given a lot of assurances before the start of the school year that there would be random testing of up to 20 of the persons in the buildings. It has not been done in district 75 and we were the first ones that were pushed into the buildings for in-person instruction. I was just tested randomly for the first time yesterday and it's just not it's not equitable students in other zones. Obviously, oh he's frozen and you know I sat within a meeting with them last week and it just was. There has not been a plan they're, making a plan in November to address the needs of district 75 kids in terms of random testing, so I do not know if that other schools are having those issues, but it seems pretty rampant. You know, oh, what do you think we can do? Is there? Is it just somebody we can advocate with or talk to or well I mean? Maybe when Tatiana speaks with the cec to find out? What's the parent's view on the random suffering of their kids, because it has not been done, yeah I can ask about that. Okay, if there's any kind of like action, we should take or a position. We should take or a letter. We should write or you know we I mean you know we should put it on the agenda pretty soon like next month. So, but it is good to find out what the parents think too. So that meeting is a couple of weeks. Yeah it's the 17th, but I could also reach out to and ask her if she knows anything about that sure she does. Okay, so, and so Thomas you're saying it's a problem, particularly with the district 75 schools. Yeah we were like, students have not been tested, and you know we're a lot smaller than most other schools, but the way I put it to somebody I said well, you know, are the students and Stuyvesant more important than the kids in our district? You know they need to know if we're contesting positive too. So you know they do not have an answer yet in terms of d75, okay. Anyone else about this d75 issue, yeah can I ask: is there any kind of parents Association or anything comparable to a cec for the district 75? No, we work with the cec, so I mean that you know we actually had somebody come through about a week ago did a walk-through of our school because they feel it's very well run in terms of signage and how we manage the students, but the testing. You know some of the staff is a little leery, because it's only been teachers that were tested yesterday. It should have been guns in September, but there's no parents group for the no other than a PTA. There's, not a specific group assigned to it. Okay, yeah I did not know if there was any special advocacy or you know you know, networking around. You know that district I can ask you know if there's anybody specific, because they we have not. You know we pretty much advocated for ourselves for many years. You know yeah I assume you would know if there was a parent's group. You'd probably know about it. Okay, all right! So if there are no other things to talk about in terms of the future agenda, we can start adjourning. The meeting me yeah I do not know if it's a future item, but this was just in from department for the aging they've begun, what's known as a friendly voices program and it's a program that matches seniors with volunteers so that they can get in touch with each other on a weekly basis to kind of cap off the social isolation situation. Oh okay, did you want to say more or do you're thinking? We should have a presentation about it or you're, just letting us know about it well to let you know, because again, I just got the email today. I would I would certainly like to know more about it being that within at least our Community board area, we do have a large amount of seniors who live alone. Oh so you just heard about this program, but you do not know how the seniors are going to access it right or who, where the volunteers are coming from. Is this a run by difta? Yes, difta, along with the I believe, is the thrive NYC program, so there's Diff Diploma go ahead Susan. Why do not you talk? First, I'm just growing the minute you say thrive. You know it's like! Well, that's going to be I won't say anything I could always contact someone adifta to see if they want to. If you want me to pursue that to see if they want to give any kind of presentation sure our next meeting is December, the 3rd okay, you know in terms of timing, all right, susan, if you want I, can forward you the email that would be great, so I'll have the right information. Thank you. We just one of our former reps that used to work for Deborah Glick and has been moving around is now I, think head of external affairs at different, so for the future, we'll have much better contact and representation there. Okay, great so I think we've covered just about everything, and can we have a so we'll make a motion to it during the meeting and then we're also going to take. The attendance may I make the motion that we adjourn I'll. Second, okay and we'll take the attendance okay. So may here yes, larissa, yes, David no David's there, eric yeah, Shirley, yes, Deborah, yes, okay, Tatiana, yes, Paul, yes, Heidi, ricky, yes and carmen yes, okay! Thank you! Okay! So the meeting is adjourned full board. The next committee meeting is Thursday December. The third and full board is in a coming a couple of weeks in October, November and November, so good night, everyone, great everyone, okay, see you at Full board, see you guys at full board, have a great one stay safe. Everyone, hey I'm here by the way, yeah.
