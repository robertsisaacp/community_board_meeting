Okay, good evening, everyone welcome to the Manhattan community board three health of the monthly health seniors, Human Services, Youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting.
We will be going over several like some items today during the meeting after the presentation may we'll be taking questions from the board members first and afterwards she will open it up for public questions.
Right food bank NYC does not know if this program will be funded again by the state.
Three last thing announcement is that vision: Urbana is working with Cec one lila mejia, my cousin, as well since October, to distribute food to families in district one schools.
We, have worked internationally to provide international educational services, both in research and policy advising and some implementation, as well targeting low resource settings and hard to reach communities, but with Covid-19.
Our reason for reaching out today is really to see if a collaboration on community-based learning proposal, which is meant to address challenges during Covid-19, especially on learning and the learning communities, is something of interest and something that we could partner with community boards and given the current circumstances, you know with education, our home, our work, all the spaces kind of merging together we're exploring ways to better connect, the learning community, even outside, of the physical and virtual classrooms.
What we're really trying to address is the strain that Covid-19 has put on many learners and the broader learning community, the families, the educators.
The teachers and, as you know, the New York City, 1.1 million students, now doing remote learning and the type of strain that it has had on the families and also the hardest hit areas in terms of Covid-19 cases, but also kind of the projections on children and youth trauma and behavioral wellness.
Our aim is to support learning quality, especially during Covid-19, to address the learning laws and the digital fatigue, with curriculum, aligned, home activities, and we're aiming for these to be available, some components of it to be available online and for there to be physical activity kits because we recognize that everything is going.
So we thought that would be a great place to start, but really trying to embed climate change, education and social emotional learning, because we know that the type of burden that Covid-19 has had on learners and parents as well, and then teachers too, so really everyone.
We also want to be building sort of an online repository that can be useful over the long term to help educators, integrate this.
You know focusing on steam, as well as the social, emotional learning, so that kind of online repository would be something we would be developing and then aligning to that.
While we are thinking about how this can be useful for teachers in a formal education, context, we're also thinking about you, know working with community partners, we want these kids to be flexible.
You know, teachers can use them to supplement and integrate into what they're already teaching in terms of aligning to education standards, but also be able to have them stand on their own.
How can educators think about how to use these materials in ways that kind of take some of the planning work off their shoulders.
So you know in this slide we can kind of see in terms of the science technology, engineering, math, learning about climate science, learning about energy efficiency, but not just theoretical, but providing tips and worksheets to think about how we can save energy at home, soil, health and the links between things like doing kitchen composting and what that can do to help capture carbon and help address climate change.
We mentioned the kitchen composting idea and where can students and families find local compost drop-offs and you know locations around New, York, City.
When, you're outside to practice some mindfulness activities and bring in some of that social, emotional learning and well-being to support all the challenges and emotional challenges that you know, young people and their families are facing right.
If you go to the it kind of just walks through sort of an example of how the how we would think about organizing the online component and linking the kids to that, you know so, there's the state learning standards and then how that's translated into the scope and sequence that educators follow and then how our online content can be.
We will actually be talking to the school principals and any other partner that you think is very important to get these insights so that we can integrate all their ideas into the execution of the you know, proposal and if I might I'm sorry go.
Are they having a lot of challenges, and so we will, you know, have a online, maybe completion of activity, photograph that the students or parents can take and upload it very easily.
You, know, understanding of cognitive learning of students and so I, but I feel that for now, I think this round should be very basic, simple lean and mean indicators to know.
This is a pandemic situation, so I feel that very basic things you know can be tapped into right now and have the program in place just to get the intervention.
It needs to expand to much more other things and getting conscious about the environment and bringing all the environmental education part is something which can be easily integrated with very non-expensive kits because anyone have any other questions.
I'm, just wondering if you've thought about that, making a partnership with one of those core curriculum organizations that the DOE is already invested in a very good question, and we are in currently in discussions with a lot of people, including the Sustainability Board at the school.
I think we are open to all ideas right now, but the school superintendents in East, Harlem district is very involved and very interested in getting this.
They actually want to use this as like a weekend activity that the teachers can discuss on Friday and how it is linked to the curriculum.
It was on public health and community education, but for that one it was youth between the ages of 15 and 25, who were trying these kids and then kind of as a training of trainers using it with their younger siblings, who are kind of in that k through 8 age range and giving us a little bit of feedback on which activities worked.
But again, we I have presented to various different team members in Verizon, and so I'm waiting to hear back to see they like the idea, and they you know, want to go ahead with it.
I feel that it needs to be much more of a community-led, parent-led thing, because right now the school system is overloaded with new things and new changes to get one more thing to them.
So right, now, I feel that if we can, you know build this in through wherever the children are or wherever the parents are congregating, even at grocery stores.
It's also teaching environment topic through you know through the subject of mathematics, so we are trying to do a lot, but I think.
Our original idea was actually through grocery stores and churches, and you know, through other places where people are and through New York Presbyterian, like the hospitals.
But, then we actually spoke to a lot of school districts, and you know east Harlem, as well as the sustainability administrator office, and they became very interested.
Communities as well as students, I mean sorry as well as teachers and then board of education.
You know the school programming seems to be right.
So, something like that, but it can be done easily through community organized or organizations, or you know, neighborhood groups that are active.
And you know, along with you, know, particularly organizations like Henry Street, that both run family shelters and after school, programs.
I mean not right now in public, but in person, but they do run a lot of programs for the youth in the community and classes.
How: do people know that the impact of Covid-19 on what they were planning to do in terms of downsizing is changing.
Yeah I think it would be helpful to folks in the community to know if there's a possibility that things are shifting.
How they're trying to share that information with the community, because I know that a big part of what was happening with them was the idea that they needed to be transparent and open with the community.
I. Think it's good to do those types of things before you know before an issue explodes into the communities that relationship building kind of destigmatizing humanizing.
Riverside, which is in charge of the street homeless, outreach down there down here, and she said she would try and think of how that what that would look like and also speak to people at goddard who had been involved with it on the upper West side, because I do not even know what at this point, what the agenda would be.
I would I would certainly like to know more about it being that within at least our Community board.
So you just heard about this program, but you do not know how the seniors are going to access it right or who, where the volunteers are coming.
