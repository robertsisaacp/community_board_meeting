Are you good, okay, great I, think we have most folks here, so we can go ahead and get started just a couple of ground rules for this, since this is probably going to be a more active discussion than we usually have in economic development.
Be limiting comments to two minutes per person from the public and the way that it'll be structured is that all committee members will have a chance to ask questions.
Could we better support cultural institutions during cover than this pandemic and help turn the city into a stage and figure out ways to work with them to create additional opportunities for income and to share their work during this time when venues and spaces are closed, theaters are closed and there's limited capacity for work.
The spring we've been working on this program called open, culture, You've probably heard of open restaurants and open streets and the idea of taking our public spaces and using them for things we usually do inside, but bringing them outside.
There are a variety of fees forms you need to fill out and different agencies approving different steps to getting a permit, and through this bill, and through this program, we'd, be turning into one application: One portal for free or low cost for organizations, arts, institutions and artists to do that programming and bring their work out into the city.
The, specifics of it would be it'd, be starting in March or the idea is to start in March and go until Halloween of next year, allowing for 2021 the nicer months to for these outdoor programs and events, while we're still figuring out what's going on with Covid-19 and the city is still responding to that, and for this it would allow for rehearsals and performances.
It would be administered through SAPO street activities permitting office and eligible organizations would be cultural institutions that have received previous department of Cultural.
It would be open to open streets as of right now, but we're exploring further options, so more spaces might be added later on, but the beginning would be open streets and for the program we are still negotiating final details, but for participation it will likely be a small fee of about 20 for a permit in order to engage in this program and get a permit for outdoor activity, And I'm open to other questions as well.
It's, a nice relief to hear that the city is working on making the permanent process in any capacity simpler and cut in a lot of the red tape, because I think that's a big hindrance with businesses and institutions being able to conduct business and stay in business.
Closed stages, are closed and most work for artists is very limited and we want to kind of turn the city into a stage into a theater into a performance hall and allow for ticketed and donation-based events to allow these artists to make a little extra income at this time and continue some of these traditional programs and for ticketing, cultural institutions, and these artists are great at figuring out ways to charge.
How that would realistically look like being able speaking with cultural institutions, folks have passed the hat done, So it's like similar traditional, like busking methods, or they just put on a QR code and have people scan to sign or ticket or pay for a ticket on their phone or have pay for a ticket in advance, going through their website and attending the event later on.
Right, now, The, latest version of the legislation that we're working on the language for the specific spaces is up to determination by the department of transportation and in communication with the local council member.
They want to stay they'll, Ask them to buy for pay for a ticket, make a donation and like pay for their viewership and help support the artists, but if not they're, welcome to just listen pass by and then continue on with the rest of their day, but if they want to stand on their street, if we have an open street and people want to stand on their open street without buying a ticket they'll be able to right.
Don't know the specifics of how long they would all be, because it's case by case and what people are applying for and what's permitted through street activities permitting office, So they would need to receive a permit in order to rehearse for the set amount of time that they apply for so right, now, SAPO doesn't have any criteria.
We've heard from organizations applying for Zappo, permits, pre-covet and middle of this pandemic, that they didn't get approval until the day of an event or the night before, and that's not a condition that we want to keep happening with this.
What kind of feedback, have you received comments or criticisms or objections to the pending legislation, just to clarify the question just like their response from the mayor's administration and his office.
It's a cultural community within New, York, City and helping them out during this time when their spaces are closed, they're unable to do performances, Our city was able to respond for small businesses and our restaurants and bars through open restaurants and open storefronts, but still have minimal efforts and resources for cultural institutions, The second largest economic driver in our city.
But it's taken a lot of work to clarify a lot of what how the current processes that exist for permitting and supporting cultural institutions could be barriers for participation as well and get in the way of them doing their work so trying to find ways to create a program.
With this program it would be trying to get rid of those issues and those discrepancies and allowing for those sorts of programs to happen at the same time as outdoor dining on those open, streets.
Ask Alex, I, think a lot of maybe the salient issues of concern, because certainly you know, the argument in favor is that we should try everything we can to support a decimated industry in any way.
What is private, what is public but where the Astra place, or even Cooper, Square Park, you know places where there's much more space, especially if you're going to permit ticketed events without restriction, which to me has the potential for inviting a lot more people to an area, and there are some open streets programs that just can't accommodate.
I, hear that the idea with this legislation and what we really wanted was to allow cultural institutions and artists to permit on pretty much any open space in the city that includes parks.
Make sure to find some way to make that accessible for permit artists are so creative in how they could use space, and we want to make that available to them, But in working with the mayor's administration and the city on this and furthering this bill, we have found legal limitations to some of those spaces and with open streets as a starting point.
We want to test this out a little bit as well, and we know these cultural institutions will be able to actively use these spaces.
So I understand the concern and we're looking to expand it and get more spaces added in, and we are just looking for an opportunity for these cultural institutions and artists to share their art with the communities and make a little money.
I have a couple of questions and then a comment will like open streets where restaurants are allowed to create.
Will, art institutions and cultural institutions be allowed to create structures, because right, now, I would say, Every structure created by a restaurant is illegal and does not meet the department of buildings requirements that we heard about last week.
What footprint would a place like that be allowed to have I mean theater for the new city also has an issue right in front of them, which is why, when they do their big events, They do it on 10th street and basically the street gets closed off for the duration, which is fine.
All organ, all these organizations are eligible to apply to permit on open street, so not necessarily right in front of their establishment, but any space within the open streets like catalog of streets, available, okay.
We heard from several residents last week and being a resident myself that between right, now, the restaurants, the open streets program with the restaurants is not well managed and makes it very difficult on any given day to just get from point a to point b, if you're just trying to get groceries or get home from work.
While it makes perfect sense that we need to do something, It almost feels like it's a shame that our arts and culture institutions weren't considered before the restaurants, because the restaurants have now occupied so much real estate.
It's, not every cultural institution, has a brick and mortar space, and we want to make this available to all the organizations and artists out there from like a random quartet to a visual arts gallery to a dance studio to a local theater.
You know the lower east side has been identified as having more performing arts organizations than any other neighborhood outside the Broadway area, So the closures are really significant to what is happening to our theaters and the fact that they've never been part of any plan for reopening.
I'm I want to say that it is important for local cultural organizations to be able to continue to be present to their communities, many of whom are here.
You know access to the open streets program to the opportunities to perform for folks in their own neighborhoods.
They want to share their art with their neighbors because they're the people like they live in that neighborhood for a reason.
If I can just follow up Jack, I'm wondering because the legislation has developed quite a bit since when it was originally written, I think it would be great if I could do an update with our membership about where things are now and what the what you're working on, or even the obstacles, you're running into, and I'm, wondering if I can follow up with you to see.
We want to make sure they are thinking about Covid-19 in this, If they're going to have a more structured, stage, event cast crew and audience, We want to make sure that they're thinking and acting appropriately and for enforcement, the institutions will be helping with that and making sure people aren't gathering if they are asking them if they want to donate things like that on getting people to cross through the street, but they'll be similar enforcement and regulation for open streets and open restaurants as well.
I would want to ensure that this, the people who benefited from this were our local cultural institutions and that not random cultural institutions or arts organizations could just get a permit to perform in the lower east.
I. Think everybody here has agreed that they would want to be supporting local nonprofits for the permits.
That's a further conversation with the mayor's office of special enforcement, the local NYPD precinct and that community and finding a solution that works for that neighborhood, because it's going to look different in every part of the city and how these streets work.
The office of special enforcement is too overwhelmed and really is not spending their time on this kind of thing, So I just want people to be realistic.
One of the people who put forward this resolution and first of all, I, want to thank you and your boss, council, member Jimmy, Van Bramer, For that you know working tirelessly for arts and culture for the city and also for understanding that it is not just about industry.
Even though I understand the need for priority for local organizations, I would think twice about legislating.
You know not just CB3, but all arts and culture of the city, thanks Olivia and with the local preference.
I think the idea worth exploring finding it based off zip code or within that community, district or neighboring that street, and we don't want to necessarily segregate folks.
I think you should definitely considered all of what the council members have told you I do want to mention that I was in a video conference, call organized by the Department of Cultural, Affairs, Commissioner, Mr Casals and the street activity.
Permits office a couple of months ago, and they wanted to update us specifically cultural organizations that you know have a relationship, a long-standing relationship with both of these organic institutions, and they were very clear about the new restrictions.
It's a good intent, I think it's hard for us for city agencies to coordinate, and it looks D.O.T and Zappo, and the major's office still trying to figure stuff out, and it's very important that you reach out to the right.
And we're at a point where we might see this start next spring and make spaces more available and the permitting process more accessible for cultural institutions and artists of all sizes and profits and wallet sizes, And what have you to be able to bring their art to the street and make a little bit money off of it.
We, don't know what the whole cultural ecosystem is going to look like next year after the summer, and so it is open.
My question is actually something that Susan said: I just wanted to clarify, and it was about the concern over having permanent and unpermitted events and in open cultural spaces.
You know all of our cultural institutions are non-profits and are subject to the same kind of registration and certification of our safety plans, so I that is in place, even if you have just like one person coming into your office, so I'm just trying to understand why that would be a concern, particularly given in the past.
I view this resolution that we are going to be working on as our opportunity to say that we do have some concerns that we are supportive of this legislation, in the sense that we are supportive of a program for arts and culture to be able to have something in this pandemic.
Yes, I think it's really important to pass the resolution in support of the legislation and saying that we want to support something being done to support arts and cultural organizations.
But I do think it is important to show support for the legislation for the impact that it has on the arts and culture community in our neighborhood.
Guess, it's a matter of opinion, because I do feel like it's important that we craft resolution and that it's passed that because I think that it shows support for a section of our community that is suffering right now and is undergoing terrific.
Okay CB3 supports the New York City Council Bill Intro 2068-22, proposed by New York City Council member Jimmy, Van Bramer, chair of the City Council Committee on Cultural Affairs, Libraries, International, Group, Intergroup relations to facilitate outdoor performance permits for impacted arts and cultural organizations and recommends amending Mayor De Blasio's emergency executive order.
To allow amplified sound for outdoor performances as regulated by local state and federal guidelines, with enforcement by local precincts, whereas New York, City Council member Jimmy, Van Gramer has proposed legislation, Intro 2068-2020 to facilitate outdoor performing for art events and performances produced by established organizations impacted by Covid-19 and whereas it has been a great loss to the city as a whole that in the warm summer and fall months of 2020, outdoor arts and cultural programming was banned and the focus was only on assisting the restaurant, industry.
By Covid-19, The sector lost 69.2 percent of its total jobs since February 2020 according to the center for an urban future art in the time of Coronavirus New York City, small arts organizations fighting for survival and whereas the impact of the loss of accessibility to the performing arts has also had a detrimental effect on the emotional health of our community.
Therefore, we urge mayor De Blasio to amend executive order 148 by banning all amplified sound so that outdoor performances, which would be regulated by local state and federal guidelines and enforced by local precincts, would allow established arts and cultural organizations to be accommodated and make performances accessible to the general public, As this would allow performers to go back to work and funnel funds to the support of economies that support that supply.
So, as opposed to a band which I appreciate the difference between the band and the allowing the amplified sound, again, So, I, don't even know if it's speaking to what the information was that we got tonight, but I think we should amend it to be consistent with whatever the up-to-date discussion is because it seems a little different.
Other thing is I think we should comment on the fact that, although we support this, that there I don't believe that there has been anything worked out.
It doesn't sound to me like there's, been anything worked out about the anticipated consequences of grouping all the grouping and the cultural organizations, Together with the outdoor dining and the people in the street.
At the same time, there should have been open streets and what to do about shut down cultural institutions and performance spaces and open dining, but they didn't do that right, so.
However, basically, What I wanted to say is that currently, if somebody abides by the law, there is not a way to get illegal permit to host outdoor arts.
But yes, So what I wanted to say is that actually what Susan is talking about is a little bit more nuanced, because, given the fact that there are legislation and that there are executive orders and state and city orders.
So I believe that this resolution needs to focus on the arts and culture and what this legislation is working.
Even if the translation passes an outdoor performance, theater or whatever, they would need to have amplified sound, so we're trying to say that once they will have a permit, they will also need to be allowed to use, amplified sound and that's why we wanted to address that.
Other thing is that you at this time they may be allowing off the record roving bands to play, but actually legally, you can not perform in the street without a permit period.
This resolution is addressed towards arts and culture organizations, doing a legally permitted process and have to you know, accommodate arts organizations that haven't been able to perform or work all right.
Other thing that you have to look at this, the new wrinkle and the legislation, is now asking the arts organizations to pay twenty dollars a pop for, if they want to rehearse and that they would have to apply for a separate permit for every one of those events that they do on the street, whether it's a rehearsal or a performance.
Okay, It's just like there seem to be a lot of things being written into the legislation and negotiation with the mayor's office.
The resolution is about trying to support an industry that is suffering greatly right now and allowing them a legal process by which they could perform and by which they could ask for donations or sell tickets, at least not meant to address people who are roaming, the streets doing whatever they want to.
We have more comments, I'm going to keep it to committee members for the time being, since there are still a number of them, but please be thinking about how this resolution is going to reflect all of the things that we have all been talking about, because we do need to get there.
This permitting process, But this resolutions also appears to be asking us to support the overturn the adjustment to an executive order banning amplified sound, There's a lot of background noise.
It's like it states very clearly that the outdoor performances would be regulated by local state and federal guidelines and enforced by local precincts would allow established arts and cultural organizations to be accommodated and make performances.
It's saying that if the executive order could be amended to allow the use of amplified sound to go along with those permits to me, That's what the interpretation is.
They just go on a binder, while arts and culture committee members and the constituencies that we represent feel really like.
This resolution, I want to remind everybody, is from the arts and Cultural Committee, and it is subcommitting.
We wouldn't be discussing many other things, but basically it is about arts and culture, and the legislation is drafted, That way, because.
And I believe it is our duty at CB3 to also you know, reflect that in a resolution and all these other concerns I believe they're, very valid concerns, but actually are part of that downhole that we're going to do and the resolution about quality of life, but has nothing to do with the legislation designed for the needs of arts and cultural organizations.
I know that there are other hands up, but I think we're going to keep it to only committee members for the time being, because we need to finish drafting this.
Both committees decide that they want to include, It seems like maybe asking to amend this executive order.
This concept of amplified, sound, so I wonder if there's a way to reference it without saying amendment of this executive order, because whether it should be a separate resolution or not I think maybe it's something around again that we have a lot of noise in this neighborhood, and you know we want to make sure that considerations around ample time sound or sound permitting is included.
What I would say is that there should be awareness clause first of all, maybe like in this at the top, maybe after the second, whereas first, whereas clause that the CB3 understands that now this proposal will at first because I, understand they're trying to have it in more places will at first be limited to the city open streets program and whereas CB3 recognizes that the city has failed to contemplate the possibility of cultural institutions, utilizing open streets or any public space, while also permitting open dining, as well as continued pedestrian, use.
That if it's included in the resolution, as whereas that arts and performing arts organizations would need to have access to amplified sound for street performances, I.
The legislation is for any kind of outdoor arts and culture organization, activity.
I. Think Alex to your point, there's probably a better place for the third one, But let me just do it in the surface of reading it, which is all right, so the three new clauses, whereas CB3 now understand now under right, that this proposal will at first be limited to the city, open streets program and, whereas CB3 recognizes the city has as yet failed to contemplate the possibility of cultural institutions, utilizing open streets or any public space while permitting open restaurants and dining and expanded pedestrian use, and whereas CB3 is concerned, The city has not yet adequately addressed how the current open streets program will accommodate this use in its discussion of this legislation, so that exhorts the city to establish clear guidelines and parameters for this added use and its enforcement.
Go up some more so this opening bold statement in my opinion would end at outdoor performance permits for impacted arts and cultural organizations.
Olympia is the impact of just of amplified sound in an order already noisy over saturated, So I want this to clearly be put in the context of supporting the ability for art and cultural institutions to perform in a way that is, you know, conducive to what they need to do.
We then maybe we should move that particular phrase further down and construct it like this, whereas Cv3 recommends further recommends that the city executive, order, 148, amended to allow amplified sound for outdoor performances, which would be regulated by existing local state and federal law or federal, guidelines, I, agree and also Joe, I.
Therefore, We urge the city to allow established arts and cultural organizations to be I, think it might change.
We urge the city to allow established arts and cultural organizations.
I would either to be accommodated by allowing them out to perform outside you, know, or in the open streets program or I, would say to host outdoor performance.
And I, want to have a performance on the street, I need to apply for a permit, and that goes through Sappo.
And whereas CB3 is concerned, the city has not yet adequately addressed how the current open streets program will accommodate this use, open brackets, which would include the ability to have amplified sound in its discussions of this legislation, so exhorts the city to establish clear guidelines and parameters for this added use and its informa and its enforcement, and therefore we urge the city to allow established arts and cultural organizations to hold outdoor performances accessible to the general public, as this would allow performers to go back to work and funnel funds to support to the support economies that supply performances, maybe a tweak there and therefore CB3 further recommends amending city emergency executive, order, 148 to allow amplified sound for outdoor performances, which would be regulated by existing local state and federal guidelines.
Cb3 supports the NYC console bill, Intro 2068, to facilitate outdoor performance permits for impacted arts and cultural organizations for the title, I, agree, and then, If no one has anything else for the next paragraph, should it be intro in the title or.
I think it detracts from this section talking about why we want to support arts and culture so just delete what I have highlighted.
What was for which part of the paragraph that says, therefore, given that CB3 is concerned, yep I was going to suggest saying therefore CB3, then the last part says exhorts the city to establish clear guidelines and parameters for and then putting the current open streets program to accommodate permitted outdoor performances.
I. Just think it would be a little more clearer just saying that we're exhorting the city to allow the permit permitted outdoor performances.
And, then you know we're saying what we mean by saying: The open streets program will accommodate permanent outdoor performances, but then maybe you don't even need the first line because you say it more exhaustively in the second part.
Okay, title CB3 supports the NYC council, bill, Intro, 2068 2020, to facilitate outdoor performance permits for impacted arts and cultural organizations, whereas proposed legislation, Intro 2068 2020 would facilitate outdoor art events and performances produced by established organizations impacted by Covid-19 and whereas CB3 understands.
Therefore, we urge the city to allow established arts and cultural organizations to hold outdoor performances accessible to the general public, as this would allow performers to go back to work and funnel funds to the broader economic ecosystem and therefore, Cb3 further recommends amending city emergency executive, order.
To, allow amplified sound for outdoor performances, which will be regulated by existing local state and federal guidelines, and therefore Cv3 exhorts, the city, to establish clear guidelines and parameters for its open streets program that will accommodate for permitted outdoor performances and their enforcement, and therefore CB3 supports Intro, 2068 2020, which would benefit Cd3 arts and cultural communities and the overall local economy.
I'd like to ask one question: sure: go ahead: It keeps referring to arts and cultural organization, but you are individual artists that are not established cultural organizations and there's only one portion of the, whereas that referred to artists, there, but I understand that most of the people who would probably benefit from these are individual, artists, I, think you're, right.
I think that those are parameters that evolved out of their discussions with the mayor's office, because the way that, when you looked at the legislation, the way that it was originally drafted, it wasn't like that.
I, think I also want to make sure that everybody understands the bandwidth of the committee and the office to facilitate these things.
Now, so I want to make sure that the committee knows that they need to be plugged into this also, and it's not just going to be able to be me and Susan running around.
We're waiting to get back a possible date for January and everything to go forward with the town, hall, Then, I think what we would need is for the committee members that are here.
I mean my understanding is that in the last meeting we just decided that we want you to have a town hall meeting with the electives to understand what are they doing in general for supporting artists and arts organizations, not just about reopening.
I, don't know if you saw Susan's email, we heard back from Carlina's office right, so I think that she had availability.
Instead in the previous subcommittee meeting last month, What we discussed was a downhaul that would address the you know what is happening at our artist and arts organization right away in terms both of intermediate support and long-term reopening agenda, and we were discussing about elected officials.
19Th is a little bit arbitrary because of Carlina, and maybe the kind of people who actually you want in a town hall and the arts and cultural organizations that hopefully will attend.
One of my questions will desire would be the Serrano for sure from the state, but also Jimmy, Van, Bramer, and also the commissioners, DCLA and mom, because those are ultimately the people who will have sway and insight on the issues that the arts and cultural organizations and artists will want.
The reason we want Serrano is because he chairs the arts and culture committee in the state.
You know what actions they're taking in order to support and arts and cultural organizations in this difficult time, As well as the city.
I want you to say that at the assembly, so we have New York, State, Senate and Assembly at the assembly, The Arts Committee Chair is Danny O'donnell, with whom I worked in a lot of issues around small business and culture, and so he could also be a good candidate to invite and to Anissa's point about which.
Think that, in terms of you know, support and programs and policies, the people who need to hear that would be more.
So, City, Council, Senate and Assembly, and the commissioners and our council woman, the reason for which it was suggested that the last meeting reached out to her was because, If she becomes a co-sponsor and the outreach comes from her office is going to be more effective in getting quick dates because elected officials, they can make themselves available in a second for various rallies and things.
I, think that if you would look like, if you want to go through or continue working with, Susan on it, I think we just ask I think she needs a complete list of the people.
And he's always been very supportive of arts organizations that I know of in the neighborhood and shows up at demonstrations, performances, and he always gives a good report, but at any rate, going forward.
So he says he thinks we should allow arts and culture organizations to provide testimonials at the beginning and then allow elected officials to address their testimonials through presentations then allow for a question to answer at the end.
Okay, That is the other way, is that perhaps we could come up with a way for arts and culture organizations.
You know, I, think that what's complicated is trying to manage something like this on a zoom without having some format in mind, because in the past, when we've done it in person, we've done it at theater.
Okay, all right so Anisha I was gonna, say that I think it's just a question of figuring out some more of the zoom features, because I have been on webinars or other meetings where you know just like our full board, meeting.
Right I think you know also too, We would have to set a limit for time and stuff like that and structure.
You know, and you certainly want a diverse bunch of people right or organizations.
What I'm saying is that if we want, you know, I, think Olympia's point was very good, that we need a broad spectrum of the arts community in the neighborhood.
And ask people that you know if they wish to comment about what the situation is with their arts organization at this point in time and how it's been impacted by Covid-19 and what would they hope that the city state officials could do to help.
Is that, if we're asking people to email, testimony or and or video clips, so I think that's something that we would have to figure out how it's going to come to us whether it goes through the office.
The participants and in the meantime, If each committee member could check the arts and culture list that is on the website and make any edits that you feel need to be done, So, I, think.
