They I'm suddenly seeing a lot of fire engines on those days, come west to avenue a and then turn north on avenue, aid, which does tie up traffic Then, today, I found out from a restaurant owner on avenue b that they're now talking about also closing three to four third street to fourth street, because as long as you have the block before closed, you know they have no The mayor's office has heard so many complaints about these closures done without even notifying the community.
At the borough service cabinet meeting, and it's not community board three, it's you know it's probably most of the city, but very certainly all of Manhattan, I'm, not alone in reporting, these, and I do not know what to tell you.
When you vote in the beginning of the meeting and to adjourn you Don't need a motion, you don't need a second, and when you take minutes, you really shouldn't be using anyone's name.
They, also came to the meeting, and the committee asked a lot of questions and the development team would address those questions in the next presentation and we also finalized the district statement.
And, you spoke before landmarks, susan- I, just I saw that michelle made a comment about the broadband report that I had sent to everybody, and I just wanted to make sure that people look at it and look at our community.
We only had maybe what two comments, michael, where people were trying to make statements, but once they realized that it was only going to host it sort of stopped, so I found it to be extremely effective in stopping second meetings, thanks all right.
The committee, worked on the district needs statement and they will need another meeting in august in order to finalize that which I think carolyn communicated to susan today.
The meeting went fine, but you know having three new members and working on the district needs.
I want to just also suggest that since they're already on the economic development committee for a report for august 5th that they bring what they've done for the district needs statements, because in the past that I know, there's been some confusion about how much to include- The committee was under the assumption that they were not meeting in august.
The one thing I would say about having this on the economic development agenda for august, like an update from the committee, is that no actual revisions to the district needs statement happened.
So are we voting on district needs in committee, or are we just adopting it?
We've talked about this like at least three times in the exec and this year we will be voting this year in instead of voting on the district needs in august and then voting on the budget priorities in October.
You know like doing any extensive work on the district needs.
I. Just don't want to go into a whole discussion about the district needs in October from other committee members, but if we haven't voted on it, how do we sort of prevent that?
