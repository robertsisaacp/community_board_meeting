Ask you what the information you gave about needing the waiting room and all that who is that coming from zoom zoom sent out a like an email, update?
The fire department was not on the call, but dot's answer to this was that they can take the they can get out and move the barricades, which of course, is going to add time what it seems to me that they're doing instead , they I'm suddenly seeing a lot of fire engines on those days, come West to avenue a and then turn north on Avenue aid, which does tie up traffic Then, today, I found out from a restaurant owner on Avenue B that they're now talking about also closing three to four third street to fourth street, because as long as you have the block before closed, you know they have no The mayor's office has heard so many complaints about these closures done without even notifying the community.
Basically use the word discretion, which means that they're not really going to be doing much as the mayor's office or any of the public officials talked about solutions for the Covid-19 uptick in young folks, because they're not enforcing, or at least as far as I can see.
You know I'm going to certainly bring this up again tomorrow morning at the borough service cabinet meeting, and it's not community board three.
I think there's only two committees that met since the last time that we met it was SLA, So nothing to report So. We did not pass any resolution and on 70 Marbury street update.
They, also came to the meeting, and the committee asked a lot of questions and the development team would address those questions in the next presentation and we also finalized the district statement.
And, you spoke before landmarks, susan- I, just I saw that Michelle made a comment about the broadband report that I had sent to everybody, and I just wanted to make sure that people look at it and look at our community.
The committee, worked on the district needs statement and they will need another meeting in August in order to finalize that which I think Carolyn communicated to Susan today.
The meeting went fine, but you know having three new members and working on the district needs.
The district needs for August and they won't be ready to obviously have it approved by economic development until September, Lisa and Susan I wanted to ask first of all.
I want to just also suggest that since they're, already on the Economic Development Committee for a report for August 5th that they bring what they've done for the district needs statements, because in the past that I know, there's been some confusion about how much to include- The committee was under the assumption that they were not meeting in August.
The one thing I would say about having this on the economic development agenda for August, like an update from the committee.
So are we voting on district needs in committee, or are we just adopting it?
We've talked about this like at least three times in the exec and this year we will be voting this year in instead of voting on the district needs in August and then voting on the budget priorities in October.
You know like doing any extensive work on the district needs.
I just do not want to go into a whole discussion about the district needs in October from other committee members.
