To be honest with you, so we're going to move on vice chair first life shares report, Nothing drastic they've, reinstituted the the ability for the host to unmute people more easily The. Only other thing is we're doing a webinar on august 3rd, at 6 30 with lorelei salas who's.
With this they I'm suddenly seeing a lot of fire engines on those days come west to avenue a and then turn north on avenue, aid which does tie up traffic Then, today, I found out from a restaurant owner on avenue b that they're now talking about also closing three to four third street to fourth street, because as long as you have the block before closed, you know they have no The mayor's office has heard so many complaints about these closures done without even notifying the community board.
Also, the neighboring organization, such as henry street settlement They, also came to the meeting, and the committee asked a lot of questions and the development team would address those questions in the next presentation and we also finalized the district statement.
The committee worked on the district needs statement and they will need another meeting in august in order to finalize that which I think carolyn communicated to susan today.
The meeting went fine, but you know having three new members and working on the district needs was I.
The committee from the agenda sent it out and then had to revise it So someone could, let me know like first thing.
I want to just also suggest that since they're already on the economic development committee for a report for august 5th that they bring what they've done for the district needs statements, because in the past that I know, there's been some confusion about how much to include- The committee was under the assumption that they were not meeting in august.
Absolutely and I will communicate with carolyn to make sure that, like we're in better communication about that, the one thing I would say about having this on the economic development agenda for august, like an update from the committee, is that no actual revisions to the district needs statement happened last night.
Yes everything else on the on the economic development agenda looks good, though well Okay, lisa again I'm just talking about the new business Sorry, let's go to trevor first time trevor , it's a quick question, and maybe susan or the other community members could answer.
