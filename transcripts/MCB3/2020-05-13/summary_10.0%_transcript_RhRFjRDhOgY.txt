I know, there's others in the public who I've been asking about a potential agenda item for next month and wanted to speak about it for two minutes.
My letter specifically requested that the committee sees that the behavior of the police union is what kind is what allowed the NYPD officer who are rank-and-file to feel a sense of impunity when they treat member of the black and Latino community?
There will be two resolutions put forth, but first we are talking about these hundred miles of streets, program, that's being implemented as a result of this unprecedented time and pandemic I believe there are representatives of Councilwoman, Carlino Rivera's office that are here: Gonna represent councilman Rivera's, office.
A lot of the need for it came out of the conversation she was having with doctors and medical administrators as chair of the hospital's committee, people, who are really concerned about the lack of social distance, and we are seen on our city streets over the last month.
I think they'll probably have more specifics about that kind of aspect of the program, but getting to kind of, like the last major points that I wanted to add on what kind of streets that the Councilwoman envisions this program in going forward with and how we are going to continue working as a council office with the ochi because do T are the experts when it comes to having the traffic engineers and the surveyors and Road people who can manage and can implement these things and bring the supplies that are needed.
That's doing a great job on this that you know around kind of the visioning, because we believe the main thing this part needs to do, and we hope this program will do in the days and weeks to come, because we do think that you know we're expecting streets to be announced.
Just do not have the open space that even areas like community, board, 3 and I think a lot of us in Canadian board.
She is working with other members of the City Council to encourage them to go to their community boards and to their community groups and ask them what streets do you think could potentially work to get those to do?
You know things that make it difficult to do a street in a certain area like if a bus route goes along.
If one Park has you know a minimum number of entrances, how can we open streets to help with the flow traffic in and out of parks, or if you have a particular the same kind of you?
Think we're here just to really listen to see what kind of streets you guys want to see in your neighborhood and You know we acknowledge that this is an emergency.
Members are important part of that conversation, and we think that you know if there's issues that you guys see with any of these streets that are being implemented like, let us know let deity know.
Do any of the committee members have questions right now for the for Jeremy or for Jennifer Paul And I was confronted by a sanitation vehicle coming straight at me, going straight across going west across Rivington I was at the terminus on Essex Street and they just moved the barrier and started driving down the street, which is to me extremely concerning about how this program would be implemented in reality.
There are so many exemptions for different types of vehicles to drive through the street, I mean just looking at the website, its local deliveries, pickups drop, necessary City service, vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles.
I. Think involving the community to make sure that there is that you know that there are clear, So, there's clear, signage and clear understanding the months officials that these are five mile-per-hour shared streets, basically for the fuse for the few vehicles that are permitted to access the street temporarily I think it's going to be part of an education effort that we need to do.
I think that's where it's really important, where those community groups that are coming in, because if they are noticing, you know that there's a lot of need for a coned repair activity for Verizon activity, I know, we've probably had it on my street.
Think they're gonna have effective tools to communicate to the city to the right enforcement officials.
So I, was told by the mayor's office that they're gonna start having social distancing ambassadors on the street because of all the complaints with a B, since these are places where pedestrians are congregating, but we still want people to social distance.
I saw Jim Shelton's hand raised first Jim, hi, And You need to have a sponsor community organization and one of the requirements Is that they staff they provide staff or the street, but there's additionally, no funding available through D-O-T How do tea is thinking about that because there's lots of organizations or streets who might identify, but there isn't necessarily two people power to staff for 12, hours.
Do. You want to just point as a clarification, the first round of streets that were open there on the parks, those are being run by the city right, now?
I'll get to Susan in the second The first thing: I'd like to sort of understand, is the purpose of safe streets, because I think we're all looking at different definitions of what this street program should look like I know.
I know the bill in the council, but I want to know about for this particular program, because I think it would be helpful to let people know that you're going to see some traffic on the street It's not just an open place street And, you've sort of touched on this and the whole equity issue, which I think we're going to face with a lot of the requests for the for these streets.
You know any Street that doesn't have a community partner The purpose is evolving And I know a number of community groups, and particularly business groups- You know it's the part of the second resolution that Tim from the Lower East Side partnership has is about discussing other ways to use a space,, the only ones we have from groups, Jan Lee's email that I think Michael will share later with a plan, that's from a group and then Jimmy Carbone suggested 7th, Street and I'm sure he would have enough people in his group to do.
They had a very short, very short conversation, but one of the things they said was you know, particularly from the second street, being accessed, to be able to respond to pick particularly fires, east of that of Avenue B.
It's important for people to know they don't want to go off the next day, because one person in a particular neighborhood said: hey, let's close the street without letting residents, know so for VOT, And, I.
Being my you know, being the person mayor of the black and helping manage things, maybe that's a good way to get young people involved this summer If they take this job on I.
Okay, I just wanted to raise the idea that if there is a concern of safety issue on Avenue, B I think there is a need.
We've seen some of the you know, brutality, that's gone on and again most people have good intentions and wanting to preserve the health and the public health of the neighborhood and the community.
Some people I get a little too gung-ho about that and then forget about the whole reason that we're doing this You know there has to be some type of innovative ways to find out how we can again enforce social distancing and remind me of the public the importance of that without breaking social distancing and bringing more because what I've seen happen.
It comes to the open streets program, you know again we're working with do T, so I can't speak with, and we're advocating for things to do.
So naturally, I strongly support the open Street project and not only to ease the pedestrian movement and to allow for more space for safe physical distancing, but I think we also need to think about what's coming up next and that we have to prepare for the needs of people.
And I think that the model that we have there - the issues with the limited hours is a really good model, because if we consider the potential reasons why we might want these streets for transportation, for recreation, for just the ability for people to leave the house and still have still maintained space having a network like this, where there's basically it's a lot easier to sort of have a few choke points where we limit access and slow cars.
That's closed during weekends for bikers and pedestrians, and the one thing that I haven't heard about is: We need enormous amount of signage, big signs that would indicate to drivers what the rules are when they're in effect, so that people know that the street has a special use.
We can use a lot of the younger people who want to get community service points or folks who are looking for jobs, training to be part of this great community network and help people get the recreation space that they need, while keeping them safe.
I. Don't have a dog right now the council and has a wonderful pug, who has certainly I think with appreciate more open streets as well, but that you know I'm, not The councilman's budget director said I want to comment.
I know you can only be on for another 10 minutes who we need to do better job social, distancing, We need avenues, but I just raised the issue aside streets too, because this crosstown opportunity for social distancing is there As well I, just I just really wanted to open those two We saw this past weekend below house and Street, seemed to work out well.
You know I mentioned sixth Street in 10th Street, just because they have access to the park and of people doing social distancing and going to the park closing off the streets, something they would both be near.
Yes, I have a question about to the people that want Avenue, B, open, That way, when that's the only firehouse that serves like lily and wall.
You know some of the comments about opening one lane might be a possibility, That seems like a better possibility, a dead, closing the whole street down There are certain streets, such as any Street with the bus, lane., say: b3, then most of Manhattan there they're very busy, but I do think extending they know taking the parking Lane could be a possibility.
You know getting uncomfortably close to people I believe it meets a lot of the city's criteria, which is that it's next to a park, Network , there's, no bus and so on.
Could, you repeat exactly what street was it that we actually I'm the sushi restaurant on 249, Broome, Street?, The public portion I want to thank everybody from the public that have offered comments and commentary tonight, and questions for car Lena's office, because woman's office and the Department of Transportation But for right now we are actually going to move to the resolution, and that will be just committee, discussion.
You know I would love for young people to get jobs, especially with us, I'm, also concerned about us forcing street closures on some streets where residents may have a reason for not wanting that so I'm a little concerned about outreach not being done quickly enough to the concerned residents and the other thing Having heard the of the fire department's concern about that, I.
People were very upset that the first round of streets did not come from the community board, since there is going to be another round very quickly, because that's what the community is asking for, and city council really pressured the mayor to do this.
Given you know, it's a Susan's point that we didn't have a lot of time to quote, but this street the streets- Our job here, is to make recommendations based on what the community wants to see and we've gotten already and So. Maybe if we as community board members, decided on this the list of streets that we'd like to see something happen, and perhaps we add that language to the resolution as well , Can I suggest it might be helpful to read the resolution.
I think we need to put Avenue beyond that on the bullet point list, whereas some streets that will not need agency criteria for approval to be closed as designated safe streets are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing.
You, know street calming measures like fiction cons or to be discussed at one point: Or you know, or the things we're talking about now about increasing, basically extending the sidewalk space that we want them.
Okay, I need to adopt the broom between orchards and Chinatown's, known for its extremely narrow streets and sidewalks, and as someone who walks the neighborhood, every day, I can't even social, just missing now: So I'm, pretty sure, with more people coming out for walks daily walks, and that really would be It does rely on deliveries because it's so small business focused right.
You know what the situation is on those streets like you're, I, would ask and again I'm not advocating against any of those suggestions as long as their priorities for the community It's my fault and everybody's had a lot of say here tonight and from the Committees of the public, And I think that's what makes it a priority if they believe that this street should be closed for social distancing, issues, If, it's a priority for the community for a see me for the members of cb3.
That's my there in the situation where we need the space, All right, Thank, You, Susan from the committee, There's, not a lot of foot traffic right there between Jacob Riis and Haven Plaza, but there's a lot of car use because of con Edison and the power plant , that's a closed Street, because so many people we got to make that left to come around anyway.
Community board 3 recommends the designation of the following streets as safe streets to be temporarily closed to vehicular, traffic or otherwise adapted to permit adequate social distancing on the adjacent sidewalks.
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, the city should return to community board 3 with any additional proposals for safe Street designations, going forward.
Can you talk about this resolution that you have in front of us, firstly, I just would thank the committee I think it was a long but robust discussion about open streets, just quickly.
The program was launched in a very quick fashion, I think in an effort to get more public open space operational as quickly as possible, and so I think with anything that moves this fast, especially during an emergency like we're in we learn as we go, and so a lot of the things that have been mentioned today already in the works.
The use of the streets for commercial activity and for commerce and social distance has been something that's been successful, and so in the resolution we seek to expand upon the open space program that is there today and to look at potentially those larger closures being places where we can have people enjoy socially distant commerce and be able to, for example, get something at a restaurant and sit within the roadbed and areas where those open streets are not available, because we can't close every street really strategically thinking about the ability of a merchant to take their method of operation and apply to the city to use the parking spaces adjacent to their storefront, as so that they can have additional outside space for commercial activity.
We wanted to try to put a resolution together to begin a conversation, not only with the committee and the community board, but really try to put a marker down to say these are the guidelines and parameters which the city should consider as they make these decisions.
We will see, you know, likely increases in people being outside businesses trying to engage in a new normal with significantly curtailed operations that they're able to open.
The goal of getting a resolution from the Community Board was to really try to understand what the parameters could be and to be able to have an earnest discussion with the city and with our local partners about you know what guidelines and what kind of framework they might work.
, just I do think it's transportation, related, and so that's why we wanted to come to you folks to be like listen ,, we're asking for your support and exploring how this can work and pushing the city to put parameters on something, as opposed to just saying it's going to happen, anyway, and you all having a conversation like we did with open streets where they had rolled something out.
Yes, it's Street side parking, but, As you launched into it Tim, you were saying you know, measures that the community board has been comfortable is supporting in the past.
Community born three supports the creative use of targeted portions of roadway to enhance public space through the construction and potential expansion of the open streets program and be it FURTHER.
