Member of the committee and safety I used to be on the same committee at Community, Board, And I wanted to bring up the issue because we all saw the video that happened in the corner somewhere in your district, around 14Th Street.
There will be two resolutions put forth, but first we are talking about these hundred miles of streets, program, that's being implemented as a result of this unprecedented time and pandemic I believe there are representatives of Councilwoman, Carlino Rivera's office that are here.
A lot of the need for it came out of the conversation she was having with doctors and medical administrators as chair of the hospital's committee, people, who are really concerned about the lack of social distance, and we are seen on our city streets over the last month.
I think they'll probably have more specifics about that kind of aspect of the program, but getting to kind of, like the last major points that I wanted to add on what kind of streets that the Councilwoman envisions this program in going forward with and how we are going to continue working as a council office with the ochi because do T are the experts when it comes to having the traffic engineers and the surveyors and Road people who can manage and can implement these things and bring the supplies that are needed.
A lot of parts of the city of New. York, unfortunately, just do not have the open space that even areas like community, Board, 3 and I.
She is working with other members of the City Council to encourage them to go to their community boards and to their community groups and ask them what streets do you think could potentially work to get those to do?
You know things that make it difficult to do a street in a certain area like if a bus route goes along.
If one Park has you know a minimum number of entrances, how can we open streets to help with the flow traffic in and out of parks, or if you have a particular the same kind of you?
Think, we're here just to really listen to see what kind of streets you guys want to see in your neighborhood and You know we acknowledge that this is an emergency.
Members are important part of that conversation, and we think that you know if there's issues that you guys see with any of these streets that are being implemented like, let us know let deity know.
Do any of the committee members have questions right now for the for Jeremy or for Jennifer Paul I was walking down Rivington Street this on Sunday morning during the 8 to 12 time, when this is a pilot and I was confronted by a sanitation vehicle coming straight at me, going straight acrosss going west Acrosss, Rivington I was at the terminus on Essex Street and they just moved the barrier and started driving down the street, which is to me extremely concerning about how this program would be implemented in reality.
There are so many exemptions for different types of vehicles to drive through the street, I mean just looking at the website, its local deliveries, pickups, drop, necessary City service, vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles.
So, typically, when you say well, the street itself is not meant for everyday cars who just go through, so Anyone that needs to make a delivery, no matter what type of truck or vehicle they are able to get into that space to do the delivery, but as they are doing that they are also, let's go really slow by miles per hour.
I should not use the word police, but how it should be managed and like it was just a little bit disconcerting for me to be really excited to be walking down the street, and then you know a gigantic truck was facing me down.
Think involving the community to make sure that there is that you know that there are clear, So , there's clear, signage and clear understanding the months officials that these are five mile- per- hour, shared streets, basically for the fuse for the few vehicles that are permitted to access the street temporarily I.
, I think that's where it's really important, where those community groups that are coming in, because if they are noticing, you know that there's a lot of need for a coned repair activity for Verizon activity, I know, we've probably had it on my street.
It's going to depend on each street specifically, I, think they're going to have effective tools to communicate to the city, to the right enforcement.
So I, was told by the mayor's office that they're going to start having social distancing ambassadors on the street because of all the complaints with a B, since these are places where pedestrians are congregating, but we still want people to social distance.
I saw Jim Shelton's hand raised first Jim, hi, And You need to have a sponsor community organization and one of the requirements Is that they staff they provide staff or the street, but there's additionally, no funding available through D- O, T and I just heard from Jeremy that there is some movement on possibly having other options to facilitate that, but maybe it'd be helpful, maybe Jen, to hear a little bit about.
Do. You want to just point as a clarification, the first round of streets that were open there on the parks, those are being run by the city right, now?
I'll get to Susan in the second The first thing: I'd like to sort of understand, is the purpose of safe streets, because I think we're all looking at different definitions of what this street program should look like I know.
I know the bill in the council, but I want to know about for this particular program, because I think it would be helpful to let people know that you're going to see some traffic on the street It's not just an open place.
The whole equity issue, which I think we're going to face with a lot of the requests for the for these streets, is that a lot of trees do not have bids or community groups that can certainly staff the area.
So I'll give you the definition for what open street is it simply a street that allows pedestrians and cyclists to use the roadbed as an additional space for social distancing?
And I know a number of community groups, and particularly business groups- Tim is you know it's the part of the second resolution that Tim from the Lower East Side partnership has is about discussing other ways to use a space,, the only ones we have from groups, Jan Lee's email that I think Michael will share later with a plan Street and I'm sure he would have enough people in his group to do.
So if it requires a lot of support from community etc- Go answers, so we have a tremendous amount of complaints about lack of social, distancing and One. Of the reasons for this is to give people more room to be outside and be able to social distance We have the same thing in our office, though.
They had a very short, very short conversation, but one of the things they said was you know, particularly from the second street, being accessed, to be able to respond to pick particularly fires, east of that of Avenue B.
Anybody else from the committee itself have any follow- up questions for the presenters, tonight, no hands Okay, I'm, going to ask any members of community board three.
It's important for people to know they do not want to go off the next day, because one person in a particular neighborhood said: hey, let's close the street without letting residents, know so for VOT, And, I.
It's like everyone's at time, work, now, Mm, hmm, Thank, you, David, once again, final shot for any that can committee members or community board three members with any follow up questions for the two presenters: okay, no hands.
Other thing is that we actually feel that the allowance of skateboarders and cyclists to go through these closed streets is defies the whole reason that we're going to be calling them safe streets because there's an expectation of safety by walking into a barricaded Street that used to have bicycles on it and now is supposed to not have bicycles on it and when people walk into this.
Okay, I just wanted to raise the idea that if there is a concern of safety issue on Avenue, B I think there is a need.
We've seen some of the you know, brutality, that's gone on and again most people have good intentions and wanting to preserve the health and the public health of the neighborhood and the community.
It comes to the open streets program, you know again we're working with do T, We believe that this program should have a minimum As a minimum or no Involvement with NYPD is possible and we certainly there are other people in the city work.
So naturally, I strongly support the open Street project and not only to ease the pedestrian movement and to allow for more space for safe physical distancing, but I think we also need to think about what's coming up next and that we have to prepare for the needs of people.
If you want to save six feet from you in most of the East Village and a lot of the city, so By closing these streets, while we're not making it a hundred percent safe, we're making it a whole lot safer than it is right.
You know it's almost impossible to walk down that street safely without being close to people.
And I think that the model that we have there- the issues with the limited hours is a really good model, because if we consider the potential reasons why we might want these streets for transportation, for recreation, for just the ability for people to leave the house and still have still maintained space having a network like this, where there's basically it's a lot easier to sort of have a few choke points where we limit access and slow cars.
We can use a lot of the younger people who want to get community service points or folks who are looking for jobs, training to be part of this great community network and help people get the recreation space that they need, while keeping them safe.
I do not have a dog right now the council and has a wonderful pug, who has certainly I think with appreciate more open streets as well, but that you know I'm, not The councilman's budget director said I want to comment.
Streets too, because this crosstown opportunity for social distancing is there As well I, just I just really wanted to open those two I think that they, what we saw this past weekend below house and Street, seemed to work out well, And I think the problem we all we have is their use, the Business Improvement District model, and we just need to think about more creative models to be doing it north of house and where there is not a good, strong bid and so side.
You know I mentioned sixth Street in 10Th Street, just because they have access to the park and of people doing social distancing and going to the park closing off the streets, something they would both be near.
You know some of the comments about opening one lane might be a possibility, That seems like a better possibility, a dead, closing the whole street down Yeah, not allowing the fire department to get out.
You know getting uncomfortably close to people I believe it meets a lot of the city's criteria, which is that it's next to a park Maybe that creates an opportunity to bring crossing guards in to help and it connects with the bike.
In, theory, I, wish that the city was taking a more of a decisive role, here, rather than kind of punting this off to the community, because what that will do is create a situation where people who already live next to parks get even more open space and people who do not live next to parks or do not have as good of organization or bizarre resources to maintain an open, street.
Is to patrol the park, So I've seen the necessary need for more park space around the parts that are already existing and Up, I think that the live on Rivington, Street I think that the ours should be expanded for the Hell Square area, because if those restaurants plan to open and want to expand open streets would be the excellent way because they could have more seating and then do it legally, instead of the illegal drinking operations that are happening right, now.
I want to thank everybody from the public that have offered comments and commentary tonight, and questions for car Lena's office, because woman's office and the Department of Transportation But for right now we are actually going to move to the resolution, and that will be just committee, discussion.
You know I would love for young people to get jobs, especially with us , I'm, also concerned about us forcing street closures on some streets where residents may have a reason for not wanting that so I'm a little concerned about outreach not being done quickly enough to the concerned residents and the other thing Having heard the of the fire Department's concern about that I.
That's, a major concern So if we want to give some input into what those streets are, they're actually want to see our draft resolutions and may not even wait for the right, So I think for tonight we really just got to focus on the streets.
People were very upset that the first round of streets did not come from the community board, since there is going to be another round very quickly, because that's what the community is asking for, and City Council really pressured the mayor to do.
If we looked at a four side street between Delancey and Houston Street, that would probably be a great Street to open Paul I think we could make this kind of a wish list that, as things change, perhaps like, given the suggestions, for example, an Avenue fee that, rather than closing the whole street one lane or removing Part B, or something like that.
Partial I think that, given you know, it's a Susan's point that we did not have a lot of time to quote, but this street.
Think that will do it, and then we can Could I just suggest that you add to such, as you know, a lane of traffic, whatever it was, you said, and other and other opportunities for increase pedestrian space.
I think we need to put Avenue beyond that on the bullet point list, whereas some streets that will not need agency criteria for approval to be closed as designated safe streets are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing.
You, know street calming measures like fiction, cons or to be discussed at one point, or you know, or the things we're talking about now about increasing, basically extending the sidewalk space that we want them.
You know what the situation is on those streets like you're, I, would ask and again I'm not advocating against any of those suggestions as long as their priorities for the community It's my fault and everybody's had a lot of say here tonight and from the Committees of the public, And I think that's what makes it a priority if they believe that this street should be closed for social distancing, issues, yeah , Absolutely, let's give it a shot.
You do not take right, so we might as well take a shot at If. It's a priority for the community for a see me for the members of CB3, it's a priority for us and we But that's my there in the situation where we need the space All right, Thank, You, Susan from the committee, any other, any other streets.
Community board 3 recommends the designation of the following streets as safe streets to be temporarily closed to vehicular, traffic or otherwise adapted to permit adequate social distancing on the adjacent sidewalks.
Can you talk about this resolution that you have in front of us, firstly, I just would thank the committee I think it was a long but robust discussion about open streets.
The program was launched in a very quick fashion, I think in an effort to get more public open space operational as quickly as possible, and so I think with anything that moves this fast, especially during an emergency like we're in we learn as we go, and so a lot of the things that have been mentioned today already in the works.
The use of the streets for commercial activity and for commerce and social distance has been something that's been successful, and so in the resolution we seek to expand upon the open space program that is there today and to look at potentially those larger closures being places where we can have people enjoy socially distant commerce and be able to, for example, get something at a restaurant and sit within the roadbed and areas where those open streets are not available, because we can't close every street, really strategically.
Permit office, the Department of Consumer Affairs into the department transportation, but we wanted to try to put a resolution together to begin a conversation, not only with the committee and the Community Board, but really try to put a marker down to say these are the guidelines and parameters which the city should consider as they make these decisions.
You know likely increases in people being outside businesses trying to engage in a new normal with significantly curtailed operations that they're able to open.
The goal of getting a resolution from the Community Board was to really try to understand what the parameters could be and to be able to have an earnest discussion with the city and with our local partners about you know what guidelines and what kind of framework they might work.
I, just I do think it's transportation, related, and so that's why we wanted to come to you folks to be like listen ,, we're asking for your support and exploring how this can work and pushing the city to put parameters on something, as opposed to just saying it's going to happen.
But that does not seem to be a concern, because I think that there is a just sort of like a you know, a willingness to trade off right, now, and especially since it is going to become harder and harder for folks to stay inside I do not have any outdoor space.
Community born three supports the creative use of targeted portions of roadway to enhance public space through the construction and potential expansion of the open streets program and be it FURTHER.
