That you said the office a letter for Member of the committee and safety I used to be on the same committee at community board and I wanted to bring up the issue because we all saw the video that happened in the corner somewhere in your district, around 14th Street, if I, remember correctly, where one officer of the NYPD tackle basically three black resident in the street and I wanted to bring that to the attention of the committee to put in various as a resident of New York, City I would expect the committee to put strong word against the NYPD on that sort of behavior and also I.
There will be two resolutions put forth, but first we are talking about these hundred miles of streets program, that's being implemented as a result of this unprecedented time and pandemic I believe there are representatives of Councilwoman, Carlino Rivera's office that are here: Gonna represent councilman Rivera's office I also handle transportation issues for the Councilwoman Legislation that we had worked on around open streets is something that the Councilwoman I think really was considered a priority during this unprecedented pandemic.
A lot of the need for it came out of the conversation she was having with doctors and medical administrators as chair of the hospital's committee, people who are really concerned about the lack of social distance, and we are seen on our city streets over the last month.
At that hearing the department, transportation was a question by council owner of era, speaker Johnson, that Mayor DeBlasio, and yet he had raised previously about implementing an open streets program Council under I Think, and the members of the committee were very adamant that this was a program is really needed.
I think they'll probably have more specifics about that kind of aspect of the program, but getting to kind of, like the last major points that I wanted to add on what kind of streets that the Councilwoman envisions this program in going forward with and how we are going to continue working as a council office with the ochi because do T are the experts when it comes to having the traffic engineers and the surveyors and Road people who can manage and can implement these things and bring the supplies that are needed.
That's doing a great job on this that you know around kind of the visioning, because we believe the main thing this part needs to do, and we hope this program will do in the days and weeks to come, because we do think that you know we're expecting streets to be announced.
I, don't know what necessary means and in terms of city service vehicles, I, don't know what utility vehicles means So, if you have any clarity around what those exemptions would entail, because my concern is that this would essentially render the street closure route if we allow a lot of leeway and who can drive down the street So. Typically, when you say well, the street itself is not meant for everyday cars who just go through so anyone that needs to make a delivery, no matter what type of truck or vehicle they are able to get into that space to do the delivery, but as they are doing that they are also, let's go really slow by miles per hour.
The cars can come and go, but then the same time, it's really not a street for anyone who is traveling to get through But I still don't know what utility vehicle means or necessary City service vehicles or how that will be I shouldn't use the word police, but how it should be managed and like it was just a little bit disconcerting for me to be really excited to be walking down the street, and then you know a gigantic truck was facing me down and I had to get off the street I suppose if there are so many exemptions without a lot of clarity, because people will take advantage of it.
Everyone has to make sure They should be driving really slow down these streets because there are going to be pedestrians and cyclists, I think involving the community to make sure that there is that you know that there are clear so there's clear, signage and clear understanding the months officials that these are five mile-per-hour shared streets, basically for the fuse for the few vehicles that are permitted to access the street temporarily I think it's going to be part of an education effort that we need to do.
I know the bill in the council, but I want to know about for this particular program, because I think it would be helpful to let people know that you're going to see some traffic on the street and it's not just an open place street Don't have bids or community groups that can certainly staff the area?
First of all the purpose is evolving and I know a number of community groups, and particularly business groups- you know it's the part of the second resolution that Tim from the Lower East Side partnership has is about discussing other ways to use a space, the only ones we have from groups, Jan Lee's email that I think Michael will share later with a plan Street and I'm sure he would have enough people in his group to do that.
That's fine and my second question just being in a neighborhood where they change streets, a community outreach in terms of letting residents note that this street may or may not be closed, It's important for people to know they don't want to go off the next day, because one person in a particular neighborhood said, hey, let's close the street without letting residents, know so for VOT and I.
I guess: I'm, not informing people who live on the affected street No announcements and through community board and elected I mean obviously, if it's in everywhere else or may no feel like there are some ten associations, and maybe that would be all the way to throughout the week.
you're the first hand I see raised Thank, you very much committee and thank you for giving us an opportunity to present We just had a few questions, and perhaps the committee can consider this as they work on streets throughout the district Other thing is that we actually feel that the allowance of skateboarders and cyclists to go through these closed streets is defies the whole reason that we're going to be calling them safe streets because there's an expectation of safety by walking into a barricaded Street that used to have bicycles on it and now is supposed to not have bicycles on it and when people walk into this, that expectation of safety should be there Other thing is that we are very concerned that essentially, the bid folks will be responsible to ask people to either wear a mask or to social distance.
For budget negotiations, Okay I just wanted to raise the idea that if there is a concern of safety issue on Avenue, B I think there is a need If there's no option of opening two streets completely two pedestrians, maybe DoD, can just remove parking on the side of the street at the curb side and replace it with barricades in order to just double the width of the sidewalk I just observed the sidewalk on B, for example, between sixth Street and 7th Street, going to the grocery store.
If do tea or councilwoman's office wants to address Sam what he just said: A couple reasons, first, that if you notice with traffic patterns when it's busier, 7th Street is usually a very highly traffic Street, because people will take that instead of going on st Mark's, for example, it's also there's no bus lane and we have a really strong tradition of working together with small merchants on the street and the churches and residents I'm a resident on 7th Street and have been a business owner.
Every weekend, So there's a long experience around the world on doing this thing, so naturally, I strongly support the open Street project and not only to ease the pedestrian movement and to allow for more space for safe physical distancing, but I think we also need to think about what's coming up next and that we have to prepare for the needs of people.
We have to turn to new forms of transportation as our city reopens for business, if you, if you will I, foresee a massive rise in cycling generally people, we want to use this very efficient mode of transportation that also allows naturally physical distancing There will be a need for a rapid expansion of surf surface public transit, namely rapid, efficient bus service unprotected and dedicated lanes on the motor lab I would suggest of DM 14 on 14th Street, so we need We need shared space There's many examples where this perfect gravitation of coexistence of cyclists and pedestrian.
I also want to say on bikes and walking together we see it on summer streets every summer, You know as long as people respect each other It is a huge transition from the bridge from Brooklyn into the neighborhood to the park, and, right now you know it's almost impossible to walk down that street safely without being close to people It's a very narrow street we've been advocating for a very long time for bike paths there, but for right now, I feel like it's really urgent, that this is particularly a street that we need just to be able to go safely through the neighborhood It's, hugely important as a street that takes people through the neighborhood and right now, if you've been over there, people are walking in the street yes, there's a lot of stuff going on, but we really need that space to get through the neighborhood We have before open streets and I think that the model that we have there - the issues with the limited hours is a really good model, because if we consider the potential reasons why we might want these streets for transportation, for recreation, for just the ability for people to leave the house and still have still maintained space having a network like this, where there's basically it's a lot easier to sort of have a few choke points where we limit access and slow cars, it makes it a lot simpler to maintain and it makes it a lot more sustainable The system in order to make a system like this better for people to be able to move throughout the neighborhood I Think.
What that's free in order to preserve the safety of the street Some enforcement to begin with and picking the same streets is all that's really necessary and I really want to emphasize the school crossing guards they're known in the community, but I'd like to second that East Broadway from Grand to Essex, Thank You, Tommy But thank you guys so much for your service in this very challenging time and thank you to our electeds on the call as well I'm wondering about resources but I'm, hoping that we can get some actual financial resources, even if a small amount to be put towards some kind of barriers that aren't just NYPD barriers.
But, then again, we can also use planters because we I think we do have some of those available Let that I've seen sort of like the rolling planters used in some of the parks around you know all people need to see I think the community is gonna figure.
I don't have a dog right now the council and has a wonderful pug, who has certainly I think with appreciate more open streets as well, but that you know I'm, not the councilman's budget director said I want to comment.
The councilman's discretionary budget is but I can tell you just from like hearing from different groups that we are getting so many requests to save funding and it's a really start budget situation, because the city cannot raise its own revenue So. It's basically, you know if you want to add something that they cut something else, and so we're in this really difficult situation right now with the budget, you know, Being that benefit of this program is that it's a low, cost?
I believe you will be the last person of the night from a public comment, section zest, 249 I, believe you were trying to raise your hand, Totally support like to why you guys talk about I will I want totally like if we come man like a front glass, three on Bruce, Lee and funk when she to Delancey and then fun on the street to LA , know well presented like because our the street arm I'm Bruce tree and then the Archer is kinda like most of the times, not very like driving three It going to be very good for the local business that that's one thinking, because I didn't prepare for the presentation, so I didn't know how to pose I.
Think I totally support the law inside alright , you repeat exactly what street was it that we actually I'm the sushi restaurant on 249, Broome, Street?, The public portion I want to thank everybody from the public that have offered comments and commentary tonight and questions for car Lena's office, because woman's office and the Department of Transportation But for right now we are actually going to move to the resolution and that will be just committee.
This is community input thing that you have that you know We could offer literally seven streets on the resolution and the vetting process could be DoD, FDNY NYPD and if one of those agency says absolutely not at all great correct, so they could literally go through all seven streets that we offer on a resolution and we could literally end up with nine an area, that's its advisory input and then they're gonna use the expertise of their agencies to bet them absolutely that's the way everything's done If we looked at a four side street between Delancey and Houston Street, that would probably be a great Street to open Paul I think we could make this kind of a wish list that, as things change, perhaps like given the suggestions, for example an Avenue fee that, rather than closing the whole street one lane or removing Part B, or something like that, Partial I, think that, given you know, it's a Susan's point that we didn't have a lot of time to quote, but this street the streets- Our job here, is to make recommendations based on what the community wants to see and we've gotten already and So. Maybe if we as community board members, decided on this the list of streets that we'd like to see something happen, and perhaps we add that language to the resolution as well can I suggest it might be helpful to read the resolution.
You know modified to increase pedestrian space on the adjoining sidewalk The. First therefore be resolved, let's say, whereas some streets that will not meet acceptable agency criteria and that will not meet agency criterion for approval to be closed are going to be important for are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social, distancing, These streets could be adapted by with measures such as removing a lane of parking could I just suggest that you add to such, as you know, a lane of traffic, whatever it was, you said and other and other opportunities for increase pedestrian space Do. You want to read it back to us.
You, know street calming measures like fiction cons or to be discussed at one point, or you know, or the things we're talking about now about increasing basically extending the sidewalk space that we want them to We don't have a concern about broom We were just highlighting it because a local merchant had suggested it so I'm pretty sure with more people coming out for walks daily walks, and that really would be, and it does rely on deliveries, because it's so small business focused right It's becomes a really crazed enforcement issue with already clawed traffic caught human traffic car traffic There are a couple of streets that I would like, but I don't really know because I'm, not an expert in terms of traffic right in terms of those specific streets Already like the chinatown side, mulberry is already half on half of bears already gone, so entire street role of Bayer all the way through Pell doors because they are so narrow, but that's an entire network right within your Chinatown that you're so connected to each other This is the first I saw the list, so we've been conferring with G ot No, but do T is aware of the back and forth discussion and we have filed in the community This thing is this thing is important for the simple reason that is Distancing is for safety number one Look at Chinatown ice cream factory You barely have two people in there and the other gentleman's observation is correct, with or without say, Street you're gonna have altercations, because right now they had to spill onto the sidewalk and they're side by side to one another, one III when I scream one property once one restaurant and under the restaurant Even if you want to wait in line on the sidewalk number one, the sidewalk is two feet wide or three feet wide and then, if you want to do the six feet apart, I don't even know which line to weigh in As you have already seen across the country, people feel there's a certain sphere.
We could possibly think of where take out any street You know what the situation is on those streets like you're I, would ask and again I'm not advocating against any of those suggestions as long as their priorities for the community and it's my fault and everybody's had a lot of say here tonight and from the Committees of the public and I think that's what makes it a priority if they believe that this street should be closed for social distancing issues If it's a priority for the community for a see me for the members of cb3, it's a priority for us that's my there in the situation where we need the space all right, Thank, You, Susan from the committee There's, not a lot of foot traffic right there between Jacob Riis and Haven Plaza, but there's a lot of car use because of con Edison and the power plant.
I think signage and enforcement seems to be the top two after this, so I think those will eventually become have some resolutions towards them and based on, what's going on I'll sort of to support recommending designated streets, the D-O-T for inclusion in the safe streets program, whereas in response to cope in nineteen social, distancing requirements, the city is proposing temporary, safe street designations, That would close certain public streets to behavior traffic and open them up to pedestrians and cyclists, and whereas on designated safe streets, no through regular traffic will be permitted during effective hours.
The program was launched in a very quick fashion, I think in an effort to get more public open space operational as quickly as possible, and so I think with anything that moves this fast, especially during an emergency like we're in we learn as we go, and so a lot of the things that have been mentioned today already in the works The resolution that we had drafted as an initial scope to begin conversations where the community was really kind of thinking about Phase two, as we look at the public health emergency and I think is Wellington astutely mention, as businesses begin to open back up, there's a great concern that there will still be significant limits on the occupancy of businesses in the interior space and as we've seen in other cities, both domestically and internationally.
The use of the streets for commercial activity and for commerce and social distance has been something that's been successful, and so in the resolution we seek to expand upon the open space program that is there today and to look at potentially those larger closures being places where we can have people enjoy socially distant commerce and be able to, for example, get something at a restaurant and sit within the roadbed and areas where those open streets are not available, because we can't close every street really strategically thinking about the ability of a merchant to take their method of operation and apply to the city to use the parking spaces adjacent to their storefront, as so that they can have additional outside space for commercial activity.
There are a variety of different pieces to that puzzle that relate to the street activity permit office, the Department of Consumer Affairs into the department transportation We wanted to try to put a resolution together to begin a conversation, not only with the committee and the community board, but really try to put a marker down to say these are the guidelines and parameters which the city should consider as they make these decisions There's a high likelihood that this type of activity will be sanctioned in some way and the goal is to really say: here's how we at a local level have collaboratively worked together to put in some guardrails, and so the resolution highlights some of those it suggests in 8 am to 10 pm our window for the open streets that involve Commerce and the same activity that would occur in an adjacent parking spaces Apologies.
I, just I do think it's transportation related, and so that's why we wanted to come to you folks to be like listen , we're asking for your support and exploring how this can work and pushing the city to put parameters on something, as opposed to just saying it's going to happen anyway, and you all having a conversation like we did with open streets where they had rolled something out.
I Don't know that this was the right committee to bring it - Yes, it's Street side parking, but as you launched into it Tim you were saying you know, measures that the community board has been comfortable is supporting in the past.
