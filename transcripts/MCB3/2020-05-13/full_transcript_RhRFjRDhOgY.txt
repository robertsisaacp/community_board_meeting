All right, Michael I'm ready. We can start recording good evening. Everyone welcome to our community boards, three transportation, Public Safety Environment Committee meeting for Tuesday May 12 2020. We have three agenda items tonight. The first one will be to approve the minutes from the March 2020 last committee. Meeting I believe will be approving those minutes. Do we have a motion to approve those minutes from the committee motion? Technically minutes, don't even require a motion. You just is there any discussion vote all right. Let's vote on the minutes in the show. Can you take the attendance for us? Thank you, David Crane, yes, Paul Rangel, yes, Michelle coopersmith, yes, Lieberman, Felicia, Kirk, shank, okay, Ellen Liu! Yes, all right! That's all folks! On gender item number one I believe there is correct me if I am wrong. Susan I believe there is a member of the public who wanted to make a two-minute statement in regard to a letter that was sent to the office yesterday. Can you know who showed up but I guess you could ask if there are any public session speakers that are not for the agenda item, so I'm gonna. Just repeat that the only agenda item we have on for today is the hundred streets that we will be discussing in a moment. I know there's others in the public who I've been asking about a potential agenda item for next month and wanted to speak about it for two minutes. I, don't know if that person who wrote the letter is in the room right now. If they are, could you please raise your hand, so I can call on you and give you two minutes to speak on that issue, and then we will move on okay. That person is raising his real bound. There is a. There is a reason we asked you to raise your hand, it's better to rate to use that function, because we can't see everybody that's in the meeting, especially depending on what else is on the screen. So, but that was Bo so vo you can unmute yourself, and you have two minutes. Yeah do Chi know welcome. You two have two minutes to speak on that topic, that you said the office a letter for. Thank you very much for your time. Member of the committee and safety I used to be on the same committee at community board. 9 and I wanted to bring up the issue because we all saw the video that happened in the corner somewhere in your district, around 14th Street, if I, remember correctly, where one officer of the NYPD tackle basically three black resident in the street and I wanted to bring that to the attention of the committee to put in various as a resident of New York, City I would expect the committee to put strong word against the NYPD on that sort of behavior and also I wanted. My letter specifically requested that the committee sees that the behavior of the police union is what kind is what allowed the NYPD officer who are rank-and-file to feel a sense of impunity when they treat member of the black and Latino community? The way they have done it? The rest is, in my letter, I hope that you can take it to the full board for a vote and I. Thank you for your time have a good afternoon Thank You Theo for one-four, going under the two minutes and - for your for your awards here today. Please, if you know, look up our website see be 3/4 full board and signed in for the public session as well. For then in a couple weeks, this is something we've discussed already and will eventually be an agenda item. Hopefully thank you, but we will not be discussing this for the remainder that night. Thank you, though, for three awards. I appreciate all right. So let us move on to the actual agenda item we'll be discussing tonight. There will be two resolutions put forth, but first we are talking about these hundred miles of streets program, that's being implemented as a result of this unprecedented time and pandemic I believe there are representatives of Councilwoman, Carlino Rivera's office that are here, I, don't know who will be the one actually speaking to us, but you will have two minutes to start to explain to us the push behind this program and the pilot and anything that you can offer and I will start with whoever's. Gonna represent councilman Rivera's office. Today everybody hope you can hear me again. My name is jeremy. Younger I am Councilwoman Rivera's legislative director I also handle transportation issues for the Councilwoman. The legislation that we had worked on around open streets is something that the Councilwoman I think really was considered a priority during this unprecedented pandemic. A lot of the need for it came out of the conversation she was having with doctors and medical administrators as chair of the hospital's committee, people who are really concerned about the lack of social distance, and we are seen on our city streets over the last month. Almost two months now we had introduced a bill about three to three weeks ago. I think that three or four weeks ago in the council, a hearing was held on that bill. At that hearing, the department transportation was a question by council owner of era, speaker Johnson, another number of other members of the City Council about the concerns that Mayor DeBlasio, and yet he had raised previously about implementing an open streets program, Council under I. Think and the members of the committee were very adamant that this was a program is really needed. That was a program that was needed. That would not be a program reliant on and my PD officers that could be reliant on community groups and organizations and bids and other city employees were aware appropriate. Following that committee hearing the department transportation, the mayor's office came to you our office in the speaker's office to work on a program that is now that has never since been announced. Obviously, and a number of streets have been designated as open streets, the bill still technically exists. It has not been passed if you know we're trying to work proactively with the Department of Transportation. If the governor transportation is not following the kind of parameters that which is hopefully 40 miles by the end of May a hundred miles down the road, we're certainly open to revisiting that bill want to let you know I can go further, so you want me to explain more, but I know I went over time. I don't want to go any for that. Susan, yeah I think there's some confusion. I asked them to present. This isn't like a two minute opportunity to talk. I asked them to present to explain a number of things about the issue. Okay, so that's kind of a Sturridge is kind of context. The legislation versus the bill and the program that has not announced so again. The bill still exists. It is in have been heard in committee. The bill could still be voted on in committee if we feel that it needs to be, but so far we didn't proactively working with Department of Transportation on this. We hope that can continue productively so far. It certainly has been. You know, right now there have been about round 10 miles, roughly of me a little bit more than 10 miles of streets that have been opened. Most of those have been into two categories, one around parks and both within and surrounding parks, to kind of open up those spaces where a lot of people already go to enjoy open space. The second area is around is in different parts of the city where Business Improvement Districts are present. Business Improvement Districts have one particular advantage and that they have full-time staff. Usually you handle the management of street events, so they are particularly capable of rapidly implementing this program, as other community organizations look at this program and see if their staffing and financial capacity allows for it. We certainly would hope and would welcome other groups and to participate in this program. Any group can bargain group can suggest streets that they think they could help manage the day-to-day operations of. If you go to the New York City Department of Transportation website, there is a link on their website on how to fill out the survey suggesting streets and hours of operations in the capacity they can provide and I don't want to get too much into that kind of operational. So because I do know do t is on the line. I think they'll probably have more specifics about that kind of aspect of the program, but getting to kind of, like the last major points that I wanted to add on what kind of streets that the Councilwoman envisions this program in going forward with and how we are going to continue working as a council office with the ochi because do T are the experts when it comes to having the traffic engineers and the surveyors and Road people who can manage and can implement these things and bring the supplies that are needed. You know they're handling that stuff and certainly we're having conversations with Commissioner trottenberg and the entire team at DoD. That's doing a great job on this that you know around kind of the visioning, because we believe the main thing this part needs to do, and we hope this program will do in the days and weeks to come, because we do think that you know we're expecting streets to be announced. You know on a daily weekly basis is that this needs to address equity in terms of open space, a lot of parts of the city of New York. Unfortunately, just do not have the open space that even areas like community board, 3 and I think a lot of us in Canadian board. 3 would say that we don't have the open space that we need, but there are parts of Queens central Brooklyn and the Bronx that have absolutely no public space or open space, and the Councilwoman believes you need to address those equities and those funding. Inequity is also in terms of expanding and keeping open space effective, but with through this bill and first are through this program, and so I know that's what the Councilwoman has spoken to depart DoD about in terms of identifying streets. She is working with other members of the City Council to encourage them to go to their community boards and to their community groups and ask them what streets do you think could potentially work to get those to do tease the deal, so you can do their road analysis. They're engineering analyses just to you know, make sure these are things that can be done in those effective areas. I know, D-O-T is a couple of specific. You know things that make it difficult to do a street in a certain area like if a bus route goes along a certain Street that makes it difficult. I know they can probably go into more of those details themselves, but you know I think that's. The biggest concern is the equity concern and trying to address that thing. The secondary concern is areas and neighborhoods where open streets can really provide a solution to kind of on-the-ground problem. So, for example, like a choke point entrance into a park, if one Park has you know a minimum number of entrances, how can we open streets to help with the flow traffic in and out of parks, or if you have a particular the same kind of you know, ideas could potentially be helped solved around other kinds of choke points such as you know. We we've talked all about how open streets can be closing down in one block entirely to all traffic, except for local, residential and delivery. You know we also foresee, and some other cities have done this. You could do sidewalk extensions near AB, major bus, stop rated a lot of people congregating and that extension of the sidewalk into the street with effective barriers. You could give more space then for people to socially distance while waiting for the bus. You know we got just one example, but I think we really hope that you know going to know the community board. Three has a list of streets that are gonna, be discussed and I, know I. Think we're here just to really listen to see what kind of streets you guys want to see in your neighborhood and at the same time you know we acknowledge that this is an emergency. This is not the typical way that these kinds of Street changes would occur and that you know cb3 and give me any more. Members are important part of that conversation, and we think that you know if there's issues that you guys see with any of these streets that are being implemented like let us know let deity know. We certainly think that there's ways to adjust these to make them more effective, and so you know hoping that you know we can have a collaborative process on this going forward. Now. Imagine do you know probably I could up the same. So that's all for me for now, Thank You, Jeremy I believe this representation from DLT here as well. Correct I think just to answer questions if necessary that she can speak Jennifer. Can you hear me I just want to make sure. Is there anything you wanted to add before I ask the committee for questions on behalf of the okay Jennifer? If they're still on the phone, you have to hit star six to unmute yourself, hello, okay, so I don't have anything else to add I prefer to take questions. If that would be better a lot of what Jeremy is. Actually you know is true, and you know it's pretty much, what I'll pull them in about bubble country, but I like that. If there are specifics, I'd rather answer those questions. Okay, thank you. So I'm gonna pivot to the committee, do any of the committee members have questions right now for the for Jeremy or for Jennifer Paul I can't find the go ahead. Michelle my hand Thank You Jennifer for coming tonight. We appreciate you taking the time and I think we're all interested in hearing more about this program. A specific question that I have comes from some language. It's on the do T's website about the I suppose you should say we could say the exemptions for use of the streets by vehicles and almost give you some context. I was walking down. Rivington Street this on Sunday morning during the 8 to 12 time when this is a pilot and I was confronted by a sanitation vehicle coming straight at me, going straight across going west across Rivington I was at the terminus on Essex Street and they just moved the barrier and started driving down the street, which is to me extremely concerning about how this program would be implemented in reality. If there are so many exemptions for different types of vehicles to drive through the street, I mean just looking at the website, its local deliveries, pickups drop, necessary City service vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles. Only those that seems extremely broad to me, I, don't know what necessary means and in terms of city service vehicles, I, don't know what utility vehicles means. I, don't know what pickups drop-offs means. So if you have any clarity around what those exemptions would entail, because my concern is that this would essentially render the street closure route if we allow a lot of leeway and who can drive down the street. Thank you okay. So, typically, when you say well, the street itself is not meant for everyday cars who just go through, so it's not a through Street, but anyone that needs to make a delivery, no matter what type of truck or vehicle they are able to get into that space to do the delivery, but as they are doing that they are also, let's go really slow by miles per hour. You know you also mentioned that you know emergency access, so it obviously there's. You know fire police, you know ambulances they're able to access that street. What pickup drop-off is also I guess also. You are able to retrieve your car that Street has a parking and you live there. Obviously, your car is parked there. You can move your car, so it's not like you're not permitted to not park there. The cars can come and go, but then the same time, it's really not a street for anyone who is traveling to get through. Does that clarify the question to a certain extent? And thank you for that, but I still don't know what utility vehicle means or necessary City service vehicles or how that will be. How will it be policed? I mean I was sorry. I shouldn't use the word police, but how it should be managed and like it was just a little bit disconcerting for me to be really excited to be walking down the street, and then you know a gigantic truck was facing me down and I had to get off the street. So you know that it doesn't give me a lot of hope for the program. I suppose, if there are so many exemptions without a lot of clarity, because people will take advantage of it, okay for you to leave the vehicles, that would probably mean like carnet or Verizon if they need to get through, maybe there's some repair that they have to do what else? If you mentioned some accessories and service vehicles, that would be most likely marked, so they would could be. Maybe it kind of thanked wealthy I guess the sanitation truck would be allowable. They should be able to get in the street to clean if they needed to sanitation, I'm trying to think what else could be I mean. Would that mean that the police would be able to drive down the street no matter? What? Even if it wasn't something in an emergency situation, they may be well, I. Think the thing with NYPD is: they are in the air. They may actually come down, they may be take out a phone call, I mean sometimes that happens and they would be allowed to get through. But, like I said all these open streets, everyone has to make sure well, they should be going really slow. They should be driving really slow down these streets because there are going to be pedestrians and cyclists. Okay. Thank you yep. Thank you. Mister. Is that all right, if I just comment on that real quick go to Germany yep yeah, just a couple of points I mean I would also like definitely acknowledge, like what Michele is seen and I got, certainly something that, like he's gonna, have to be worked out throughout this process. I think involving the community to make sure that there is that you know that there are clear so there's clear, signage and clear understanding the months officials that these are five mile-per-hour shared streets, basically for the fuse for the few vehicles that are permitted to access the street temporarily I think it's going to be part of an education effort that we need to do. I. Think the more these streets have been prevalent. Well, I think it's going to become more of an understanding, I think we've seen in other cities across the United States, where this is being implemented that it there is effective implementation that streets in other cities are seeing those you know, delivery vehicles and other service vehicles accessing it and are not. You know, they're not encountering large-scale issues and, while you know I can't speak to the situation on Rivington Street I've been on some of the other open streets in Manhattan in Brooklyn. You know to me: I've seen I've seen them work very effectively. You know, I think it just is going to depend on a case-by-case basis. I think that's where it's really important, where those community groups that are coming in, because if they are noticing, you know that there's a lot of need for a coned repair activity for Verizon activity, I mean God knows my Internet's been on the fritz for the last weeks. I know, we've probably had it on my street. You know a community group I know that from firsthand experience and be able to actively work to kind of accommodate those vehicles. You know in ours where open streets may not be as necessary like late at night earlier in the morning. All right so I have a quick question. I just maybe might be centered around enforcement. At some point, I was in a cab on Saturday and I. The cabby drove me through a portion of what would be considered an open street. He drove around the barricade and drove straight through to get onto the FDR Drive I, wouldn't imagine he would be allowed to go through correct me if I'm wrong, because he looked shocked by seeing all these barricades Jennifer. Do you want to take that one or should I? You could think of you want yeah I mean they wouldn't be? Definitely not something that would be legal, it's not for through traffic use. So that would have been an instance where, if someone had seen that should have immediately reported the medallion number two three on one to make sure they were very least educated it. You know certainly probably up for a ticket violation. Okay. So what that I guess that my question is enforcement? Is that on a citizen to just call 3-1-1, oh I, see a cab coming through or somebody's a regular car going through right through I, see a license plate number on and put in the license-plate number, who actually enforces who's not supposed to be going down these streets? So nobody can get it. You already have enough other vehicles going through it's a good question. I mean I, certainly think that it's a it's going to depend on each street specifically, which group is doing the organizing. You know, especially it's like a bid. I think they're gonna have effective tools to communicate to the city to the right enforcement officials. If there wouldn't seen that kind of behavior, you know if a community group doesn't have the capacity to provide that on-site staffing. You know we would like to see- and this is just councilman's offices- is not do tees position. Yet we have been advocating for other city officials, school crossing guards for other DoD employees, traffic enforcement agents to play more of a role, a present role in this process. So you know, that's certainly our position, our offices position and you know again continuing conversation as these streets of all, because honestly they've only been here for a week or two and I know we've all you know been going through and seeing how different transportation changes have happened in cb3. You know over the last couple of years, whether it's 14th Street or whether it's bike lanes or whether it's shared streets. You know some of these things do take time and they do have. You know things that change with them. So again, I got would just really preface like, if you guys are noticing specific issues at a specific street. If it's on Rivington Street there's a specific issue occurring. That's the kind of thing that I know our office wants to know about, so that we can then bring that to do T's attention and they can either change they can remove from the program they can add to the program. You know to make sure the programs work effectively, I believe Susan, that a question I. Thank you. So I was told by the mayor's office that they're gonna start having social distancing ambassadors on the street because of all the complaints with a B, since these are places where pedestrians are congregating, but we still want people to social distance. Would this be a place? The ambassadors might be, and would that be helpful, I'm sure a lot of the lack of compliance right now is because it's so new, but would the ambassadors possibly be a help to try and educate people or their vehicles? I don't know to do tea. Just because, like the program is pretty new and we certainly have the same question ourselves, but we haven't heard anything out so I'm just gonna turn to do tea if they have anything at this point Jennifer at the moment, I haven't heard any updates or details on that problem or haven't reached certain social decision ambassadors when I do have that info. I can share that with you. Thank you. Maybe it's something we can suggest. I see. - Thank, You, Susan I, see two hands raised. I saw Jim Shelton's hand raised first Jim, hi, yeah I, just I want to follow up a little bit on what Susan Jeremy we're just talking about. You know, looking at the current D-O-T guidelines for the program and I understand that they're evolving, but currently, as the program exists, you need to have a sponsor community organization and one of the requirements is that they staff they provide staff or the street, but there's additionally, no funding available through D-O-T and I just heard from Jeremy that there is some movement on possibly having other options to facilitate that, but maybe it'd be helpful, maybe Jen to hear a little bit about how do tea is thinking about that because there's lots of organizations or streets who might identify, but there isn't necessarily two people power to staff for 12 hours. You know this. It's 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. you know that takes money that takes people I'm, always going to be available. So is the city considering ways to stab that position? Oh yes, we prefer this to be managed by a partner organization. You know such as a bid, but then our there are areas where you don't have a bed, then you know there's any you know visit. Also no community groups and the alternative is to try to work with NYPD. They do have some resources that we may be able to. You know, engage with them to help with some of the streets and I know for those particular streets. If it's NYPD, then obviously they would be staffing that and they would be. You know managing that during the time from 8:00 to 8:00. In addition, any community group that does apply and say like they can't do from 8:00 to 8:00 I mean the schedule for the open. Street is also very flexible. So for this program it is flexible. We would definitely like to work with a partner and see what days or you know what time of day or you know it doesn't have to be every day it could be. You know a couple of days a week and you know certain number hours I mean if that's their capacity to do so, we'd be willing to both put them on that ship. Yeah I, don't have a follow-up I just wanted to hear about that cuz. That is, it could be a difficulty for identifying. You know a street that fits if there's no possibility to staff me and Jim more than I. Do you want to just point as a clarification, the first round of streets that were open there on the parks, those are being run by the city right now? So those don't have a group so just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. I'll get to Susan in the second I've seen Trevor Holland's. Also a board member his hand was up for a while I'll take his question. Then I'll go to Susan Trevor I. Thank you, I guess. The first thing I'd like to sort of understand, is the purpose of safe streets, because I think we're all looking at different definitions of what this street program should look like I know. Initially this there was a push because it wasn't enough pedestrian space and it was supposed to ignore sort of an overflow space for pedestrians walking. But I can see from the list that it's evolved from that and we're looking at it differently. So the first thing I'd like to hear is a clear definition of what program I'm supposed to do under the safe streets. I know the bill in the council, but I want to know about for this particular program, because I think it would be helpful to let people know that you're going to see some traffic on the street and it's not just an open place street and you've sort of touched on this and the whole equity issue, which I think we're going to face with a lot of the requests for the for these streets. Is that a lot of trees? Don't have bids or community groups that can certainly staff the area? And how are we looking to make sure that the distribution of these open streets are equitable for neighborhoods, that don't have groups or the resources to sort of police, the area or police the streets? So I'll give you the definition for what open street is it simply a street that allows pedestrians and cyclists to use the roadbed as an additional space? For social distancing, the open street allows the local deliveries. It allows for emergency access, it allows vehicles to pick-up and drop-off, and it also allows folks to retrieve their parked car, but the street is not floor is through traffic. It's not for programming it's right now, it's also not for seating or anything to encourage gathering the program itself. I, don't think, there's a time frame for how long it's gonna be I mean, depending on who manages it. It's flexible I mean anyone that we get an application for that. Actually, you know seemed like we approved it, and this is good the open street if, after you know, day 1 day 2 after a while, it doesn't work that we do. We may not continue it. I mean that's a flexibility that we're willing to you know, try I mean we wanted to get as much streets. You know as possible to help with the social distancing, and you know, as I mentioned before you know any Street that doesn't have a community partner I'm going to try to see what other you know. If NYPD has some available resources that we can definitely try to see with corner with them, I mean I know. There's also like some areas where you know there weren't any say like Bach Association. Some of them actually start to you know bunch of volunteers might get together and decide so hey. You know what we could do this for two or three hours, maybe we'll try it I mean that's also a possibility. Thank you. What Thank You Trevor Susan I believe you had a question to a couple of that. First of all, the purpose is evolving and I know just as we're speaking here. I just got an email that the city is considering using restaurants, letting restaurants use some of the spaces and I know a number of community groups, and particularly business groups- and you know, are discussing that and I. Think Tim is you know it's the part of the second resolution that Tim from the Lower East Side partnership has is about discussing other ways to use a space, so I think that's going to be evolving about that as far as groups. The list we have right now are ones that, with a few exceptions, are ones that individual residents suggested to the two council offices and that's that's a list that was on the website since then, the only ones we have from groups, Jan Lee's email that I think Michael will share later with a plan, that's from a group and then Jimmy Carbone suggested 7th, Street and I'm sure he would have enough people in his group to do that. Maybe even more so part of my suggestion is that you vet. The street is the streets on the list that we're on the website are not vetted at all, and my I would suggest that you vet those and in and kind of let the who's going to manage them be a second part. Maybe they can't find anyone to manage them. Maybe they won't be open, but at least you'll have your decision on whether or not these are streets that should be open. There was one street that was taken off the list on the website and that's because the Fire Department contacted me and asked to have Avenue be taken off, but all the others are totally not vetted at all. That's you know for your discussion. Thank you. I am going to ask the committee if they have any other questions for Councilwoman Rivera's office for Jeremy and for the D-O-T. Does the committee have any other questions? Go ahead, Ella. So my question is just a follow-up in addition to bedding, what is the definition for success so if it requires a lot of support from community etc- and there seems to be variations of this experiment and there's a process to this experimentation, how do we define what is successful and what you know that would look like I can give one answer go answers, so we have a tremendous amount of complaints about lack of social, distancing and I believe because and I believe. One of the reasons for this is to give people more room to be outside and be able to social distance I, just echo. What susan saying is it's good? We have the same thing in our office, though. A number of complaints, we've gotten about social distancing concerns, whether it's in parks or on streets is it's. It honestly does not compare to any situation we've ever had in two and a half years in the council. It just doesn't and I think that metric is important. I also think, looking you know at having our public health experts. Look at. You know areas where open streets are implemented, particularly in areas where there have been high concentrations of Kobe cases to see if that has any effect on further transmission. Obviously, to caution like you know: there are numbers of factors, public health factors and initiatives and rules that help to decrease. You know spread of coronavirus, but you know that is something I certainly think woloson looking at as well, I could also add. One of our problems is illegal bars on the sidewalk which are causing areas of great non social distancing, and if there were a way, if this eventually allowed for some commercial use, it would be under criteria and not in the sort of non-compliant Wild West way. It's happening now. Susan. There is a lot of comments coming up in the chatbox wondering if you can give more information on what FDNY's concerns were without Mandi. They had a very short, very short conversation, but one of the things they said was you know, particularly from the second street, being accessed, to be able to respond to pick particularly fires east of that of Avenue B. But you know, we've never and I. Think all the years generally, we think the fire department is too lenient on what they allow and there often didn't commit community and community board concerns. This is the first time I've ever heard them say this could be a public safety factor in responding to fires, but it was particularly using Avenue B to get east of Avenue B Thank You Susan any of the committee members. Anybody else from the committee itself have any follow-up questions for the presenters tonight: no hands. Okay, I'm gonna. Ask any members of community board three. Do you have any follow-up questions for the presenters here tonight? Mailee go right ahead! Sorry, hello, sorry Oh! So my question was just about the streets on the other side of the Bowery. Is that being considered at another time? Nobody suggested any. You know. Are you talking about west of the Bowery or what gently he has a proposal that you haven't seen yet. Okay, all right, Trevor I, see your hand up. It's a quick question number one. The list, Susan I, see FDR couple lanes of that's the actual FDR or infant trap. I got that from car Lena's office. I said they have not been vetted at all. That was okay. That was just a just Acrobat I think that was from a constituent who, just you know, we some of them literally, have just been one line. Some of them have been well thought out. So that's fine and my second question just being in a neighborhood where they change streets. Pretty often, how are we going to, or this do t do- a community outreach in terms of letting residents note that this street may or may not be closed. It's important for people to know they don't want to go off the next day, because one person in a particular neighborhood said: hey, let's close the street without letting residents know so for VOT and I guess the counselor's office. Is there a vetting process that involves letting residents know who live on an affected? Street I would say that this any tree that gets approved it's a quick turnaround. By the same time, we do notify the electeds community boards and I'm sure the mayor will make an announcement. They are gonna pick streets by the end of this month. It's on a rolling basis, no I guess I'm, not informing people who live on the affected street. How does that happen? No announcements and through community board and elected I, mean obviously, if it's in everywhere else or may no feel like there are some ten associations, and maybe that would be all the way to throughout the week. I would just suggest adding that to avoid the, why did you close my Street emails and phone calls that the cb3 will get if you're not at least telling TAS and residents who live on the street? Those post fliers David go ahead. Somebody background noise, David, Crane, I, see your hand up so weird computers, bizarre I was gonna, say DoD. Could you put up? Could you put up signage flyers or something like Susan suggested, I think that's the most effective way and probably supported means to put them out in the streets: oh yeah, on the street itself or at the corner. Considering some installation I mean people, it's like everyone's at time work now, mm-hmm, okay, I opened that back. Thank you, David once again, final shot for any that can committee members or community board three members with any follow up questions for the two presenters: okay, no hands, so the public has a lot of opinions to say tonight. I see the chat room is and overflowing I reading those chats as we speak, I believe there were some people who wanted to have a public comment tonight. I. If you could raise your hands and I will call you in order, I want to limit your time to public comment to two minutes, each maybe less. If possible, I believe before I get to the I, see Jennifer raised her hand. Did you want to add something Jennifer or is that by accident that would by accident Lori? Okay, all right, I see one two, three, four, five, six one, two three four five, six people that would make that want to make a public comment. I want to keep it to under two minutes on your public comment on this specific agenda item of the hundred streets and what will be this specific item anyway? I can see the participant list again here we go Jan Lee you're the first hand I see raised. You have two minutes. Thank you very much committee and thank you for giving us an opportunity to present. We just had a few questions, and perhaps the committee can consider this as they work on streets throughout the district. One is that we understand the D-O-T does not require that the barricades be manned for the entire time that they were going to be put out. So that's something to consider whether or not an automobile owner will move the barricade who's going to move it back. The other thing is that we actually feel that the allowance of skateboarders and cyclists to go through these closed streets is defies the whole reason that we're going to be calling them safe streets because there's an expectation of safety by walking into a barricaded Street that used to have bicycles on it and now is supposed to not have bicycles on it and when people walk into this, that expectation of safety should be there. The other thing is that we are very concerned that essentially, the bid folks will be responsible to ask people to either wear a mask or to social distance. They may be not proficient in English. Many of the ones in at least in the chinatown area are actually Chinese and given the high uptick in biased crime, we have a serious concern that they are going to be responsible to then confront people. As time goes on. We have a. We want to make sure that there are proper ambassadors in place, that don't put them completely in danger and have them as the sole source of enforcement, and so that that's one of our concerns- and you know the last thing- is just the storage of the barricades in the crosswalks. Are we going to block it for wheelchairs and people with walkers and people with canes, and that's the only questions we had? Thank you. Thank you. Jen Lee, I, don't know if any. If DLT wants to answer any of those questions before I go on to the next question next topic, member, the one for barriers that could be placed. If it's not gonna be on the sidewalk, then it's gonna be against the curb which could be a parking spot Jeremy. Did you want to offer anything else on behalf of accounts woman's office? To answer any of those questions, thank you all right, Thank, You, Jen, Wendy, Brower I, see your hand raised. Does the next person up you have two minutes? I didn't know we could make requests, but I wondered if high school students could get service-learning credit. For being my you know, being the person mayor of the black and helping manage things, maybe that's a good way to get young people involved this summer is D-O-T planning or any group planning some kind of training video that volunteers can watch. So they understand what the role is if they take this job on I think that could be really helpful. Some pointers that you can watch before you do this. Gardens are parks, really community gardens are owned, but mostly owned by the city, and most many of them are part of the parks departments. Are these spaces also be prioritized by community gardens and I'm? Thinking of some, we have some beautiful examples on our streets that would be so nice to be by even if you can't go into the garden quite yet and I think that's about it. I want to I really want to help more people feel like they can be part of this and help their community. It's a really wonderful way for people of all ages to give back to the city and to help make it more healthy and safe for everyone, and it's a safe thing to do for people of all ages and backgrounds. So I, don't think language issues should be a barrier and that we can get the young people involved and get them to be thinking long-term about mobility in the city and their role in it, not just the self esteem they will get from helping people be out safely in the street I understand summer. Youth employment span canceled, but for now, but maybe the I hope it gets back on, but maybe they get service-learning credit and that's something of value to them as well. Thank You Wendy, the is do T or does the council woman's office want to address any of you? She just brought up I. Think that's a great idea. I! Don't have an answer to that, but I'll certainly take that and the question for my team. Thank you and I'll just say it in general, I mean it's not just this issue, though there's a lot of ways. We want to look at SYEP, Summer, Youth, Employment, two, how that can be adopted in this covert environment. It's so certainly I will take that back as well for budget negotiations. Thank you so much Thank You, Wendy Tresh Wald, am I. Saying that correctly you are next up. Call it five dear. How are you sorry about that? Okay, I just wanted to raise the idea that if there is a concern of safety issue on Avenue, B I think there is a need. The thing is: Avenue B is a major through there for pedestrians and the sidewalks are very narrow. So if there's no option of opening two streets completely two pedestrians, maybe DoD can just remove parking on the side of the street at the curb side and replace it with barricades in order to just double the width of the sidewalk I just observed the sidewalk on B, for example, between sixth Street and 7th Street, going to the grocery store. This space is very narrow, and it's just if you remove the cars next to the curb, then you get access and it's in multiple blocks. It's the same thing I observed on 9th Street between a and 1st, which is I'm not sure about the least I, haven't seen the list. I assume it's also a street that will not be available because of PD concern again. Do you walk on the very narrow sidewalk on ninth Street between a and 1st, if you remove just the cars next to it and you put barricades instead of that, you get much more space for pedestrians. That's my suggestion. Thank You, mr. wold I, don't know! If do tea or councilwoman's office wants to address Sam what he just said. I put note of it. I don't have an answer right now, but there is a possibility. So let me pin that back. Awesome, Thank, You, Jimmy, Carbone I, see your hand raised more than happy to see you on here. So it's your turn. Thanks. Paul I just want to speak for a 7th Street, how they recommend 7th Street between Avenue, a and 3rd Avenue. A couple reasons: first, that if you notice with traffic patterns when it's busier, 7th Street is usually a very highly traffic Street, because people will take that instead of going on st. Mark's, for example, it's also there's no bus lane and we have a really strong tradition of working together with small merchants on the street and the churches and residents I'm a resident on 7th Street and have been a business owner and I'm also been a founding board member of the East Village independent merchants for 5 years. I. Just think that those 3 three blocks would be very interesting on each block. There's a church, there's the st. George Ukrainian Church on one block, there's the side of middle Collegiate Church on another and there's the polish Polish Catholic Church on another there's a lot of spirit on those blocks at 7 o'clock, every night, where the three blocks, where there's a lot of really great people calling out their windows and I, think that it there's not too much commercial businesses on those blocks. But there's enough things like van Lew and ice cream and big gay ice cream. That's that they're there they're people will use it appropriately and again with the presence of the churches. Perhaps the churches may be able to do something social distancing as well I think it would benefit the community. I know that my wife, for example, really wants to go outside, but she's someone that it is afraid she's. You know we're close to 60. She wants to observe social distancing always so. If we knew that we could walk on the streets and not have to worry about our sidewalks there's no buses involved and right now, there's not really any traffic. I, don't see that many cars going down our streets, there's not really made deliveries going on, so I just recommend the 7th Street blocks. Thank you. Thank you for the recommendation. I know you wrecked your. You were recommending 7th Street between 3rd Avenue and Avenue way. Jimmy. Is that correct? Okay I got you I saw you all right. Next person welcome before I move on does do T or the council woman's office want to address Jimmy, but I think he just means simply made a recommendation. Thank you that once again, what Michael? Just said, if you're on the phone and dialed into the zoom meeting tonight's star nine, to raise your hand, I am going through the order. I see the hands raised. The next person I have listed on here boy Prince for Congress. You have two minutes to speak on the topic: hi how's it going. Thank you I actually was missed a little earlier, so just wanted to I could speak at the end of this item, because my comment would be out of order at this moment. Okay, so I apologize for that I. Believe you wanted to make a public comment earlier. I apologize for missing. Your must have not seen your hand raised. I will not be discussing that topic for the remainder of the evening, but we can definitely speak about it offline, which will probably be an agenda item most likely for you. Okay, I also encourage you to go to the public, the full board and public comments. In a couple weeks. You can look up that information on the community. Okay, thank you. Much appreciated. Alright, next person I have one sure well with that being said, then, as far as it related to the enforcement of the safe streets, you know it could be a potential recipe for disaster, depending on the who. What when and where, just because a lot of people are already got a lot of cabin fever from being inside for so long and you know, are excited to have a chance to get outside see some of the neighbors you know enjoy what's best about New York, which is our streets, and you know just the day-to-day life so figuring out a way to enforce the social distancing without breaking social distancing, and then you know having it become something where it's a just a just, a potentially worse situation. A disaster we've seen some of the you know, brutality, that's gone on and again most people have good intentions and wanting to preserve the health and the public health of the neighborhood and the community. But some people I get a little too gung-ho about that and then forget about the whole reason that we're doing this is to stay safe and to stay apart. So you know there has to be some type of innovative ways to find out how we can again enforce social distancing and remind me of the public the importance of that without breaking social distancing and bringing more because what I've seen happen is someone will not be wearing a mask or it not be social distancing, and then the response will be hey. Let's get six people or, let's get you know a group of cops or whoever that people are in that situation to then enforce social distancing, and now these people are the ones that are interacting with the community, the most the enforcers. If you will and every time they do, they break social distancing, making it easier for the virus to spread I, don't know seen some of the stats doing this. So that was just my comment about that and figuring out. Thank you that way to do that. No much appreciate it. I does the Councilwoman in office, one I can I know we address enforcement earlier and my question I: do you guys want to speak on enforcement again? I, don't know if we need to really beat that again. I know: there's a lot of questions surrounding enforcement. Still, do you want to address it again or do you would you I mean I'll just say briefly? You know we obviously have been very concerned about on my PD involvement in any sort with social distancing measures, open streets or otherwise we had a letter kind of condemning the situation with officer Garcia on Avenue D. We called for his removal from the NYPD we're gonna, be introducing legislation around oversight and data on enforcement of social distancing. When it comes to the open streets program, you know again we're working with do T, so I can't speak with, and we're advocating for things to do. T do T is running the program, so my what I'm, what I'm saying is not there's not an endorsement from do T, but it you know. Certainly. We believe that this program should have a minimum yeah as a minimum or no involvement with NYPD is possible and we certainly there are other people in the city work force. You can take on that role of you know. There may be certain circumstances were NYPD except some sort of involvement, but you know I think. For the most part, we want to try to get as much community and non police involvement as possible. Thank you. All right, we're gonna move on to the next person. Luke Nadal had their hand raised down, trying to am I in muted you're, unmuted. Okay, sorry about that. Alright. So thank you for inviting me to speak and providing this opportunity. I live on 14th Street here in Manhattan I'm, also a consultant in urban planning and transportation in major cities. Internationally cities like changing in Jakarta, Nairobi, Sao, Paolo, Bogata, Mexico City, and a number of this cities open major streets to pedestrian cyclist on a weekly basis every weekend. So there's a long experience around the world on doing this thing, so naturally, I strongly support the open Street project and not only to ease the pedestrian movement and to allow for more space for safe physical distancing, but I think we also need to think about what's coming up next and that we have to prepare for the needs of people. We have to turn to new forms of transportation as our city reopens for business, if you, if you will I, foresee a massive rise in cycling generally people, we want to use this very efficient mode of transportation that also allows naturally physical distancing. There should be there will be a need for a rapid expansion of surf surface public transit, namely rapid, efficient bus service unprotected and dedicated lanes on the motor lab I would suggest of DM 14 on 14th Street, so we need. We need shared space and I. Think there's many examples where this perfect gravitation of coexistence of cyclists and pedestrian as long as the speed is limited five miles per hour is perfect. I would like everyone to keep in mind that the sidewalks will still exist even on open streets, so particularly vulnerable pedestrians, saying confirmed. Elderly people, for example, is I will be, will be protected there, Thank You Maya preciate your comments. It was there any Street specific that I didn't catch. That you said was any Street specific that she wanted to have proposed. I know you said you're on 14th Street, but did you say 14th Street was something you proposed because I don't think 14th Street is allowed to be a part of that plan. No I think 43 is fine as it is. It is right now possibly extending that the sidewalks would be good. I really think that Avenue B Avenue B should be your mark, at least on. Maybe part of it would be possible to barricade maybe two out of four lanes and I still keep access for emergency vehicles, which is of course extremely important. Okay, thank you. Luke I appreciate it. Thank you. I am going to move on to the next. The do t1 take those recommendations, back I, believe or do you want to answer any of that? Let me take it back mm-hmm. Thank you. The next person I have is a hand raised. Is Elizabeth disregard my saying that correctly I apologize if I'm watching maine's something? Yes. Can you hear me? Yes, that's fine! Thank you, I'm, a long-term resident of East Village and, first of all, thank you for talking about and considering this program. I think it's hugely important, especially as the weather gets warmer, and people are desperate to be outside, but want to do it safely. I think all of us, who've walked or biked in the neighborhood in the last two months also know that the reality is. This is what's already happening. People are walking in the street because they have to if you want to keep six feet away from people, you're already walking what sorry somebody's yeah all right. So hello, we can still hear you, okay, yeah, so the reality is, people are already walking in the street. You know you have to if you want to save six feet from you in most of the East Village and a lot of the city, so by closing these streets, while we're not making it a hundred percent safe, we're making it a whole lot safer than it is right now, I also want to say on bikes and walking together we see it on summer streets every summer. There's no reason why we can't share the streets together also for little kids to be able to be out on their bikes. You know as long as people respect each other there's room for everyone. I want to particularly make a case for Avenue B. It is a huge transition from the bridge from Brooklyn into the neighborhood to the park and, right now you know it's almost impossible to walk down that street safely without being close to people. Also on a bike: it's not safe. It's a very narrow street we've been advocating for a very long time for bike paths there, but for right now, I feel like it's really urgent, that this is particularly a street that we need just to be able to go safely through the neighborhood. Certainly, all the streets around Tompkins Square would be great too, because again we're already seeing overflow. Sorry about that with the clock, any specific Street you have in mind yes, I think particularly I hope, you'll reconsider, Avenue B. There must be a way to work with the fire department. It's hugely important as a street that takes people through the neighborhood and right now, if you've been over there, people are walking in the street. It's you know, there are bars, yes, there's a lot of stuff going on, but we really need that space to get through the neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you. Elizabeth I appreciate it. Thank you for your comments. Andrew Gilbert is the next person with their hand raised. Please go ahead. You have two minutes hello, I heard previously into the chat, a Google map that as well confusing, so I wanted to take my time to talk about that. As we all know, the Lower East Side currently has a grid of Stanton Rivington and then Ludlow and Orchard I believe between Allen and Essex. We have before open streets and I think that the model that we have there - the issues with the limited hours is a really good model, because if we consider the potential reasons why we might want these streets for transportation, for recreation, for just the ability for people to leave the house and still have still maintained space having a network like this, where there's basically it's a lot easier to sort of have a few choke points where we limit access and slow cars, it makes it a lot simpler to maintain and it makes it a lot more sustainable. The system in order to make a system like this better for people to be able to move throughout the neighborhood I. Think it's really important that we consider expanding these super blocks out in a network and the map I created I have sent in the comments. Basically, it shows all of the streets in red that would not really be good candidates for these networks either because there's a fire department there there's a bus route. It's a heavy traffic street like Delancey or Houston, but for all the other streets. I. Think it's good. Basically, if we make a map of a grid of these streets that are good to preserve traffic flow on all the streets in between, we can consider it. The super blocks in the model of what Barcelona has done, or what a lot of streets in Japan look like outside of major roads and what the Netherlands does with their residential streets for all these, basically just put barricades mid-block put barricades intersections. They don't have to be impermeable, but just make it put a block in the middle of the street and so that a car can't go 15 or 20 miles an hour and they have to really slowly navigate around it. And then you don't even need to have a pool, barricade blocking it and cars and still enter all they want. They just will not be able to go quickly if I had to recommend one or two specific areas, since obviously building a whole network may be difficult, given the constraint I would second everyone with Avenue B and the streets next to that, but also recommend that we move down Clinton Street south of there as well extending east of the thank you Andrew. Thank you for sharing that map. I appreciate that before I, move, I will continue on with the public. I just want to acknowledge that our assembly member Harvey Epstein, has joined the committee meeting, but I will move on to the net rest of the public in their comments. Thank you. Andrew for the committee will definitely use that map tonight. When we're discussing the resolution. Tommy Loeb is the next person I have with their hand raised yes, thank you can hear me I hope. Yes, we can. Thank you very good. I am I have used such a street in another city for a couple of years, and it's a street a major street in the city. That's closed during weekends for bikers and pedestrians, and the one thing that I haven't heard about is: we need enormous amount of signage, big signs that would indicate to drivers what the rules are when they're in effect, so that people know that the street has a special use. Just putting a barricade doesn't mean anything because people drive if there's no activity, people wouldn't understand what the barricade even means. So DMT has to put up very large and a lot of signage. The other is and I thank Jeremy for discussing this school crossing guards, traffic enforcement agents, parking enforcement agents they're all under utilized right now. There is no reason why we can't make use of their services to station them at these locations, at least to begin with, until drivers get used to it and I can say from using it in another city, the rule is, you can drive one block before you have to make a similar to 14th Street you're allowed to drive one block to park your car to get your car. The access or dry drop something off, but you must Macy hurt immediate turn what that's free in order to preserve the safety of the street. It's just not rocket science signage. Some enforcement to begin with and picking the same streets is all that's really necessary and I really want to emphasize the school crossing guards they're known in the community. They have training in this kind of work and they're totally capable of doing this. Thank you, Thank You, Tommy, I, appreciate it. I know, signage is a big issue. That's been brought up already today, but yet no signage is definitely big issue that we need to talk about and I have one recommendation and that's East, Broadway and I think it was on a list but I'd like to second that East Broadway from Grand to Essex, Thank You, Tommy I appreciate that grants is expect all right all right. Sophie Helen is the next person with their hand raised merits. I was on the Transportation Committee a long while back, but thank you guys so much for your service in this very challenging time and thank you to our electeds on the call as well I'm wondering about resources. I, don't know if Jennifer from Quixote still on but I'm hoping that we can get some actual financial resources, even if a small amount to be put towards some kind of barriers that aren't just NYPD barriers. So you know planters, for example, some of the signage that folks were talking about. These do not seem like big asks and Jeremy Unger for you all for Carlene his office I'm wondering if there's any discretionary budget I know the city budget is tight right now, but like this is such an important issue like the social distancing, is not happening. I actually was walking. My dog this morning on Avenue B about two feet of distance and a guy stepped on him. Definitely my dog's paws like this is just a no brainer. We need this space and I. Don't think it's a high cost ask the other thing. Is a lot of people are raising I? You know the issue of NYPD enforcement, which is huge I, do not think we need NYPD involved. The community can handle this. The community organizations who are interested can handle this, and you know we can use some of the earlier brought up crossing guards. Absolutely amazing. We can use crossing guards. We can use a lot of the younger people who want to get community service points or folks who are looking for jobs, training to be part of this great community network and help people get the recreation space that they need, while keeping them safe. That's all I had to say Thank You Sophie. The first question I believe was for dota and dota responsive athletes. Jennifer I am on a line for barriers. It doesn't have to be them IPD, it could be the French barricades or the blue sawhorses. But then again we can also use planters because we I think we do have some of those available. Well, let that I've seen sort of like the rolling planters used in some of the parks around yeah yep like there's, definitely different types of barriers, I became users. Great I. Think all cars need is the signal you know all people need to see is that there is some kind of barrier. There is some kind of signage, but does not need to be an NYPD valid barrier does not need to be this huge thing. I think the community is gonna figure it out. I really have faith in the Lower East Side in East Village, to make these streets what they need to be for this summer. Thank you Jeremy. Would you want to answer Sophie's question yeah I'll, just then Sophie I'm. So sorry, your dog experience, not because that's the worst. We don't. Nobody wants that. I know that no I know that I can speak. I, don't have a dog right now the council and has a wonderful pug, who has certainly I think with appreciate more open streets as well, but that you know I'm, not the councilman's budget director said I want to comment. The councilman's discretionary budget is but I can tell you just from like hearing from different groups that we are getting so many requests to save funding and it's a really start budget situation, because the city cannot raise its own revenue. So it's basically, you know if you want to add something that they cut something else, and so we're in this really difficult situation right now with the budget, you know, I certainly think it's gonna be something we're gonna, be looking at really closely to see how that can be implemented with this program, The Alibi. Being that benefit of this program is that it's a low cost? It's a low cost program to implement the in terms of for how widely effective it can be. Obviously there may be need to be some increased costs associated with it. You know we're gonna, basically look and see how the you know rollout goes, and you know we can certainly try to advocate for that, though, if we need to look what we save on NYPD enforcement could be spent on those planters and signage barricades. You know the whole the whole deal. Thank you. Thank you, I, believe the assembly members short on time, I will, if you wanted to say anything right now, please go ahead. I know you can only be on for another 10 minutes who we need to do better job social distancing and we need avenues, but I just raised the issue aside streets too, because this crosstown opportunity for social distancing is there as well and so I just I just really wanted to open those two I think the suggestions are having you be a really good idea: I think that they? What we saw this past weekend below house and Street, seemed to work out well and I think the problem we all we have is their use, the Business Improvement District model, and we just need to think about more creative models to be doing it north of house and where there isn't a good, strong bid and so side streets. You know I mentioned sixth Street in 10th Street, just because they have access to the park and of people doing social distancing and going to the park closing off the streets, something they would both be near. Tompkins Square, if you're doing from Third Avenue all the way to a nudie or to the river I, think those are opportunities as well and wondering what people, and at least what parks is thinking I know we have apps to keep talking to them around east west, as well as north south Thank You assembly. Member Epstein appreciate it. I believe I just saw Troy Velez his hand up, but he went down. Does he still want to say anything you're next on the line, but I guess he dropped off Troy? Yes, I have a question about to the people that want Avenue, B, open I just have a problem with it, because there was a mention of the fire trucks hidden through. How do they expect the fire trucks to get through to get to the east side, to Avenue D and in the blocks? That way, when that's the only firehouse that serves like lily and wall, all the way to 8th Street I, don't see how it's done, I'm Susan. Do you want to answer that? Or do we want to van as an opposition comment? I think he he's absolutely right, but, however, you know some of the comments about opening one lane might be a possibility, yeah. That seems like a better possibility, a dead, closing the whole street down yeah, not allowing the fire department to get out. So there are criteria. I hope you have pry Tyrion after the speakers to show. So there are certain streets, such as any Street with the bus lane. That is not eligible, I think with the fire department saying they need that Street I think it's no longer eligible. They are experts on what they need to you know say we have much higher responses for the fire department in, say: b3, then most of Manhattan there they're very busy, but I do think extending they know taking the parking Lane could be a possibility. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Susan Thank, You, Troy Jason Gertz hand raised, am I, saying that correctly. Yes, so I just wanted to add to the comments that many of the other people were making in support of Avenue B, the primary reason being that the sidewalks are incredibly narrow, some of them as narrow as four feet. Three feet, even at certain pinch points two feet, so it's just very difficult to even walk under those circumstances. Without you know getting uncomfortably close to people I believe it meets a lot of the city's criteria, which is that it's next to a park well being Tompkins, Square Park, as well as schools and playgrounds that are now closed. But maybe that creates an opportunity to bring crossing guards in to help and it connects with the bike. Network, there's, no bus and so on. You know, in addition to that I'd like to just make a comment about how the whole program is being rolled out on one hand, I'm a huge supporter of open streets. In theory, I wish that the city was taking a more of a decisive role here, rather than kind of punting this off to the community, because what that will do is create a situation where people who already live next to parks get even more open space and people who don't live next to parks or don't have as good of organization or bizarre resources to maintain an open street. We're not going to have the same opportunity to get this space, so it occurred the city, the D-O-T and so on to take a more active role and you know, support the equity agenda. That's being stated by taking the lead and doing this without waiting for everybody in the community to figure out the DLT. The city should have the resources to take this on Thanks. Thank you. Jason appreciate your comments. I, don't think any response is needed right. There I think I'll take it. Hopefully, I get a lot of it. Today. Dan T as his hand raised Dan, T, yep, I, think I just unmuted, but my Internet's, a little spotty so much okay, excellent, so I have a lot to say: I mean a lot of those streets that were on the list where my I wrote to the both council, members that are in this community district and I so Trevor. That was me that put in two lanes in the FDR, but I'm I understand that's a more complicated, my biggest one. That first part the whole duty work that's happening under there. It's already should be a stayer tree right now, it's mostly storage of parked cars and a lot of blind corners for people going off the sidewalk in the park. So that would be my biggest push and I think that should be an NYPD staffed one, but as far as I'd like to love to echo all both as a connector to the park, but also expanding the park and I would suggest taking away parking, if not one directional lane the traffic of all four sides of Tompkins Square Park to be open streets to expand the park. I'm not representing the parks department but I am my job is to patrol the park, so I've seen the necessary need for more park space around the parts that are already existing and so yeah Avenue B and since it came up, I think that the live on Rivington, Street I think that the ours should be expanded for the hell Square area, because if those restaurants plan to open and want to expand open streets would be the excellent way because they could have more seating and then do it legally, instead of the illegal drinking operations that are happening right now. Thank you. Thanks for submitting those recommendations to the office, I appreciate that, and that's what generated most of our list tonight and we'll get into that. There is I believe there was one person trying to get into a public comment. I'll allow this person, then the zest was that those name I was looking at the zest. I believe you will be the last person of the night from a public comment, section zest, 249 I, believe you were trying to raise your hand, I, don't know I'm, not sure I. Can you guys can hear me or not? Now we can to 49 Bros 3 floor. You sigh I'm, not worried, I, just raised my hand, a lot I'm, not sure how to raise our hand, I mean, of course, like I'm. Totally support like to why you guys talk about I will I want totally like if we come man like a front glass, three on Bruce, Lee and funk when she to Delancey and then fun on the street to LA, know well presented like because our the street arm I'm Bruce tree and then the Archer is kinda like most of the times, not very like driving three I taste it like a also. Is it going to be very good for the local business that that's one thinking, because I didn't prepare for the presentation, so I didn't know how to pose and I didn't know how to say, but I think this is where idea I think I totally support the law inside alright. Thank you, yeah. Sorry, thank you. Could you repeat exactly what street was it that we actually I'm the sushi restaurant on 249 Broome Street? No, you side, okay! So, between room between I mean all right below the line. Okay, thank you. I appreciate you trying to try, then good present thing I, just like I'm, really enjoying why you guys are conversations, but it's just like don't worry about it. I'm nervous too. So I am gonna close out. The public portion I want to thank everybody from the public that have offered comments and commentary tonight and questions for car Lena's office, because woman's office and the Department of Transportation I know this is an ongoing matter, but for right now we are actually going to move to the resolution, and that will be just committee discussion. Only so I believe the public will be on mute for this entire time, but I think Susan wants to say something before yeah I was wondering if you want to look at the criteria first, because I'm not sure all the board members, oh Michael, just put it on okay, yes, I think the criteria is I. Do think. I'll start this task the this part of the resolution, because we do have two resolutions to look at tonight and it is already 804 so I want to chop through this a little bit. Let's look at the criteria so now, as we move on towards dealing with the resolution itself in the streets that we want to think about being closed, can we pull that up a little bit so the first page back to the first page? Thank you. Is there any way that these gonna be sent email to us, and then we can just look at it right now. I believe the criteria right I understand that, but we don't have control over the speed of the scroll right, and so it's much easier. If we get these email to us and then we can just look at it Simonson's right now. Thank you. Can you meet yes, yeah, okay, so I guess with the committee inferred a lot of recommendations tonight. What are your thoughts about the streets? I know we're going to look at the criteria in a second. When should we pull it back up? This is for the entire committee. What are your thoughts I want to hear I know kind of today was a lot thrown at us. What are your thoughts? What are the streets that we that you're thinking of what are your opinions on your thoughts about this process? Let's start debating this a little bit and we agree to take the FDR Drive off of the list. I think I would hope. We'd all agree that putting pedestrians an imperial highway is not the best idea and then the other thing that I love to discuss is enforcement. Do we want high school kids, having or others Manning barriers and potentially getting into altercations with people who want to drive through to make a delivery or cut through to the FDR Drive I'm really concerned about that, whether it's police, somebody from the bid, a high school kid, a volunteer I, think that's a major should be a major consideration for this plan. Lady I agree with you on the enforcement portion. I think that's definitely gonna have to they're. Gonna, have to figure this out and figure it out soon. How this is gonna look and yes, I'm with you on the fact that I don't know if young people should be doing the enforcement. You know I would love for young people to get jobs, especially with us, well IEP being cut down and they need it. I agree. I think that's something we think about. Thank you for taking FDR Drive loss, because I think we wanted that one off as any other streets you thinking of well, then you say you know: I I'm also concerned about us forcing street closures on some streets where residents may have a reason for not wanting that so I'm a little concerned about outreach not being done quickly enough to the concerned residents and the other thing is Avenue B. Having heard the of the fire department's concern about that, I think Public Safety has to be the that the paramount concern for any Street and hearing that FDNY has great concerns about not being able to utilize Avenue B and is, if somebody mentioned. How does the fire department get to the developments on Avenue D from the firehouse? That's a major concern and I asked Paul. Can you clarify what is it that we are discussing, because I didn't think from what I heard that we were approving individual streets? We are okay, yeah, sorry about that. I didn't make that clear. We are going to improve individual streets for today, another face of streets. So if we want to give some input into what those streets are, they're actually want to see our draft resolutions and may not even wait for the right so I think for tonight we really just got to focus on the streets. I understand the enforcement issue. Lee trust me I, think that may be something we put on the agenda. Let's say maybe next month where we put a resolution together for enforcement specific, especially now that we're hearing more and more from the community I think for tonight and tonight's purposes. For this resolution we got to figure out which streets should it be open should remain open should be that's who that's what we'll be talking about on this resolution? Does that make that clear? Is that? Is that clear enough Susan go ahead? Yeah I think Ted Street is a bust Street right, so that should be taken off. I want to recommend particularly 7th Street, because we have people that will be responsible for that. This is and I just hold you up for a second Michael. Can you bring up the street list? Suze I'm, sorry to cut you off. Do you want just finish your statement? So I can move to Ellen sure what I was going to say. Some of them to me seem to be easy streets to support. Some you know might be Burnet controversial. 10Th Street is not going to be eligible because it's about it's a bus route, 7th Street we have Jimmy's group- that's willing to take care of us, so I would think that would be an easy one to do. In he's, East Broadway people they actually did not come from the council offices. It came from people that live down there. Yeah say yeah I'm, gonna, grooming, down 10th street, because it's also the FDR Drive service road to goes FDR drive south. So a lot of people use that on the loop and Jacob Riis. So that's got to come off. Ellen go ahead! Allen! You need to hit the spacebar time. You yourself, I can't do it for you, Allen Ellen, okay, Ellen, when I guess, when I don't know, if you're having technical issues or something like that, all right, yes, Seussical XL, go back, see Cooper, Square, Cooper Square also has buses Cooper squared off to this Cooper and I. Should we be doing raised hands, or is it few enough? Yes, I'm trying, but go ahead and jump in David? If you wanted to say something, okay. Is there a draft of a resolution, because this seems like a letter that was sent to us and then a list that was tacked on there is it is not what we're looking at and it's not a tacked up anything what I did is I put together the guidelines and information and then I added on below that for you to see the submitted streets. The resolution is there's two resolutions you're voting on tonight and those are both separate. So these streets haven't been vetted by agencies. Yet no, the only thing that was vetted by an agency in any capacity was Avenue B by FDNY they're, the only ones who responded so then the resolution that we would be sending would be a. We find the program very interesting and we would like to suggest these streets be considered and they were okay, crashed, oh okay, all right, Alan, that's fine! What did you want to say yeah, so I, just since were I guess, begging. Now these streets I, who my question was just the vetting process right that was brought up. So what is the vetting criteria for assessment of these blocks? Well, that's. What is uptime all right. Can we just know you just got the list? Can we just scroll up and we'll go from there and we'll talk about that and then we'll pull up the resolution? And then those guidelines are basically it yeah. Can you just go yeah go down to that bullet point list. So let's look at the bullets. Let's read through them really quick, proposing organizations with such strong ties to the community and demonstrate their capacity and manage to open street by providing a staffing, a staffing plan, so staffing plan has to be provided. Open streets can not be proposed on bus routes, truck routes or hospital corridors. Open street closures may be proposed for any number of days in a row or on current days exactly like if they only choose one day, I guess one day, but it seems like it's gonna, be everything or continuously for the entire duration of the program. So I assume that, with these guidelines, I mean it would be I me I will speak for myself. It would be difficult. Let me to follow these guidelines to assess and answer these bullet points like tonight within, like the next 20 minutes, I mean clearly I'm, not an expert on every block, with NCB to be right and of its community uniqueness and alliances. So I would need a little bit more resource. I agree with the other night. You know I can talk clearly about streets above house, then all the way up to 14th, but anything below that I wouldn't be as well. First but and we all have different, we all live in different areas of this district of cb3, so we know different areas. I, don't know. If any of the committee members want to jump on that. Well, it's specifically why I advocated so strongly to get people like Ellen on, so we had someone with familiarity with the streets down there. It is true that nobody knows all of it, but I think. As a committee members, we do kind of have it covered right. Do you have concerns about this process, though it I mean I, don't really like concerns it. Just it's I, just don't know exactly where the list came from Suzie well, where the list came from was resident, so residents in general have been asking that streets closed for pedestrians, most of these streets, our streets, that residents sent in to both council offices and said these are streets. I want you to consider so most of them became I got them from the council office, because I thought it would be good to have something to start with, as far as the process since I'm dealing every day all day with issue with everything within the boundaries of the pandemic. What I would like to say is this is something people are asking for they're asking for it quickly. It's going to happen quickly. It's because it's a very unique situation. People were very upset that the first round of streets did not come from the community board, since there is going to be another round very quickly, because that's what the community is asking for, and city council really pressured the mayor to do this. You know it's absolutely not ideal, but this gives us input. If you know, if you pick a street, it doesn't mean that the CEO tea and everyone else is still going to vet them. They're not going to do anything that stagers are inappropriate, you're doing it, not as experts you're doing it from a community input. Standpoint general, you know dangerous situations or something that needs traffic expertise. This is community input thing that you have that you know, so this isn't just backtrack a little bit. We could offer literally seven streets on the resolution and the vetting process could be DoD, FDNY NYPD and if one of those agency says absolutely not at all great correct, so they could literally go through all seven streets that we offer on a resolution and we could literally end up with nine an area, that's its advisory input. This is what you would like and then they're gonna use the expertise of their agencies to bet them absolutely that's the way everything's done you're just doing it much faster, who has just joined us. Oh okay, I'm, sorry about that and I didn't mean to intentionally ignore. Okay. What one welcome to the to the board? Troy! Sorry about that, thank you and don't rank it. Michael I just have suggestion. I see that foresight streak was on there, but it had a little comma of FDR Drive put to it. But if we looked at a four side street between Delancey and Houston Street, that would probably be a great Street to open Paul can I am. Can I make a suggestion to two suggestions? One I think given Susan's information earlier about how the program is evolving. I think we could make this kind of a wish list that, as things change, perhaps like given the suggestions, for example an Avenue fee that, rather than closing the whole street one lane or removing Part B, or something like that. So we could put this more as a wish list of streets that we hope will have some sort of implementation, whether or not it's a full closure or if it's more of a partial closure, either physically partial or ours. Partial I think that, given you know, it's a Susan's point that we didn't have a lot of time to quote, but this street the streets- that's not really. Our job here is to make recommendations based on what the community wants to see and we've gotten already and I. Think you know, I have a couple of more suggestions than were on the initial list, we're in the Lower East Side, where you know I am or familiar with. So maybe if we as community board members decided on this the list of streets that we'd like to see something happen, and perhaps we add that language to the resolution as well can I suggest it might be helpful to read the resolution. Can we get Michael tell me to read it I? Have it open space or transportation safe streets, that's transportation, safe streets, I prefer yeah I'll, see it once you pop up there, you go. That's it there. We go. Okay, I'll, write it where, as responsible with 19 social distancing requirements, the city is proposing temporary, safe street designations. That would close certain public streets, vehicular traffic and open them up to the des transit cyclists and whereas on designated safe streets, no through vehicular traffic will be permitted during effective hours. Typically 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and vehicles will be limited to local deliveries, pickups drop-offs, necessary city service vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles. Only sorry, it's my roommate. In the background, these drivers are advised to be extremely cautious and to drive five miles per hour or slower, and whereas this is meant to address the public health need for more space and social distancing that a typicals to be sidewalk can accommodate and to create additional open spaces for New York City residents for a safe and appropriate social distancing can be observed, and whereas this need is expected to be even greater in the coming summer months, as residents will not have access to New, York City public pools, beaches or summer camps, and there will likely be a strain on cd3 parks unless additional open spaces are made available, therefore, be it resolved. Well, these are the two options for whether or not we would approve it or not, approve the designation of certain streets. No, they they're both there's I think there's supposed to be both sorry yeah, but someone will be recommending streets and will be not recommending streets and asking the sage to come back to cv3 for additional recommendations. Right, no I think the second one is and if there are further recommendations, come back to the city, I mean it's just an option of ours to say we don't recommend anything or you know whatever. Oh well, I I'm, not I'm, not advocating for that position. There absolutely will be. Furthermore, this is the second phase of continuing phases. Okay, what did Michelle? You said you wanted to add something in the language. Well, that's then, let's move it before we start doing that oops, so I'll move that we adopt this well, thank you that we could start modifying. So do you want me to copy and paste the list of streets from the other document into here and edit it while you guys are discussing streets? Please I have a question regarding the time on the second. Whereas is it so? Is it typically from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. generally? That's what it's going to be I believe. Well, some are less yeah. That is the tip that is typically what it is, but, as just I think Jen's off the call-out. She said it could be anything you could propose anything, but that is like the I think that's the longest possible opening. You can have right about I'll move that we strike Cooper square, that we strike 10th Street between D and East River Park, and that we strike a couple of lanes of the FDR northbound along East River Park. Is anybody disagree with that from the committee? Was the committee on - I moved to add Avenue B into the list, as recommended by the community? Go ahead, I see your hands. Susan I was gonna, say what about the one you're not gonna get Avenue, because that's right, Fire Department is saying no, so there's no chance, but what about using the one language, maybe you could get yeah I was gonna suggest that we that we, someone had already suggested it earlier an hour ago in the conversation about language I, think it was Michelle. You had language that you spoke about how to do that and then say that we may be temporary close to eco traffic or otherwise. You know modified to increase pedestrian space on the adjoining sidewalk, and then we can just have our list if you can think what you said. Michelle potential like solution to increase social distancing, something I mean okay, let's say it's hard to do this on the fly, whereas some streets will not be acceptable. Sorry I was recommend above the above. The first therefore be resolved, let's say, whereas some streets that will not meet acceptable agency criteria and that will not meet agency criterion for approval to be closed are going to be important for are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing. These streets could be adapted by with measures such as removing a lane of parking I. Think that will do it and then we can, you know refer, then the very offer that will be referring to that in the resolve clause is that also too fast Michael or waiting on Michelle could I just suggest that you add to such, as you know, a lane of traffic, whatever it was, you said, and other and other opportunities for increase pedestrian space. Definitely I didn't want to be prescriptive kind of saying. We want you to look at what we haven't thought of. Do you want to read it back to us sure? Where are some streets that will not meet agency criteria for approval to be closed, maybe I should say to be closed as designate streets. The rest of the committee agree with that right. Yes, we shouldn't because we're putting that statement I think we need to put Avenue beyond that on the bullet point list, whereas some streets that will not need agency criteria for approval to be closed as designated safe streets are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing. These streets could be adapted with measures such as we're moving a lane of parking and other opportunities for increased Destrehan space. What am I from Houston to what 14th Street and let's add before the colon that leads to this list, temporary close to vehicle traffic or otherwise adapted to permit adequate social, distancing on the adjacent sidewalks or otherwise adapted? Do we need to have a more of a resolve to say that we really want do TX I'm a little confused now for the beginning of the presentation two hours ago? As do t proposal, or is this from the council- people any case that there be that it be expanded to include other? You know street calming measures like fiction cons or to be discussed at one point or you know, or the things we're talking about now about increasing basically extending the sidewalk space that we want them to. Consider great thing: don't worry, we got something for that. Haven't you be seem to be the principal Street that was talked about. A few other suggestions. I know is Troy's suggestion of foresight, Street between Houston and Delancey yeah I mean were there others, because, although B was mentioned, the most be always organizes the most and I. Let's not have C by largest yeah I have a few other suggestions. I know, Broome was brought up between orchard and Ludlow. Is that one that already been done or not? Because don't forget we're not looking at the pilot program? That's already been instituted, that's not part of the pilot program right now. No, the bid had concerns about that I believe I, don't know exactly what they were. Maybe we could ask I think the biddin wants broom between Orchard, then Tim. Here yeah, we don't have a concern about broom. We were just highlighting it because a local merchant had suggested it so I think the room Street between orchard and Ludlow would be good. Okay, I need to adopt the broom between orchards and Chinatown's, known for its extremely narrow streets and sidewalks, and as someone who walks the neighborhood every day, I can't even social, just missing now so I'm pretty sure, with more people coming out for walks daily walks, and that really would be it's impossible now. Do you have a suggestion? Or do you want us to say some of the streets in this tour? Trying to tell there are some concerns that I have in terms of you, know, closing streets and losing you know in terms of human versus cars I. You know go with humans, but it is an economic Enclave and it does rely on deliveries because it's so small business focused right. So when you have so many small businesses that require deliveries, it's becomes a really crazed enforcement issue with already clawed traffic caught human traffic car traffic. You know and now social distancing right. So there are a couple of streets that I would like, but I don't really know because I'm, not an expert in terms of traffic right in terms of those specific streets, I haven't stirred outside done a survey, for example. So I, don't I, don't think I'm. Sorry to cut you off I, don't think we're any experts, I would just say just throw them out there and see what happens, because eventually, this all has to get that at some point. Right and they'll reject some streets. They'll take it on some streets. I might as well say, take the shot so be part of beds already closed because of 70 Mulberry, hey so half of mulberries. Already, like the chinatown side, mulberry is already half on half of bears already gone, so entire street role of Bayer all the way through Pell doors because they are so narrow, but that's an entire network right within your Chinatown that you're so connected to each other I'm. Just throwing that out there hey Wellington Chang of the Chinatown bid, has an opinion on that Mabini yeah. So this is the first I saw the list, so we've been conferring with G ot. We have some merchant requests for some streets, such as Noah and then do you hear some ideas, but apparently they're now under list I do not know why. Maybe it's the next round or other reasons, because no one put them on the list. No, but do T is aware of the back and forth discussion and we have filed in the community. I see okay. Well, as Ellen said correctly, this thing is this thing is important, for the simple reason that is, they are, you know, is for safe. Distancing is for safety number one. As you know, I learned this absolutely righteous. Look at Chinatown ice cream factory. If you had to put a six-foot distance between the customers, you barely have two people in there and the other gentleman's observation is correct, with or without say, Street you're gonna have altercations, because right now they had to spill onto the sidewalk and they're side by side to one another, one III when I scream one property once one restaurant and under the restaurant. So even if you want to wait in line on the sidewalk number one, the sidewalk is two feet wide or three feet wide and then, if you want to do the six feet apart, I don't even know which line to weigh in and I. So I think that's number one. There are three major purposes to this: a safe Street one is obviously number one you need. You need a proper spacing in order to prevent further recurrence of the another round of infections. Number two you're going to get into fights, as you have already seen across the country, people feel there's a certain sphere space. Like this week, I was in Chinatown Bank I tried to get into the ATM machine, and the lady says six feet away from me and six feet away means I'm outside the door I'm not inside a lobby, so you can have altercations. You're gonna have like that security guard getting shot at or get killed. So it's a necessity, and the first thing is obviously what has been observed in by many of the topics come and today about the need for space. It was the restaurant game, even if they reopen at 50% capacity. They're, not gonna, survive and they're gonna need to space outside, and you can see it's not just in u.s. in Calgary Canada. They already started implementing what is called alfresco just check out the newspaper from yesterday a lot of countries. A lot of cities are starting to do these into outdoor alfresco type of dining experiences. Even if you want to do takeout, that's the way to do it. So there are many reasons so obviously, at the end of the day, also increased their survival rate. Because yeah okay appreciate your comments. I wish you'd raised your hand during the public session to offer a lot of a lot of those good comments, but we gotta get back on to the resolution. Okay, Ellen I'm, gonna, backtrack to you and then I'm gonna, get to you. Lee I see your hand raised as any other Street. You want to add in there Ellen right now, but thank you. Wellington I appreciate that I just get back to the resolution, any other streets you wanted to adopt Ellen. Since you know that area better than pretty much everybody else on this committee, like Baxter, Marie, montbéliard lawyers pal, because they make the network right and it's a good network. I don't want cars. You know deliveries whatever tracks. If you're with that said, there are many businesses within that network and so I, don't know how much it would I don't know what the impact is so I'm, just noting internally closed Columbus Park is always it's super crowded I mean I'm having two down there since this began, but it's a it's a crowded Park. Maybe we could ask for some portion of Chatham square to be marked off and turned it into a pedestrian zone, and that would create I, don't know without furniture or whatever. What would that be like? Well, I live at Chatham Green right, which is at the end of Chatham square, where Park Row ends so is currently experiencing a lot of construction because worth Street the renovation that they've been doing for the past decade. It's moved down to that end of Chinese Square, so you have a lot of car traffic and construction currently and then you add the people on top of that. So it's already a very busy intersection and in my years of experience crossing those streets, it can be rather dangerous, so I'm slightly hesitant about that and yeah, so that that's what I will say about that and I just offer some backgrounds to help you make your decision. One of the things is Ellen said the safest street is Dori Doris. We have had huge successes in the last two years of closing the foot traffic is up so for sure, joyeux Street and by the way the request came from the merchants. Nawa Wilson Tang personally made a request for the street to be closed, so that I can safely attest to that Doyle Street should be safe to be on the list, as the rest of the comment is really up to the merchants weather and the residents whether they want it and I. Think that's up to you to put it on the map to see whether they want Ellen's comment is about correct about there's a lot of death. So there's a lot of funerals hearses they go up, Mulberry Street, that's the only street they can go up on so Mulberry Street needs to have passage of the funeral possessions on a daily basis. Okay, thank you! Yes, ISM and with that's exactly what I was going to say that block next to the park, where you have all the funeral homes I, don't think that should be closed. I think that's really too important for all the funeral house there. So my taking Mulberry off the list in its entirety- it's just going in and Wellington would know better, but I don't think. Does it have to all be taken off or is it just a block or two I guess? Actually you would need they need to leave yeah, so I would say yeah now mulberries too important for the funeral homes. Yeah I just say that Lee go ahead. Hums, sorry about that in Chinatown, I would recommend closing Henry between Kathryn and Oliver streets. It's one block and vehicles are able to get around that if they need to, and if you look at all the tenements that are right around that there's a significant amount of population there that certainly need space Henry between Catherine Street and Oliver Street Lee. Do you have any other streets you want to see adopted in here? I do not okay! Thank you. Can I can I just clarify which streets that, because I'm taking the minutes, so are we saying from the conversation by ARDS Street between Mulberry Street and Bowery, Pell Street between Mott Street and Valerie's, Doyers Street, between Pell Street and Bowery, Mott Street, between Canal Street and worth Street, Henry Street between Catherine, Street and Oliver Street seems right. Ellen. Do you want to agree with the better? It's so for Oliver Street, it's really one Street, so I mean I, don't know, doesn't make sense. Even just you know have Oliver Street open, but it doesn't have much foot traffic and probably because it's really just one Street there's school, it's right next to ps1, except our ghost, is a detour around some of the work. A lot of the work streets, Apple and I have some more straight suggestions. All right, Michelle go I, have I know you have a fee sure, so I would actually for Broome Street suggest doing broom between Forsyth and Alan. In addition to between Allen and Essex, it's relatively quiet there already, and there are many businesses there. I would also suggest doing the same thing on Hester's and between Forsyth and Allen and Allen and Essex I would suggest Division Street between Canal Street and Bowery. There are many restaurants there and not much car traffic, and it already has sort of yes trian terminus closer to Canal. Street I would extend what's going on in both I'm keeping the minute. So don't worry about it unless you want to have it on the screen. I would suggest eldridge between Delancey and grand and Eldridge, between grand and Canal Ludlow, between Valencian grand and Ludlow, between grand and Canal Orchard, between Delancey and grand and Orchard, between grand and Canal, so essentially extending what's happening above Delancey Street below Delancey Street. So the streets are similar there and the sidewalks are very narrow and there are many businesses and restaurants there. That will benefit from expanded foot traffic. Okay, that's I! Guess when does the committee disagree with adopting everything? Michelle said I think eventually, all of these are gonna get vetted, and these are community recommendations so whether they get put in or not is from the city at this point, so we might as well take advantage of this time to throw in every street we could possibly think of where take out any street. We can possibly think of I. Don't have a problem with a these necessarily I. Are we focusing well I? Guess we all should be focusing on I, don't know how to say this: some of these streets. There are serious problems already that we're trying to rectify and those are like the I guess. The priority ones and a lot of these other ones are good ideas that I don't really know. You know what the situation is on those streets like you're, Michelle or Darrell and I. Just don't know, I mean I can imagine West Marilyn, because I know trying to town pretty well. In any case, are these all priorities for us? I guess is a question. I would ask and again I'm not advocating against any of those suggestions as long as their priorities for the community and it's my fault and everybody's had a lot of say here tonight and from the Committees of the public and I think that's what makes it a priority if they believe that this street should be closed for social distancing issues, yeah, absolutely, let's give it a shot I. You know, Wayne Gretzky said you miss 100% of the shots. You don't take right, so we might as well take a shot at it's a prime if it's a priority for the community for a see me for the members of cb3, it's a priority for us and we and if it gets whittled down and gets whittled out. That's my, but that's my there in the situation where we need the space, all right, Thank, You, Susan from the committee, any other any other streets. We want to think of putting on or taking off, I'm gonna move to adapt to take off East, 12th and Zolt. There's not a lot of foot traffic right there between Jacob Riis and Haven Plaza, but there's a lot of car use because of con Edison and the power plant they've slowly encroached all of our land up here. So there's lots of trucks, lots of construction going on around PS 34. It just doesn't make sense to have east well fans ole, that's a closed Street, because so many people we got to make that left to come around anyway. To get back out. It's I understand it's kind of like this throwaway Street a little bit, but it's really important specially. If you're coming around from 13 and all the con Edison people are using it and whatnot and it just gets busy I. Don't it's not a lot of foot traffic from social distancing standpoint, the sidewalks are pretty wide on 12th beat Wiens old and D, mainly because I can see it from outside my window, I move to strike that off the list. Does anybody disagree with me or okay? Thank you. This is the first time we're taking a crack at this is gonna, be more discussions, more ways of doing things, not everything's got to get resolved tonight. You know this is just the first step in the process. That's gonna be ongoing for a while and who knows how this metamorphosizes over the next few months and what this really does for us, but it gives us I, think our priorities have changed now, as a transportation committee I think this kind of shifts of itself up to the top a little bit before to what we were discussing before now we're going after different things, just because of what this pandemic is done so from the committee. Is there any other streets we want to put in, and we just say: okay, we look at adopting this resolution and voting on. Is there any other language we want to put in Jim I see it? You raised your hand. I will take your I think this may be something to do this flag and consider for the future, especially we could have come back to this, but I just want to note. There were at least three or four instances where people brought up the need for better signage and two instances: better signage for drivers and a better notification for residents. That fair sheet will be closed. You might want to just flag that and save it for a future resolution, but I just want to note that was a concern. It's not addressing the base, maybe save it for future consideration. Thank you, Jim! No, definitely the signage is definitely I. Think what I took out of so far was a lot of the public is saying with signage and enforcement was the outside of what streets needed to be chosen. I think signage and enforcement seems to be the top two after this, so I think those will eventually become have some resolutions towards them and based on what's going on. Thank you Jeff. So are we ready to surrender Susie Susan? You got Florida B. What are you doing? I'll sort of to support recommending designated streets, the D-O-T for inclusion in the safe streets program, whereas in response to cope in nineteen social distancing requirements, the city is proposing temporary, safe street designations. That would close certain public streets to behavior traffic and open them up to pedestrians and cyclists, and whereas on designated safe streets, no through regular traffic will be permitted during effective hours. Typically 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and vehicles will be limited to local deliveries, pickups drop-offs, necessary city service vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles. Only these drivers are advised to be extremely cautious and to drive five miles per hour or slower, and whereas this is meant to address the public health need for more space and social distancing that a typical City sidewalk can accommodate and to create additional open spaces for New York City residents were safe and appropriate social distancing can be observed, and whereas this need is expected to be even greater in the coming summer months, as residents will not have access to New York City public school pools, beaches or summer camps and they're all likely strain on CD three parts unless additional open spaces are made available, whereas some streets that will not meet agency or criteria for approval to be just to be closed as designated safe streets are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing. These streets could be adapted with measures such as removing a lane of parking and other opportunities for increased pedestrian space, therefore be it resolved. Community board 3 recommends the designation of the following streets as safe streets to be temporarily closed to vehicular, traffic or otherwise adapted to permit adequate social distancing on the adjacent sidewalks. Therefore, be it FURTHER RESOLVED, the city should return to community board 3 with any additional proposals for safe Street designations going forward. Let me run through the list of streets, nice Broadway between Essex Rutgers and Clinton; Street adjacent the Seward Park 7th Street between 3rd Avenue and Avenue; A Avenue B between house and Street, and 14th Street, governor's Governor Street between Madison Street and Water Street Stanton Street between Allen Street and Essex Street and Essex Street and Pitt Street, Collins, Street and Essex Street and Essex Street and Pitt Street, Stuyvesant, Street, 1st Street between Bowery and house and Street, where it concludes at Ludlow 5th Street from Bowery to 1st Avenue AWB Avenue D to the roundabout at Avenue C 6th Street from between Avenue a to the East River Park 11th Street between 3rd Avenue and 4th Avenue for cited Street between Delancey Street and Houston Street by yard, Street between Mulberry Street and Bowery Pell Street between Mont Street and Bowery, Doyers Street between pala Street and Bowery, Mott Street between Canal Street and Ward, Street, Henry Street between Catherine Street and Oliver, Street, Broome Street, between Forsyth Street and Allen Street and berm Street between Allen Street and Essex, Street, Custer Street, between Forsyth and Allen and Hester between Allen and Essex division between Canal and Bowery eldridge between zelanski and grand Aldrich, between grand and Canal Ludlow, between Delancey and grands and Ludlow, between grand and canal border, between Delancey and Orchard, between grand and Cabela's pedal ya. Walks more should we add anything in terms of and David help me out here. Should we add anything about outreach by when the streets are chosen by DL T or the powers that be into this resolution and not saying something about outreach to the community to the streets that will be affected. I, don't know, I, don't know that would add to it. I mean yeah I. Typically, if you're asking like what I would have done, you know when that was chair. I would be, if do T's said pretty strongly I'll - we'll take that back. I would just leave you. Unless is something we really wanted to memorialize, because we wanted it done okay, so thanks get late yeah! Thank you, David. That was just the thought, because I saw it in the chat, so Trevor bring it up in the chat and I thought about it too. Is there anything about from the committee we're talking about? Like things like signage enforcement, I, don't really want to ask fortunately I'm not done by signs and enforcement, but more or less about, like I'm gonna steal your line, Trevor about minimum outreach to the community to the community or the streets that are affected. It is there a place for this in the resolution? That's for the committee. Well, certainly, our last be resolved. If we could scroll that up onto the screen, maybe we could say that we we'd also asked do T to help with- maybe not in that one. But above it it's not a bad idea, but the concern be to get input about like additional streets or you know, are you seeing unsafe streets or would it be when there is an actual street proposed that we would want them to be informed? No, once the street has been like okay by the city that they should know like that, Street the people who live there or the businesses, this is the street. That's gonna be close, we're letting you know ahead of time that this is what's about to happen. It's gonna happen on this day: it FURTHER RESOLVED the D-O-T outreach the community to inform them of what streets are being closed and when yeah III would agree with that. Can we adopt that into the resolution? Yeah Susan? Can you repeat that from the show Michelle did you get that yeah I got it so therefore be it further is all that the Department of Transportation conduct outreach the communities before, though, to inform them of what streets will be closed in one, so this would be like as they're approved, so that streets that have been approved for closure, yes or some sort of approval process. Okay, yeah, so they're aware that there's a change, yes are the words clear on that yeah I. Think I think they were. You know, asked their opinion. It's inform them. What's research, all right, I, don't think we want to read through that a tag and even with the new Clause present, can we go straight to vote on this Michelle you? Do it an order again asking everyone? Yes or no for the committee David Crane, yes, Paul Rangel, yes, Michelle, Kupersmith, yes, Lieberman, yes, Fletcher Cruikshank, all ooh. All right. This motion is passed. That was fun party hasn't ended yet so we're gonna move into the second. Before we talk about second resolution, I believe Tim from the bid is here online with us. Tim proposed I believe, went to the office and spoke with Susan about this resolution. Tim. If you're on the line, can you talk about this resolution that you have in front of us sure thanks Paul, so, firstly, I just would thank the committee I think it was a long but robust discussion about open streets just quickly. We are the managing partner for the current street and just to address some I think the concerns about signage and planters and those next steps. Those are all things that we're working on and are under consideration. The program was launched in a very quick fashion, I think in an effort to get more public open space operational as quickly as possible, and so I think with anything that moves this fast, especially during an emergency like we're in we learn as we go, and so a lot of the things that have been mentioned today already in the works. The resolution that we had drafted as an initial scope to begin conversations where the community was really kind of thinking about Phase two, as we look at the public health, emergency and I think is Wellington astutely mention, as businesses begin to open back up, there's a great concern that there will still be significant limits on the occupancy of businesses in the interior space and, as we've seen in other cities, both domestically and internationally. The use of the streets for commercial activity and for commerce and social distance has been something that's been successful, and so in the resolution we seek to expand upon the open space program that is there today and to look at potentially those larger closures being places where we can have people enjoy socially distant commerce and be able to, for example, get something at a restaurant and sit within the roadbed and areas where those open streets are not available, because we can't close every street really strategically thinking about the ability of a merchant to take their method of operation and apply to the city to use the parking spaces adjacent to their storefront, as so that they can have additional outside space for commercial activity. There are a variety of different pieces to that puzzle that relate to the street activity permit office, the Department of Consumer Affairs into the department transportation. But we wanted to try to put a resolution together to begin a conversation, not only with the committee and the community board, but really try to put a marker down to say these are the guidelines and parameters which the city should consider as they make these decisions. There's a high likelihood that this type of activity will be sanctioned in some way and the goal is to really say: here's how we at a local level have collaboratively worked together to put in some guardrails, and so the resolution highlights some of those it suggests in 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. our window for the open streets that involve Commerce and the same activity that would occur in an adjacent parking spaces. Apologies. My assistant, is building something on the floor lyosha and that is I. Think a pretty good summation. Apologies if I may any of it happy to answer any questions or discuss concerns. Sure before I ask the committee a couple questions and I guess this is for both Tim and first Susan I know we had a brief discussion earlier. What is the urgency behind doing this resolution tonight? Oh I think you know the opinion on urgency. Is that I think it's important for the community board to have input here. I think that these decisions related to how these types of programs will work will move rather quickly. You know it is likely, and obviously we don't know that we'll see some type of hopeful phase reopening by mid-june and the window that we have for commercial activity, essentially between mid June and mid September, is limited in the sense that those are the warm weather months. Where we will see, you know likely increases in people being outside businesses trying to engage in a new normal with significantly curtailed operations that they're able to open. So the goal of getting a resolution from the Community Board was to really try to understand what the parameters could be and to be able to have an earnest discussion with the city and with our local partners about you know what guidelines and what kind of framework they might work within, and so the goal of the language and the resolution was simply do kind of codify what has been an acceptable standard to date by the community board for outdoor space and outdoor seating related to sidewalk, cafes and other commercial activity, but expanding that to work within the existing of emergency framework. It's been established by the city for these types of activities, okay, I, would say one small businesses are in a terribly dire condition. We're losing some are not going to reopen every day, so I think anything that could be done. That would help the businesses and I think it would be. You know also I, believe it's something that the residents would appreciate, but you know I think everybody is concerned about losing those businesses. The other thing, I would say is, as the weather is getting warmer we're having more and more unsafe, non-compliant use of businesses in the street and I think what you always want to do is make a way for them to be compliant and safe. I want to open this up to the committee before I have any other questions. So if the committee has questions for Susan and based on this resolution, please go ahead. What outreach, if any, was done to the local resident organizations? You know whether it's Lower, East, Side dwellers or other organizations specifically around, for example, Ludlow orchard, where I assume some of these safe streets or open streets. You know: we've got Health, Square and I'm, trying to imagine now an open street with seating and tables, even though only up until 10:00, but from 8:00 until 10:00. We know what goes on there after I'm really concerned about not hearing about passing this resolution without hearing input from the community right. There look I think it's a legitimate concern. I will just be very blunt to say that I think the city is going to move forward with some substantive changes to the ability of a commercial establishment to operate in the outdoor space, while I understand the standard and more typical concern of the lower Eastside dwellers and other groups related to nightlife I. Don't think that anyone would dispute activity prior to 10:00 p.m. would be problematic in any way. So that's pretty much I also think you're concerned absolutely right on it's things right now. Things are just happening, they're happening overnight. They just you know, I, don't know what to say. Like I said I know, I got an email, you know it's just about an article I think it was like cranes or something saying this is being talked about. So you know, I have no idea. I'm not involved. I, didn't know about any of this to like a week ago. So I have no idea of what the city's timeline is. You know, I have no idea if you discussed it again next month, whether that would be in time or whether that would be too late. I have no idea. You're, absolutely right: people should have input. Yeah, look I think on the timing piece again. Things are moving fast, there's a small window here and when we talk about the potential for commercial activity to resume in some fashion again, we have to consider the fact that there could be a small window and a likely placement of some type of additional restriction or contraction of those restrictions. When the flu season starts and we potentially have an uptick in cases so I think the goal here is to try to create a framework and to advocate for an appropriate framework that considers all the stakeholders, residents, merchants and property owners and to get a plan in place that is temporary in nature. This is by no means a permanent solution. Really. The proposal here is focused on the warm weather months between you know, June and September I understand, Paul I feel very uncomfortable, not discussing this framework we're creating this framework without the other stakeholders in about Thank You Lea, it tends to be in agreement with you. A little I get an opinion from any of the other committee members, crickets or anyway. Any of the committee members can chime in I also sit on SLA, so I hear we hear from the committee a lot and I am pretty confident that they would be, and the black associations neighborhood associations all over would want to have their voices heard in this process and I understand that there's a time sensitivity to it, but I think there's also a history of sort of opening a can of worms that you know like Pandora's Box. You can't put the monster back in once. It's out so I mean you know: I, don't want that Sasser bait and the ready sensitive situation right. Oh I want to be more educated about this and as Chinatown, where you know you, if you hear noise from outside your window, it can come from a number blocks away. It's just because we're so custard right so and I live in building word. We have a lot of green space right and it's just the area that we're in and it's just how noise bounces around so I as a resident I am particularly sensitive to that, and I would like to hear more from other stakeholders and I feel that this it's a bit rushed so I would prefer to be more educated about the situation before rushing this through, but also the resolution itself. It's very to me, it's very unclear. It's very unspecific, so I'm not quite sure what it's really trying to say at the end of the day. Besides, yes, we need to support small businesses, all right just to clarify Paul cause I. Think it's an important point like I understand the hesitation right and I, just I gotta say for the record right. What we're talking about here is saying very clearly and I. Think we've tried to define it in the resolution right is that an establishment can use the parking spaces adjacent to their business to operate while there is restrictions placed on their inside operation and doing so in the warm weather months and I. The concept of supporting the business community in a global pandemic, where there is I, just undescribable suffering by the small merchant community, whether you're a shop owner or a restaurant, and the notion that we would not be in support of that honestly baffles me and you know, is something that I think that we should, you know, definitely continue to discuss, but clearly it might be something that is in the realm of the Economic Development Committee I, just I do think it's transportation related, and so that's why we wanted to come to you folks to be like listen, we're asking for your support and exploring how this can work and pushing the city to put parameters on something, as opposed to just saying it's going to happen anyway, and you all having a conversation like we did with open streets where they had rolled something out so I think that was the impetus in trying to have that on this month's agenda, as June will be here very soon. Thank you. Tim in the show I know you have. You want to say something. Yes, so I understand the concerns about this being somewhat rushed. I know we didn't have a lot of time to view it, but I tend to think that this is a sort of an unprecedented time. I think everyone would agree with that, and it pains me that our local merchants cannot operate in a way that they can even potentially stay afloat for a little while and I. You know, I had some reservations, but I spent some time talking to people in my neighborhood who are business owners just walking around with my dog, and you know, I think Wellington also express this that you know businesses are willing to make some essential sacrifices when it comes to like deliveries or that kind of thing in order to have the physical space in order to operate their businesses. Even if it's at heart capacity. You know that was one of my main concerns was about deliveries for these restaurants and bars and whatnot, but that does not seem to be a concern, because I think that there is a just sort of like a you know, a willingness to trade off right now and especially since it is going to become harder and harder for folks to stay inside I, don't have any outdoor space. Personally in my building clothes all the outdoor space, the only time I go outside is to walk around and I have nowhere to go really so. I can only imagine that there are many other people feeling that way. So it's not just for the businesses, it's also for the residents that lack any sort of outdoor exposure and that will just get harder and harder and the reality is they won't stay inside and they'll get more crowded. So you know, for example, Tampa is allowing this type of thing. I don't want to be less created unless forward-thinking than Tampa so unprecedented time. You know: I have not seen a plan from the city about how we're gonna make our lives better, but this I think is one tiny building block towards that. So I you know I would urge people to think about it. In that context, all right, Thank, You, Michelle, David I, know yet yeah all right, I went back and forth. I changed my mind three times. This is very unlikely, even though I'm a Gemini, so I noticed because it's late I have any dinner yet, but I'm now I think that it's I think it's I think would be fine for us to pass this I support. My do. I. Don't know that this was the right committee to bring it -. Yes, it's Street side parking, but as you launched into it Tim you were saying you know, measures that the community board has been comfortable is supporting in the past. I was like oh wow, we're removing street side cafes into the street, and I was thinking about the ten bars on my block and how I really wouldn't want all that loud, music outdoors, it's terrible when they don't shut their french windows before and I was thinking about these issues, but I don't think that is what is going to happen anywhere. If we pass this right, I really do think that it's allowing a couple parking spaces to be used for tables and it if it keeps the small businesses in place and I agree, we got to do it before June, so I'm for it. Okay, thank you. David Thank, You, Michelle Burke from leader from Ellen. That's two -, two - one more information than two that we can go to tonight: buddy, yes, I'm, the tiebreaker I! Guess you know for thinking about it personally. I just didn't like that. The resolution was thrown at us today right, there's debate whether this is the right committee or not for it, but at the same time this is the unprecedented time we are in and we want to start building blocks somewhere so I'm for going with it. You know, I, guess that full board, it will have its questions and it will be debated, though it'll be debated at full board and, let's start knocking this one out so in the interest of time, since we're gonna move forward with it for tonight. So let's get this motion going. Let's start it through and go ahead resolution supporting expansion of open streets program and suggestions for shooting it safe streets program. So is it the official title safe streets or is it open, Street, Susan? It's open streets, it's open streets, it's okay resolution, supporting expansion of open streets programs, program and suggestions for operating parameters of emergency outdoor space or commercial activity, whereas the koban 19 public health emergency has created a unique set of hardships for residents, merchants and property owners, and whereas community born 3, specifically below East, Houston Street has limited amounts of public space and whereas the need exists to ensure additional in public space that can be used for both recreation and Congress in a responsible and appropriate manner where social distancing can be maintained to ensure public health and well-being can be balanced with the need for resumption of economic activity, and whereas this need will continue in the short and medium terms as steps are taking to gradually resume equity levels depending upon meeting local benchmarks associated with the theives reopening. And whereas there is a high likelihood that during this phase, reopening establishments indoor occupancy will be significantly limited and whereas the open streets program recently launched has provided a palette of how creative use of the roadway can provide opportunities for additional public space, therefore be it resolved. Community born three supports the creative use of targeted portions of roadway to enhance public space through the construction and potential expansion of the open streets program and be it FURTHER. Resolved community board three supports additional program. Elements such as the use of parking spaces directly adjacent to establishments will eliminate a limited occupancy for temporary uses outdoor seating constrained to a similar method of operation. They have four indoor space during a phase reopening, be it the further result. Community we heard three supports an expansion of the current open streets operating area use the extended the current. The current open streets operating area be expanded to include appropriate at commercial activity and longer operating hours between the window of 8 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. daily. Be it further resolved that any such program expansion have appropriately predetermined users, actions that align with an existing establishments normal operation that encouraged the resumption of commercial activity while ensuring limited destruction to residential quality of life that operate no later than midnight daily and file walks or within the roadbed directly adjacent to the establishment and be it FURTHER RESOLVED community board during requests the city and state and their respective agencies of the appropriate jurisdiction. Expeditiously work to enact these programs in the coming weeks protect and support small merchants as they begin modified operations in the near future and be it FURTHER. Resolved community board three request that any application and approval process required to execute an extended program be simplified as to reduce the burden on the already struggling small merchant community and be it FURTHER. Resolved community board three requests: it's active and ongoing consultation and input into program parameters and how different program elements and the open space initiative operates. Open streets initiative, open space. One thing I notice in here is that in the fourth from the bottom, paragraph, residential quality of life that operate no later than midnight, but the other section says p.m. Michael. Can you move that up a little bit to the first picture? Thank you yeah. So, as you see, the first paragraph in the bottom is midnight and then the second paragraph in the bottom, this expands at 8:10 p.m. daily apologize. It might have been a typo I think we should change the midnight to 7:00 p.m. yeah. Yes, okay, so we adopt that change. It's any other changes we want to make. That's that we need to adopt, or is this perfect there was this good, as is David, do things good as a zoo leave Ellen you would one change or adopt all right. That's the only change! Let's move this to evoke David Crane! Yes, all Rangel, yes, Lieberman, no Felicia Cruikshank! This motion passes its resolution passes. Thank you. Thank you, Tim. Alright, that is the last resolution of the night. I think we had enough of a party tonight. I want to say thank you for your time. I know today. Tonight was not easy. The first time we've done it in two months is the first time I've actually really chaired this thing, please, let's I, hope I'm hoping next time. We can do it a much shorter time. Thank you to the public for coming out tonight and offering your opinions and for staying on some of you who stayed on this till 23 participants. So that's pretty cool just know that there's gonna be some other items being brought up in the June agenda and we'd like for you to chime in on those. Can I get a motion to adjourn motion to adjourn Thank, You, Leigh, second I and we're good, thank you and have united one night. Okay, bye-bye.
