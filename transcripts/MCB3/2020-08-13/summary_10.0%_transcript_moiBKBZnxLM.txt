Because I do not know if everybody has to give it a shot: here, okay, so we're fixing to post the draft of the district We tried to reflect in the draft about the needs of the arts and culture.
This moment of crisis, it's even more important that extra funding, support and resources are given to these sectors, with special attention to local organizations that focus on the most impacted population by Covid-19.
The city should create a WPA style program to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as impacted arts and cultural industries.
The city's annual budget has become more constrained, so support for small vulnerable arts organizations is not certain in Cd3 neighborhood, art, venues, libraries, community, gardens and parks provide local, often low- cost access to cultural programming, and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects such as designated arts and cultural spaces.
In new, publicly subsidized developments, the Department of Cultural Affairs, should follow the recommendations of create NYC cultural plan by supporting arts organizations that expand, promote diversity and inclusion in the cultural workforce and to increase language access for communications and cultural programming to reach broader, more inclusive, audiences and programs that support the cultural life of low- income communities.
This would include funding for latinx and people of color residents, artists and cultural workers and cd3, with particular focus on those in Chinatown and Loy. The city should explore incentives for developers to provide the low market rate.
Rentals phase for arts businesses and non- profits and city development should include the low market opportunities for arts, businesses and organizations, as was done for food businesses and Essex crossing financial incentives for property owners to provide lower- cost rental space to arts and cultural organizations would both lessen the number of vacant storefronts that can bite a neighborhood as well as benefit the arts.
The mayor's office of media and entertainment and DCLA should support a neighborhood level, trilingual data and communications platform for the many cultural spaces and projects located in our districts to share information on programs and learning opportunities, DCLA, the mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency, and the New York City.
I think you know maybe not having this entire long list of priorities and figuring out like because the pandemic is such an extraordinary situation and it has disproportionately affected arts and culture.
That work in a district needs statement that number I do not think like, You know year.
I. Think the bigger challenge is that you know DCLA did not reduce the size of their budget, And they're, still sort of committed to giving grants and funding from you, know, council or other places to arts and cultural organizations.
Non- profits rely on City, Council, discretionary funding for their operations and for fy Fy21, which is what I believe, It says that later the council members that represent community district three receives significant budgetary cuts and then some of them are.
You know it will have a severe impact that way that drastic, I mean it just I do not know if it makes sense to include all of those specific pieces of information, because again not all of it goes to arts and culture.
We said many local non- profits rely on City, Council, discretionary funding for their operations and programming in Fy, 2021.
We could probably just take it out because we already said drastic right, but I think you could also take out the arts in front of organizations and put these instead, because it's redundant to have it twice, Right, here , I'm, taking arts out Mike in asking them to reallocate DCLA and other funding to balance this funding reduction to a district.
The funding for arts organizations is through DCLA through the city or through the lower Manhattan cultural council.
It has a lot of small, like lower budget community groups that do a lot of arts and cultural education and service, and those usually are the folks that are impacted by this kind of budget.
It can be also DCLA only collaborate with DOE and create grants for cultural organizations that are giving support services and after school services to you, know, public schools in our district.
My fingers on the wrong keys, should collaborate with d.o.e to create grants and funding streams for cultural organizations that provide support services and after school for the local district schools, cultural organizations that provide right, support, services, no crime or reason just the keys, just go where they want to go.
We want them to create a funding stream for WPA and to preserve the workers, because what we're hearing is the workers are either moving away or changing jobs, and if for the industry, the creative industry to rebound, we need to preserve some of our people.
That, I think, is a very fair concern that these people are not going to even survive, but the reasons they're not going to survive is if we do not do anything about the rent, because it's just you know they are expected to be paying the same amount of renting, but those have been sat down from the city and they have no ways of generating income.
They're sort of the whole committee agrees to them, but there's not even You know you do not not even have a resolution to approve them, but I just feel that if we continue having general comments, we're not going to be able to do the work that we need to do, because the text is not there yet right.
Okay, and so far today we have tati who's, saying that some of the points that we brought into the district needs statement could be drafted into a resolution and removed from the district So. My comment was actually related to the to like a specific point about the district needs that might fit in, and I was thinking about the the cultural plan.
Maybe I do not even know if that merits like a discussion about where the funding would come from for this sort of stuff So we want to start with the first paragraph suggested edit Olympia.
So somebody just said that we should also add that the pandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire in January They, constantly change those deadlines, but I- think they're set to expire sooner than we know that artists will be able to go back to work, and we need to do something about that.
The only fact that what we're trying to say is you want to preserve workforce, because our city agencies have a way of preserving industries, and that means they give grants to the businesses and the organizations, but they do not understand that those do not always arrive to the workforce, So that's why the rhetoric here was you love the creative industry, but you need to fund the people who fuel the creative industry.
Why, New, York City cares about arts and culture, maybe not necessarily why Community board 3 cares about, at least from my perspective, arts and culture, even though it is connected to tourism for sure I think what is important for cd3 is that, even though the industry wants rebounds for three to five years.
However, I think it's that artist and cultural in community district 3 are integral to the creative capital of New York that fuels the city's tourism and economy.
That first paragraph speaks to the points of the specific programs that we'd like the city to fund.
People of color, and I do not even know that it's we, I, think what perhaps it's, that it's arts organizations that both serve and represent.
I. Think maybe the need is that, because of the particularities of venues and non- profit organizations.
I think there is a connection, as Linda pointed out, between understanding that arts and culture is like the most.
Right, besides, like general small Business in New, York, City, and very much so in our community board area, because there are so many cultural organizations, small, theaters, and I think you can certainly say.
We know specifically that there's a program or funding that's needed, but that there should be funding, That's, specifically targeted towards the cultural sector, because it does make up a significant share of the city's economy.
I do not think it's relevant to today's time, right now, with the changes that they have integrated into DCLA and how they're operating the programs now that they require that, in order to receive city funding that you have to have a diverse board.
Cultural is not just DCLA right, So I do not know if I think this ask of this like bullet point of mom could be a little bit.
You may do you know when you start thinking of this need and this budget request.
