That initiatives would like the city to fund for fy 2022 The city should create a WPA style program to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as impacted arts and cultural industries rebound okay down to the next page.
Many non-profit cultural organizations within the CD receive annual funding through the department of cultural affairs as resources redirected to respond to Covid-19 19 The city's annual budget has become more constrained, so support for small vulnerable arts organizations is not certain in cd3 neighborhood, art venues, libraries, community, gardens and parks provide local, often low-cost access to cultural programming and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects such as designated arts and cultural spaces.
This would include funding for latinx and people of color residents, artists and cultural workers and cd3, with particular focus on those in chinatown and loy saida Rentals phase for arts, businesses and non-profits and city development should include the low market opportunities for arts, businesses and organizations, as was done for food businesses and essex crossing financial incentives for property owners to provide lower-cost rental space to arts and cultural organizations would both lessen the number of vacant storefronts that can bite a neighborhood as well as benefit the arts.
The mayor's office of media and entertainment and DCLA should support a neighborhood level, trilingual data and communications platform for the many cultural spaces and projects located in our districts to share information on programs and learning opportunities, DCLA the mayor's office of recovery and resiliency and the new york city.
I. Think the bigger challenge is that you know DCLA didn't reduce the size of their budget and they're still sort of committed to giving grants and funding from you know, council or other places to arts and cultural organizations.
Think state of the art DCLA that they're not going to allow a number of new organ You know like usually every year the cdf opens to new organizations like people who have organization What's in the council, members budget yeah right, because normally the way that most small arts organizations are funded through DCLA is through a 5 000 grant from the discretionary funds that goes through DCLA Basically, the amount of money that's been awarded to the council person is not going to go very far in regards to funding small arts organizations, because that a discretionary fund also funds other non-profits It funds, everything so that will have a huge impact on many of the liberal arts organizations in this neighborhood If you cut it out that it's going to reflect what the actual reality of the situation is, I think we could say something like local non-profits rely on city council, discretionary funding for their operations and for fy fy21, which is what I believe It says that later the council members that represent community district three receives significant budgetary cuts, and then some of them are I.
I think you could say instead of unconscionable that the funding reduction to a district has been You know, it will have a severe impact that way that drastic Just I don't know if it makes sense to include all of those specific pieces of information, because again not all of it goes to arts and culture, and then tariq had a comment in the chat.
What olympia was trying to say is that, even though DCLA has still a budget and like a huge budget and is still committed to funding arts organizations, it's the fact that city council in our district had their budgets cut the mechanism through which that money comes, which does come through DCLA I.
That would be more accessible to artists, but I think I think there is a simpler way, caroline, basically, because the funding stream, you know the DCLA-- may administer funds that come from the city budget that the mayor as an administration distribute, Basically, what I think we could do is by just asking DCLA to make sure that there is additional administration funding the funding stream that they will use The question is the city will prioritize certain needs, and so, as arts and culture committee, what we can say is this sector is worth of being prioritized because it had the huge impact because it serves the people who have been most impacted, etc It just tell them that they need to re-establish the funding seam and you are okay, The whole point of this letter, I think, is to make the appeal is to bring awareness and to make the appeal not to second-guess whether they will or won't do it.
Think cb3 is both district 1 and district 2 for schools, because our community board and our school district don't go inside, So I would say local schools- and you know I mean like after school programs right.
They're sort of the whole committee agrees to them, but there's not even you know you don't not even have a resolution to approve them, but I just feel that if we continue having general comments, we're not going to be able to do the work that we need to do, because the text is not there yet right and we asked for suggestions from people and comments from the committee about what they think needed to be included or deleted Okay, and so far today we have tati who's, saying that some of the points that we brought into the district needs statement could be drafted into a resolution and removed from the district So. Perhaps if that would be a starting point to do that would trim down the district needs statement, anisha My comment was actually related to the to like a specific point about the district needs that might fit in The the cultural plan.
So we want to start with the first paragraph suggested edit olympia I, think they're awesome, the first product yeah, the first paragraph is just general and Maybe people should speak up when they have something that we need to change So the economic studies that I am you know being distributed for the music sector for sure the impact is three to five years and some money are not going to be coming.
So, but fundamentally, the only fact that what we're trying to say is you want to preserve workforce, because our city agencies have a way of preserving industries, and that means they give grants to the businesses and the organizations, but they don't understand that those don't always arrive to the workforce, and so that's why the rhetoric here was you love the creative industry, but you need to fund the people who fuel the creative industry, but if you think it's too worthy or obscure, we can just edit it I think it seems like it's a random sentence about how new york city is a creative capital based on tourism and not a connection between that workers work in the creative industries, and we need to support them.
Why new york city cares about arts and culture, maybe not necessarily why community board 3 cares about, at least from my perspective, arts and culture, even though it is connected to tourism for sure I think what is important for cd3 is that, even though the industry wants rebounds for three to five years That feel, however, artists and cultural workers, We can say, take out the word at the creative capital of new york.
However I think it's that artist and cultural in community district 3 are integral to the creative capital of new york that fuels the city's tourism and economy.
I have this need in my community Here's the money I'm looking for you to give it to me Do we want to take this particular segment out that the specific programs initiatives would like the city to fund for fy22 and turn that into a resolution?
We can describe it as our district needs to retain arts and cultural workforce, but I don't know if any of these other things really are more needs than budget requests, because I didn't read through them: I'm, not trying to dictate I'm, not on your committee right Maybe what we can spell out is in that sentence where we're talking about the fact that they lost their income and they cannot meet the rent, etc.
It is the hardest hit sector right, besides, like general small business in new york city and very much so in our community board area, because there are so many cultural organizations, small theaters and I think you can certainly say that we know specifically that there's a program or funding that's needed, but that there should be funding.
I, don't think it's relevant to today's time, right now, with the changes that they have integrated into DCLA and how they're operating the programs now that they require that in order to receive city funding that you have to have a diverse board, you can't receive and they've put things in place so that it's impacted on the arts organizations that receive funding from them that they have to follow the create NYC plan going once going twice.
You know, you're letting microsoft dictate your life and just change that to reducing The need is that they establish that funding How they're going to do it or we can ask it at the budgetary request resolution this one I mean just we'll put it in with the budget request: right.
