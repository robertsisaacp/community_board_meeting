This moment of crisis, it's even more important that extra funding, support and resources are given to these sectors, with special attention to local organizations that focus on the most impacted population by Covid-19.
The city should create a WPA style program to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as impacted arts and cultural industries.
The city's annual budget has become more constrained, so support for small vulnerable arts organizations is not certain in cd3 neighborhood, art, venues, libraries, community, gardens and parks provide local.
The department of cultural affairs should follow the recommendations of create NYC cultural plan by supporting arts organizations that expand, promote diversity and inclusion in the cultural workforce and to increase language access for communications and cultural programming to reach broader, more inclusive, audiences and programs that support the cultural life of low-income communities.
The, mayor's office of media and entertainment and DCLA should support a neighborhood level, trilingual data and communications platform for the many cultural spaces and projects located in our districts to share information on programs and learning, opportunities, DCLA, the mayor's office of recovery and resiliency, and the new york city.
I think you know maybe not having this entire long list of priorities and figuring out like because the pandemic is such an extraordinary situation and it has disproportionately affected arts and culture.
I think the bigger challenge is that you know DCLA didn't reduce the size of their budget, And they're, still sort of committed to giving grants and funding from you, know, council or other places to arts and cultural organizations.
What's in the council, members budget, Yeah right, because normally the way that most small arts organizations are funded through DCLA is through a 5 000 grant from the discretionary funds that goes through DCLA.
So I, don't know quite how you know if you cut it out that it's going to reflect what the actual reality of the situation is , I think we could say something like local non-profits rely on city council, discretionary funding for their operations and for fy fy21, which is what I believe It says that later the council members that represent community district three receives significant budgetary cuts and then some of them are.
You could take out the numbers, but it's, I think, a 98 budgetary cut that drastically reduces funding for organizations within for arts organizations within the district, I would say right, but it's also.
We said many local non-profits rely on city council, discretionary funding for their operations and programming in fy 2021.
We could probably just take it out because we already said drastic right, but I think you could also take out the arts in front of organizations and put these instead because it's redundant to have it twice, Right, here, I'm, taking arts out Yeah, mike in asking them to reallocate DCLA and other funding to balance this funding reduction to a district.
, so the discretionary funding is actually I distributed from directly from I mean through the city council, so the they are a different budget line than what we would like to use.
It has a lot of small, like lower budget community groups that do a lot of arts and cultural education and service, and those usually are the folks that are impacted by this kind of budget.
That would be more accessible to artists, but I think I think there is a simpler way: caroline, basically, because the funding stream, you know the DCLA- may administer funds that come from the city, budget, that the mayor as an administration distribute, and then there are these additional funds that come from the citizens.
What we can say is this sector is worth of being prioritized because it had the huge impact because it serves the people who have been most impacted, etc, and It just tell them that they need to re-establish the funding seam and you are okay, The whole point of this letter, I think, is to make the appeal is to bring awareness and to make the appeal not to second-guess whether they will or won't do it.
It can be also DCLA only collaborate with DOE and create grants for cultural organizations that are giving support services and after school services to you, know, public schools in our district.
It's sort of including remote learning, That I don't think it's gonna work, but My fingers on the wrong keys should collaborate with d.o.e to create grants and funding streams for cultural organizations that provide support services and after school for the local district schools, cultural organizations that provide right, support, services, no crime or reason just the keys, just go where they want to go.
They're sort of the whole committee agrees to them, but there's not even You know you don't not even have a resolution to approve them, but I just feel that if we continue having general comments, we're not going to be able to do the work that we need to do, because the text is not there yet right.
My comment was actually related to the to like a specific point about the district needs that might fit in, and I was thinking about the the cultural plan.
So somebody just said that we should also add that the pandemic unemployment benefits are set to expire in January They, constantly change those deadlines, but I think they're set to expire sooner than we know that artists will be able to go back to work, and we need to do something about that.
The only fact that what we're trying to say is you want to preserve workforce, because our city agencies have a way of preserving industries, and that means they give grants to the businesses and the organizations, but they don't understand that those don't always arrive to the workforce, So that's why the rhetoric here was: you love the creative industry, but you need to fund the people who fuel the creative industry, but if you think it's too worthy or obscure, we can just edit it.
Why new york city cares about arts and culture, maybe not necessarily why community board 3 cares about, at least from my perspective, arts and culture, even though it is connected to tourism for sure I think what is important for cd3 is that, even though the industry wants rebounds for three to five years.
Think it's that artist and cultural in community district 3 are integral to the creative capital of new york that fuels the city's tourism and economy.
Think the beginning of the next paragraph could be removed, and maybe we just focus on that last bit, which is special attention to local organizations that focus on the most impacted population that are low-income people of color, and I.
I think we don't have to say again that it's a positive impact to the local economy, because we've said that a couple I completely agree: I, don't know necessarily that the point that you're making connects to that last piece of it, then that special attention to local, organizations.
But I, don't know if any of these other things really are more needs than budget requests, because I didn't read through them: I'm, not trying to dictate I'm, not on your committee, right.
I. Think there is a connection as linda pointed out between understanding that arts and culture is like the most.
It is the hardest hit sector, right, besides, like general small business in new york city and very much so in our community board area, because there are so many cultural organizations, small, theaters, and I think you can certainly say.
We know specifically that there's a program or funding that's needed, but that there should be funding, That's, specifically targeted towards the cultural sector, because it does make up a significant share of the city's economy.
I, don't think it's relevant to today's time, right now, with the changes that they have integrated into DCLA and how they're operating the programs now that they require that in order to receive city funding that you have to have a diverse board, you can't receive.
Carolyn I, mean generally is an important request, but I don't know if it's a district need for 2022.
You may do you know when you start thinking of this need and this budget request.
