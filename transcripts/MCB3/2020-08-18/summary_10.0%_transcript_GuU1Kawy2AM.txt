We, do business as 10 degrees, Well, while we're waiting for one more community committee member I'll go ahead and read through the guidelines for anyone who is attending here as a guest or an applicant.
Look at the elements of the business you can reach out to the applicant and speak to the applicant about whatever concerns you might have and then, prior to the committee meeting.
You want to just make a comment about the business, that's fine, but We're not hearing the applicant tonight or discussing whether or not to approve this as we've already determined, would be administratively approved.
You could send that into the off after this meeting or after you've reviewed the questionnaire that the applicant submitted and the stipulations the conditions that it's agreed to about how it's going to operate its business, then you can certainly send something into the office and we'll try to address it, for you send that into the sla website.
To number two number two is: was an agenda item added by the office and something that we have discussed on and off as a committee which is adding to the administrative approvals, the stipulation requiring that the applicant or the licensee operate for a year before applying for an upgrade and as a committee, we've discussed different amounts of time.
You mean you like to see a more comprehensive resolution that includes something along the lines of no sooner than but from at least like a But from this point on, you may apply for a changing class of your liquor, license understanding that your application is going to be evaluated just as any other application would, which would be whether or not it's appropriate for a changing class and whether or not your business has been operating the way that it agreed that it would, when it was administratively approved.
I know that's putting it off another month, but maybe it's probably a good idea to have it formulated into a more comprehensive resolution so that we have a better understanding of what we'd actually be discussing and voting on anybody else.
So this is an application for the sla notice, says: tavern, with minimal food recorded music and notes the existing outdoor space pursuant to the executive order, which it doesn't have to because it's pursuant to the executive order on the ground floor of this location, Although, a diagram submitted, shows a standing rail with no seats, a bar with no information- I, don't know if it's the service counter or something separate in the diagram.
I mean, or the photograph that was submitted or photographed, show that the cloud is completely open without any agreement to close at 10 pm, which is one of the stipulations on our questionnaire recorded background, music, no promoted event scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no tvs, no security, no sound proofing, no intention to upgrade no hosting pub crawls or party buzzes happy hours to 8pm.
Also speaking to the cars as well as the dj on the sidewalk, there was a letter submitted by the lower east side dwellers also citing the events, but additionally, noting that this applicant currently is placing its rails and its rails.
The district manager also submitted a statement that, because of the two she said, there were two gatherings, both of which generated complaints, the second resulting in a fight meeting, with the bid with the business improvement district in that area, the community board, the precinct and local elected officials or their representatives to address what was going on with the business and which ultimately resulted in the business agreeing not to be open for the period of one week or consistent with whatever phase we were in and until we moved into the next phase of the executive order.
I know I note that I have not heard personally from anybody that I emailed the community groups that were listed on the cb3 website, inviting them to certainly reach out to me that I put them in touch with my clients if they had any questions or concerns about this.
And I think the record is that hasn't happened since I, don't know what the second event that you mentioned was I'm, very surprised that there are stating that this was not a planned event that they seem to be portraying it as that they're, more victims of the situation that occurred versus the instigators or the orchestrators of the dj of the cars of this of the cars that had decals of the place, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but number two.
I think that was just not filled in correctly on the agenda There were two gatherings of some kind, because the second resulted in the office actually responding to the site, but the event that happened on may 31st ravi had flyers posted to announce the event with the logo and name of the business on the flyers.
So I know it's called a gathering, but it appears to be consistent with an event, given that all these people showed up in the same place at the same time and were summoned there in some way, whether it was just via the flyers that the neighborhood saw, or by some other means, as well and like and was with the idea of having music outside and coordinating off the street.
And I know that they're applying tonight for beer wine or something like that, but I, am really just disgusted at the fact that they had no regard for the community when they allowed this thing to happen, I mean, or.
When susan mentioned it to me when I put in the application, and certainly I've discussed the reality of the situation in this neighborhood with my client that whether it was planned or not, which it wasn't, even if other people want to do something like that- It's, not a place to have a car, show.
We definitely would like to see it, but these were people that were a fan of the place that thought it was a cool idea which I frankly, don't think it was a cool idea for this neighborhood, not in these circumstances, and not certainly going through the proper channels.
I have a concern about even a beer and wine license in this location until 2 a.m and 4 a.m. On the weekends, because there are, with the exception of the governor's executive order for having outdoor seating other than that, there are no tables.
I've already spoken, so, and I agree with him with respect to the hours of operation, the type of business, the location, and you know what they seem to be marketing toward and also what I've read in terms of what they say : they're marketing toward which Is the hip young, energetic community that exists in the area, I wasn't in the street Secondly.
The other point, is, I agree with clint that having beer and wine and having to stand at one small table, how many people could be there and, if you're, having the fries and drinking somebody on the sidewalk and,?
Is that the applicant's not going to assign any stipulations that we construct, although maybe that, maybe that person or people will and then we'll go to the sla And we'll end up having to send somebody to the sla, and I have no doubt that the community will submit material to the sla.
I live on the upper east side of new york, city She said we got to bring this to the states, because there were lines in front of all these street stores and we were trying different french fries And, so I rolled it off, I said, make me a business.
I. Don't know if a single second event that ever happened, we've been we've been operating, the business is doing nicely.
This business has been open since may of 2020 and that in the three months of operation that there have been two events or gatherings- The applicant's attorney denied the second gathering.
Given that the business has already been disruptive and has had these, what they're characterizing is irresponsible, unsafe, events, the in addition, the lower east side dwellers submit a letter which also speaks to its current operation, unassociated, with the events themselves, in terms of how it's utilizing residential garbage cans for the rails, that are that are actually part of the places that you eat the fries and they submitted.
We can include that the applicant, the attorney for the applicant, the applicant, were given an opportunity to speak and stated that they didn't plan this event, that it happened without their planning and that when and that when- Not knowing what the second gathering it is.
It's already existing issues with respect to the vehicle, congestion, pedestrian congestion, noise from people, noise from horn honking, because cars can't get down the streets which are blocked and that you know This was evident in the event that was held on behalf of the business and how it exacerbated all of these conditions.
We have great concerns about the approval of a license of any type for this business, because we have concerns about the ability of the applicant to follow or permit requirements.
We understand that the threshold for the approval of such a license is low and consequently would therefore approve this application with certain stipulations governing the method of operation of the business, and we can go through what they are, but I'll propose them.
I would propose no outdoor state, no commercial outdoor space recorded background music online, the facade closing at 10, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for overseeing heads in life outside alex.
Proposed hours are 11 a.m to 12 a.m; sunday through thursday 11 a.m, to 2 a.m, friday and saturday kitchen open all hours serving this The applicant wrote the swedish street food but then also wrote primarily burgers accordion doors and windows.
There was a statement as part of the questionnaire with a plan to address waitline staff, had an agreement to have staff responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the applicant listed 19 ops within 500 feet, but submitted an sla report that listed 20, and there are 20 per my count as well as four pending ops within 500 feet.
Each east 136th street in the Bronx since 2011, with an op license issued september 21st of 2018 submitted a applicant submitted a letter of public interest which in some said it would be one of two breweries in Manhattan, which would provide patrons unique access and perspective to the beer.
The word used by the applicant with activations also were used by the explicit through two new releases per month, which is something that currently exists as its business that it operates now and then also said.
The comment: I was gonna, make is I work in the Bronx I'm familiar with a lot of the neighborhoods in the Bronx, I'm familiar with morrisania, and the port morris section of the Bronx, and I can see just in looking at your location and looking at it, It's on the sla website on the lamp map or looking at it on a street view that it's in a warehouse , it's not surrounded by a residential area.
So the location sort of lends itself to what you do now, whereas what you want to do here is bring that business, even if it's in a smaller format to what is essentially a 1900 residential like mixed-use, residential building in an area that is packed with people, whether they're people who actually live here or people who come here.
I, don't know when you did your search, but we we're hearing all the time about businesses that we're losing and just to add another license to the to the neighborhood Is generally, something that my organization opposes and It just seems that there's a lot of disconnects between what you want to do and the space that you want to do it in There are other locations that sell beer and craft beer, none of which are actually producing beer on site, and I think, more than anything.
The prior experience of the applicant operating the location that is in the Bronx, the address of the location and when it was issued of an op license at that location, identifying the location, that's on 2nd avenue as a previously unlicensed location and also identifying it as a mixed-use residential commercial building built in 1900.
That, furthermore, I didn't- have it before that- laura that a representative of the east village community coalition, which represents tenants and businesses in the community, spoke in opposition to this application or to the issuance of a full-on premises like license for an application to operate a small pilot brewery and to the the reasons stated by the applicant during its hearing, which is that it want to be out.
I guess what I'm hearing is that the community board would be in favor of a wine insider licensed at this location with the brewery, or do I need to submit a secondary application for those purposes, or is that able to be part of the resolution?
That's an op license for an application for 10 degrees, which is an existing business.
No wait lines and staff outside the apple chain count 18 02's within 500 feet, and this application consists of one principal who has worked in the business since 2006.
When we heard the applicant in July of 2006, they stated that all of the violations were for were from the partner who had previously operated the business and not for that person.
I. Just want to note that I myself have actually seen a live, performer, usually sitting on a stool, usually right at the front of the building with of the business, which I noticed, because the facade is completely open.
The account for the applicant and the count for us with respect to number of licenses in the area and that the existing principal has operated this business since 2006, Given that the business method of operation will remain the same and retain the one of the existing principles of the present business, we would approve with, or we would deny, unless the applicant agrees to the following stipulation, which is that this would operate as a tavern cocktail bar with a prep area serving food during all the hours of operation, or rather it's on the stipulation it would be less than a full service kitchen, with hours of operation of 4 a.m, to 4.
Music, no live dj, no djs, with the exception that it may have djs on new year's eve, no alteration without first coming before the community board will not host pub calls or party buses will not have unlimited drink specials, we'll have happy hours to 8 pm Is there an amendment to this motion or a second just to let you know So, he threw past pasta minutes on to me, but he is no longer with us, so don't be for his vote.
A wine beer license in september of 2015 with stipulations, operate a full-service balkan restaurant serving food within one hour of closing having hours of operation of 2 p.m, to 12, a.m, all day, not using outdoor space, closing and it.
Closing, his father 10 pm playing recorded background music, not seeking an upgrade not applying for an alteration without first coming before the community board, not hosting club calls or party buses, not having happy hours, not having weight loss and having staff responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside.
That was a mistake on the application, so I don't know if there's an increase in hours and the belly dancing would be one hour from 9 00 p.m, to 10 p.m. I'm, not aware of it that this business is, as you said, has been in restaurants, been in business since 2015.
Restaurant we've been in business for about five years, now, we're just looking to upgrade to the actual full liquor.
It should be on the application, but we do not serve alcohol on the outdoor area, meaning beer and wine.
I think we can include two paragraphs that say that there's a an issue with respect to its proximity to a house of worship that being saint mark's church, the bowery that the applicant has stated and submitted a proximity report indicating that this house of worship is 310 feet from this location and that the community board understands that in the past the fla found that this is not exclusively a house of worship.
The community recognizes that it is primarily a long-standing house of worship with contingency which is continually held services during its years of operations and asked that this, the proximity and this used to be evaluated by the fla and considering this application.
Here it would be a full-service mediterranean restaurant which, with the kitchen, open and serving food during all hours of operation.
I noticed that this will be a restaurant with a full menu recorded background, music, no outdoor space on the ground floor and basement the there have been a number of licensed businesses at this location, but the last one doing business with violet was approved, nop licensed by us in december of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full-service pizza, restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 12 p.m, to 12 a.m. All day, not using outdoor space.
Closing, the facade at 9 00 pm playing recorded background music, not applying for alteration without coming before us, not having happy hours, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials with food, reviewing the exhaust and just pursuant to complaints, reviewing the exhaust system and making repairs to address complaints of residents, not having weight lines and having staff responsible for overseeing people on their website.
We have one restaurant owner looking in my window, this window here, Yes, and actually looking at me and making menacing faces to me, because walter can I walter, because I know I want to give you your opportunity to speak, but I think I could refine at least parts of this so ravi, much like with your businesses on 7th street.
You know, Like a complaint form submitted to the office, saying I made a 311 complaint because it's my understanding that the 509 space is still being used.
I, don't have a huge issue, maybe normally we would ask for to bump it back a bit to 12 in one, but given that we do know how he's operated as other businesses, I would probably be okay with well the side street businesses like the 7th street business is closed.
But it's going to be that the facade the windows close at 9 00 pm every night, that there's that there's a recorded background, music, no promotion that scheduled performances or events with covers no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for ensuring no noise or people outside or overseeing noise, and patrons about that There, an amendment or a second When.
