But I can, if you want to just go ahead and give me one second, to open the chat box and state your name I'm, the owner of new statford restaurant We do business as 10 degrees Well, while we're waiting for one more community committee member I'll go ahead and read through the guidelines for anyone who is attending here as a guest or an applicant.
I would like to know when usually for administrative approvals, but the process is, and it's outlined on our website is that somebody has the opportunity to look at what is listed as an administrative approval, not heard of committee Look at the sla notice and the questionnaire that was submitted by the applicant, which is on the website.
Look at the elements of the business you can reach out to the applicant and speak to the applicant about whatever concerns you might have and then, prior to the committee meeting, if there's an issue with the business that you want addressed, you ask us the calendar There is a questionnaire that the applicant submitted, that is on the website, that details the elements of the business, the proposed business and also what the stipulations are.
You could send that into the off after this meeting or after you've reviewed the questionnaire that the applicant submitted and the stipulations the conditions that it's agreed to about how it's going to operate its business, then you can certainly send something into the office and we'll try to address it, for you send that into the sla website and they'll get forwarded to me, okay, but make sure, but make sure you submit them to the community board, not just the sla website.
If you are joining, please sign in the chat box list, if you're an applicant, if you're here supporting an applicant if you're a member of the public, with any comments for or against, and then we're going to build into the agenda items that clint reviewed when he went through the agenda, Do I have a motion and the second for the approval of previous months minutes or any amendments.
Just the way it is you mean you like to see a more comprehensive resolution that includes something along the lines of no sooner than but from at least like a and I'm, not even saying that it would necessarily be a year, but from this point on, you may apply for a changing class of your liquor license understanding that your application is going to be evaluated, just as any other application would, which would be whether or not it's appropriate for a changing class and whether or not your business has been operating the way that it agreed that it would, when it was administratively approved and I , think it is a good idea, because often we're having people coming in with administrative approvals.
You should write all that in so this is an application for the sla notice, says: tavern, with minimal food recorded music and notes the existing outdoor space pursuant to the executive order, which it doesn't have to because it's pursuant to the executive order on the ground floor of this location, Although a diagram submitted, shows a standing rail with no seats, a bar with no information- I, don't know if it's the service counter or something separate in the diagram.
Through saturday, it says kitchen open all hours and The diagram shows that the facade is completely open, I mean or the photograph that was submitted or photographed show that the cloud is completely open without any agreement to close at 10 pm, which is one of the stipulations on our questionnaire recorded background music, no promoted event scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no tvs, no security, no sound proofing, no intention to upgrade no hosting pub crawls or party buzzes happy hours to 8pm.
The district manager also submitted a statement that, because of the two she said, there were two gatherings, both of which generated complaints, the second resulting in a fight meeting, with the bid with the business improvement district in that area, the community board, the precinct and local elected officials or their representatives to address what was going on with the business and which ultimately resulted in the business agreeing not to be open for the period of one week or consistent with whatever phase we were in and until we moved into the next phase of the executive order.
This is primarily this is summaries, a summary of the information you submitted, as well as the letters that were submitted to the office you're on mu I, wanted to just address a couple of things that you mentioned in the application in terms of the terms of what we submitted, it's technically a bar, but really that's the food counter where people order their french fries and that's where they would I believe it's a letter of no objection.
I know I note that I have not heard personally from anybody that I emailed the community groups that were listed on the cb3 website, inviting them to certainly reach out to me that I put them in touch with my clients if they had any questions or concerns about this I know that there was not an event, but there was a gathering back in may 31st I believe you said this is not a normal or part of the regular course of business of this business, which is to sell french, fries and and hopefully to sell beer and wine in conjunction with the sale of french fries Really.
and I think the record is that hasn't happened since I, don't know what the second event that you mentioned was I'm, very surprised that there are stating that this was not a planned event that they seem to be portraying it as that they're, more victims of the situation that occurred versus the instigators or the orchestrators of the dj of the cars of this of the cars that had decals of the place, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but number two I also want to stress that I do understand the situation that the business is in.
So I know it's called a gathering, but it appears to be consistent with an event, given that all these people showed up in the same place at the same time and were summoned there in some way, whether it was just via the flyers that the neighborhood saw, or by some other means, as well and like and was with the idea of having music outside and coordinating off the street That seems to have been sponsored or promoted by your applicant, and the concern here is not that the business is going to be run every day like that would be its own concern, but that there really can't be any reliance on how the applicant is going to run any kind of business.
A teeny, tiny one that maybe only can hold seven people because he's already had these two events that necessity that resulted in complaints on one case necessitated various city officials showing up to try to mediate it both times the police had to show up I think in order to get to the making of a resolution.
I learned about it when susan mentioned it to me when I put in the application, and certainly I've discussed the reality of the situation in this neighborhood with my client that whether it was planned or not, which it wasn't, even if other people want to do something like that, it's not going to stand unless it unless anything, has to go through all the right channels, and that's not the plan to do at this time.
and I agree with him with respect to the hours of operation, the type of business, the location, and you know what they seem to be marketing toward and also what I've read in terms of what they say: they're marketing toward, which is the hip young, energetic community that exists in the area.
The other point is I agree with clint that having beer and wine and having to stand at one small table, how many people could be there and, if you're, having the fries and drinking somebody on the sidewalk and, of course the sidewalk is a privilege depends on the liquor authority and they have to apply for a sidewalk cafe or some form which may not even be given to them and serving french fries and beer and wine until two three o'clock Not my sense of what I would like based on his business model The fact is that the first his representative could say as much as the point he wasn't there I guess, that's a political point of it.
I, don't know that this would necessarily fall, We've been provided and the videos, or we can make a motion that we are very unhappy with this business and the reasons why already we are unhappy with this business and a motion to approve with very restrictive stipulations, I'm open to either either one My expectation is that the applicant's not going to assign any stipulations that we construct, although maybe that maybe that person or people will and then we'll go to the sla Have no doubt that the community will submit material to the sla also about their concerns about this business, or we can make a motion to deny the motion to deny would have all of the information that we discussed as I said, as well as the documentary evidence.
I just wanted to point out that you had made a had a question as to whether or not this was an application for beer or beer and wine Looking at the application that I emailed you guys- The application that I have that you sent says beer, wine, beer and cider This business has been open since may of 2020 and that in the three months of operation that there have been two events or gatherings, although we can put in that the applicant's attorney denied the second gathering.
What they're characterizing is irresponsible, unsafe events, the in addition, the lower east side dwellers submit a letter which also speaks to its current operation, unassociated with the events themselves, in terms of how it's utilizing residential garbage cans for the rails, that are that are actually part of the places that you eat the fries and they submitted photographic We can include that the applicant, the attorney for the applicant, the applicant, were given an opportunity to speak and stated that they didn't plan this event, that it happened without their planning and that when and that when- Not knowing what the second gathering it is The, and with respect to that event.
That was instructed by the police to have people dispersed and have the dj go away that they, you know, follow the instructions of police and I had included what clint brought up, which is of my own little notes that this location has no tables and chairs that, even in the explanation of the questionnaire submitted, the table's insurance referenced in the questionnaire to the community board, where the tables and transfer currently exist outside pursuant to ceo, executive, I mean executive order, All the time for my own work and that, rather, there is just a small space that can house only a few patrons with a counter and rails that can accommodate the cones that the one item of for service the fries are or french fries are sorry and you can certainly amend what I'm making, because I will write it out in a much more comprehensive in order way that the that the the layout and setup of the business and what it sells is not conducive to We. Understand that it's not conducive to the cell sale or really compatible with the sale of alcohol of any kind, including beer, wine and cider, that the patrons will really have no place to drink the beer one insider other than to stand up while holding their cones.
We, also understand that the apron has no license experience and it has himself spoken at length about his experience or in the fashion industry, and nor does he have any familiarity with this area or it's already existing issues with respect to the vehicle, congestion, pedestrian congestion, noise from people noise from horn honking, because cars can't get down the streets which are blocked and that you know this was evident in the event that was held on behalf of the business and how it exacerbated all of these conditions Consequently, we have great concerns about the approval of a license of any type for this business, because we have concerns about the ability of the applicant to follow or permit requirements We understand that the threshold for the approval of such a license is low and consequently would therefore approve this application with certain stipulations governing the method of operation of the business, and we can go through what they are, but I'll propose them So. What I'm proposing is that the for the first one that the method of operation would be and ellen since you're filling this out under other?
I would propose no outdoor state, no commercial outdoor space recorded background music online, the facade closing at 10 no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for overseeing heads in life outside alex Given, the saturation and the late night foot traffic in this area.
An applicant also submitted a letter from the Bronx overall EDC That's, an economic development committee, saying the business opened in 2010 and has been a destination location and is supportive of the business I notified the business that it's within 200 feet of a church.
You said we have been in business since 2011 The idea behind this was to bring you know a bit of what we've been doing up in the south Bronx down to the east village Local artists, The, word I use as creatives because it kind of span a bunch of different mediums, but that's really what we want to do with the space use beer use.
The venue is a platform for local artists and creatives through collaborations through activations, like you said, so, that's really the intent We will have a small brewing system located in the venue that will be visible to the public, obviously separated as required by the sla and the federal government, but The idea is to encourage interaction between our brewing team and guests that they can learn about what goes into beer, the beer, making process etc so happy to answer any questions you have about what we're looking to do in the space Let me just glance through and make sure there's no one new, but no one had is there anybody from the committee that wants to make any comments or ask any questions.
Even if it's in a smaller format to what is essentially a 1900 residential, like mixed-use residential building in an area that is packed with people, whether they're people who actually live here or people who come here, I get the draw of wanting to have your business here because of the people who come here, but we're not underserved by beer places, including craft beer, places that are locally sourced, so that they're getting the beer from breweries that are coming from Brooklyn, if not Manhattan, and we're inundated with places that call themselves breweries and provide us that service While I appreciate that you want to bring this business to this community I, don't know that this okay and the location's two doors down from a church which is its own issue.
I guess what I'm hearing is that the community board would be in favor of a wine insider licensed at this location with the brewery or do I need to submit a secondary application for those purposes, or is that able to be part of the resolution?
It has a prep area serving small place all hours, It says french doors, but the facade opens completely and has for a long time no tvs recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or covers no traffic or a sidewalk plan.
I just want to note that I myself have actually seen a live performer, usually sitting on a stool, usually right at the front of the building with of the business which I noticed, because the facade is completely open, so I don't know whether or not you want to speak to that at all So I'll go to the making of a resolution, then what the applicant is applying for that this is a new corporation with an existing principle and a new principle.
The applicant history has been before the the community board that the original license As noted on the fla website, was issued, may 5th of 1987 the account for the applicant and the count for us with respect to number of licenses in the area and that the existing principal has operated this business since 2006.
A full-service balkan restaurant serving food within one hour of closing having hours of operation of 2 pm to 12 am all day not using outdoor space closing and it This is closing at sidewalk cafe at 10 pm, employing security, friday and saturdays having it wrote in that it would have, or already has sound proofing on its administrative approval, stipulations Closing, his father 10 pm playing recorded background music, not seeking an upgrade not applying for an alteration without first coming before the community board, not hosting club calls or party buses, not having happy hours, not having weight loss and having staff responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside So. The original application did not include that this would be a hookah bar with belly dancing, The application that was submitted, says the cfo is 46 with 13 tables and 44 seats.
The community recognizes that it is primarily a long-standing house of worship with contingency which is continually held services during its years of operations and asked that this, the proximity and this used to be evaluated by the fla and considering this application So do you want to go to making a resolution that would be to approve it with stipulations or to deny it?
We would approve ogenai unless this applicant agrees to the following stipulations: So here it would be a full-service mediterranean restaurant which, with the kitchen, open and serving food during all hours of operation, the hours of operation would be 4 pm to friday and saturday and ellen is probably gonna have to go on the bottom, but it will operate outdoor speeding within its building line, as consisting of four tables and eight seats with hours of operation of 4 pm to 11 pm It has a the facade of this.
Should we go to the making of resolution, then sure I think we're all kind of on the same page, all right, So, the where the first warehouse would be What the applicant is applying for is stated that it wants to have a vegan mexican restaurant serving tequila mezcal alcohol What.
But it's going to be that the facade the windows close at 9 00 pm every night no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for ensuring no noise or people outside or overseeing noise, and patrons about that Is. There, an amendment or a second When- you gave me last month: yes same email, okay, so the office will send it to your email.
