We, do business as 10 degrees, Well, while we're waiting for one more community committee member I'll go ahead and read through the guidelines for anyone who is attending here as a guest or an applicant.
You want to just make a comment about the business, that's fine, but We're not hearing the applicant tonight or discussing whether or not to approve this as we've already determined, would be administratively approved.
You could send that into the off after this meeting or after you've reviewed the questionnaire that the applicant submitted and the stipulations the conditions that it's agreed to about how it's going to operate its business, then you can certainly send something into the office and we'll try to address it, for you send that into the SLA website.
To number two number two is: was an agenda item added by the office and something that we have discussed on and off as a committee which is adding to the administrative approvals, the stipulation requiring that the applicant or the licensee operate for a year before applying for an upgrade and as a committee, we've discussed different amounts of time.
I would say there was like a handful of them at one time in the space of several months, but otherwise it's been every once in a while that we've heard from somebody who has been operating with less than a year Do any of the committee members want to comment or be heard about.
Just the way it is, you mean you like to see a more comprehensive resolution that includes something along the lines of no sooner than but from at least like a But. From this point, on, you may apply for a changing class of your liquor license understanding that your application is going to be evaluated, just as any other application would, which would be whether or not it's appropriate for a changing class and whether or not your business has been operating.
And I think it is a good idea because often we're having people coming in with administrative approvals coming back after three four six months when they have not been operating long enough for us to even really get a full understanding of, if they're going to be good operators or if they're, going to be problems.
I know that's putting it off another month, but maybe it's probably a good idea to have it formulated into a more comprehensive resolution so that we have a better understanding of what we'd actually be discussing and voting on anybody.
Do you agree that you want just a resolution that is better explained, because we can certainly adjourn this to next month and I can draft a resolution Okay, moving on to item number three belfrees fries, either or which is 132 ludlow street hi, grabby sharma, on behalf of Bell fries, I, have with me here: Or you're, the applicant, so that we could keep an accurate accounting of attendance.
So this is an application for the SLA notice, says tavern with minimal food recorded music and notes the existing outdoor space pursuant to the executive order, which it does not have to because it's pursuant to the executive order on the ground floor of this location, The CEO it says, is 74 with four tables in 15 seats.
I mean, or the photograph that was submitted or photographed, show that the cloud is completely open without any agreement to close at 10 pm, which is one of the stipulations on our questionnaire recorded background, music, no promoted event scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no tvs, no security, no sound proofing, no intention to upgrade no hosting pub crawls or party buzzes happy hours to 8.
The applicant notes, no license experience, but no similar job experience, Two letters from residents of 101 Stand street complaining about a event on May 31st, where the street was closed for what they're characterizing as a race, car block, party.
The district manager also submitted a statement that, because of the two she said, there were two gatherings, both of which generated complaints, the second resulting in a fight meeting, with the bid with the business improvement district in that area, the community board, the precinct and local elected officials or their representatives to address what was going on with the business and which ultimately resulted in the business agreeing not to be open for the period of one week or consistent with whatever phase we were in and until we moved into the next phase of the executive order.
I know I note that I have not heard personally from anybody that I emailed the community groups that were listed on the CB3 website, inviting them to certainly reach out to me that I put them in touch with my clients if they had any questions or concerns about this.
And I think the record is that has not happened since I do not know what the second event that you mentioned.
This event: There were two gatherings of some kind, because the second resulted in the office actually responding to the site, but the event that happened on May 31st Ravi had flyers posted to announce the event with the logo and name of the business on the flyers.
So I know it's called a gathering, but it appears to be consistent with an event, given that all these people showed up in the same place at the same time and were summoned there in some way, whether it was just via the flyers that the neighborhood saw, or by some other means, as well and like and was with the idea of having music outside and coordinating off the street.
Opening, and I know that they're applying tonight for beer wine or something like that, but I am really just disgusted at the fact that they had no regard for the community when they allowed this thing to happen, I mean, or.
I learned about it when Susan mentioned it to me when I put in the application, and certainly I've discussed the reality of the situation in this neighborhood with my client that whether it was planned or not, which it was not even if other people want to do something like that, it's not going to stand unless it unless anything, has to go through all the right channels, and that's not the plan to do at this time.
Off from something in the regarding the first event or complaints from that, As compared to this other car event that you know we're not saying it did not happen, I'm saying what I'm saying And I do not have much more to say other than it's not part of the planned operation of this business, and if there was some over- exuberance by some fans of the business, that's what it was But these were people that were a fan of the place that thought it was a cool idea which I frankly, do not think it was a cool idea for this neighborhood, not in these circumstances, and not certainly going through the proper channels.
I have a concern about even a beer and wine license in this location until 2, A.M and 4 A.M on the weekends, because there are, with the exception of the governor's executive order for having outdoor seating other than that there are no tables.
That's a concern of mine for a beer and wine license for pretty much a stand, up, takeout, business.
You know it's, it can't be, and if five people want to be able to sit on the inside of that premises and have their french fries with a beer, then that's what they can do.
Then, when you can only sell five years at a time, but that's the way it's going to be, but right now, but he's entitled to that he's entitled to have a wine beer, license.
I've already spoken, so, and I agree with him with respect to the hours of operation, the type of business, the location, and you know what they seem to be marketing toward and also what I've read in terms of what they say: they're marketing, toward which Is the hip young, energetic community that exists in the area, Michelle Ellen, Jesse Herman.
The other point, is, I, agree with clint that having beer and wine and having to stand at one small table, how many people could be there and, if you're, having the fries and drinking somebody on the sidewalk and?
So I do not see why we would preemptively give someone who has already proven to be a bad operator, a license, especially right now, maybe at a different time, okay, Jessie or ellen, and then I'm going to make a statement with respect to the process.
Is that the applicant's not going to assign any stipulations that we construct, although maybe that, maybe that person or people, will and then we'll go to the SLA and we'll end up having to send somebody to the SLA, and I have no doubt that the community will submit material to the SLA.
Two years ago, I was traveling through Europe, with my daughter, who's in college, at Cornell, University currently, and when we were traveling through Europe, we saw free stores all over France the Netherlands and then into belgium, and my daughter came to me She said we got to bring this to the states, because there were lines in front of all these street stores and we were trying different french fries And, so I rolled it off, I said, make me a business.
This business has been open since May of 2020 and that in the three months of operation that there have been two events or gatherings, and I think that we can.
Given that the business has already been disruptive and has had these, what they're characterizing is irresponsible, unsafe, events, the in addition, the lower East side dwellers submit a letter which also speaks to its current operation, unassociated, with the events themselves, in terms of how it's utilizing residential garbage cans for the rails, that are that are actually part of the places that you eat the fries and they submitted.
It's already existing issues with respect to the vehicle, congestion, Pedestrian congestion, noise from people, noise from horn honking, because cars can't get down the streets which are blocked and that you know This was evident in the event that was held on behalf of the business and how it exacerbated all of these conditions.
I would propose no outdoor state, no commercial outdoor space recorded background music online, the facade closing at 10, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for overseeing heads in life outside Alex.
The SLA notice, says tavern, with small pilot brewery system on site recorded music and no outdoor space.
The Cfo is 74 with 18 tables 59 seats, a 20 foot bar with 10 stools proposed hours, are 11 A.M to 12 A.M Sunday through Thursday 11 A.M to 2, A.M, Friday and Saturday Kitchen open all hours serving this The applicant wrote the swedish street food, but then also wrote primarily burgers accordion doors and windows.
There was a statement as part of the questionnaire with a plan to address Waitline Staff, had an agreement to have staff responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the applicant listed 19 ops within 500 feet, but submitted an SLA report that listed 20, and there are 20 per my count as well as four pending ops within 500 feet.
Each East 136Th Street in the Bronx since 2011, with an op license issued September 21st of 2018 submitted a applicant submitted a letter of public interest which in some said it would be one of two breweries in Manhattan, which would provide patrons unique access and perspective to the beer.
The word used by the applicant with activations also were used by the explicit through two new releases per month, which is something that currently exists as its business that it operates now and then also said.
The comment: I was going to make, is I work in the Bronx I'm familiar with a lot of the neighborhoods in the Bronx, I'm familiar with Morrisania, and the port Morris section of the Bronx, and I can see just in looking at your location and looking at it, Whether, it's on the SLA website on the lamp map or looking at it on a street view that it's in a warehouse , it's not surrounded by a residential area.
So the location sort of lends itself to what you do now, whereas what you want to do here is bring that business, even if it's in a smaller format to what is essentially a 1900 residential like mixed, use, residential building in an area that is packed with people, whether they're people who actually live here or people who come here.
While I appreciate that you want to bring this business to this community, I do not know that this And the location's two doors down from a church which is its own issue.
I do not know when you did your search, but we we're hearing all the time about businesses that we're losing and just to add another license to the to the neighborhood Is generally, something that my organization opposes and It just seems that there's a lot of disconnects between what you want to do and the space that you want to do it in There are other locations that sell beer and craft beer, none of which are actually producing beer on site, and I think, more than anything.
The prior experience of the applicant operating the location that is in the Bronx, the address of the location and when it was issued of an op license at that location, identifying the location, that's on 2Nd Avenue as a previously unlicensed location, and also identifying it as a mixed- use, residential commercial building built in 1900.
There are four pending licenses per the SLA lamp map, and then I would put in how the location of the existing business, which is what I said in a warehouse in a relatively isolated industrial section of port morris in the Bronx surrounded by no other license, is markedly different from the location is proposing to occupy, which is the 1900 building in a in a densely populated area.
That, furthermore, And, I I'll, add in because we I did not have it before that- laura that a representative of the East Village community coalition, which represents tenants and businesses in the community, spoke in opposition to this application or to the issuance of a full- on premises like license for an application to operate a small pilot brewery and to the the reasons stated by the applicant during its hearing, which is that it want to be out.
I guess what I'm hearing is that the community board would be in favor of a wine insider licensed at this location with the brewery, or do I need to submit a secondary application for those purposes, or is that able to be part of the resolution?
That's an op license for an application for 10 degrees, which is an existing business.
No wait lines and staff outside the apple chain count 18 02's within 500 feet, and this application consists of one principal who has worked in the business since 2006.
When we heard the applicant in July of 2006, they stated that all of the violations were for were from the partner who had previously operated the business and not for that person.
Then the the amended application says it's seeking to have live music for new year's eve only and happy hours to 8, pm.
I. Just want to note that I myself have actually seen a live, performer, usually sitting on a stool, usually right at the front of the building with of the business, which I noticed, because the facade is completely open.
The account for the applicant and the count for us with respect to number of licenses in the area and that the existing principal has operated this business since 2006, Given that the business method of operation will remain the same and retain the one of the existing principles of the present business, we would approve with, or we would deny, unless the applicant agrees to the following stipulation, which is that this would operate as a tavern cocktail bar with a prep area serving food during all the hours of operation, or rather it's on the stipulation it would be less than a full service.
Music, no live dj, no djs, with the exception that it may have Djs on new year's eve, no alteration without first coming before the community board will not host pub calls or party buses will not have unlimited drink specials, we'll have happy hours to 8 pm And we'll have no wait lines and have someone responsible for overseeing crowds in those websites.
So, the SLA notice, says this is a restaurant, with a full menu, a Hookah bar belly dancing on fridays and no outdoor space on the ground.
A wine beer license in September of 2015 with stipulations operate a full- service balkan restaurant serving food within one hour of closing having hours of operation of 2 P.M to 12, A.M, all day, not using outdoor space, closing and it.
Closing, his father 10 pm playing recorded background music, not seeking an upgrade not applying for an alteration without first coming before the community board, not hosting club calls or party buses, not having happy hours, not having weight loss and having staff responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside.
If you look at social media or places where there, where it references the take out service for this business and list just hours of operation and the website.
Restaurant we've been in business for about five years, now, we're just looking to upgrade to the actual full liquor.
It should be on the application, but we do not serve alcohol on the outdoor area, meaning beer and wine.
It seems a little strange to me that the name on the restaurant, like, if I as a person that lives in the neighborhood, I, do not know that it's dine.
As, an exclusive house of worship, so I would, I, would like to suggest I know in the past, there's been a couple other businesses within 200 feet and the SLA has ruled that this is not exclusive.
The community recognizes that it is primarily a long- standing house of worship with contingency which is continually held services during its years of operations and asked that this, the proximity and this used to be evaluated by the Fla and considering this application.
As long as we're adding in the stipulation for the SLA to consider the church in their recommendation or their determination- We approve with stipulations- Then the resolution would be the awareness clause stating what the application is applying for, which is a change in class of its wine beer to a full on premises.
I, noticed that this will be a restaurant with a full menu recorded background, music, no outdoor space on the ground floor and basement the there have been a number of licensed businesses at this location, but the last one doing business with violet was approved, Nop licensed by us in December of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full- service, pizza, restaurant serving food, all hours having hours of 12 P.M to 12 A.M, all day, not using outdoor space.
Closing, the facade at 9:00 pm playing recorded background music, not applying for alteration without coming before us, not having happy hours, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials with food, reviewing the exhaust and just pursuant to complaints, reviewing the exhaust system and making repairs to address complaints of residents, not having weight lines and having staff responsible for overseeing people on their website.
It was sort of hard to say no to and it made, and it was a fully built out beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous open kitchen, and- But, unless I know I'm going to give it a try, so that I can employ 25 people that I would have normally had to fire or not bring back, because they've been out of work.
We have one restaurant owner looking in my window, this window here, Yes, and actually looking at me and making menacing faces to me, because Walter can I walter, because I know I want to give you your opportunity to speak, but I think I could refine at least parts of this so ravi, much like with your businesses on 7th street.
Unless there's a problem, so renewals, we would hear if there was a problem or complaints, but if there were no complaints or requests, then renewals are not normally heard in front of the committee and if you send something to the office, a request for information- So, if there's any, you know understanding that there's a history of complaints or regarding a business- And you ask a question with respect to that.
I think that other app store outstanding thing we might have to just speak about are the proposed hours of operation, and I do not know if any committee members want to talk about them they're longer than what we have had.
Anybody else want to be heard with respect to that, so there's ellen Herman, Michelle Clinton , I do not have a huge issue, maybe normally we would ask for to bump it back a bit to 12 in one, but given that we do know how he's operated as other businesses, I would probably be okay with well the side street businesses like the 7th street business is closed.
But it's going to be that the facade the windows close at 9:00 pm every night That, there's that there's a recorded background, music, no promotion that scheduled performances or events with covers no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for ensuring no noise or people outside or overseeing noise, and patrons about that There, an amendment or a second What email donation, When, you gave me last month, yes same email, okay, So the office will send it to your email.
