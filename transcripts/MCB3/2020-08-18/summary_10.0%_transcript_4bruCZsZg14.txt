We are coming to the coming to the landings community today because, as co-applicants, we want to continue to move forward the application by resubmitting a third draft of the reasonable worst case and, in addition to submitting a third draft, also submitting it alongside a letter that uses the opportunity to respond to some technical concerns raised by dcp.
We are posting a lot of information to the committee members and also to the public If you read dc george james memo, he was basically saying that he used the term devastating to describe dcp's response So melanie sorry, jackie just to clarify, though olympia just I'm, sorry, technical clarification that what you were being asked to approve is on the website.
My bro I want to emphasize that george was engaged by the community board and the memo was written for the community board, so I can kind of explain it a little bit my understanding of george's analysis right, but I'm kind of a third party to this analysis that set so essentially essentially the letter we got back in march march, 16th from dcp in regards to our second draft of the reasonable worst case.
That dcp essentially put it really clearly in writing right and it felt as if they were not responding to our proposal as a technical document, and it was not necessarily coming from their position of responsibility to carry the technical document through the application process, but rather from the perspective of of the city planning commission's like ultimate role in voting, an application, yes or no right, which is supposed to be much further down the line Memo george took a look at this situation and took a look at dcp's rhetoric in the letter and so forth, and gave some background in context to why, in the face of this kind of clear opposition, it may make sense for us to continue to move forward the application right and essentially george describes two options, one which is moving forward.
The application despite potential future opposition from cpc and I, want to emphasize cpc right, like city planning, commission level, not ecb, and then the other option which he calls let's make a deal, would be going back to the application, making major revisions to its content and essentially to its like very nature, So olympia, your mic is open again, I am not opening it.
What's been done in other parts of the city or what dcp's like typical typical rezoning looks like, and you know not only do we stand by the actual rezoning requirements within the proposal, but also believe that commitment to that larger process is really important and george essentially outlines you know moving forward through the technical parts of this process, So the basic sort of political assumptions or, like administrative points of view that are shaping the decisions that the commissioner is making right now are essentially like time limited right, and so, if we continue to move through the technical parts of this process, we will, even if this current commission and this current mayor has strong opposition to the plan.
There's very little we can still change, but we can just keep going, but actually they wrote a letter in march that lays out not what's technically wrong with how we present the reasonable worst case development scenarios, but why they disagree with what we're trying to do.
Let's try one more third draft There's, a couple of changes we'll make clean up a couple of numbers, nothing major, and this long cover letter kind of explaining They belong on the political end after it's been certified, but if they don't review for the technical, we want to know where we're at we Maybe we'll consider another strategy, maybe we'll consider court, maybe something, but we can't just keep coming back and redrafting and redrafting we want to give them a way.
One of the strengths of this application is that there's the community board as one applicant which has been here for this whole process and like kind of been the steward of the working groups and everything- and it's clear to us that there's no, you know, maybe, for the community board understanding that march letter with its harsh language is a final agency.
That'll mean one thing for the community board So somebody, one of the applicants could choose to sue based on knowing that march letter is a final agency determination and it sounds like one right: This application will remain incomplete, but that's not where anybody wants to go right thanks for this long letter We can all draft an environmental assessment statement and submit that and actually get it certified so that the community board can treat this euler publication like every other euler application and actually assess the merits, but then I'm glad to wait.
One of those things is kind of this issue of slow walking projects for political reasons, right and saying that you have to kind of let them go through review as technically complete, and this is just sort of citing a number of different rules right, euler rules which are rules in the city of new york having to do with land use applications as well as the establishment of of the rule we just talked about You could follow the links to read about it in more detail.
And what makes this really simple and makes our advocacy job kind of easy, because all we need to do is point out to dcp- is that in 2016 the city planning commission adopted specific brand new rules about what's supposed to happen before the before there's an eis All. The steps before there's actually an environmental impact statement, that's going to be governed by secret, and that's where we are there are specific regulations they're supposed to follow them, we're reminding them of what they are in the paragraphs that jackie pointed out because they're pretty new, these regulations were not the law before 2013 Is. It lives in this area where there were no regulations, people kind of did what they wanted.
Our neighborhoods, our people are facing diet crisis and we need the community board's help So. We ask the members of community board three to please support the two bridges: rezoning application memo and the cover letter to the department of city planning.
Together with your support and your strong belief that we can significantly strive to make social changes by forging forward and helping one community at a time, Please vote yes tonight to our zoning co-application cover letter Thank you for your service and your community support so I'm going to ask the committee to decide whether we're gonna approve the letter So from the conversation we already had I feel like most of the committee members are in favor of them approving the letter If I have a motion to approve the the cover letter with the minor edit and proposed by lisa Do, you want to read that just to read the edit sorry, I could read it, but oh you did get the urban justice one.
