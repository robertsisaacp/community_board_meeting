Next item is two bridges: resuming co-application, update and request for support for application memo and cover letter to department of city planning.
We can ask them questions as well and following that it will be a perfect session, and then committee member will debate whether we should approve this letter decline or make change to the letters so so melanie and and elise.
I, know atlante's committee members are well familiar with this proposal, but just for the general public and then also as a little recap, because it's been some time since we last presented at land use.
Then this is catherine street on the far end and on the far end over here, I believe is water street and gouverneer We want to remind you all that the specific requirements and overall goals come from the chinatown working group plan and the larger history of community-based planning that led to the development of that plan in particular, which we'll review very briefly in the proposal highlights, but the essential core values, core goals behind this plan include ensuring that future development prioritizes affordable housing, particularly at AMI levels, accessible to the existing community and then also prioritizes development of commercial establishments and community spaces that serve the existing community.
You want to like learn more of the specifics, but I'll quickly go through these, so 50 permanently affordable housing requirement in all new or in large residential development, with amis at the lowest levels, so they're accessible to this community height limit of 350 feet on all new developments, at least 60 percent open space and permeable surfaces on new development sites where feasible, requires schools, affordable food markets or community support abuses for ground floors and 40-foot frontage limits for banks and drugstores.
We want to continue to move forward the application by resubmitting a third draft of the reasonable worst case and, in addition to submitting a third draft, also submitting it alongside a letter that uses the opportunity to respond to some technical concerns raised by dcp, and then you all have a draft of that letter That's specifically what we're asking for the land use committee's vote of approval on, so that alicia can sign it on behalf of the board and then after submission.
So I didn't post that dcp letter for you guys, because I don't want to overwhelm the committee member.
My bro, I want to emphasize that george was engaged by the community board and the memo was written for the community board, so I can kind of explain it a little bit my understanding of george's analysis, right, but I'm kind of a third party to this analysis that set so essentially essentially the letter we got back in March March 16th from dcp.
That dcp essentially put it really clearly in writing right and it felt as if they were not responding to our proposal as a technical document, and it was not necessarily coming from their position of responsibility to carry the technical document through the application process, but rather from the perspective of of the city planning commission's like ultimate role in voting, an application, yes or no right, which is supposed to be much further down.
The application, despite potential future opposition from cpc, and I want to emphasize cpc right, like city planning, commission, level, not ecb, and then the other option which he calls let's make a deal, would be going back to the application, making major revisions to its content and essentially to its like very nature.
I come from a very long history of community planning in the neighborhood involved, the input and the and the input and discussion and priorities of a wide variety of stakeholders and represent a unique planning process when compared to what's been done in other parts of the city or what dcp's like typical, typical rezoning, looks like, and you know not only Do. We stand by the actual rezoning requirements within the proposal, but also believe that commitment to that larger process is really important and george essentially outlines.
There's very little we can still change, but we can just keep going, but actually they wrote a letter in March that lays out not what's technically wrong with how we present the reasonable worst case development scenarios, but why they disagree with what we're trying to do Okay.
They belong on the political end after it's been certified, but if they don't review for the technical, we want to know where we're at we Maybe we'll consider another strategy, maybe we'll consider court, maybe something, but we can't just keep coming back and redrafting and redrafting we want to give them a way to signal to us like When I read that sentence paragraph whatever it is, I.
One of the strengths of this application is that there's the community board as one applicant which has been here for this whole process and like kind of been the steward of the working groups and everything- Next, and it's clear to us that there's no, you know, maybe, for the community board understanding that March letter with its harsh language is a final agency.
So somebody, one of the applicants could choose to sue based on knowing that March letter is a final agency determination and it sounds like one right.
You, know what I mean, so I think lisa the kind of qualification and our technical team is here to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that kind of qualification would not actually making changes to the overall integrity of the letter.
I mean like I'm, not sure this was supposed to be public, so So I just want to response to olympia a little bit about like what to prophesize and whatnot, because we feel like without publishing that then people will not have the context to understand what we are trying to approve tonight.
Oh, my goodness, laguardia and the that case, the developers in the city just filed their appeal, we're working out a briefing schedule and there's a third case that was brought by a different set of community groups.
It would be things having to do with the set of sides of affordable, housing, or you know the regulations around commercial uses right which, like what we're proposing here, is not necessarily in dcp's vision of how you would develop this area and or in any area right, because it has a serious, significant, affordable housing set aside for one beyond my age, but the question is: Can they ask us to change that on that basis, alone?
So I mean I, don't know if there is any value in adding any comment around that in this letter or whether we as community board three wanna resume in a future agenda discussing that, because if we don't change the seeker as a language committee, we will be reading a lot of crap sincerely in the future olympia.
We ask the members of community board three to please support the two bridges, rezoning application memo and the cover letter to the department of city, planning.
Please support the two bridges: rezoning application, a memo and the cover letter to the department of city planning.
So you wanted a motion for this letter because we're going to pass it like a rental We, also disclose, because we represent one of the four applicants that some of our committee members.
