Next item is two bridges resuming co, application, update and request for support for application memo and cover letter to Department of City planning.
So DCP has given us a negative response on our resuming application back in March, and in may we, we CB3 hired consultant George James to prepare strategic memos in a in a reasonable worst case development scenario, memo to help us analyze the situation and also make recommendations.
I, know Atlante's committee members are well familiar with this proposal, but just for the general public and then also as a little recap, because it's been some time since we last presented at land use.
We want to remind you all that the specific requirements and overall goals come from the Chinatown working group plan and the larger history of community- based planning that led to the development of that plan in particular, which we'll review very briefly in the proposal highlights, but the essential core values, core goals behind this plan include ensuring that future development prioritizes affordable housing, particularly at AMI levels, accessible to the existing community and then also prioritizes development of commercial establishments and community spaces that serve the existing community.
So our sort of planning and thinking and timeline in recent months obviously has been seriously impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic right, but so I just want to emphasize that this has been a very long process and we are very far along.
We want to continue to move forward the application by resubmitting a third draft of the reasonable worst case and, in addition to submitting a third draft, also submitting it alongside a letter that uses the opportunity to respond to some technical concerns raised by DCP, and then you all have a draft of that letter That's specifically what we're asking for the land, Use Committee's vote of approval on, so that Alicia can sign it on behalf of the board and then after submission.
In regards to our second draft of the reasonable worst case, development scenario, discussed technical issues and edits to the application, but also gave strong indication that DCP essentially was unlikely to continue to move this application forward in an active way because of because of issues with because of disagreements with the planning rationale behind our proposal.
That DCP essentially put it really clearly in writing right and it felt as if they were not responding to our proposal as a technical document, and it was not necessarily coming from their position of responsibility to carry the technical document through the application process, but rather from the perspective of of the City Planning Commission's, like ultimate role in voting, an application, yes or no right, which is supposed to be much further down.
The application right and essentially George describes two options, one which is moving forward: The application, despite potential future opposition from Cpc, and I, want to emphasize Cpc right, like City Planning, commission, level, not ecb, and then the other option which he calls let's make a deal, would be going back to the application, making major revisions to its content and essentially to its like very nature.
I come from a very long history of community planning in the neighborhood involved, the input and the and the input and discussion and priorities of a wide variety of stakeholders and represent a unique planning process when compared to what's been done in other parts of the city or what Dcp's like typical, typical rezoning, looks like, and you know not only Do. We stand by the actual rezoning requirements within the proposal, but also believe that commitment to that larger process is really important and George essentially outlines you know moving forward through the technical parts of this process.
We can still change, but we can just keep going, but actually they wrote a letter in March that lays out not what's technically wrong with how we present the reasonable worst case development scenarios, but why they disagree with what we're trying to do Okay.
They belong on the political end after it's been certified, but if they do not review for the technical, we want to know where we're at we Maybe we'll consider another strategy, maybe we'll consider court, maybe something, but we can't just keep coming back and redrafting and redrafting we want to give them a way to signal to us No, we're not going to change our position from March or Yes, When I read that sentence paragraph whatever it is, I.
One of the strengths of this application is that there's the community board as one applicant which has been here for this whole process and like kind of been the steward of the working groups and everything- That's, happened in the last seven years, but there's also independent not- for- profit organizations that represent different interests in the neighborhoods and can act independently.
So somebody, one of the applicants could choose to sue based on knowing that March letter is a final agency determination and it sounds like one right: This application will remain incomplete, but that's not where anybody wants to go.
You, know what I mean, so I think Lisa the kind of qualification and our technical team is here to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that kind of qualification would not actually making changes to the overall integrity of the letter.
Oh, my goodness, laguardia and the that case, the developers in the city just filed their appeal, we're working out a briefing schedule and there's a third case that was brought by a different set of community groups.
One of the goals here is to say was that March 16th letter There's a history of the City Planning, Commission and DCP as their as their agency, Right projects that had kind of political or policy recommendations that differ from the department's goals.
One of those things is kind of this issue of slow walking projects for political reasons, right and saying that you have to kind of let them go through review as technically complete, and this is just sort of citing a number of different rules.
It would be things having to do with the set of sides of affordable, housing, or you know the regulations around commercial uses right which, like what we're proposing here, is not necessarily in Dcp's vision of how you would develop this area and or in any area right, because it has a serious, significant, affordable housing set aside for one beyond my age, but the question is: Can they ask us to change that on that basis, alone?
It responds to individual instances where they said at least give us a rationale: here, if you're going to propose something unorthodox in our interpretation of city, planning, My concern is that I guess I want to make sure that paragraph actually is the correct on that eventually.
So I mean I, do not know if there is any value in adding any comment around that in this letter or whether we as community board three Wanna resume in a future agenda discussing that, because if we do not change the seeker as a language committee, we will be reading a lot of crap sincerely in the future olympia.
We ask the members of Community board three to please support the two bridges, rezoning application memo and the cover letter to the Department of City planning.
Please support the two bridges: rezoning application, a memo and the cover letter to the Department of City planning.
So I had a process question, so you wanted a motion for this letter because we're going to pass it like a rental We, also disclose, because we represent one of the four applicants that some of our committee members.
