I remember going to PS 23 when I first landed in Chinatown, and these nonprofits are so critical in our community cpc's Chinatown Senior, Center, Chinatown manpower, project, CMP, HT, Dance, Company, Museum of Chinese in America MOCA, a United East Athletic Association, since the fire on January 23rd that devastated the structure of the building.
My office has been working diligently to assist these nonprofits in retrieval and relocation, and to urge the city to engage in a community process to discuss the future of this site, and today is the first step of the engagement process and I.
You know we were having conversations the elected official and the community board representatives about with the city about how they were going to move.
We know how precious and how important this site is to our community and still is it's literally in the center of our community, and it's like The heart right and at the community space And I think that one of the things that you know our community had prompt gotten promised by the mayor was to make sure that it stayed our community space and that we would be able to have what it was back And I think that the fact of the matter is there's some distrust in our community and folks have gotten their hearts broken before by promises made that were broken and I.
I think it's really important that we have community input and a time for us to really be able to talk about things together and be able to address some of the issues that we have.
You know when people are seeing cranes coming out and like lifting things out and That's really important that folks see for themselves with their eyes like what's going on inside the building, Obviously, what we see is the facade You know, be able to have the community be able to give input and what Brian said is very true, that we need transparency and accessibility and an open dialogue for us in the city.
And I want to say thank you to our local elected officials for the input and leader commitment and making sure you know that anything happening and the future of 70 Mulberry Street is being transparent and is real community input.
I just want to thank everyone for having this meeting tonight and now, looking forward to working with the community and all the little fishes.
In, the last few weeks, I have been hearing a lot of community members are asking so many questions about this building and there are also some speculations on the street, but I think some of them may not be true, and tonight we are very happy to have a representative from dicas to give us an update on the demolition of the building and also tell us what to expect for this site in the future.
There are five nonprofits located at 70 Mulberry that provide community services to local residents, Chinatown Senior Center, who operates a Senior Center, the United, aesthetic Association, who provides youth services to the community Museum of Chinese in America, who operates a museum Hg Dance Company who operates a dance studio and Chinatown manpower project who provides educational and training services and shortly after the fire we work with them and neighboring community organizations to locate temporary space for them to continue their service.
Mochou was able to expand its use at its primary location, on 215 Center, Street, Chinatown manpower, project, relocated, its operations to a nearby facility, 96, Baxter, Street, and We, provided temporary administrative space and another D cast building 115 Christine.
We would like to be able to have our input so that the rebuilding of the 70-mile Murray will into account the space usage the need for programming into that plan, so that the building is reflective of the program services that we providing to the community.
Weather is going to be expansion to include additional space added organizations, but this is importance for this building to stay in the community It's important for us five tenants to come back and continue our surface Clean Quintin did mention where we are right.
But we will have to continue with this until 70 mobile street I would like to ask Nancy from MOCA to say thank you to the members of the Manhattan Community Board, three Land Use Committee, Jackie, Wong.
So I'm, hoping that when we have these conversations when we rebuilt the building that all these things are kept in place and kept in mind and just not change it into a monstrosity within the neighborhood, but keeping it in place and keeping it in Sen said open to the community and open specifically, as well as all the members who have been in occupy the building before we hope and we look forward.
Five of them is asking to create more new space with current zoning and also, and also want to see the current tenants to be able to move back to the future building and also once the future building to be remained for exclusively for nonprofit use and also.
I can tell you from my lifetime experience in construction that were I to start tomorrow morning on this between design environmental engineering impairments, the fastest that we could do this in the private sector would be for a new building like four years and the public sector, where I used to work and build things for the city and for the state you're.
Mitchell addressed many of those reasons: architectural innovation, the first New York City public school, designed by CBJ Snyder, the first, the home of the Chinatown history project, which became oka and then the central community.
Therefore, 40% of the cost of rehab would be taken as a so How could house more community space, And I think it is really essential to say this needs to stay a community center and given the overwhelming significance of this building any proposal, any proposal for the future of this site needs to consider preservation and even land marking, as an option.
You would like to bring that down bring the basement a little lower, so you could actually we hit the when you come in, on the first floor between being a mulberry that that's great level, And I, think even for the community and people occupying the building , you may want to it, be to restore it, I mean yes, you can, if you need to stabilize the building, I, have done that before the facade, but you would take it only down to the brown break.
Another conversation, right, I, agree with the Olympia Everyone I'm here, today, just to shift on my support for time, town's, iconic, 70, Mulberry, Street, community space and all of the tenants displaced by the fire.
The city has to have the will and the imagination to create something special on this corner in the heart of Chinatown that will serve as a beacon for our community and cemani Mulberry Street Must remain a space only for nonprofits keeping in line with the current zoning regulations.
Should also take into consideration the needs of the former tenants and ensure that they can return to affordable customized spaces that suit their needs, and operations on this structure should also make accommodations for other nonprofit and community-based organizations that serve Chinatown and I.
What does a city plan on doing to involve the community Think the community visioning process is the is the first opportunity and a continued engagement with both the local residents and the community to decipher and determine what's gonna happen at 70 mulberry we're committed to continuing to provide the community with up-to-date information on what's going on at the building.
That plan was signed by 42 community groups, from Chinatown in 2014 and since then by another 18 books, folks at the Chinatown and Lower East Side community organizations, including community board 3 as a resident of community district 3, who worked for many years in Chinatown and as a published historian of Chinatown and in particular of its architecture that consider 70, Mulberry Street, not only to be the most beautiful building and in Chinatown, but also I, find it a unique design in all of New York, specifically for it's in our well tower.
I just want to say that I think that moving forward the next time that Dee cast comes to us or to any part of our community, that they should come prepared with information about how they are going to engage.
The entire lot should remain for public facility and institution in perpetuity, so yeah, I know heard from a lot of speakers, but I really wasn't always able to distinguish the public members from the actual tenants of the building.
Whereas, the 70 Mulberry Street building was constructed in 1893 to house PS 23, the first public school built by CB j Snyder, who went on to oversee the construction of more than 160 schools in NYC, many of which are New York City Landmarks.
After the school closed in 1975, the building became home to five Chinatown nonprofits and cultural institutions, Chinatown Manpower, HT, Chen and dancers, Chinatown Senior Center, operated by the Chinese American Planning Council and United East, Athletics Association, and the archives of the Museum of Chinese in America, all of whom are currently displaced and as the diversity of community uses and services.
And whereas the Department of Buildings and Department of citywide administrative services have determined that there has been extensive fire damage on the top floors, as well as additional water and structural damage to the remaining floors and building shell, and that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full demolition and whereas Chinatown Menezes is an important cultural destination in New, York City.
Yet, 70 Mulberry Street was one of the only spaces in Chinatown that supports and houses nonprofits and cultural institutions that provide cultural, programming, education and training to the community and whereas Chinatown has very little community facility.
Space and the neighborhood lacks accessible spaces for community meetings and whereas in a January, 27th 2020 statement, Mayor, Bill DeBlasio committed to rebuilding at this location and working with current tenant organizations as the process unfolds and whereas.
While demolition has begun at 70, Mulberry Street, the process and timeline for planning a new building and starting new construction is unknown at this time and whereas, in this challenging time for city finances and operations due to kovat, 19 and budget shortfalls, isn't particularly important to make sure that there is a well-conceived plan to ensure these vital resources are returned to Chinatown community to the Chinatown community.
The city should formally commit to redeveloping the 70 Mulberry Street space for community use as soon as possible, and therefore be it.
The city should establish and share with the community a clear and transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of a new 70 Mulberry Street space, which will include regular community outreach and appearances or the community board to receive input and ensure community needs are addressed and the community is represented in the planning process and therefore be it resolved at.
The city should ignore all opportunities for additional community serving uses at this location, all of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity and therefore be it resolved that any redevelopment should include commemoration of this building's importance in the history of our city.
I think that we could parse out a little bit more of the fact that it's not absolutely necessary for a folk to have a full demolition from what we've been discussing and then also the things I mentioned, before, about keeping it in the public trust and ensuring that public facilities and institutions land use remains the same for the whole lot in perpetuity.
Did you want to read it No, if people can, unless you want to I didn't know, I was still on my word version that a city of New York am ownership of the building and that is used to that is used to be continued into perpetuity.
We have said that every step of the process of moving this building forward toward to a redevelopment be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants, residential neighbors elected offices and community pottery, that the participation should be at every sorry, okay.
Also like to say that you know this is a very critical and crucial time in Chinatown, and you know the stakeholders, residents and community organizations really need our support because they are going through a substantial amount of hardship right now, due to covert 19.
Whereas is saying this is the position of D cast, so maybe we can say and that the that D casts has determined without community input that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full commission, and should we add in here , I think we should say that it is new state and national registry register Let's put that in the second.
What became apparent in the presentation today is that they made a cost analysis and that was conduced them to decide to demolish I'm, not entirely sure I want to I mean the financial consideration is the only thing because they also talk about like trying to expand the spaces, but you can expand the spaces and protect the building.
It's messed up that you know the city is telling our elected officials that things and have legitimate community input , I, don't read it as we're.
It's really important to mention that again, the demolition began without community input, We. Now we have to finish this in on the first, whereas on this page to know and the timeline for planning a new building and starting new construction as past has not been determined a hand up from Ellen.
The city should establish a shared with the community, a clear, transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of the new, the space, and this one I would suggest we replace with two of the ones I write Maybe, it's the next three, please let me drop them in and then, if they're redundant, take them out so, but we think we should take this part out the formatting book.
Why did land owned by a private actor You know people in the community want that and really are asking for that.
You know my point: Is we're not going to lose an opportunity by not mentioning it now, instead of community facility, we could say in perpetuity for the public good or something for community use, as it said, before, right like trying to try to leave the language a little just big enough.
People said they want to have more space, not a problem, so I said for sure Say that the people everybody said that they're very no transparency and enough engagement, We just say we're held a public hearing on May 14th, community residents and leaders, including concern about ongoing participation in the redevelopment, process, ongoing, meaningful, participation.
Okay, therefore beaver the resolved after guaranteeing community facility space for the existing 70 Mulberry Street, tenants, the city strip explored or opportunities for additional communities serving uses at this location of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity.
And I think the conversation would go on We really wish the dicas will come into a process to engage the community in creating a plan for this site, and so tonight is the first time that-.
