It went from being a form of public school to housing, Some of our important community nonprofit organizations, I remember going to PS 23 when I first landed in Chinatown, and these nonprofits are so critical in our community cpc's Chinatown Senior, Center, Chinatown manpower project, CMP, HT, Dance, Company, Museum of Chinese in America MOCA, a United East Athletic Association, since the fire on January 23rd that devastated the structure of the building My office has been working diligently to assist these nonprofits.
New Margaret has smoked and so eloquently about the significance of this building in this community I obviously do not represent Chinatown nearly as or You know, powerful significance of this building to this community and, of course, the many organizations that were housed there and continue to be critical parts of the community that any decisions that are made are fully vetted and have you know real opportunity for the community to have input, and you know at times and what it matters along the process and that it be you know, transparent process and that your community is respected as the city moves forward.
I think it's really important that we have community input and a time for us to really be able to talk about things together and be able to address some of the issues that we have You know when people are seeing cranes coming out and like lifting things out and That's really important that folks see for themselves with their eyes like what's going on inside the building, because, obviously, what we see is the facade You know be able to have the community be able to give input, and what Brian said is very true: that we need transparency and accessibility and an open dialogue for us in the city.
Thank you so much to all of the elected, and thank you so much to all of the community members that have written, have fought and have expressed their concerns and I want to say, Thank you again to Student Center and the community board three for all of your efforts and being able to put all of this together for us, because this is the first time that we're able to have this conversation due to Coe bid and I Think, that it's really important that we are, you know, still very much a part of this process, even without being able to gather together and be able to discuss it.
Everyone I'm glad that we have in this meeting today is really important and I want to say thank you to our local elected officials, for the input and leader commitment and making sure you know that anything happening and the future of 70 Mulberry Street is being transparent and is real community input, a collaboration in feedback.
The last few weeks, I have been hearing a lot of community members are asking so many questions about this building and there are also some speculations on the street, but I think some of them may not be true, and tonight we are very happy to have a representative from dicas to give us an update on the demolition of the building and also tell us what to expect for this site in the future.
We will go through the status of the building and the current activities that are happening on site after our presentation, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have so to start, I wanted to provide some information on the building so, as we all know, 70 ml Barry as a city-owned building located on the northeast corner of mulberry and Bay yard Street in Chinatown So, as I was saying, was condemned by the city in 1889 for the development of a public school that was PS twenty-three years.
I mean I wanted to say where they currently are now Senior Center patrons were accommodated in nearby senior centers Mochou was able to expand its use at its primary location, on 215 Center, Street, Chinatown manpower project, relocated, its operations to a nearby facility, 96 Baxter, Street and We, provided temporary administrative space and another D cast building 115 Christine In addition over the past couple of months d, Katz and other city agencies have worked directly with the tenants to retrieve as much as possible their salvageable property from the building Now. This included over 95% of mochas culture and historical archives and I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to publicly thank the tenants for their steadfast patience and partnership throughout this process, as well as the all the other city may agencies that may be as possible.
You any more questions from the committee members we can no so Olympia if this is going to be redeveloped with the like in compliance with the current cement, and we don't have to go through Europe, but if we are doing something different or like beyond or changing the zoning, the current zoning, then we will have to go through Europe, but I Don't know if dicas have to have anything to add But in order to understand, because you know in our community there have been various instances of deed restrictions, of the places that were previous schools or other things, this location right now as it is, it would require no Euler, because there are no restrictions If, they do it as with the current the allowable area.
A financial literacy, A big part, is also to teach about education, about literacy, mostly with population English as a second language, and one of the key concerns that we have as tenants of the building is, of course, we assurance from the city that we will be able to go back to the building once the beliefs be developed and, at the current rate that we've been paying As. You know a lot of the nonprofits in the building operating on a very tight budget, and this building, as a community asset, allow us to put a majority of our budget into services rather than paying rent This is a critical factor for considering us back to the building.
We certainly would appreciate the city and the community board to be receptive in like when you start the visioning We would like to be able to have our input so that the rebuilding of the 70-mile Murray will into account the space usage the need for programming into that plan, so that the building is reflective of the program services that we providing to the community Chen dancin to serve thousands of New Yorkers through performances, classes, workshops for visiting school groups outreach the hundreds of community children each week and support for dance artists, local artists and visiting artists.
We struggle to properly recognize a hateful discriminatory unconstitutional nature of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that was executed 138 years ago this month, an act that stated that Chinese are endangering the good order of American life, the story's lives and journeys of Chinese in America during that period of time and the period thereafter is exactly what the Museum of Chinese in America We. Do this work to make sure that others can see American history through a critical perspective, making their own connections with their past on January 23rd, the five-alarm fire devastated us cast, Quentin, Jo or friends, DOB FDNY, NYPD, other city agencies, We, stand by our neighbors HT Chen, CBC, United, East and Chinatown manpower when my mother in fact learned job skills in English in the late 1970s mocha underscores the important role that 70 mulberry plays as a home for children to dance adults, to learn, skills seniors to socialize associations, to gather and most critically, in our mind, histories to pre-recorded for future generations.
Knowing that we are active members of this community, alongside our neighbors at seventy mulberry and other community representatives, mocha is committed to playing a thoughtful role and an honest and truthful one in the visioning process can I have a car from CPC to say a few words Our community I want to take this out, but you need to thank other CUNY councilmember Margaret Rayne Assemblywoman Yulin, all the elected officials, who have been very generous in ongoing supporting CPC in regard and all the other tenants in regards All our feathered tenants for over 30 years, we've been providing senior services for close to three hundred seniors on a daily basis.
I advocate for restoring the historical structural facade, as others have said, in whole or in part, and the significant structural architectural elements of the building the city has to have the will and the imagination to create something special on this corner in the heart of Chinatown that will serve as a beacon for our community and cemani Mulberry Street must remain a space only for nonprofits keeping in line with the current zoning regulations.
So I think the community visioning process is the is the first opportunity and a continued engagement with both the local residents and the community to decipher and determine what's gonna happen at 70 mulberry we're committed to continuing to provide the community with up-to-date information on what's going on at the building.
You want me to read the reso Whereas, the 70 Mulberry Street building was constructed in 1893 to house PS 23, the first public school built by CB j Snyder, who went on to oversee the construction of more than 160 schools in NYC, many of which are New York City Landmarks One of its innovative features, was the basement auditorium the first step in the movement to provide community centers and neighborhood meeting halls within schools.
And whereas Chinatown Menezes is an important cultural destination in New, York City, Yet, 70 Mulberry Street was one of the only spaces in Chinatown that supports and houses nonprofits and cultural institutions that provide cultural programming, education and training to the community and whereas Chinatown has very little community facility.
Space and the neighborhood lacks accessible spaces for community meetings and whereas in a January, 27th 2020 statement, Mayor Bill DeBlasio committed to rebuilding at this location and working with current tenant organizations as the process unfolds and whereas, while demolition has begun at 70, Mulberry Street, the process and timeline for planning a new building and starting new construction is unknown at this time and whereas, in this challenging time for city finances and operations due to kovat, 19 and budget shortfalls, isn't particularly important to make sure that there is a well-conceived plan to ensure these vital resources are returned to Chinatown community to the Chinatown community.
The city should establish and share with the community a clear and transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of a new 70 Mulberry Street space, which will include regular community outreach and appearances or the community board to receive input and ensure community needs are addressed and the community is represented in the planning process and therefore be it resolved at the current tenants will have a right of first refusal for community facility spaces that are at minimum equivalent size to their pre fire units with rents, cap pre-fire rates and therefore be it resolved at for guaranteeing community space for the existing 70 Mulberry Street.
We want you at the housing here, because what we want to open for the community to have a input first We have said that every step of the process of moving this building forward toward to a redevelopment be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants, residential neighbors elected offices and community pottery that the participation should be at every sorry, okay, every phrase of the planning from decision about it about either the renovation wait, I think that the IDA renovation I think there's a typo as a redundant versus the reconstruction to redesign the construction and, finally, the administration and management of the final building that this community engagement process became immediately and that dick has returned to Savitri with a more specific plan describing how this participation will be accomplished in no later than July meeting of the Land Use Committee that the city must do everything possible to expedite the reconstruction of the property with the goal of reoccupying it within three years, I may have missed some What was mentioned and leases and additional points that may have addressed this, but I just want to flag, and this is not an endorsement.
We didn't hear it so much from the public tonight, so you know that's not pressing that issue one way or the other We should add some, whereas about today's hearing and the people who spoke today and highlight clearer what Linda talked about So the fact that there is obviously a disagreement with the assessment of dicas about resolution about the demolition and that this decision is at their discretion They did it because they did all this financial studies is that we could say when I said the hearing the community wanted you to understand, you know and have input on that decision-making Someone in the audience said like: How do you value culture , so mr bridge is really something that is very important and I think we need to clearly state in our Asia I think we can add a certain language that we want a city to be open about test.
A strong community support for preservation of the building, I think what we should do is that we want to move the wrestle first and then we can modify the languages and I mean if the majority of the committee thing pepper, want to be removed You use the information that you have there, because those are important information that they evaluate it.
Also like to say that you know this is a very critical and crucial time in Chinatown, and you know the stakeholders, residents and community organizations really need our support because they are going through a substantial amount of hardship right now, due to covert 19 You know integrity of this community I think it's completely inappropriate that there was absolutely no community input and the city has just decided to demolish the site.
In the resolution somebody used an open, It's messed up that you know the city is telling our elected officials that things and have legitimate community input , I, don't read it as we're Incans and then can we move the next one, and while demolition has begun or even into process and timeline for planning, anything is unknown at this time.
Don't I would like to keep the options open at this point, for either I feel like I want more information about what would be in the public interest and Yeah could open for more community discussion, because there has not been enough community input and I like community use better than community facility, because that does keep the open, also affordable, housing The city should establish a shared with the community, a clear, transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of the new the space, and this one I would suggest we replace with two of the ones I write Maybe, it's the next three, please let me drop them in and then, if they're redundant, take them out so, but we think we should take this part out the formatting book That's that Kalina on third line Can we go to the next beery soft cloth that this community engagement process begin immediately and the deke has returned to see be free with a more specific when describe how this participation would accomplish no later than July?
You know my point: is we're not going to lose an opportunity by not mentioning it now, instead of community facility, we could say in perpetuity for the public good or something for community use, as it said before, right like trying to try to leave the language a little just big enough.
People said they want to have more space, not a problem, so I said for sure say that the people everybody said that they're, very no transparency and enough engagement, We just say: we're held a public hearing on May 14th, community residents and leaders, including concern about ongoing participation in the redevelopment process, ongoing, meaningful participation, Thank you, okay whereas and then therefore be resolved, that the city of do retain ownership of this building for community use in perpetuity and therefore be further resolved that every step of the process of moving this building forward to move moving this building forward toward we development be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants and residential neighbors elected offices in committee.
No, later than June meeting of the Land Use Committee and therefore be further resolved, that the city must do everything possible to expedite the reconstruction of the property, with the goal of reoccupying it within three years and therefore be further resolved, that all of the occupants of the building at a time of the fire, be guaranteed a right of return, a point, a completion of the restoration / reconstruction with at least the same square footage and the cost that is comparable on a square foot basis to the rain to the raised charges at the time of the fire Okay, therefore beaver the resolved after guaranteeing community facility space for the existing 70, Mulberry Street, tenants, the city strip explored or opportunities for additional communities serving uses at this location of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity How. Do you vote yes, Dominic?
Do you vote yes and I think the conversation would go on and we really wish the dicas will come into a process to engage the community in creating a plan for this site, and so tonight is the first time that-.
