I remember going to PS 23 when I first landed in Chinatown, and these nonprofits are so critical in our community Cpc's Chinatown Senior, Center, Chinatown manpower, project, CMP, HT, Dance, Company, Museum of Chinese in America MOCA, a United East Athletic Association, since the fire on January 23rd that devastated the structure of the building.
My office has been working diligently to assist these nonprofits in retrieval and relocation, and to urge the city to engage in a community process to discuss the future of this site, and today is the first step of the engagement process and I.
You know we were having conversations the elected official and the Community board representatives about with the city about how they were going to move.
I think it's really important that we have community input and a time for us to really be able to talk about things together and be able to address some of the issues that we have.
And, you know when people are seeing cranes coming out and like lifting things out and That's really important that folks see for themselves with their eyes like what's going on inside the building, Obviously, what we see is the facade You know, be able to have the community be able to give input and what Brian said is very true, that we need transparency and accessibility and an open dialogue for us in the city.
And I want to say thank you to our local elected officials for the input and leader commitment and making sure you know that anything happening and the future of 70 Mulberry Street is being transparent and is real community input.
I just want to thank everyone for having this meeting tonight and now, looking forward to working with the community and all the little fishes.
In, the last few weeks, I have been hearing a lot of community members are asking so many questions about this building and there are also some speculations on the street, but I think some of them may not be true, and tonight we are very happy to have a representative from Dicas to give us an update on the demolition of the building and also tell us what to expect for this site in the future.
There are five nonprofits located at 70 Mulberry that provide community services to local residents, Chinatown Senior Center, who operates a Senior Center, the United, aesthetic Association, who provides youth services to the community Museum of Chinese in America, who operates a museum Hg Dance Company, who operates a dance studio and Chinatown manpower project who provides educational and training services and shortly after the fire we work with them and neighboring community organizations to locate temporary space for them to continue their service.
In addition, over the past couple of months, D, Katz and other city agencies have worked directly with the tenants to retrieve as much as possible their salvageable property from the building.
This included over 95% of mochas culture and historical archives and I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to publicly thank the tenants for their steadfast patience and partnership throughout this process, as well as the all the other city may agencies that may be as possible.
We are hearing a lot of screaming in the background, so now that touch a little on redevelopment to the miracle minute following the fire that the city will rebuild the side and return the tenants to the building and that commitment, remains.
I'm, going to open up for the land- use committee members to ask questions A one question I think everybody wants to ask is about investigation of the fire According to the FDNY investigation.
This site, its to be I, mean look like I was really just asking a computation based on the square footage of the site, and that me, if they are in the neighborhood I, do not The. Would it take you to make sure you had all the funding in place and that sort of thing before constructions start might happen?
We would like to be able to have our input so that the rebuilding of the 70-mile Murray will into account the space usage the need for programming into that plan, so that the building is reflective of the program services that we providing to the community.
The building was filled with activity seven days a week serving children, families seniors, as well as artists and audiences to local residents, tourists and New Yorkers 70 Mulberry Street was a centerpiece of Chinatown.
We all stand we united to restoring these services to the community, to being able to afford to start all over again and to being stronger together as we oversee leadership and the role of the building to lift up and enlighten new generations of New Yorkers.
Weather is going to be expansion to include additional space added organizations, but this is importance for this building to stay in the community It's important for us five tenants to come back and continue our surface Clean Quintin did mention where we are right.
I would like to ask Nancy from MOCA to say thank you to the members of the Manhattan Community Board, three Land Use Committee Jackie, Wong.
So I'm, hoping that when we have these conversations when we rebuilt the building that all these things are kept in place and kept in mind and just not change it into a monstrosity within the neighborhood, but keeping it in place and keeping it in Sen said open to the community and open specifically, as well as all the members who have been in occupy the building before we hope and we look forward.
I can tell you from my lifetime experience in construction that were I to start tomorrow morning on this between design environmental engineering impairments, the fastest that we could do this in the private sector would be for a new building like four years and the public sector, where I used to work and build things for the city and for the state you're.
Mitchell addressed many of those reasons: architectural innovation, the first New York City public school, designed by CBJ Snyder, the first, the home of the Chinatown history project, which became oka and then the Central community.
How could house more community space, And I think it is really essential to say this needs to stay a community center and given the overwhelming significance of this building any proposal, any proposal for the future of this site needs to consider preservation and even land marking, as an option.
You would like to bring that down bring the basement a little lower, so you could actually we hit the when you come in, on the first floor between being a mulberry that that's great level, And I, think even for the community and people occupying the building , you may want to it, be to restore it, Make.
Should also take into consideration the needs of the former tenants and ensure that they can return to affordable customized spaces that suit their needs, and operations on this structure should also make accommodations for other nonprofit and community- based organizations that serve Chinatown and I.
Think the community visioning process is the is the first opportunity and a continued engagement with both the local residents and the community to decipher and determine what's going to happen at 70 mulberry We're committed to continuing to provide the community with up- to, date.
Did you, as the owner of this building, get this building to be so bad that the wires were crumbling and that there was a fire caused by none of the tenants that this was something that was negligence on the part of the city of New, York and now you're coming to us with no schedule , you know it's going to cause 6 million dollars to tear it down.
If there's any information that comes our way, we're happy to discuss it with you, and both your concerns are valid and We will be transparent and have been transparent, with everything that has transpired, post, sapphire and I can only commit that we will continue to do so, Thank, You, Clinton and I As, the secretary of the Chinatown working group, community planning group created in 2008.
Folks at the Chinatown and Lower East Side community organizations, including Community Board 3, as a resident of community district 3, who worked for many years in Chinatown and as a published historian of Chinatown and in particular of its architecture that consider 70, Mulberry Street, not only to be the most beautiful building and in Chinatown, but also I, find it a unique design in all of New York, specifically for it's in our well tower.
I just want to say that I think that moving forward the next time that Dee cast comes to us or to any part of our community, that they should come prepared with information about how they are going to engage.
The entire lot should remain for public facility and institution in perpetuity, so yeah, I know heard from a lot of speakers, but I really was not always able to distinguish the public members from the actual tenants of the building.
As on January 23rd 2020, a five- alarm, fire destroyed the top three floors of the historic 5 storey, 70 Mulberry Street building and caused significant water and structural damage on the other floors as well, whereas the 70 Mulberry Street building was constructed in 1893 to House PS 23, the first public school built by CB J Snyder, who went on to oversee the construction of more than 160 schools in NYC, many of which are New York City Landmarks.
After the school closed in 1975, the building became home to five Chinatown nonprofits and cultural institutions, Chinatown Manpower, HT, Chen and dancers, Chinatown Senior Center, operated by the Chinese American Planning Council and United East, Athletics Association, and the archives of the Museum of Chinese in America, all of whom are currently displaced and as the diversity of community uses and services.
These organizations provide to Chinatown residents include, but are not limited to programming for seniors, Vocational, Training, Workforce, Development, Small, business, assistance, dance performance and education, archives and artifacts from 40 years of MOCA, curation and collection and youth education and athletics, programming, and whereas the Department of Buildings and Department of citywide administrative services have determined that there has been extensive fire damage on the top floors, as well as additional water and structural damage to the remaining floors and building shell, and that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full demolition and whereas Chinatown Menezes is an important cultural destination in New, York, City.
Yet, 70 Mulberry Street was one of the only spaces in Chinatown that supports and houses nonprofits and cultural institutions that provide cultural, programming, education and training to the community and whereas Chinatown has very little community facility.
Space and the neighborhood lacks accessible spaces for community meetings and whereas in a January, 27th 2020 statement, Mayor, Bill DeBlasio committed to rebuilding at this location and working with current tenant organizations as the process unfolds and whereas.
While demolition has begun at 70, Mulberry Street, the process and timeline for planning a new building and starting new construction is unknown at this time and whereas, in this challenging time for city finances and operations due to Covid-19 and budget shortfalls, is not particularly important to make sure that there is a well- conceived plan to ensure these vital resources are returned to Chinatown community to the Chinatown community.
The city should formally commit to redeveloping the 70 Mulberry Street space for community use as soon as possible, and therefore be it.
The city should establish and share with the community a clear and transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of a new 70 Mulberry Street space, which will include regular community outreach and appearances or the community board to receive input and ensure community needs are addressed and the community is represented in the planning process and therefore be it resolved at.
The city should ignore all opportunities for additional community serving uses at this location, all of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity and therefore be it resolved that any redevelopment should include commemoration of this building's importance in the history of our city.
I. Think that you know we should be clear that it's not just presenting what the city decides, but creating a process outside that residents can be engaged in or stakeholders can be engaged and to give real meaningful.
We, have said that every step of the process of moving this building forward toward to a redevelopment be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants, residential neighbors elected offices and community pottery, that the participation should be at every sorry, okay.
I, think that the IDA renovation I think there's a typo as a redundant versus the reconstruction to redesign the construction, and, finally, the administration and management of the final building that this community engagement process became immediately and that Dick has returned to Savitri, with a more specific plan describing how this participation will be accomplished in no later than July meeting of the Land Use Committee that the city must do everything possible to expedite the reconstruction of the property with the goal of reoccupying it within three years.
So the fact that there is obviously a disagreement with the assessment of Dicas about resolution about the demolition and that this decision is at their discretion right, they did it because they did all this financial studies Is that we could say when I said the hearing the community wanted you to understand, you know and have input on that.
I think we can add a certain language that we want a city to be open about test So if we say suspend the demolition calendar for October 2020, because if they do not suspend that, if CB3 does not ask for that, all the other things that we're asking he they demolish the building, they have no meaning I.
I'd, also like to say that you know this is a very critical and crucial time in Chinatown, and you know the stakeholders, residents and community organizations really need our support because they are going through a substantial amount of hardship right now due to Covid-19.
The historic you know, integrity of this community I think it's completely inappropriate that there was absolutely no community input and the city has just decided to demolish the site.
Whereas is saying this is the position of D cast, so maybe we can say and that the that D casts has determined without community input that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full commission, and should we add in here I think we should say that it is new state and national registry register Let's put that in the second.
What became apparent in the presentation today- is that they made a cost analysis and that was conduced them to decide to demolish I'm, not entirely sure I want to I mean the financial consideration is the only thing because they also talk about like trying to expand the spaces, but you can expand the spaces and protect the building.
It's messed up that you know the city is telling our elected officials that things and have legitimate community input, I.
Do, not read it as we're going to rebuild the whole building, but Incans, and then can we move the next one, and while demolition has begun or even into process and timeline for planning, anything is unknown at this time.
For, the committee I said on transportation and, as we talked about you, know, City, and also into Chinatown many supporting businesses.
Is this that what we want to use, or should we say the city should commit in writing to restoring I think redeveloping this, but I do not.
The city should establish a shared with the community, a clear, transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of the new, the space, and this one I would suggest we replace with two of the ones I write Let me drop them in and then, if they're redundant, take them out so, but we think we should take this part out the formatting book.
We comfortable with this restoration/ construction or I'm after Karen, guaranteeing community facility space for the existing seven in Mauritania The city opportunities for additional commute, serving use at this location, of which it should be guaranteed in perpetuity?
Why did land owned by a private actor You know people in the community want that and really are asking for that.
You know my point: Is we're not going to lose an opportunity by not mentioning it now, instead of community facility, we could say in perpetuity for the public good or something for community use.
The shitty city should work with the community when exploring I think its gathered above We're saying that we want them to have community input.
The city, that the city of New York, retain ownership of this building and that I use, and that is used- be continued in perpetuity for community use at any language.
Whereas and then therefore be resolved, that the city of do retain ownership of this building for community use in perpetuity and therefore be further resolved that every step of the process of moving this building forward to move moving this building forward toward we development be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants and residential neighbors elected offices in committee.
Okay, therefore beaver the resolved after guaranteeing community facility space for the existing 70, Mulberry Street, tenants, the city strip explored or opportunities for additional communities serving uses at this location of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity.
The conversation would go on And. We really wish the dicas will come into a process to engage the community in creating a plan for this site, and so tonight is the first time that-.
