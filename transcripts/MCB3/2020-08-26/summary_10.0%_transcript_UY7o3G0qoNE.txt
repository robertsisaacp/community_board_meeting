Don't have the bandwidth to do it anymore, but just a reminder that if you're going to join if you're going to start the meeting early to like have a conversation with the chair or with the board or the board members or whatever Before you actually start, the business try to pause the recording.
Linda's run it once I'm going to ask clint since he's our third sort of most prolific, zoom person I can, while the meeting's going on, I, will open up the youtube channel and put the link in the chat box If you just search community board three under youtube, you should find it I'm.
Herman district managers report, sure I'll start with the election, since you guys brought it up so just sort of an fyi for all kinds of operational things.
But I do want to run everything by the committee on open government because they're the ones who decide things you know anybody making up like noel or anybody.
Interesting thing is: DHS has not released their hope count from last January, which is supposed to be made public every year, and you know, I've asked for it now, I'm asking elected officials to help me get it, but it's not that it's not the issue.
The residents also contacted the elected officials, so we're we've had one conference call we're trying to figure out some steps that can be taken, and I want to publicly talk about them because they're being investigated and if they don't work out, it'll be a problem, but there it's not very much.
I mean the city has to the city has to have a plan, and you know people think that nobody's listening to them.
People are besides himself are the broom orchard area that came up in the transportation committee, because D.O.T wanted to have a plaza, and I think the residents around there kind of freaked out, because it would mean more people congregating in the area, so they wasn't approved the bid called a meeting.
That kind of thing, so I was asked at first I was asked if the board could support project renault, And I said you know that would take a month because it would have to go on the agenda.
You, know, I give a reference on good neighbor, bad neighbor thing, so I have written a letter for project renewal as district manager.
So also I'd be like to know what may Doing, the context of order of rules that govern the community board's use of procedures.
I took a little while with the fry guy beginning to actually talk because at the end he provided me with useful information to include the resolution, which was really that he doesn't know anything about the area and or have any experience with what he's doing.
Susan had emailed me and said that she and the precinct and the bid and local elected officials or their representatives had to actually show up on site at some point because of problems with respect to the business which that guy denied, knowing anything about that at all.
We support the business And I'd like to know what people think about that If you watch the meeting, then you saw that we did and thought it was better to do the resolution this way, but I think that we were all open to doing it either way.
It wouldn't be support from us, and you know, I would just ask that that you might want to consider whether that's a possibility, considering what I have found out from the police, today.
So, like I, could put in writing to you kind of one, what the police, the reports from the police today, which I think you know the fact that we got them after the meeting in response to his response, makes it pretty rational It's actually something I forgot to talk about in my report.
That I that I distributed to the other committee members in advance of the minute meeting to look at that said that what was going on required a response from the bid from the precinct and also from various elected officials.
Oh, okay, I am may I just want to let you know, like I've, asked my family members.
It's everything that we need in our community, so I think a lot of people really don't understand the importance of filling out the senses.
There's this thing with the transportation and the open streets and the parks, and There was a school in our area who you know they try to apply online through the website and they get a reply that we'll get we'll get back to you in October, which was not what they needed.
Because, as you all know, we have a lot of community members who are not able to work right.
The second thing not really related to the committee meeting Obviously that you know, businesses in the neighborhood are closing.
One request to have a vote, and I need to know how we're going to proceed as a community board, because a lot of these issues are timely.
If it's a specific vote like if you want to put if the issue the issue of making the meeting public, if you know, if that's one of the issues, I, would suggest that we put that on the agenda specifically The thing: is that they're?
