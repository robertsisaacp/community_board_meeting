Either, but I just wanted to go over some zoom stuff, not because the office has taken over a lot of the zoom stuff that I used to do during the day since I do not have the bandwidth to do it anymore, but just a reminder that if you're going to join if you're going to start the meeting early to like have a conversation with the chair or with the board or the board members or whatever Before you actually start, the business.
We have to go into the youtube and try to edit out, like 10 minutes of non- business, to get the meeting to start at the business part of it and remember to use pause and not stop, because if you stop the recording it's going to create multiple files, you can pause.
He, said he was working on some something for CB6 in Manhattan and Queen, the two Cb6S in Manhattan and Queens on some sort of virtual voting, thing: okay, that could be used so he's going to pass it along, and then he has some like best practices that actually all the boards need it, but he could pass that along.
Herman district managers report, sure I'll start with the election, since you guys brought it up so just sort of an fyi for all kinds of operational things.
Anyway, is that we were handed a paper sheet to fill out, and so we need to replace that, and you know, I do not know if they're making a bigger deal or not, but I do want to run everything by the committee on open government because they're the ones who decide things.
Interesting thing is DHS has not released their hope count from last January, which is supposed to be made public every year, and you know, I've asked for it now, I'm, asking elected officials to help me get it, but it's not that it's not the issue.
You have even things like car break, Ins assaults on people, It's brought up at every police meeting.
I mean the city has to the city has to have a plan, and you know people think that nobody's listening to them.
People are besides himself are the broom orchard area that came up in the transportation committee, because D.O.T wanted to have a plaza, and I think the residents around there kind of freaked out, because it would mean more people congregating in the area, so they was not approved.
Actually, all the elected officials and the Community board are working to resolve issues like find public space for the shelter residents and programming, that kind of thing, so I was asked at first I was asked if the board could support project.
You, know, I give a reference on good neighbor, bad neighbor thing, so I have written a letter for project renewal as district manager.
You know how we've had some of the residents several years ago come and testify at our board meetings to support a K2 resolution about K2.
I took a little while with the fry guy beginning to actually talk because at the end he provided me with useful information to include the resolution, which was really that he does not know anything about the area and or have any experience with what he's doing.
We heard it because it wanted to stay open until 2 and 4 A.M, but also because there already been this incident Susan had emailed me and said that she and the precinct and the bid and local elected officials or their representatives had to actually show up on site at some point because of problems with respect to the business which that guy denied, knowing anything about that at all.
We support the business And I'd like to know what people think about that If you watch the meeting, then you saw that we did and thought it was better to do the resolution this way, but I think that we were all open to doing it either way.
It would not be support from us, and you know, I would just ask that that you might want to consider whether that's a possibility, considering what I have found out from the police today.
So, like I, could put in writing to you kind of one, what the police, the reports from the police today, which I think you know It's actually something I forgot to talk about in my report.
Now I understand that I meant the with respect to the email, That I that I distributed to the other committee members in advance of the minute meeting to look at that said that what was going on required a response from the bid from the precinct and also from various elected officials.
Oh okay, I am may I just want to let you know, like I've, asked my family members.
It's everything that we need in our community, so I think a lot of people really do not understand the importance of filling out.
I said that they should also and Susan told me they should loop in the community board because we deal with parks and streets and so many other things.
The second thing not really related to the committee meeting Obviously that you know, businesses in the neighborhood are closing, so I just wanted to give a shout out to Susan for fielding all of those emails, and you know sort of shepherding people to the right set of resources.
And I need to know how we're going to proceed as a community board, because a lot of these issues are timely, but I can save that.
But that was the only resolution with regards to the Cag. It can be one of those every month, things like update from the community, Advisory group sure, and what about the votes?
If it's a specific vote like if you want to put if the issue the issue of making the meeting public, if you know, if that's one of the issues, I, would suggest that we put that on the agenda specifically The thing.
We make it as part of the state that in the beginning, you know, if you want the board to be an active member of this in voting.
