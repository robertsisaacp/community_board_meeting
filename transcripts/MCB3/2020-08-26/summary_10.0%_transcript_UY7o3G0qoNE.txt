Maybe I should mention very briefly that, as follow-up to my responsibilities to monitor the attendance, we reviewed everyone who had received the warning letter several months ago Nobody has to go to the second round of possible elimination and I will try to reach out to those members that I've noticed that I haven't seen them and I know that one of the members are is sitting on paul's committee I appreciate that anything from the treasure to report herman You have nothing to report.
Herman district managers report sure I'll start with the election, since you guys brought it up so just sort of an fyi for all kinds of operational things: The 12 district managers in Manhattan, always like email, each other about how do you do?
But I do want to run everything by the committee on open government because they're the ones who decide things you know anybody making up like noel or anybody.
I've talked previously about many more homeless has not released their hope count from last January, which is supposed to be made public every year, and you know I've asked for it now Often people like to lump call everything homeless, but the real issues people are complaining about are a tremendous amount of crime on the streets , There's lots of people on the streets, they're, not all sleeping there.
People are besides himself are the broom orchard area that came up in the transportation committee, because dot wanted to have a plaza and I think the residents around there kind of freaked out, because it would mean more people congregating in the area, so they wasn't approved.
I was approached by kasir the lobbyist, that represents project renewal, All, the adult shelters in cb3 have been emptied for social distancing, all the city contracted or city shelters and the ones in kenton hall and project renewal have been moved to the upper west side and I'm sure you've all heard about the issues on the upper west side , You're only hearing, there's a lot of people complaining and you're Only hearing about that, as actually all the elected officials and the community board are working to resolve issues like find public space for the shelter residents and programming, so I was asked at first I was asked.
They would ask me so I'm sending it to the president of project renewal so that he can use it as he wants If. You would like me to read the letter to you Are they asking for support from us?
You know how we've had some of the residents several years ago come and testify at our board meetings to support a k2 resolution about k2 We finish the letter issue Do. You want me to read the letter to you?
Is people seem to have a problem on knowing whether they have to you know it's really difficult for people to remember that they don't have to make motions, they don't have to second it, and if you want, we could change the agenda to approval of minutes and roll call and that might make it easier for people Now we're going to move into the committee reports.
I took a little while with the fry guy beginning to actually talk because at the end he provided me with useful information to include the resolution, which was really that he doesn't know anything about the area and or have any experience with what he's doing But you saw that he thought that he was doing something good and provided people comfort, Please.
This incident Susan had emailed me and said that she and the precinct and the bid and local elected officials or their representatives had to actually show up on site at some point because of problems with respect to the business which that guy denied, knowing anything about that at all Had people driving by in the fancy cars had him in a fancy car, and you could see that his logo on all the fancy cars So today after I saw a little bit of that.
So he wasn't actually the cause of the second event and the site meeting My concern I have my concern about this and I'm just concerned about how it might impact our credibility in asking for enforcement If. We support the business and I'd like to know what people think about that.
so, like I, could put in writing to you kind of one, what the police, the reports from the police today, which I think you know the fact that we got them after the meeting in response to his response, makes it pretty rational.
Think or I had actually explained to the community You know the rules and regulations and had been posted at the beginning of the meeting, and people were saying that they were getting shut up.
We, don't necessarily have the highest in the city but the highest below 96th street and then the second thing not really related to the committee meeting and you know, sort of shepherding people to the right set of resources.
One request to have a vote and I need to know how we're going to proceed as a community board, because a lot of these issues are timely.
