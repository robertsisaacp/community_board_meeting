And next item is the dcps application for the citywide zoning test, amendment on zooming for coastal flood resiliency, and there are a couple points.
Think one of the concern we have from last meeting is that we thought that these zoning change would incentivize and encourage a large new development in our area in our district.
And I want to hear Jim's opinion and also Trevor, because I feel like after the Scl is done.
Everyone understands what me this first item, actually Jackie and I, just kind of went back and looked at the transcript from last month and tried to make kind of trying to aggregate what we were hearing from people and put it together in what could be an amendment you know to the existing base.
I mean I think this would probably be something that could be added as like.
I'm, not sure certain that extra height you know, without, like the addition of you, know, significant developable floor area is alone, going to encourage a developer, who you know wasn't going to build in the floodplain to now say: yes, This is financially viable.
I, think that is the kind of key incentive here that it largely only encourages resiliency measures in new construction.
I just want to echo Jackie's point that I feel like they didn't emphasize this enough.
You look on the map that DCP provided last month, there's currently a smaller area of buildings down there in the flood, plain.
Trevor I just wanted to piggyback on your points that I actually had a conversation with Jim on that I use, Nika Baka as an example for the discussion and like I, guess like to encourage them to move the mechanicals to their to the top of their building.
Their basement looks like they can convert that for more commercial use, but then I also think that I mean most of these affordable housing, complex.
I, didn't put this in the points, because that was just a private discussion between me and Jim, but I just feel like, Since you bring this up.
This is a clear incentive and it goes to private development of new construction, and it makes it more palatable to construct in an area that, as a city, We know we'd rather think about it more before attracting new developments there, because it is a flood zone and because new development does impact already vulnerable populations that live, there, and so I clearly see this.
In order for the zoning to not contradict the law, That is the building code right, So the building code has been updated, because this is a flood zone and after Sunday we know what that means the same way.
What we are against is the idea of these very obvious subsidies that are in there, and the second thing is that the building code is currently I, Think Monday mandatory only in the 100 year flood zone and.
So I believe the best way to do it is to make it a mandate, and then, If there is low income construction, you subsidize, but you actually want to make sure all the communities have equal safety from flood and about the ESCR comment.
And, If they're going to do anything in the harbor is a permanent solution, So I feel we need to always build with the understanding that there is a you know, climate change, and if it's not the river, it's going to be extreme rainfall.
Think the point here that says it encourages large development.
You know, I, Don't think that this there are four area exemptions, but they're, not massive and they're, not like bonuses or something.
Differently, because, like Olympia just said it doesn't make sense that this legis or this you know this text amendment will in a way be easier for new construction, which is you know, especially in our district, usually very different than like a.
Michael I want to hear from other committee members I'm just not sure that if I agree with what Olympia said before how this would reduce the cause for the developers to do the resilience, improvement, I, don't think she was saying it would reduce the cost.
So I think we want to maybe be more precise with that language, but I also don't want to dismiss I think what Olympia is saying is absolutely right in terms of how it this policy kind of privileges, certain building, typologies and type development, right.
Don't think this alone will trigger new development at a significant scale, but I do agree that you know a like higher capitalized developer is much more likely to do this than the owner of an existing.
And actually, If anything, based on how limited the actual incentive from the city is financially right, you know, then there's limited subsidy available, Besides this, We talked about that with Stephen earlier meetings, so I think you might want to say something.
For, the first point, and then in the second point, I mean Lisa and I had a background discussion, and we also agreed that we feel, like certain type of housings, that don't have the financial ability to do go through this kind of work, and it is on the second point.
Amendment, just Olympia made a point about the building code, the resiliency building codes that are referenced by the construction standards and the you know the flood elevation and things as being required in the floodplain.
I'm from the past, So I don't know on that too, and Jim. I'm sorry, I have to go back to you on the language of the second point that we are going to work.
I think it wants to talk about existing buildings.
Larger, complex I, don't know what is the right wording because I want to see buildings like Nicaragua, Village and also those session 8 buildings also covered, and maybe traffic can help with that.
Second, While you are working on the first editing, the first point: If you get I mean if you, if someone can you know, move to, amend it or play, you know or insert it somewhere in the resolution, be my guest, I'm still editing the first piece.
We think that zoning is not really the best tool to address this issue, because certain building types are not able to afford that kind of changes in certain compared to larger developers, and we want we propose.
Zoning and you know, zoning is not a tool and what we really need is subsidy and by the way, I'm making that assumption, because I can't completely read the document, because it's too small, Niko.
My problem with this in general is just in terms of a climate resiliency like forward thinking, Don't know the text amendment that DCP could be doing.
I mean I personally, when I was reading, I feel like I, actually wanted to support.
I feel like we don't have a lot of I have heard some people disagree with this point, but then I feel, like most of our committee members, seems to be okay.
I understand the reasoning why DCP I want to limit it, but I also feel like a lot of this issue can be resolved by better planning of infrastructure and also emergency protocol, so, and also like Lisa, brought up a very good point right after last.
I mean at this point that does not the committee member have any thoughts on it.
So to me, it makes sense to stop building new nursing homes in the flood plain, But this text amendment does expand that area and it is, you know, a significant part, I guess of CB3.
I thought 2015 already expired in 2013 still have some time to go, and just to put this in context for point number, one or point number, two Jim. I remember from last meeting that DCP was saying that 2013, the zoning actually allows, is more relaxed than what they are proposing right, now.
I want to put maybe on the second point, that to emphasize that certain type of certain scale of properties owners are not able to do it because of the financial consideration, Even if you give them like higher incentive, I, don't know if it makes sense.
And I think this is going to get you another point that a number of you have brought up that, despite it being quote unquote like more permissive.
Today, they've actually had relatively little participation in the in this like program as it exists, which I think should point you all to your.
If committee members have any other thoughts because I think Jim have you already finished your language for the first point.
Good, sorry, Jackie, Okay, I was just joking, I mean like because that is too small.
There is a bigger question about whether we should be just addressing issues of buildings in the floodplain and not thinking broader, about I, really like this point, but I'm, not sure how other people feel if they're comfortable, adding it in.
I mean I, Ask everybody if everybody has any thoughts about it looks like people are comfortable with it.
You want I, think actually Lisa wrote something better, but.
I think we have all the points right.
I, think that is a space that need to be removed and also for point number.
I feel like point number.
With, the language, no, I'm, okay with the language, because I don't think this implies that you know there's.
Looks like it and those needed subsidies, Herman I, think we lost you, because your computer, just frozen.
Suppose I want to develop a new building.
The subsidy was is intended for the existing buildings, not really for new buildings, but I guess other committee members can that's what I'm asking.
You know that at this point having that discussion is really going to change anything, because we, this is regarding zoning.
I mean I want to open this for discussion right, now, I would like to disapprove in jacket, and if we try to change, it probably have three more hours to go.
