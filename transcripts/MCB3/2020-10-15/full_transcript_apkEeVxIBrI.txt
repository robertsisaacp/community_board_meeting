Okay, so there's a lot of stuff going on in Chinatown right now. All right is there a motion about the minutes. I make a motion. Okay, I second all right all in favor, aye, okay, so all right, what we needed to do was develop a resolution to request city agencies, including DCLA D.O.T, the department of sanitation and parks to increase funding opportunities in the discussion of the current budget for artists and arts organizations, so editing right. Any suggestions from that Olivia crystal suggestions. What kind of suggestions are you talking about? What sort of suggestions are you talking about? We need to pollution, because what we were looking for are ways to expand funding, opportunities for artists and arts organizations through city agencies that are included in the budget. Unfortunately, the Department of Cultural Affairs is not in the budget negotiations, but the Ot Department of sanitation and parks are well of course sparks. It would be very valuable. We, you know our whole summer, this summer were parks and, of course, we could not perform outside. We, I saw in the minutes something about looking for outside performances. I certainly would like to push it in that direction, but at any rate, we made a wonderful outreach to all the parks we would have performed in and we actually received a very tiny but very gratefully accepted donation from one of the parks and- and we were on a number of the park's websites this summer, our performance I mean when our performance was live during the whole summer, every Saturday and Sunday at 2 online, but we certainly had a relationship to the parks and then to NYCHA. That's the next topic, the support. Oh. Okay. Sorry, no, okay! So olympia, your comments on your resume. Yes, so I mean, I think what we had discussed. Is I just copy pasted in the chat, the bullet point that we originally had in the district needs. That said, the city should create WPA style programs to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years. They that they were impo like. I do not know why it's weird, the written impacted, arts and culture industries rebounds as they impacted art and cultural industries rebounds. So I think I mean have you drafted any ratio that you want to review, or do you want us to write erasure from scratch here? On this meeting, I thought we could write it from scratch at this meeting, because I wanted you all to have input into it. Yeah so I mean I think we could. We could expand on this sentence that we originally had in the district needs, and then this in the discussions with the chair of the Economic Development Committee and the Cp3 manager they you know it became apparent that it made more sense for this to be a separate resolution that we have it in the district needs, and I think what is interesting is that now there is a little bit of public. You know traction because there was recently an article with quotes from Senator Jessica Ramos, who is the chair of the Labor Committee, actually asking for a new deal herself. So I think the resolution should be saying that you know because the art and are you going to draft it like a clint? Can we ask you to be our secretary or you're working on something else? Well, I'm drafting it in minutes. Oh you're, dropping it, okay, good yeah. So basically you know clint. If you'd like to have input into this, please feel free to join anybody. Okay, so I think I think that there is a could say that you know, because of the drastic impact that the Archer cultural sector had received, and especially the performing arts sector, that you know it was the first to close and the last one that will reopen. We feel that it is very important that we preserve and support this workforce during the shutdown, and we recommend that the city state prioritize any relief funds that they will have to create. You know temporary employment programs, the ones in the past by you know the new dlwpa and we are open, like we recommend. You know the agencies that you had put in the agenda to look into ways in which you know- and I would add in those agencies DOE, because DOE could definitely benefit from you know. Art features and extra support for the kids right now, as they do remote learning, okay, wherefore the arts and culture sector. Section sector has experienced extensive damage from the paws program with Covid-19. Are you looking for ways for us to allied with other city agencies? Besides, cultural affairs? Is that what you're looking for now? What we're looking for is because the topic that the way that has begun is that, because Carlina's discretionary funds were cut so badly, oh, where are they yeah? She was granted 225,000 and discretionary funds for this year this coming year as compared to 11 million from last year. Oh my god, my opinion last year and all of the council people who voted against the budget were penalized by the speaker. So at any rate, what that means is that the smaller arts organizations that normally receive funding through discretionary funds will be extremely hard hit, because there is a very small pot to go through many different non- profits in this cbd and based on that, what are you looking for? What we were looking for were other ways that funding could be increased for arts organizations yeah. That's what I mean right, you're, looking for other ways, we're looking for other ways that city funding could our stream a funding stream could be created. Artists and arts organizations, both D.O.T and the department of sanitation, have programs in place products Department. I do not know that they included in their budget, but they do have a gallery and they do accept applications for artwork to be. You know, displayed in public parks. Is there any way that they could also include like a stipend or something to help the artist to do that? The other issue has to do with the fact that when artists apply to DOT- and I'm not sure about the department of sanitation, they're required to provide a certificate from an engineer about the safety of their project and stuff, which is basically in order to get a letter like that, it's usually like about at least 500 to 800, so at any rate, we're looking for ways that are to express ways that maybe perhaps these agencies could assist arts organizations, artists, improving the funding stream they represented when they go to the budget hearings. The only thing I can ever think of is after school, cultural arts, but I do not know that has to do with dos or you know I that usually, what is through DYCD, that would be the education department. Well, doi CD is the one that gets the funding for the after school programs is my understanding who gets the funding the Department of Use, and what do you mean? Oh yeah, you're right? Well, that would be, I think, that could work possible. Yeah theater for the new city has been funded that way right in the past, but it was for we served the shelters, we served a number of city shelters, that's very hard work. We did not that's because they have to sometimes the only good meal they'd get during the day. They would get at your place. You have to be able to serve them dinner and then after they eat, they have cultural activities. But you know it requires a certain kind of an artist. Of course. The kids in the shelters have real problems, major problems, and you know we have to be able to deal with it, but that is a funding stream. We there was a really great program that the city had for a number of years, including even the public theater had an after- school cultural arts program for the shelters. You know you one shelter and they bust the kids to you and it's just you know you it's heartbreaking, it's heartbreaking. It really takes a toll, so you have to be a certain kind of person to want to do that, to be able to do it anyway. It's a funding stream, definite yeah, so DYCD should be included in that, but yeah children's services, children's youth. So carolyn do you want to read the result as far as you have it, or do you want to share your screen because I know we need to write two results right. I know I'm not sure how to share the screen, I'm not about it. So I think Clint can basically make you a co- host and then you just have beneath at the top of the zoom. It needs to it has a small green square with an arrow and if you click on it, you can share your screen. Okay, all right clean! You are muted. No, I see the share screen up to the bottom of my screen at the top okay, you should be able to share now Carolyn, okay, fine! So all right, let's see how I can do this all right, that's nice! It says multiple, okay, one participant can share at a time. Do I click advanced, sharing options or what? Just? If you click it should bring up a few different options and if it's in word it should bring up the word program. You can click on that and it should share your word document. Okay, what's coming up when I click on it is one participant can share at a time. Let's try advanced, sharing options. Okay, if this is not working, you can just read the document and we're going to edit it verbally yeah. Okay, so far, what I've written is wherefore. The arts and culture sector has experienced extensive damage from the paused program enacted by New York state. Approximately 70 of the arts community has had their funding cut according to Senator Jose Serrano, the performing arts industry has had the most extensive cuts and will not be able to open okay until what is the date been changed from January? Or what do you mean? Carolyn, you mean theaters performing theater Broadway is not opening until June, okay and as far as anything else goes, they do not care. They do not we're not even on the radar they do not discuss off or even off. They only talk about Broadway and Broadway is not opening until June okay. So I think I'm posting in the chat, the paragraph that we had originally in the district needs, and it was saying many giganomy artists and cultural producers had no income since March and we're unable to access unemployment benefits for months, while the prospects of new commissions and projects are in existence. Since theaters venues and live performance initiatives are indefinitely Saturday. We do not know when they will reopen so right now. There is this indefinite thing. So the economic hit that the arts and cultural sector is receiving will last for three to five years, depending on sector specificities. However, artists and cultural workers are the creative capital of New York and are integral to the creative industry capital that fueled, New, York storage and export economy for years. So I think this sentence that we had written for the needs and I'm not sure it's still there, but it's definitely the perfect intro for us to call for funding to support this workforce while they are shattered, while they you know they can not perform and but at the meanwhile, you know the community is definitely in desperate need of cultural programming yeah. I think we need well, but if you can't perform, how are you going to give them cultural programming? I mean there are after school and outdoors and online, so yeah, okay, if you would get money, you would be able to produce some work in that way. Yes, that's true. We already doing it without money and we're in terrible trouble because of it, wife, yeah- that is absolutely true online and after school and outdoors, all those three things could be done now within the guidelines within the health guidelines yeah and they all require money yeah, and so we want them to make it a priority. If there is any federal relief funds, we want to make sure that they use some of them for this kind of programming. Yes, well, I think, that's, I think, that's relatable, okay, yeah! No! I was impressed. I was in a zoom meeting where Serrano was on and he basically said that 70 of the industry had been artists and arts organizations had lost significant funding. So that's on the state level that good at any rate, the other thing that came up at the Economic Development Committee meeting is the their consensus. Opinion was is that we can not use the word export economy. So I have not received the final. Why not? Because they said that the term was not correct to describe what it is, so you know what that we need to have this conversation, because it was so inappropriate in the first place that they put arts and culture and their economic development, and given the fact that these people are speaking about things that they obviously do not understand, if New York is not exporting culture in the whole world, with our artists, our music or theaters, I do not know who is you know, so I mean when they are giving us inaccurate and ignorant feedback. This needs to be, you know, discussed. We can not accept their edits when they are not obviously informed about what we're talking right. There was an extensive discussion about it, and so, at any rate, it was redrafted that did it include something about the economy, but since I have not received the edited draft, yes, no, they are not sorry, let's do it for a second here, let's be like serious and democratic. This is not acceptable. They can not edit the work of another committee. Do you understand that, like this is not acceptable? I do not understand it olivia. It's a matter of what I have been told by the district office is the way that we will conduct business okay and that's what they have been doing so, but this is not okay, I mean this does not even comply for with the open discussion law like if anybody wants to amend an a resolution that has been drafted in a public meeting they're going to have the opportunity to amend it either in the meeting at economic development or at the full board meeting. They can not take it home and edit it and then the committee that is doing the rest does not know what we are resolutioning on. You know that's not acceptable. Sorry, I'm! I really you know, I'm not. Okay with that, okay! No, I think you perfectly justified in expressing your opinion, you know, and you have a right to your opinion in terms of how the district office I mean sorry, this is not my opinion, and you know this is this. Is the law right? This is the open meeting law and that's something that we would have to take off with them. Okay, so the district office told you that you had to rewrite your resolution. Is that what you're saying what happened was the district needs statement when it was anything that we draft in this committee has to be presented to the Economic Development Committee for their approval before it will ever make it right? Yeah? Okay, so because they did not approve supervising? No, they did not approve of the district needs in the way that it was written. The bulk of it is intact. We were able to keep charis included thanks to what did they do? What did they not like a number of different things, but unfortunately I do not have the draft the final draft. I changed because it was only on the zoom and I can't print that I do not have a copy of it will be approved at the executive committee. So I would suggest that if you have concerns about that, we should all sign in to the executive committee. What is it Declan next Thursday, next Thursday yeah? Should you sit in the executive now clean or not anymore? Yeah? Yes, no! I know okay well, we're a subcommittee! So I suppose we whatever we want, has to be approved by the committee. That's yeah, because they're going to have to give it to the board right yeah, but they need to approve it in a public space like where we can have input and they can not just ha. Somebody from that committee or from the office can not take this document do whatever changes they want and then just present it at the full board, as if it was a resolution, because it's not okay, I think what you're referring to is what happened in land use. Okay, there was a public meeting for the Economic Development Committee, okay and it unfortunately you were not able to be there. Yes, but what I'm talking about is today we're having this meeting in which we're supposed to do two resolutions right and they are around similar topics with our district needs right. But the thing is, first and foremost, the resolutions that we draft tonight, okay, that will be forwarded to the Economic Development Committee, will be on their agenda in November. They won't be there. I know that, but what I'm also saying is that we would have to go to the Economic, Development, Committee and comment at that point in time. If we have, you know, they will come, make their comments as to what they think of our resolutions. Okay, and then we can comment about what we think of their edits, and that is the process at this point in time, so their edits have not gone through they're going to come up in a public meeting right. The Ed okay draft tonight will be forwarded to the office to end Jim and it will go to Anisha and to Susan and to Jim okay, and they will review it, and then it will appear on the Economic Development Committee agenda. We hope in November, and then we can attend that meeting and we will hear the their committee's comments on the resolutions and the edits that they, oh yes, sorry Carolyn. I did not talk about that. I know the process. I was just talking about the resolution we did on similar issues last month and I'm completely okay with the fact that it was discussed at economic development. But since this commit this subcommittee is reconvening today, I think it is probably within our rights to know what were those suggestions and what is the new draft of that razor and it's not right. There was no resolution that reviewed in economic development. It was only the district needs. Yes, I mean I called it, but it's basically it it's a documentary, let's call it the district document right, I realized yeah. The district needs was reviewed and edited okay, it's by who, by the Economic, Development, Committee, okay, and there was a link and they said what they liked and what they did not like exactly and so, and we do not know what that is well. The problem is that the draft will be submitted to the Economic Development Committee next Thursday, and what I'm suggesting is that we tune in to the I mean to the executive committee next Thursday and they will review the draft and comment on it, but I mean they've already told you what they do not like right, separate things: there is the Economic Development Committee drafted. You know the changes that they wanted. Okay, that draft will be submitted to the executive committee on Thursday to approve. So can you tell us what those changes are? I do not have a copy of it in front of me to be explicit about what all the changes were, but one of the comments was that really set them off was the word export economy and so, at any rate it was redrafted to not. I do not even know what export economy means, because export economy means that New York is like one of the role centers for the arts and we export a great deal of our arts to other countries around the world, and that's, oh and important, yeah support culture right that we export culture yeah. I could see where they would not like that export music Jesus, we export fashion. We export, you know you name it: we've exported it in the arts, world yeah. I know it sounds like you're selling it it's sold. I mean the ideas are sold and they're marketed acrosss the country. I mean it's hysterical because I think one of the things that the Cia used abstract art it's a way to. Well. That's probably why they did not like it, because it had to be something like the Cia. No, it certainly was not Joe schlow down the block, but this was in like the late 40s, 50s and stuff that that went around, but at any rate yeah. It is like the artist that did the Goldman Sachs Mural is located here in the Us, where she fabricated. Her work was in Germany. Okay, so you know the money for creating that artwork fed into the german economy that it was several million dollars that that the artist received to create it. But it is, we do export a lot of art and we utilize other countries as okay. Well, I've never exported any art. So yeah, you have you've gone to columbia, those different things yeah, but I did not ever exported any art. I did not get paid any money, but you did export art and ideas to other countries. You've been to Italy you've done performances there yeah. I just I do not like the word myself: okay, sorry, but at any rate, whatever very crap, okay, whatever okay, it's just. That was one of the comments. I know that they went back and forth and they you know it's all things considered. It came out better than I thought it was going to and okay well, that sounds great, but we won't have access to that draft until next Thursday, when it's presented to economic to the executive committee that I was well who made the draft they, in other words, they took what we wrote and they rewrote it a bit yes and they and then they're, going to present that they're presenting that at the executive without telling us what they did they. You know, I saw it online when it was being created. What I do not have is a written copy of it to share with you. Why not because they won't give it to you huh. They have not said it to me. That's why? Oh that's kind of crummy that whole that's kind of crazy. Well, you know that's the way it is right. Now we do not have a copy of it will be available on Thursday at the executive committee. We can tune in then okay, and it will also be at the full board. It will be printed in the I'm assuming in the sheets, so I have a motion. I think that we are done with the first resolution. You know we threw down the. Why and the what and I think we could move on and do a resolution in support of the outdoor, dining legislation, sorry outdoor performance legislation by Jimmy, Van, Bramer and the one related with Laurie combo, because I mean they're very straightforward and they, you know we all have probably zoom fatigue by this point, so I would recommend trying to finish the meeting the earliest possible right sure, generous noise. To that outdoor thing. I do want to say something, but I do not know if it's, if you're talking about it, yet we're not talking about it quite yet. Okay, what are we asking? Okay, we're, therefore asking that when the federal relief funds arrive or whenever funds the city has you know yeah, when whenever the city receives relief funds, we want them to prioritize such programs that employ artists- and you know, support the arts and cultural sector at large during this horrible. You know shutdown that they're experiencing. Okay, therefore, that when federal relief funds are arrived at the city and state, because both the city of state could finance this, but you know you can't ask for money unless we're doing something. So do not. You think we need to talk about online and you know a virtual performance and that they should support that and because we are not allowed to open, therefore we're not open. Therefore we are not performing in person. So what are we doing that they could fund? Yes, so I mean we can't we can not yeah, so we can add those things so that you know I mean first of all, the artist could still produce work right. They may not be able to present it yet, but they could get funding to create a new write, a new theater piece or write new music or you know, do whatever they do. So I think partially it could be. You know directly to artists and then for programming. It could be for programming that conforms with health mandates, so programming that can happen outdoors online or in a safe social distance way, because there are also some spaces that could even be safe indoors because they're huge so as long as they have seating. That is, you know, well distance, and there is aeration in place. Yes, but one of the things that's required is going to be that new filter system like we can definitely but that filter system we can't afford so so you could get a grant for a system like that a place level if we could get it done for that yeah, that's right! That would be something that they could fund finance, yeah finance yeah. I think, but I think we should be a little specific and talk about online, outdoor or social distancing abilities that they should fund those things that we can do them, not that we are out of work, give us money, you know what I mean see what I mean yeah we can. We can add that okay, I think we should. I think we need to. Are they not going to listen? Well, you know we keep trying that okay, so basically I'll, we will speak and fine- tune. The resolution on that and support okay on to item three support for New York City proposed legislation to facilitate outdoor permitting yeah I about. Are we talking about that now? Yeah, let's move on! Okay, can I just tell you a fact we applied for a permit to perform in the street. We knew we were not going to get it for August 1st, which is when we usually perform in the street and all the rest are parked. So we also asked for September 5th and we did not get that either and the reason they gave was we are giving permits for outdoor dining and performances in the street are under block parties. There is no, there is no permit for outdoor performances. You have to apply under Block, Party and Block. Party is in conflict with outdoor dining, so we can not give you a permit, not that anything you do would be wrong, but we can not give a permit for outdoor dining and, at the same time, one for Block Party. So I yeah I am familiar with this issue. It has to do with executive order 148 by mayor De Blasio. That makes illegal any kind of sound app. I mean you would have amplified sound right yeah. I did not even get to that. But yes, that's another issue. Yes, so there is this emergency executive order, 148 that has basically made impossible performance outdoor performance, and I think this Jimmy Van Bramer Bill, is trying to create something similar with outdoor dining for outdoor performance, basically streamlining the permitting, but it is very important that in this resolution we also refer to the fact that we want the mayor to you, know: revise executive order, 148 and allow, for you know, amplified sound when it meets certain criteria, because right now it's just illegal, and so that means we have a moment. We want that also, but we also do not want to run into conflict with outdoor dining. We want somehow or other to be able to apply for a permit yeah. I do not think I do not think there is a conflict. What happened at that time is there? Is they prioritize about that? Yes, well, no, they did not. It did not prioritize it. They told us in no uncertain terms that they are conflicting permits and that they can not give a permit for two different things. At the same time now the outdoor dining has gone into the gutter. I do not know if you know that, but they are taking up parking lanes now, they're, not just on the sidewalk. They are actually in the gutter they're in the street, oh yeah, but okay, and not only that, but they are beginning to have single performers performing, but that's illegal, unfortunately well, but they're doing it yeah. I know they are. I mean you know it humanly speaking, it's nice to hear performances. There was a group performing on the corner of Avenue B, and is it the like five piece marching band, that's kind of been going around. I do not. I think it was the marching band. It was an interesting ensemble and it was nice. You know it's like kavanagh has had a duet, a duo perform and it's yeah. Well. I do not think that I think I do not think the restaurants would be against it by the way. I do not think restaurants are against it, but we've got a permit problem, so I'm just telling you they would not. No, I feel that way that will be incorporated into the resolution that needs to be addressed. Okay, so Olympia, you voted the legislation that it causes. Yes, I had emailed already the legislation back in the day. So let me just a question that you're talking about that limits the or that, oh so the executive order. I can send it to you in the chat. This is the emergency executive order 148 by the mayor, and this is the one that makes amplified sound illegal, and so we want to make sure that you know, because if the legislation by Jim Van Bramer passes, but this executive order is still active, the legislation is basically useless, because this is you're right, you're right amplified sound is very important yeah. I guess that Jimmy Van Bramer is worried about the high line. You know that may be having performances. There usually he's more worried about Queens. Oh yeah, Queens, okay, oh who's, the guy who's worried about the high line, probably the Warrior Corey Johnson, yeah, Rory Johnson right, that's right anyway, I yeah and also in the parks we were not given permits and they said the Parks Department said to us. Now you can apply, but there's no guarantee that you will get anything. That was the last thing they said to us, so we definitely want to be able to perform in the parks. There's no reason why we should not be able to you know: people have been performing in the park yeah, I know but illegally right- and we have you know our company. We have a company of 50 and a stage. You know you can't fool around like that with that kind of a company. No, I know you have to have permits yeah, okay and I'm sure that more broadway type shows will probably go into the parks if they allow that you know so, we might be able to get some help from that sector in pushing this anyway. Okay, so do you Wanna, read what you have so far? Okay, whereas wherefore that New York City Council member Jimmy, Van Bramer, has proposed legislation, Intro, 2068- 2020, to facilitate outdoor performing arts events and performances, but then executive order, 148 by mayor, De, Blasio forbidding amplified sound, creates a conflict. So no, so I think what we want to say is that we support one thing and the other one. We urge them to amend it so that it does allow for outdoor performance to take place. So what I would say is more like, so you know that we feel that it was a great loss to New York City as a whole. The fact that this summer, the city only focused on outdoor dining and did not focus getting outdoor performance running, we want to make sure that they, you know correct this course by passing immediately the legislation of Jimmy Van Bramer, that creates you, know a streamlined, permitting process for outdoor performance similar to outdoor dining, and we also urge the city to you know, amend the emergency executive order 148 by the mayor, so that amplified sound when is needed for outdoor performance. Indeed, is legal. You know it's physical right and you know if they want to if they want to keep the decibels at a certain point I mean we might say if they want to, you, know regiment the amount of sound. This is already regimented. I think so. There is already the guidelines for amplified. Sound public space are already yeah. There is yeah you're right you're right already, so we do not need to head all Right City Council member Jimmy, Van gramers has proposed legislation for performing arts for art events and performances. It has been a great loss to the city as a whole that the focus has only been on outdoor dining. We urge the city to amend executive order 148 via mayor De, Blasio forbidding F alphabites found so that outdoor performances you want to throw in something about the emotional health of the city, because that's beginning to emerge that there is a real problem with people's psyches now because of this, and that the cultural life is the basis of the emotional life, the emotional health of our citizens. I think that might say something yeah greg. We should write that you know there is a you know. Investing on this makes sense in many ways financially for the sector, because you have more people you know employed, but that also, but also emotionally, both for those people who have been long- term unemployed and they have no, you know, hope for the future right now and then also for the community for the community society as a whole that still craves. For you know local accessible, you know performance physical, not just actual, you know yeah. I think that's good. I think that the impact of the loss of accessibility, the performing arts, has had a detrimental effect on the emotional life of our citizens. It has on the what mental that's a detrimental effect: okay on the emotional health, okay on the emotional health of our community as a whole, we urge the city to amend executive order 148 by mayor De, Blasio forbidding amplified sound so that outdoor performances could be accommodated and made accessible to the general public. Does that work? For you guys work for me? Okay and we are and you're also talking about the economic health. I mean you know, I'm not trying to get rid of that. Okay. How would that impact on the economic health? I mean people would be able to go back to work. You know, artists and art organizations could be. You know, ticketing people for the events and all and all of the comp. All of the businesses that depend on the theater would also improve, because theaters have to buy materials to make sets they have to buy materials to make costumes the actors go out to eat between rehearsals. You know I mean the there's a tangential effect on the economic health. I mean how you obviously see it right if we, if we create a program that you know, invest money in arts and culture, the there is going to be. You know more artists that right now have no income whatsoever and they rely maybe in unemployment. But you know what has happened with the enhanced benefits that have stopped since July. We do not know if they're going to get any additional, it's going to be very important that these people can start having income again and the whole economy. Of course, then they use that income to pay, for you know food and rent and other things they need to buy, so it really it reactivates the economy as a whole, but I do not think we need to explain this in terms it's self- explanatory, I think so we can just say yeah economic life, but okay also, you know we spend almost a thousand dollars a week on a truck, a truck and a van for for performing in the park, because we have to move the set, the costumes, the actors, the crew, I mean you know there are tangential companies that have actually gone out of business, because theaters have gone out of business, so I think we could say therefore, clause. Sorry, we do not have to mention them. You know all we need is therefore okay, because we're for we're, saying we're, starting out with the opening sentence when we wherefore we support New, York City, Council, Members, Jimmy, Van Graver. Therefore we ask this what the city, Council or the city to so yeah the city Council, to pass this legislation. Okay, that would improve the overall economy of the city. Are I mean I do not think I think you do not need to explain why?
