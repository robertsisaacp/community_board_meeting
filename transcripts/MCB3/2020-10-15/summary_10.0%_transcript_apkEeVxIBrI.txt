What we needed to do was develop a resolution to request city agencies, including DCLA, D.O.T, the department of sanitation and parks to increase funding opportunities in the discussion of the current budget for artists and arts organizations, so editing, right.
Funding, opportunities for artists and arts organizations through city agencies that are included in the budget.
Think the resolution should be saying that you know because the art and are you going to draft it like a clint?
The other issue has to do with the fact that when artists apply to DOT- and I'm, not sure about the department of sanitation, they're required to provide a certificate from an engineer about the safety of their project and stuff, which is basically in order to get a letter like that, it's usually like about at least 500 to 800, so at any rate, we're looking for ways that are to express ways that maybe perhaps these agencies could assist arts organizations, artists, improving the funding stream they represented when they go to the budget.
If this is not working, you can just read the document and we're going to edit it verbally The arts and culture sector has experienced extensive damage from the paused program enacted by New York state.
Okay, They only talk about Broadway and Broadway is not opening until June So I think I'm posting in the chat, the paragraph that we had originally in the district needs, and it was saying many giganomy artists and cultural producers had no income since March and we're unable to access unemployment benefits for months, while the prospects of new commissions and projects are in existence.
I mean there are after school and outdoors and online, If you would get money, you would be able to produce some work in that way.
You know what that we need to have this conversation, because it was so inappropriate in the first place that they put arts and culture and their economic development, and given the fact that these people are speaking about things that they obviously do not understand.
I mean this does not even comply for with the open discussion law like if anybody wants to amend an a resolution that has been drafted in a public meeting they're going to have the opportunity to amend it either in the meeting at economic development or at the full board.
Today, I think it is probably within our rights to know what were those suggestions and what is the new draft of that razor There was no resolution that reviewed in economic development.
Whenever the city receives relief funds, we want them to prioritize such programs that employ artists- You know, support the arts and cultural sector at large during this horrible.
You think we need to talk about online And, you know a virtual performance and that they should support that and because we are not allowed to open.
But I think we should be a little specific and talk about online, outdoor or social distancing abilities that they should fund those things that we can do them, not that we are out of work, give us money, The resolution on that and support okay on to item three support for New York City proposed legislation to facilitate outdoor permitting Okay, can I.
Think This Jimmy Van Bramer Bill, is trying to create something similar with outdoor dining for outdoor performance, basically streamlining the permitting, but it is very important that in this resolution we also refer to the fact that we want the mayor to you, know, revise, executive, order, 148 and allow, for you.
Okay, whereas wherefore that New York City Council member Jimmy, Van Bramer, has proposed legislation, Intro, 2068- 2020, to facilitate outdoor performing arts events and performances, but then executive, order, 148 by mayor, De, Blasio forbidding amplified sound, creates a conflict.
The legislation of Jimmy Van Bramer, that creates you, know a streamlined, permitting process for outdoor performance similar to outdoor dining, and we also urge the city to you.
Know, amend the emergency executive order 148 by the mayor, so that amplified sound when is needed for outdoor performance.
Okay on the emotional health of our community as a whole, we urge the city to amend executive order 148 by Mayor De, Blasio forbidding amplified sound so that outdoor performances could be accommodated and made accessible to the general public.
If we create a program that you know, invest money in arts and culture, the there is going to be.
