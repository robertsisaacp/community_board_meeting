All right, let's start good evening, everyone welcome to Manhattan Community board three transportation. Public Safety Environment Committee meeting for October today is October 13 2020 6:34 P.M. My name is Paul Rangel. I am the chair of the committee. We have a pretty relatively light agenda tonight, but first things. First, we're going to start off with any objections to the minutes from September from the committee. I'm going to take our radioactive silence as a good thing and we can move on and wendy who will be doing the minutes for tonight. We'll do royal call. Can you hear me? Okay, yep. We can go ahead: okay, Paul Rangel here, Michelle Cooper Smith, yes, Lee Berman, yes, David, Crane, Yes, Felicia, Krugshank, President, Wendy, Daily, Present, Ellen Lowe, yes, Tariq Ramos! I do not see Tariq Eric, okay, all right! That's it! Okay! Thank you all right! So we have a couple of agenda items. Tonight we have a presentation from the- I guess: Rideshare moped company. Yes, so I do not know if I'm saying that correctly but we'll get to that in a second anybody, who's a guest, please sign into the chat room today and if you want to speak on any agenda item, please make a note of that in the chat room. Please know who you are and what your affiliation is with the community in the chat room. When you get a chance, please do so now, as the chat room will be recorded and downloaded for attendance purposes. The chat room should only be used for attendance purposes and any technical issues that we may have, but not and not to have any side meetings or anything of that sort. The rules and regulations are up there for everyone to see, and if anybody does have questions for the for Revel, we will take them at a later point, but the committee members will get the first opportunity to do so. The Department of Transportation Jennifer long is on it is on today, and I know she wants to do the presentation to start on behalf of D.O.T for rebels hi good evening. Thank you all for having us. I'm Jennifer Liang from DOT Manhattanville communities office. I am also joined by my colleagues assistant commissioner for Education Outreach, Ken, Wiley Schwartz, and also from our policy team. William Carey I'll provide a short intro before turning it over to rebel. So at the end of August DOT announced the rebel a multi- sharing company would be able to resume its operation on an interim basis. This was agreed by the company who will be closely monitoring its operations and also Institute New Instructor safety protocols that includes writer, training, account security, a new suspension policy, helmet use measures and also restricted hours operations. In addition to Revel, they will be also providing data to us on like trips incidents and also suspensions as part of the interim agreement. Currently DOT is developing some permanent regulations for the share moped services and we will initiate the rulemaking process this fall. This also includes an opportunity for public input. We will definitely keep the community boards updated on this. We will be on for the remainder of the time, as we will give their presentation. That's all I have for now. So Carol is all yours. Thank you. Jennifer hi everyone, my name is Carol and Tunis. I'm the community affairs manager at Revel, I'm going to briefly share my screen here. It does not seem like. I have the capability to do so. Give me one second, I'm going to have to make you a co- host, yeah, quick, second I'll share the screen. Give me one. Second, you should be able to share it now. Go ahead. Great! Thank you. So much Revel was founded in 2018 we're a micro mobility company based in New York City. We operate a fleet of 3,000 electric vehicles in New, York, City, they're, fully street legal. Each moped has a dmv issue license plate. It requires a driver's license in order to operate in each vehicle's throttle at 30 miles per hour. There are absolutely no bridges bike lanes allowed on a revlon and helmets and insurances provided with every single ride, because they're so small they're about 200 pounds. It's really easy to park Revels in the city of New York, which we all know can be a nightmare. I myself live in Astoria and on a good day. It takes me 15 minutes to find parking. Sometimes 45 minutes fairly, affordable, only one dollar to unlock and then 35 cents per minute, very simple model and, like I said, they're fully electric, so emissions free and also pretty quiet, which is great Breville's, a local employer. Since the very beginning, when we had our pilot with 68 mopeds in Brooklyn, we decided we're never going to do the gig economy, so every single person that works at Revel is an employee with benefits. The same benefits that frank our CEO has access to that I have access to. We hire locally and build relationships or workforce partners like say Nyx, Alliance and Ace, and really provide in- depth, training and electrical electric vehicle technology. From the very beginning, we've been all about access, so even back in 2018 with the 68 mopeds, we still had our access program, which essentially offers a 40 discount to anybody who's eligible for or participating in any local state or federal assistance program. We have about 2,500 writers, using on that membership and we've saved about 200 thousand dollars, and those are real dollar that has been saved by people on the program during the height of Covid-19. Back in March April may we provided nine weeks of free rides to anybody that was in the healthcare sector. We had three thousand folks on that program who wrote 130,000 miles. We partnered with restaurants in New, York City, who at that time, were struggling to provide them with the vehicles free of view, so they can shift to that delivery, only model that we saw back in about April this year. This is just a visual representation of rebels growth over the last year. So when we first started, we were very broken centric. We then moved to a story on long island city. Then you can see here, September and June, really just the network itself expanded a lot of that expansion happened earlier this year. We realized that we had. We had these incredible vehicles and we had just like this pandemic going on in New York, and we wanted to do our part. So in an effort to cover 57 hospitals. In the four boroughs we opened up a large section of northern Manhattan with pockets in the lower East side, the south Bronx and just a little bit covered a little bit more of Brooklyn and Queens, and this brings me to safety. Like Jennifer said this year we experienced our first fatalities and this really shook our company to the core. We had been working on safety for months before that always kind of iterating, making sure that we have the safest, platforming system on the market. So after we experienced that fatality, we decided to just temporarily pass our own service, so we took the mopeds off the road and we huddled, as a group, 300 employees just focused on safety, and we came back with really strong requirements. So the first thing that is now required with every single ride is taking a helmet selfie. So before, if you download the app, you know that you open up the app as a free floating system, so you find your moped, you walk to it. You have 15 free minutes to find your moped and you would hit start ride and you were good to go. We changed that flow a little bit so now, when you hit start ride only the helmet case and the back will unlock so then you'll put on the helmet you'll take the selfie. You submit that somebody will review it and then you're good to go, and this also applies. If you have a passenger. So if you have a passenger, they also need to submit that selfie. Really one of the largest things was just creating a comprehensive safety training. So we designed a training, that's 42 questions long, so it's 21 questions, they repeat twice and it really quizzes our users on everything, from helmet requirements to just traffic rules, really reminding folks not to ride on sidewalks, Bike lanes highways and the whole point of this safety training is not to fail our riders, but really to educate them on what the rules of the road are. What the policies are, what New York state law is, and we've seen just great success. The feedback is constantly like hey. This is super thorough, much harder than my dmv test really happy with this as part of our agreement with DOT, we also just implemented a couple of other initiatives, the first being just shutting down service overnight from midnight to 5. Am we found that late at night? Sometimes you know writers who are inexperienced are more likely to get in trouble, so we're just shutting down the service temporarily, really increasing our lesson. Capacity. We've always had free lessons out of our Gowanus HQ. We now have lessons in the four boroughs seven days a week, and anybody if you are a Revel rider, anybody can just sign up they're totally free. You can take up to five different classes at zero cost. If you take a lesson, we're also providing folks with a 65 dollar ride credit, which essentially means you get three free hours of riding time and then just really hitting writers with safety messaging, we have link NYC ads a safety content series on social media and also just increasing the community's ability to report any sort of bad behavior. What we realized with Covid-19 is that bad behavior just kind of increased acrosss the board, not only with our users, so we now have a community reporting tool. So anybody, absolutely anybody with a phone- can download the Revel app. You do not have to go through the sign up process, but you will be able to use that reporting tool. It takes about a minute to complete you, yours, you select the sort of behavior that you would not say. Maybe it's someone without a helmet or someone not stopping at a red light or someone driving on the wrong way. You select the infraction you let us know the time, the date and if you have a photograph or video or it's not necessary, but it's an option and just with your email, you submit that report and then someone on our team looks at that. So I know I've been talking for a while. So I'll stop here and allow for questions. Thank you Carol. So Committee does anybody have questions for Carol or for DOT in regard to got an observation? Not so much a question? One. Thank you for coming and presenting. I I'd have to say that at least 90 percent of the rebel riders that I've witnessed over the last seven ten days have been riding on sidewalks through parks, going through, stop signs going against traffic, stop signs, red lights, etc. So, to see that this, your new safety functions and features have been implemented does not really seem to have put a stop to the bad actors that are endangering riders as well as pedestrians and cyclists and everybody else on the road yeah, and I'm sorry to hear that. That's been your experience last week or so one thing I did not mention is that we have automated a lot of our alert systems so using GPS technology we can now detect when someone is entering a green space, a bridge a highway or riding down the wrong way street for over 0.1 mile, which is essentially less than a city block. So any behavior of that nature, because we have GPS technology. What we can do is we get an automatic notification that account is automatically suspended and the user's off the road, but it happens immediately after that right it ends. So it does not happen in real time, but I assure you, if you've seen anyone riding through a park, that person is up off the platform. I would love to see whether, through you or through D.O.T, I'd love, to see those statistics. You know whether it's just in Cv3 but I'd love to see. You know for a period of time, whether whether next week or the week after or I'd love to have access to those types of statistical analysis, I think that could certainly help us in the future. Thank you. This is, will carey from New York City D.O.T. We also want to encourage all members of the subcommittee and the board and members of the public to use the community reporting tool that rebel mentioned. I myself have used it several times, particularly if you can get a photograph of the vehicle, including the license plate that will enable them to hold riders who are violating the rules of the road accountable. Thank you just there's a picture that my one of my family members sent me a couple months ago and it will never leave my head and it's. It was a one of the mopeds in the middle of a stairwell in NYCHA houses. How have you guys resolved a lot of those kinds of issues? I know you were taking offline for a little while and now you're back, but there's a lot of things like that. You know we spoke about. You know the dangerous riding on the sidewalks, but now, where are people going with these bikes? I guess you said the GPS maybe solves that. I guess I actually know the exact picture you're. Referring to. I saw that photograph myself and I can definitely confirm that we retrieved that moped, so GPS does come in quite handy. I think with like any sort of micro mobility, company you're, always going to experience some sort of tempering with the moped so like folks try to take it home because they love it so much. Luckily, a lot of the times we're able to retrieve them, but it happens. Okay, just another question about the driver's licenses: when you go onto the app, does the app ask you for your driver's license number and all that information just make sure I did not know if I caught that or not yeah when down when you first download the app and you go through just the creation process to the creation of an account, you will submit your a photo of your driver's license a selfie just so we can match the driver's license to the person who's taking that selfie in real time, as well as a credit or debit card, and you said they have to take a selfie post ride as well or not not post rides, so the helmet selfie is at the beginning of every single ride. So those do not there's no real way of you taking your selfie, your helmet selfie and your driver's license and just not giving it to somebody else to ride on like somebody's there with you here go ahead. I did all this stuff. Now you go jump onto the moped and do what you to do. We try to reinforce to our users, because this is a motorized vehicle that requires a driver's license. It's not only rebels policy, but just New York state law. That person with the account is a person using the vehicle. So that's we call that unauthorized use and our users are fully aware that is not allowed on the platform. Okay committee members, any other questions for either D.O.T or no questions comments. Concerns from the committee, then I'm going to take one from a fellow board member. I know Larissa has her hand up Larissa go ahead. You can ask yourself. I thank you for acknowledging me and thanks for coming to the meeting regarding rebel. I have seen a lot of since you've been come since you've come back online. I have seen quite a few egregious acts by rebel riders. One day there was a scooter parked acrosss, both bike lanes a it was a two- way bike lane. They were parked acrosss, both of them for a good long time. I've seen wipeouts on the Williamsburg bridge, two of them and I've seen them ride on the greenway along East River. Thank you. It's good to know that we can report this. I am going to definitely utilize that, but my question is, after a writer, loses his rights to the rebel scooters. Is that permanent, or is there a period of time that he can come back? He or she can come back and get back on the app. Thank you for the question. There are two types of suspensions. The first is a seven day suspension for a minor infraction, and we have cases like riding on a bridge a highway, a park where it's a permanent suspension. So once you have been permanently suspended, there's just no going back on the platform. Great. Thank you so much all right. Thank you, Larissa does anybody else have any questions from the from the community? I can't raise my hand. No, it's not your fault. Well, I just want to say that I wish that anyone took the safety of how cars treat the roads as seriously as it seems that rebels taking their scooter situation. We do not take cars off the road when pedestrians are killed, and that happened many more times this year than happened with Revel, and I personally think that the more we can pivot to smaller vehicles like this, the better not just for safety, but also for climate- the climate crisis that we're experiencing. So I hope that we can continue to mitigate any issues with Revel to keep them on the road, because fewer cars are better and especially right. Now we some people do not feel comfortable in public transportation and so here's a good alternative. So I just wanted to mention that, but yeah just keep us in the loop thanks. Thank you all right does anybody else have anything to say: D.O.T, Revel committee? No sorry, this is so we'll carry again. Just as Jennifer mentioned, we are going to be going through a formal rule, making process the. We have this interim agreement in place with Revel and during that process I believe the community boards are notified. So there will be an opportunity for you to review those draft rules to submit comments in writing or, if you so choose to attend. The public hearing and we hope for that process to kick off this fall. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you will is there. I know you said the process will begin this fall. Do you? Is there an actual timetable when you think those rules will be officially drafted by that we'll come back to community? It's impressed. The process typically takes about 90 days, but that's from when you sort of officially submit the rules for public review. We are writing the rules. The commitment we're making is that we will start this process. This fall before the 21st of December. If you want to get technical about it all right, so for maybe for nice purposes, maybe we'll see you in 2021. Susan. I know you have your hand up go ahead. Okay, I could not tell if it was up. Thank you for the notification for the rule process. I know often many agencies send out many blast emails. Could I ask that you kind of personally notify us either an agency or a rebel? Send us an actual email, letting us know so we can participate. Yes, we'd be happy to do that. Thank you. All right, any other questions, comments concerns all right. I want to thank DOT for coming on the call tonight, as well as carol from Revel, well more than welcome back anytime, if you ever have any questions or concerns to committee here for Community Board, 3 transportation. Thank you for coming on tonight and telling us a lot more about the moped company all right. Thank you. We're going to move on the agenda you're more than welcome to stay on, but I do not thank. You might get bored a little bit with what we got to do last night. So, let's go with our next agenda item, which is district needs and our budget priorities. I sent the committee on Sunday night. The final draft of our district needs statement, which we pretty much settled on in August. Excuse me in August, I'm thinking last month it was in August. Does the committee have any questions? I think we finalized it up pretty good. Do we need to take a look at it again? Should we pull it up again? Let me show you one pull it up just in case. We want to take a look at it if anybody has any questions, comments or concerns. If we need to add or change up some grammatical things, because we are voting on it tonight, people can continue to send grammatical and that kind of thing to the office after okay. Well done so more content based, I guess for tonight, but I think we're good. I think we hammered it out pretty well over the summer, put the additions we needed to put in cleaned it up. I know I sent it out on Sunday. Did everybody receive it? I'm pretty sure everybody got all right, we'll pull that up and we'll just take a look at it and then we'll go right to the budget priorities all right. Thank you, Michelle transportational, environment, even better, I did not think I was losing my eyesight there we go all right. I think everything was updated with the Stats right Susan. I think we were good. I think Jim had updated everything we just keep scrolling down. I think we got everything we needed to get out of this sorry. I was saying correct before while I was muted. Okay, all right now, I think we got everything yeah, let's delete that all right. I think we're good committee. You have any final questions on on the district needs statement. I think we were good from a couple months ago. All right, I think we're good we'll come back to that, we'll vote on it together with budget priorities. Susan, I'm going to ask you if you could go into a little bit of the explanation budget priorities for the committee just so we can get a refresher and even for him, for the new members as well sure happy to I'll read most of what you sent it out. I think yesterday or today so I'll go through. Most of it sorry be more polite. So every year we vote on ranked lists of 25 expense priorities and 40 capital priorities for city agency budgets, expense priorities are items like programming or staff for an agency, and capital are generally items that last at least five years and costs at least 35,000. The goal of voting on these priorities is to bring more services and money to community Board three for needs that we decide are the most important. Therefore, if a program is well funded and not in danger, we would not make it a priority because we already have that service, because these are agencies priorities. They do not include funding for programs or items from City, Council funds or state or federal funds that might be administered by agencies. I won't go through all the research I'll, just let you know all of these items have been well researched. They were put on an agenda to meet with the agencies. The committee chairs in office met with the agencies went over all the questions and we also if there is a priority left over from last year. We look to see the answer from the city from last year and all of the minutes from these meetings and all the answers from last year. It's all on our website. Under member resources and after the committee's rank and vote their priorities, their collated decree will create one list for the board. The committee rankings are very important since there's a limited number of priorities and the bottom ones may fall off the final list. So all the committee priorities are collated together. The committee rankings are generally not changed, they're respected, and then we create one list and take the top 25 to send in and if there's any questions on that, I do not have any questions right now does committee have any questions for Susan on that explanation? No okay, so first thing I'm just going to look at is that second bullet susan, the death, the ny. Let you know if any the firehouses needed backup generators and they never got back to us. So I'm going to assume that they do not. I think I actually remember from previous years that they did not. Okay. Can we just take that off the list? Take it off all right: let's do it make it easier for you, that's right. Let's go from nine to eight so Susan, just just for the committee's purposes. I went to the NYPD budget consultation with Susan. They did not really offer much and you know they took their hit on the. I guess the defunding part I Wanna. I Wanna thank Michelle for going to the D.O.T budget consultation. I think it was about a week or so ago, but the main people that hit was a department of sanitation. Am I correct? There Susan sure they actually had 60 percent of their budget services reduced the collection basket, collection and residential collection was hit so badly that there was quite an outcry and there's been some replacements, but nowhere near enough we're getting. We do get complaints about garbage if you're in outdoor dining, you see piles of garbage next to the restaurants, we do feel we're going backwards on the rat program because of the garbage. That's absolutely all over. You know, and you know now that we have outdoor dining. We need better garbage pickup, not worse, so sanitation has taken a tremendous hit on top of it. I just found out today that some of their inspectors are being drafted for the open restaurants program. You know DOT has to inspect that, and the ot has a hiring freeze. I'm sorry, yeah, D.O.T and D.O.T has a hiring freeze, so they do not have enough inspectors. So the city is taking inspectors from other programs, such as sanitation was supposed to be inspecting dumping at David, Crane's garden, and they told us they could not because their inspectors had been drafted. So it's serious, it's really serious situation. Sorry David! Just before I go on, I just see some people still in the participant list. If you have not signed in please sign in that way, we have your attendance for the for the for the in the chat box. Just please sign in and your relationship to the community. If you're a non- board member, please do so yeah sanitation's saying a big hit. I think you know all of us live in different parts of the district. I live closer to 14Th. I've seen the garbage start piling up by my neighborhood and the rats are coming out and they're. Looking like cats, it's starting to get rough around here and with the anticipated potential of open, dining and out outdoor dining becoming permanent. This is only going to get worse. The garbage is going to get worse, everything's going to get worse, like that, I feel strongly about putting number one as the Rat Medication zone collection. That's just my opinion. I'll take opinions. Now what from anybody? I do think we need to move the sanitation priorities closer to the top, though considering that they just took such a big hit, but I am open to hear everything and then I'll chomp it down after that, I'm here free for all. Whoever wants to chime in please chime in I'd agree with moving well anything sanitation related up since without sanitation, pickups and overflowing baskets. That leads to the inevitable rats. So yes, if we can rank that higher and then rat mitigation along with that, I think curbside well composting, perhaps further down syringe pickup as important as it is slightly less, but I'd agree with you Paul. If I could say I think the litter basket, which I think that was Lee just referred to. I think that's really important. Also, I mean that's a daily thing that we now see overflowing and worse than ever and impacts all the things that you've both mentioned. So actually, susan two things are similar: Matt Rats, Mitigation zone collection and Litter basket service, which of those two do you think, would have the bigger impact or they both. I they're both number one. I can't make it easy for you, they're, totally different and both extremely important. For the same reasons. Okay, I was thinking those should be in the top two as it was. I did not know how to how to rank them either way one or two, but I do think they should be the top two. Does anybody disagree with the Rat Mitigation zone collection and litter basket service being either one or two, because if not, we want to move those two up and we can figure out which one is that number one? In fact, this is what we'll do, because we did it at Human services, Thursday night we're going to just do you know the blue raised hand, feature for and whoever outranks, whoever wins, we'll get the number one number two we'll just run it down that way so for rat mitigation zone. What can I ask one more question that will help? Is the entire Cd3 district designated as a rest mitigation zone? Yes, there's a tiny little bit near the waterfront, but Doa DOH has included it in so yes, it is okay! Well, that does not make it easier. Sorry, all right, so we do agree that this is one and two so for rap mitigation zone collection. If you want that as number one raise your hand on the raised hand feature we got one. We've got two now: okay, we've got two for rat mitigation zone. If you want litter basket service, if you want litter basket, services number one, two, three, four one: two wait: Michelle Europe right, Lee, you're up, I'm up. Okay, Litter basket service is number one. That's going to be the win wendy! Thank you, that'll, be your one, I'm okay. Does anybody feel strongly about something else? Moving up ahead of rap mitigation zone, no, hey tariq, how you doing all right, we're good with those one and two we're doing a bunch of priorities. I know you just came up all right, we're ranking them. Okay, so now we've got one and two right there. Nobody else feels stronger about any things on the bottom, going ahead of rat mitigation zone, going once twice three times sold. When do you still have your hand up you? Do you have a question, or do you you're good? Oh you just do it mistake? It's good! Okay! Anybody have any strong opinions about what number three should be out of the rest funding for completion of the Pedestrian Ramp program, Curbside Organics, Collection curbside, let's curbside organics collection from the residences. They have like a brown bin program that some buildings participate in. You would put your compostable. Oh yeah, thanks. Okay, it's been suspended for a year David, since you knew a little bit about it. How do you think a lot of buildings do participate in this specific program? A lot of the very larger buildings do not a lot of the small resid like tenement style buildings. Do a lot of the community gardens did like mine. Did we had a binge out front and a lot of people contributed and I had to maintain it in a sanitary way that kind of stuff I could say I live in a 100 unit. Building and we particip, we did participate and it, I would say it removed a lot of waste from from the sanitation. Okay, it was extremely popular. We put ours out on the outside the gate, so people could use it all at all times and we ended up. I ended up having to we're picking it up. I believe it was three times a week at that time. It's popular, but I would not advocate for putting it to the top. Although I really liked it, there are higher priorities for me. I think the the of the ones that are here that I would I would say that I would drop toward the bottom. It would be the curbside organics and the curbside e- waste. So I would sort of say those two at the bottom I mean they're. All these things are important in some sense. That would help us. Then we'd have four others to cons to. Oh also, community compounds program subsidy. So those three about those three types of waste pickups. I would not consider for position three. What we're talking about now. I would it's funny for completion of the head ramps. The syringe litter patrol and then the bottom one which I do not actually fully understand what it's about, but it's rap mitigation is, are these the ones who would come by and say, there's a problem of health? Yes, these are the bottom. One is department of Health that actually go goes out and Specs works with buildings or whoever I think they did with your garden. My garden had numerous the properties around the garden who are contributing to the problem. Yes, those were department of health people right and they would come by periodically and you know, give us an attaboy or give us advice, or I like did you break it up David, but I do not know how how impactful it truly is. So I will tell you it is a truly impactful. We worked with them constantly whenever people complain because they inspect, they can have inspectors issue violations. They work with both businesses and residents on how to mitigate, and then they also do the indexing to see to be able to rate the properties, the focus and the policy and the direction all come from this department of Health Initiative. All right, I'm sorry, I just ellen, had her hand up. I just want to make sure she gets something to say something. I was just going to say that my building had the brown Bin. I would participate in the brown Bin program and it's Chatham Green, so it has 400 units and it was a really popular program that we were disappointed to see go. I think it reduced at least fifty percent of our race. So it was a great program and it's unfortunate I had to go, but I would think that I think the rat and litter issue would impact the residents here, a lot more than the Brown Bin program, all right David. So actually I'm. I think I would advocate next for putting the pedestrian ramp program in if there's any chance that it's actually going to happen. There was progress in recent years. It has always been a very high priority of the board. You know, and our main advocate for that is no longer with us. I would hate to. I would hate to see us drop it down by just neglecting it, because none of us feel that we're affected. You know it just has not grabbed our attention. It is an important thing for a very vulnerable part of the population. There are entire like long streets where you can not find a curb cut to get onto the sidewalk. You know if you're, if you are using a wheelchair or a walker, even you know so you there are entire series of blocks where you have to ride in the street. My second one will be this inspector's neighborhood interventions program that program the way that they ran. It was great. It was really helpful, they provided systemic advice and they were extended a lot of carrots as opposed to fines right. It was not like, like other programs, they did not issue violations, they could, if things did not improve, they could direct inspectors to go there and issue violations, but that was not their role right. It was this intervention right, neighborhood intervention, they did it and I think they did it very well. So I would say I would like to see that one as number four, so three and four being ped ramps and four being the inspectors Neighborhood initiative. Does anybody have anything they want to put higher than that? Does that seem like a good thing? How do people feel about the pedestrian ramps at number? Three? Does anybody object to that going in number three? Let's group them at three and four, the inspector neighborhoods and we'll do the same thing we'll run the vote. We'll do the little raise hand vote again, so we can chop this down even more so funding for the pedestrian ramp number three. We got one. We got two. We got three. We got Michelle at four ellen at five. That's enough that that'll win it right there. That puts it at three we'll put we'll put funding for completion pedestrian ramp at three. Does anybody feel stronger about anything else for number? Four? Besides the neighborhood Rand interventions, Rat reduction, interventions and initiatives, I would like to make a plug for the syringe litter Patrol. It is a public health matter and it's very unique and it apparently continues to be a problem in CB3, I'm kind of with you on that ellen. I was about to pivot. To that that's what I felt strongly about too was the syringe program. Let's move it up to five. For now we can determine between four and five, the rat reduction and the syringes. So does anybody feel the rat reduction should go ahead of syringe patrol or the other way around? I think syringe patrol should go ahead of the Rat reduction. I know ellen you ellen. You wanted that for right. So let's do the vote again for neighborhood rat reduction at four raise your hands. David Michelle anybody else, raising their hands. Okay for Sir is that tariQ&And phil tariQ&And felicia for Rat Reduction, yes, David and Michelle, so that's Felicia, David Tariq Michelle- is that four is that the majority today, all right, that's a four! We have to be comfortable with the ones that end up at the bottom, like could be potentially get kicked off the 25 for full board. So I think that's something we got to be extremely careful with so syringes at five. Can we do a raised hand? There's anybody feel any. Let me go back. Does anybody feel I need the rest, their curbside organics collection, E-, waste collection or the compost program? Subsidy should go ahead of syringes. No, we do not want to move the keyboards ahead of the syringes. No okay, no okay syringes are going to stay at five. Now we can determine six seven eight. Does anybody feel strongly about one or the other going to six? I almost feel we should. We should, at this point, rank them from the bottom, which ones would we least mind losing, because I think we are going to lose one or two. Let's say of these. Everyone understands that there's 25 allowed for the full board and each committee is putting in a wish list, they're going to be collated into a single list, but if that list goes beyond 25, then 26 through the end would be dropped right. That being said, I'm okay with e- waste going dead last. I just have to ask: what's the like what like a say like a big building, that does actually collect that kind of stuff? Where does that go now like? If people are throwing out computers like what are we going to? Where does it go? Does anyone know you're good ellen go? Oh, so I was going to so. If it's a I mean a lot of companies will have contractors with other private companies who are second-, hand, dealers in the market, so they will pick up as part of their business model, but for residential buildings. There's really no other method unless you're going to take it to a distributor somewhere that you know of not like New York City has had a very large e- waste program collection program to begin with, because it was really never required by law. Even though there's a New York state law on it, but there are no penalties for not doing it, so it's been kind of a free- for- all, but there's no coordinated effort. Besides the DSNY sponsored and funded programs. To my knowledge, yes, David. Thank you Alan! So this they do not even do well, maybe they've just been canceling them, but I've been looking to bring in an old computer and a very old one. There seems to be nowhere to do it. They often would have a pickup. You know day at a at a farmer market or something they have not done it the whole time a coveter, since this is not connected to that is it. This is not that budget item yeah those well for the community programs. They tend to be the sny funded, related programs and then for the private haulers. I think it. You know it's just not profitable to be in the model where you're just picking up one or two items, so they usually have these sort of business partnerships with. You know large law firms, let's say where you're collecting a thousand pieces of electronics or something right, but this is the this is the where they have a you know, drop- off day. Yes, the farmer market, that's usually lower East side, Ecology center. That's the community organization funded program, it is the city, is paying for the Lower East, Side, ecology, drop- off. Also, the residences like in my building, we also along with the organics. We also have ordinarily e- Waste pickup also, so all of that is, you know, city funded, whether it's at the residences and the city picks it up or if you go to the farmers market and Low East side. Ecology center runs the program they're doing it with funding from the city, and those are different budget items they probably are. I think the community program is is the one funded by yes is funded by separately. Well, I guess Sam. What I would say is that the curbside collection- it's less important. If they do start up doing the I did not even know they did curbside collection of that, and maybe they only do it for buildings that participate, but anyway, there's another way to dispose of these things into that program through events, if they actually have those anymore, I guess I'm trying to say: maybe this one is lower priority. There has been one recently. Okay, where do we feel should be? What should be the one that we know could just drop off at this point kind of beat this to death. A little bit I feel like waist can go. I think e- waste can go at the bottom. I actually do think it could go at the bottom. Was anybody at the bottom was that Lee were using yeah? I agree. The e- waste should be at the bottom. Okay. Anybody disagree with e- waste being the that last item. Okay, so now we can, we can go between seven and six. I would actually put the compost program subsidy ahead of the Curbside Organics collection. That's the way I would look at it. I would put that at six. Does anybody feel different again? Can I disagree with you sure? Go ahead. The brownfield system is actually a much larger program than the community- based program. However, the community- based program does do more education, so I because you know so- let's say the Lcu's ecology center, for example, as an example, so they collect within the closed loop system, and so everything is much controlled, but it's a much smaller collection. However, there is an education component to it and it feels more local. The brown bin system is much larger. It's a it's a full direct DSNY program and it gets held upstate in a much larger, much larger quantities and much larger sort of you know, compost system, so I mean I, the brown Bin system. I think, in terms of numbers, impacts a lot more people and takes away a lot more waste, assuming that they do what they're supposed to do, bringing organic waste and turning it into compost. I forgot ellen used to work for ecology center. Yes, we got the we had the wild card, the whole time flip them flip them go ahead. Let's go[ _ _], I'm sold. Excuse me ellen you've, almost convinced me. I was going to advocate for the other one, because in some theoretical sense you know, since they collect synthetics community compost collect at the farmer market. I could all my stuff over there, but actually I'm not going to save my garbage for a full week and then bring it over to the farmer mark and drop it off. So I really, if you believe, that the the brown Bin program, even though it's only in the limited number of large buildings predominantly, but if you believe that diverts a lot more of the waste stream into a composting effective composting program, then I'm all for doing it first yeah. I am I'm for I'm convinced I'm for it being a six anybody, not anybody want to flip them or we're good with that. Yes, good all right. I think that was pretty good. That was pretty painless. May I add one additional point for the brown Bin system once it was well before the the budget cut. You can just sign up for your building online and they'll. Send someone to assess your building and whether or not your building can the needs for bombing, and there are many smaller buildings and also single residences homes that participate in that program. So it's not just for large buildings. They had a long wait list for a while, so it took them quite some time to meet everyone's needs so, but I thought that they had worked through that list already, but you know now this budget code yeah, I do know smaller, build buildings. My size that are, you know, co- ops where the where they have joined with the program buildings like mine with commercial Landlord. My landlord is never going to implement it. Sad for me, can we maybe add a sentence here about why it's needed if you can come up with one quickly ellen, because it just says it's been suspended and should be restored. Can you put a sentence about why it's important, I think, because of the large- scale, much larger scale impact and it's very visible, because it's a direct DSNY program, so they promote it as part of the recycling programs, for example right it's on the website. It's they have all the you know, logos and everything. So it has that visibility. That goes with it. However, what it does not have is that community close- knit component and that extra you know that extra sort of added education and also close loop aspect, that the community compost program has cool how about impact if we could add a clause after it impact large- scale impact in diverting or organic materials from the waste stream from the solid waste stream. Is that the right words for it? I believe it is in diverting organic materials from the solid waste stream. If that's accurate, then I think this makes it a little stronger. How would you want to bet that this is number 26 on the combined list? Well, now, I'm just thinking about it since we've been talking about it this much. Do we want that to go higher that sucks? I did, but we kind of voted on that already I'm open to renegotiating this. We have not locked this in yet we have not voted it in. If does anybody want to move curbside organics up higher than where it's at right? Now, at six David, you said you was a possibility. Where do you want it at you wanted to switch with one higher yeah ellen? How you feeling about that because you we discussed syringes before so should we just go ahead of the Organics Collection program, or should it stay the same? You know what, if the syringes dropped off, I would be just as upset. Can I make a comment about the syringe program sure it sounds very important. I never heard of it before this month. I I've never seen or I've never had contact with anyone from there. So I do not know how big or impactful it was I'd say in our neighborhood in the parks it is the Parks Department staff that are cleaning up syringes. We also have a lot of cleanup from harm reduction, non- profits, so it sounds really important. It probably should be very big and very important, but, like I said, I never even heard of it yeah now that I see that as DSNY, I understand that I pick up the syringes in the community garden. I've never had a patrol come by help. So we'll put you a high up on the list. All right, I am willing to see Curbside Organics collection move up one spot higher. At least anybody disagree with that. Considering what we just heard about the DSNY syringe program or black thero, all right, I'm I can, let's move curbside organics up and move below it. We want to make any other moves. Is there anything? That's glaring that we should move up all right. That being said, let's I just need to do the final vote for it right Susan. I do not need to do it right. You can do one final vote for that this and the district needs, and then I can close out and we can adjourn all right exactly and if I could just ask before, if you could, I guess Michelle send me the district needs and the priorities without waiting for the minutes. Thank you, okay. Well, dear, thank you all right. So that being said, I'm going to close this right now. Are we good on this order because we're going to vote on both district needs and budget priorities? I think we did this pretty. Well, pretty painless we're good. Nobody feels strongly about anything else. Going up higher or lower or anything like that, all right, yep, okay, wendy you're, going to roll call us out and that's our vote on district needs and budget priorities and then we'll agree: okay, Paul Rangel, yes, Michelle, Cooper, Smith, yes, Lee Berman, yes, David Crane, yes, Felicia Crookshank, yes, Wendy Lee; yes, Ellen Lowe, yes, Tariq, Ramos, yes, okay! Thank you very much all right! Thank you, wendy. I think I need a motion to return. You just say: let's vote on the motion to Adjourn, I mean when it's obvious in the point of the business we're at and I think it's actually on the it's on the it's on our agenda as an item or it is a full board. Then it's already emotion. You say: okay, if there's no other business. Let's vote on the motion to adjourn time. All right. That's a motion to adjourn. We good everybody! Goodbye good night have a good week good night we're going to have a pack November agenda, I'm just letting everybody know yeah! Thank you.
