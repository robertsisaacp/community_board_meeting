So even back in 2018 with the 68 mopeds, we still had our access program, which essentially offers a 40 discount to anybody, who's eligible for or participating in any local state or federal assistance.
We had these incredible vehicles and we had just like this pandemic going on in New York, and we wanted to do our part.
So, we designed a training, It's 21 questions, they repeat twice and it really quizzes our users on everything, from helmet requirements to just traffic rules, really reminding folks not to ride on sidewalks, Bike lanes highways and the whole point of this safety training is not to fail our riders, but really to educate them on what the rules of the road are.
So, to see that this, your new safety functions and features have been implemented does not really seem to have put a stop to the bad actors that are endangering riders as well as pedestrians and cyclists, and everybody else on the road I did not mention is that we have automated a lot of our alert systems so using GPS technology we can now detect when someone is entering a green space, a bridge a highway or riding down the wrong way street for over 0.1 mile, which is essentially less than a city block.
This is, will carey from New York City D.O.T. We also want to encourage all members of the subcommittee and the board and members of the public to use the community reporting tool that rebel mentioned.
If you ever have any questions or concerns to committee here for Community Board, 3 transportation.
So, let's go with our next agenda item, which is district needs, and our budget priorities.
Susan, I'm, going to ask you if you could go into a little bit of the explanation budget priorities for the committee just so we can get a refresher and even for him, for the new members as well sure happy to I'll read most of what you sent it out.
So every year we vote on ranked lists of 25 expense priorities and 40 capital priorities for city agency, budgets, expense priorities are items like programming or staff for an agency, and capital are generally items that last at least five years and costs at least 35 000.
The goal of voting on these priorities is to bring more services and money to community Board three for needs that we decide are the most important.
Under member resources and after the committee's rank and vote their priorities, their collated decree will create one list for the board.
The committee rankings are very important since there's a limited number of priorities and the bottom ones may fall off the final list.
We do feel we're going backwards on the rat program because of the garbage.
If we can rank that higher and then rat mitigation along with that, I, think curbside well, composting, perhaps further down syringe pickup as important as it is slightly less, but I'd agree with you.
So actually, susan two things are similar: Matt, Rats, Mitigation zone collection and Litter basket, service, which of those two do you think, would have the bigger impact or they both.
Anybody disagree with the Rat Mitigation zone, collection and litter basket service being either one or two, because if not, we want to move those two up and we can figure out which one is that number one?
Anybody have any strong opinions about what number three should be out of the rest: funding for completion of the Pedestrian Ramp program, Curbside Organics, Collection curbside, let's curbside organics collection from the residences.
It's unfortunate I had to go, but I would think that I think the rat and litter issue would impact the residents here, a lot more than the Brown Bin program.
Besides, the neighborhood Rand interventions, Rat, reduction, interventions and initiatives, I would like to make a plug for the syringe litter.
Does anybody feel the rat reduction should go ahead of syringe patrol or the other way?
Anybody feel I need the rest, their curbside organics collection, E, waste collection or the compost.
That you know of not like New York City has had a very large e- waste program collection program to begin with, because it was really never required by law.
This is not that budget item Those well for the community, programs.
That's, the community organization funded program , it is the city, is paying for the Lower East, Side, ecology, drop- off.
Ecology center runs the program they're doing it with funding from the city, and those are different budget items they probably are.
It's, a full direct DSNY program, Much larger sort of you, know, compost, system, I think, in terms of numbers, impacts a lot more people and takes away a lot more waste, assuming that they do what they're supposed to do, bringing organic waste and turning it into compost.
It probably should be very big and very important, but, like I said, I, never even heard of it Now that I see that as DSNY, I understand that I pick up the syringes in the community garden.
We good on this order because we're going to vote on both district needs and budget priorities?
