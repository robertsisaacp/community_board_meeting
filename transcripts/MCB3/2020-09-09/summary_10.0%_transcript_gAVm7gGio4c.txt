If the well they're not going to avenue a specifically, you know there may be times when different responses to different areas require different.
But like can't be answered whether or not this is putting people's lives in danger To like no know that I mean I know that the open streets program will probably not go that much longer, but I, don't know, I, don't think that people are using it so much that we could put people's lives in danger because of any sort of reduced response time or as captain spleen as or chief splain excuse me has explained to us over the past couple of months about the response order as well, which throws things into havoc.
You know those things haven't been eradicated, 100, but it's been better than it's been better since, since the July, since our episodes in July and everything I've spoken to the officers and the apparatus operators, especially from the firehouse, the fire company on east second street, and they found to be improved.
If the committee doesn't have any ques any other questions, what I'm going to do for tonight, Is I'm, going to pivot back to agenda item number two, which is the dot's response.
If the D.O.T representative can speak on agenda item number two, which is the response to the request for the study proposals on e-second and fourth street to allow for faster response up north A point of personal approach.
So at this point, we're not looking to remove parking for open streets, but just to clarify Is this to remove parking on the corners to accommodate the turning moves or just to widen.
So maybe jackie could discuss and respond to both corner, eliminating parking on the corner and the full street, which I think the committee asked for.
Okay, so yeah, like I, said at the moment, we're not looking to remove parking for open streets, but I could bring back the this to my office and see what I would have to bring it back for further clarification, I mean, I guess, if it's a temporary program, probably not, but if it's something that is something that this is going to go on for longer, I mean I.
Think some cities have extended their open restaurants and streets to like december.
The open streets is a very successful program that people like so therefore it may be extended for a long time.
The reversal study would take some time for evaluation, the avenue b, open, streets, open restaurants or temporary programs.
This point, we are not looking to remove parking for opening streets to clarify is the request to remove parking at the corners to accommodate turning movements for fdny trucks or just to widen the travel lane for the full block?
I, don't think the question is right: now, whether we want to pursue 4th street, it's not happening, but I, think we need the information from D.O.T Thank you with regards to the parking on east 4th, street.
Well, dot's response was, at this point, they're not looking to remove parking for open, streets.
Oh, thank you and thank you all for continuing to talk about this, and I know the open streets coalition and including myself with my office on avenue b.
I mean, I, don't think I think DOT just can't wait another month and not have responses, because the answer is then less social distancing for people and more risk for health, issues, and People who, like people who walk people, need to use the this open space is a way to for a healthy, issue.
You know unless the committee has any reason not to We're, not updating the resolution per se tonight, but we'll have DOT take some of these thoughts back to their colleagues and see how they can work with them, whether it's a loading zone or freeing up fourth street a little bit.
At the same time, you know, I, think, personally, I think that the emergency lane I've seen some drivers speeding down through avenue b, between 6th and 10th street.
Fdny is now sharing their concerns and some of the creative ideas that came out of last month's transportation committee meeting D.O.T is now saying we're not going to look at elimination of parking.
The number two thing is: we want to make sure we have a pleasant community, And, I, think, ultimately, the goals here of the open streets program and the fdny are in sync.
I really hope you guys do look at the fourth street potential of maybe daylight there a little bit to help free up, but the one thing I do like out of this is that there is has been improvement.
What about removing parking on east 6th, street?
