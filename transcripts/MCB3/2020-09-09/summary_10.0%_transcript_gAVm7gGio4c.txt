Everybody, Lee Berman, also, a lifelong resident of lower East side, Yeah, I'm, David, Crane and I've been here a little over half my life on a block right near tompkins, where hi everyone thanks for watching hi, I'm, also born and raised in lower east side and happy to be on the committee.
But, another restaurant took up the mantle and, although again like it's, not perfect, we when we need to get up the street like us If the well they're not going to avenue a specifically, you know there may be times when different responses to different areas require different routes.
If it's improved but like can't be answered whether or not this is putting people's lives in danger, I would love to like No know that I mean I know that the open streets program will probably not go that much longer, but I do not know.
You know those things have not been eradicated 100, but it's been better than it's been better since, since the July, since our episodes in July and everything I've spoken to the officers and the apparatus operators, especially from the firehouse, the fire company on East second street, and they found to be improved.
Think you answered my next question, which is what would be the ideal situation which is to not have anything blocking the street, so thank you, okay, great.
If the committee does not have any ques any other questions, what I'm going to do for tonight, Is I'm, going to pivot back to agenda item number two, which is the dot's response.
Thank you, if you guys, can just hold on for a little while longer and if the D.O.T representative can speak on agenda item number two, which is the response to the request for the study proposals on E, second and fourth street, to allow for faster response up north The floor is yours, a point of personal approach.
Think in the resolution you guys also mentioned removing the barriers on Avenue B in favor of flexible delineators, so flexible delineators would not be a viable option, because the open streets is not in effect 24 hours.
Okay, so yeah, like I, said at the moment, we're not looking to remove parking for open streets, but I could bring back the this to my office and see what I would have to bring it back for further clarification.
Think some cities have extended their open restaurants and streets to like December.
The real concern for us is: if the open streets continues, we know like it's.
And I know there's a school in the area If they're going to if Amy B is going to be shut down again come springtime through for the open, streets.
The open streets is a very successful program that people like so therefore it may be extended for a long time.
As this and the response from the Department of Transportation The reversal study would take some time for evaluation, the Avenue B, open, streets, open restaurants or temporary programs.
Is the request to remove parking at the corners to accommodate turning movements for fdny trucks, or just to widen the travel lane for the full block?
I. Do not think the question is right: now, whether we want to pursue 4th street But I think we need the information from D.O.T Thank you with regards to the parking on East, 4Th. Anything will help you know if they could, if D.O.T can remove the parking off the corner.
Well, Dot's response was, at this point, they're not looking to remove parking for open, streets.
Think DOT just can't wait another month and not have responses, because the answer is then less social distancing for people and more risk for health, issues, and People who, like people who walk people, need to use the this open space is a way to for a healthy issue.
You know unless the committee has any reason not to We're, not updating the resolution per se tonight, but we'll have DOT take some of these thoughts back to their colleagues and see how they can work with them, whether it's a loading zone or freeing up fourth street a little bit.
Fdny is now sharing their concerns and some of the creative ideas that came out of last month's transportation committee meeting D.O.T is now saying we're not going to look at elimination of parking.
The number two thing is: we want to make sure we have a pleasant community, And, I, think, ultimately, the goals here of the open streets program and the fdny are in sync.
If there's going to be any investigation about that, then I think you also need to bring in the department of education is not there a school on East 4Th, Street.
What about removing parking on East 6th street is not that, because is not that fdny is using that right.
