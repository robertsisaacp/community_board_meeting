It's specific to agenda item number three findings from the studies of turns and other studies to determine the best route for the fire department, I'm, just reversing the order for tonight and starting with the fire department just for clarity purposes for the public We found a marked improvement in the response pattern, not that it's ideal, but the way it is set up currently from 6th street north to east 14th street I appreciate that david crane committee You are up there gore that thank you around third street I , don't remember if it's one or both of the two blocks at third street and avenue b, they put in a restaurant, only I, don't know the technical word for it, but restaurants know through traffic Does that mean that the fire engine actually has to go over to avenue.
During the open restaurant portion of the week after friday, five to eleven I believe saturday and sunday, twelve noon to 11 pm the restaurant, the groups that run the open restaurants That was a little shaky in the beginning, especially when one of the establishments that was running the restaurant group from second to third street lost their liquor license Another restaurant took up the mantle and, although again like it's not perfect , we when we need to get up the street like us like it's, not it's not ideal, but it's better than it was, and there are times when, if the well they're not going to avenue a specifically, you know there may be times when different responses to different areas require different routes.
A car across the yellow stripe of avenue b That would block any ability until you've got that car moved, but I only saw that once and it was over a month ago, The fire department was going to do what they called turn: studies on 2nd street to turn on avenue b and I wondered if that happened, and my second question is: is the they fire the different battalions or different firehouses?
no know that I mean I know that the open streets program will probably not go that much longer, but I don't know , I, don't think that people are using it so much that we could put people's lives in danger because of any sort of reduced response time or as captain spleen as or chief splain excuse me has explained to us over the past couple of months about the response order as well, which throws things into havoc So I, don't know if either of the representatives here can speak to that, because I mean I think when we had the full meeting in july I want to say you know there was sort of like a life and death description given to us, so I'm still a little worried about that.
We generally like to leave the guidelines up for a little while in case people are joining a call late, so they understand what they need to do, but we will take the guidelines down at seven o'clock that way If anybody wants to speak to any of the agenda items, which would be primarily two and three tonight I'll take a few questions on each of the presentations If anybody actually has a specific question, I know, assemblyman epstein has a question which I'll say that I'll line them up first after I'll line them up at first after the DOT presentation, so dot, jackie lazaro, hi I'm here for jennifer leong I'm, the newest borough, planner of the Manhattan borough commissioner's office, so just to confirm we're discussing the reversal on east second, between avenue, b and avenue c, and the upper part of avenue, b, Okay, so I believe when for the reversal study, what I was told is that it would take some time for an evaluation to go through and on avenue b.
They do have set time so because of that we could not install flexible delineators and then for creating a employee Oh removing parking So. At this point, we're not looking to remove parking for open streets, but just to clarify is this to remove parking on the corners to accommodate the turning moves or just to widen the travel lane for the whole block.
This point we are not looking to remove parking for opening streets to clarify is the request to remove parking at the corners to accommodate turning movements for fdny trucks or just to widen the travel lane for the full block?
Don't think the question is right now, whether we want to pursue 4th street Thank you with regards to the parking on east 4th street Anything will help you know if they could, if dot can remove the parking off the corner.
If we get a vaccine, We have no idea how we're going to respond to the city, state and country and globe, and so we need to be prepared, and that requires DOT to do the appropriate thing and if that requires them turning around at second street or you know that requires turning around street I mean I, don't think I think DOT just can't wait another month and not have responses, because the answer is then less social distancing for people and more risk for health issues and People, who, like people who walk people need to use the this open space is a way to for a healthy issue.
I know I, you know when I walk down avenue, b and I do that almost every day there isn't a time where you know, people with barriers or people try to get I think what we really need to do is have something that's really for emergency vehicles only and for people The dot would work on working with the community, because we see these all over the street, a city where there's real open streets and that accommodates for emergency vehicles, but doesn't accommodate for the community We get a commitment from you to having an appropriate response to the community board next month with real answers of saying, hey, we're not sure, because they may not be around forever, but really studying it and really getting adequate answers to our community?.
I would just like to raise the idea of loading zones on avenue b, I think double parked cars and trucks block traffic, far worse than the barricades and in combination with the barricades.
I am a NYCHA resident We, have a ton of recovery and resiliency work going on with lack of public space as well, so making sure that this program is successful should be a priority All I saw from the public who signed up before 7 o'clock I'm here, both the resident of cv3 and as a member of the los cc, who were responsible for the avenue b, barricade, maintenance and I, mostly the second I think there are two things that are most important Obviously you know fdny has valid concerns about the safety of the street.
