Hmm foreign, you, okay, yeah, hey how's, it going good thanks, so you probably want to make me a co-host. Hi, hey, Alex I, edited that resolution and emailed it yeah I just got it and Megan I sent it to you, so you can pull it off. Yeah hang on a second I'm just going to edit grammatical, edits and one, whereas claus did not have a noun or a verb. Okay, so I guessed, but it could be wrong or what the interpretation, what it's supposed to be saying I, do not think any of any of us like looked at them very carefully. I was like I did not look at the other one, because it's just like a letter to people. Yeah I did not even see that one right, it's fine! It's going to be an interesting meeting: okay, November! Okay! Also! Maybe the therefore clause the first one should not exactly say what it says. Maybe it should say something like that. We support them in doing both at the same time. So doing you know doing both supporting small businesses and continuing to you know, keep everyone safe, because otherwise it reads kind of like a, whereas clause right, sorry, guys I, just wanna. So if I share my screen, how do I get back to where I see all the participants I think you can share yeah at the bottom? Oh you can't. You have to unshare. Okay, oh I, see hold on I, see ac, it's just the three of us right now, anyway, it'll go up to five or six I. Think I see it yeah I've heard about what did you want? October up, oh yeah, I do not know. I was just thinking about something to put up because of I guess for voting. No I do not need that. I could just put the actual agenda up right, I guess so! Yeah I do not actually need to put anything up right now. If I do not want to yeah there, we go hi bruce hi. Are you with d.o.b? No I got an email. I, live in I, live in the district in the Community Board area and was told there might be discussion about amplified sound and I've been struggling with a restaurant. That does a lot of that on the weekends Gotcha thanks for coming sure Anisha. Do you want me to put the agenda up? We can just second actually I think that we'll do our minutes and then we'll have the DOB presentation, so the DOB. Thank you, everybody for joining we'll start in just a minute or two. What a few other folks log on oh clintus on hmm one, two, three four! You know what this does not really help anybody, because it does not give like a nice neat list of the agenda. No, I'm just going to take it off. Yeah, that's just to use for ten minutes really yeah, hi Susan, all right, okay, I think we can do we have a quorum. Let's see two three I think we can go ahead and start in just a second welcome to the November economic development committee meeting. Let's do a couple of housekeeping things. So if you are not a committee member, if you could write your name and affiliation in the chat, so we can have a record of all of the attendance. If you have questions throughout any of the meeting, please use the raise your hand. Button in zoom I do not always see everybody's actual hands if they physically raise their hands. So today we have a couple of things on the agenda, let's see, but we can start with an approval of the minutes from October so megan. If you'd like to do a roll call vote, Anisha Stephen, yes, Megan Joy, yes, Alastair Economicus, yes, Andrea Gordillo, yes, Herman, Hewitt, Herman he's not on Joe kearns. He won't be here tonight: David Louis, yes, Alexandra Militano, yes, Richard, Ropiak, Richard you, there Washington I, do not think Rodney's on you. There, okay, Andrew Comey, I'm here, okay, Richard or rodney. No I do not think they're on. Yet, if they're going to join okay great, so we have a presentation from the department of buildings and then three resolutions tonight. So, let's go ahead and start with Josh Adams from DOB who's, going to speak about winterizing spaces for small businesses and other types of institutions. I guess so I'll hand it over to Josh and Megan Josh had sent over a couple of sort of flyers. If you could pull those up. That would be great thanks good evening everyone Joshua Adams Department of buildings. Can you all hear me well yeah, okay, perfect I'll, just wait for those! If you could I think I spent over two one you can bring up right now is building these bullets in 2020 over 19. You got it so, whilst he's doing that I'll just speak a little bit on the background of it of the of what the department of building says is requiring so, oh perfect, so you could scroll down to overview of a section. Three I apologize overview of planning perfect there we go. Thank you, okay, so so just a little background. So you know really in conjunction with department of Transportation's Open Restaurants program for sidewalk and roadway dining the department, the building's issued of some following guidance on about how owners of restaurants install outdoor heating heat equipment and obtain the required permits and inspections that are necessary to operate natural gas heating and electrical heating in a safe and efficient manner. So what the department buildings has determined is that this installation of electric heaters is allowed on both sidewalks and roadways. Propane heaters and natural gas radiant heaters are allowed only on are allowed on sidewalks only and are prohibited on roadways, so any open flame natural gas here any open flame natural gas seeds are not permitted. The use of propane and natural gas for heating requires a permit from the FDNY as well and propane heating requirements, compliance with FDNY regulations for outdoor use handling and a secure outdoor tank storage, if applicable overnight. Three of these options may be considered for outdoor seating areas within private property as well, provided they comply with the respective requirements outlined in the bulletins 2020 of 19 that you're, seeing here in 2020 of 18, which relates to electrical heating guidance so for business owners. The way they should go about obtaining outdoor heating is the first step they need to do is hire a license for at least for natural gas and propane. We require that business owners hire a licensed master plumber that license Master Plumber is going to go through. Basically, what you see here under the evaluation we're going to determine the number of heaters required based on you know how many or how large the space is for the outdoor seating they're going to inspect the gas system for your building. The licensed master Plumber should determine the system size for your building, based on the capacity that your building can hand withstand, as well as provide safe connections. The license performance determines that safe connections are going to be in place within the for your outdoor heating and space. That's the same with propane as well. You could also scroll down if you do not mind to the next page other safety requirements as well. These refer to like manual shutoff valves and other emergency use and locking systems to ensure that your plumbing fixtures are secure and we're going to determine if the license plate Master Plumber should determine whether flax gas hose connectors are desirable. So this highlighted portions dates under the open restaurants program, flexible gas hose connection may be used to connect the portable outdoor heating unit to the gas outlets. Now your license, Master Plumber, is going to determine what that use is based on what they find when reviewing your plumbing fixtures inside your space before you get outdoor heating scroll down to seven. If you do not mind, this is probably the most relevant portion for a lot of you owners who are planning to do outdoor heating. What the license Master Plumber do is going to do after going through all those steps is they're going to file for plans and permits. So under this open restaurant program, the licensed plumber can follow natural gas heaters with the department through an expedited process. That's called Limited Opera alteration application. Basically, they file this laa through DOB, now build and once they file it, they need to identify and state on the scope that it's for the open restaurants program when they're filing for any natural gas or propane. That's the same for electrical as well, which I'll get to in a few. So after the work is completed, the license Master Plumber must file for inspection to DOB, now inspections and you, if you scroll down a little further. My apologies of course I could scroll it, but access you're going to see a list of go back up. It's right at the top, where the blue text is perfect right at the top. You know once you hire your plumber and they conduct all the necessary work. They need to get the outdoor heating. Then they will send these inspection requests to Manhattan, there's other relevant boroughs as well, but I highlighted my hands since this is CB3 in Manhattan. They need to submit this request to Iman plumbing Ir Buildingsnyc.Gov. Now no gas work can be formed without an approved, laa filing and permit. But gas work can begin once the required permits are obtained and in most instances once they submit this laa request to the department we review it and the permits can be submitted rather quickly or immediately. After all, that is done and the inspections are done. The owner may is permitted to contact Con, Edisonison or the other utility company and have that gas turned on for their outdoor heating use. One other thing that the plumber, as well as the Electrician must make sure is that when they're connecting these flexible hoses from indoor from the indoor plumbing to the outdoor heating fixtures, you need to ensure that there's no tripping hazards when going across the sidewalk. So there needs to be some sort of protective covering. If you could scroll down a little bit, you'll see the section I'm referring to. They need to be make sure that there's some protective covering and that it's not impeding access for individuals using the sidewalk as well. You need to ensure that remains safe and no tripping hazards are in the way you need to. Please note as well that flexible gas hose connectors should not be laid across any bike lane, unless approved otherwise by the Department of Transportation. Now I have provided this building's bulletin in the chat as well. If you can see in the chat in the chat provided the link and right next to natural gas propane for any of you any of you owners who want to pursue natural gas now, if we could go to the next buildings bulletin, which relates to electricity, it's 20 of 18, and we can start that on second page. Can you see the new one? Now yes scroll down? Yes, this is the one thank you scroll down to the next page right at the top, where the highlighted portion is so the same steps pretty much apply for if you're going to pursue electric heating for your outdoor heating, the electrician that you hire will pretty much do the same thing that their plumber is going to do. You're going to determine the number of heaters required that you want to use for your space you're going to perform load calculations within your within your within your space, to ensure that the amount of heaters that you are wanting to to use that the electric load within that building can handle that amount of amount of power. Additionally, Electrician's going to inspect an existing electric system. Now, if there's any instances where they find that, there's other steps you need to take to ensure that your electric system can handle what you're the amount of heaters you want to use, then that's a separate permit. You might have to obtain to get you know the electric system up to date, so the electrician is also going to file permits for the department now with electrical work. The electric work can not be can not begin without the permit being approved, but the electrical work can begin with the requirement once the permit is obtained. Excuse me this section here. Ah, yes, here it is so once the electrician obtains the permits, conducts the words and schedules the inspection for any kind of electrical heaters. To help you save time, the DOB is allowing the installation to be energized and the heaters to be put to use as long as the electrician deems it safe and is for use in advance of a DOB inspection or sign off. So once you, the Electrician, conducts the work for the outdoor heating and they contact the department and request an inspection. You may use those outdoor heaters while waiting the time of waiting for the inspection to occur. Of course, the electrician must determine if it is safe by letting the department know in advance this same thing with temporary cords crossing over the sidewalk. Please ensure that you know these cords are protected, that you have a rubber safety covers, on top to ensure that there's no hanging wires, there's no tripping hazards, they're, not blocking travel lanes and, in addition, they're not blocking bike lanes unless otherwise approved by the Department of transportation. Another issues that you may have questions about, possibly plugging in a electric heater indoors and then taking the cable outdoors. The department is not permitting that the apartment is not permitting any cords shall not be installed through doors, windows or similar openings. So you must hire an electrician to conduct that work, follow up with the depart or up the department conduct the work request, the inspection and after the inspection is performed and approved. You should be good to go to use your electric heaters same with your natural gas and propane heaters as well. I think that's about that is about the majority of it when it comes to requesting natural gas and propane or electric. There are any additional questions. Please. Let me know I'm here for you. Thank you. So much if there are any questions, feel free to raise your hand in like with the zoom feature. If anybody has any questions and oh there are a number of them- susan you're up. First, thank you. So on First Avenue and Second Avenue, we have outdoor street seating on the outside of a bike lane and your instructions say that you know anything running through the bike line has to be approved by D.O.T, but there's no guidelines on what kind of what would be approved by DOT. Is there more information on that because it seems like that's going to be a big issue? It's my understanding that if you are going to be blocking a bike late or if you intend to your space to block a bike lane, then you must contact the ot to request that permission. Now we do not have anything on our end, because D.O.T is mostly the spearhead behind the open restaurants program. The department is really just a regulatory agency to ensure that the natural gas and or that the heating requirements are up to code. Okay, thank you now. As far as there was something I wanted to speak about, I know, there's I do not know if you wanted to discuss it Susan about the any kind of enlargements like the similar restaurants. We were having some talks about so as well. I put the question to Anisha, but that's certainly an an issue that has come up in CB3 about enlargements of restaurants. Are you talking about on the public I'll just clarify so we're talking about these outdoor seating. If you are trying to you know heat your outdoor space, any outdoor seating, if it's going to be connected to the building itself, that would constitute an enlargement right, so any outdoor spaces that are connected to the building to the facade of the building. You would need a separate permit away from these natural gas and propane electric permits that you're requesting here now. That would be some sort of alteration one permit. You know. Excuse me that would require a licensed design professional to hire and submit plans to the department. That would be a much more lengthy request compared to the request here to do flexible lines and electric lines to the outdoor space instead of doing an enlargement yourself. That would that would require a very much more in-depth review. So I mean that's something that you are looking to. Do that's a separate that separate information away from what I'm providing here today. The reason this is coming up is because businesses have done this without permits and you're liable to get huge fines right. Yes, obviously there are fines attached to that for work without a permit. You know it's you know. Obviously you can save yourself a major headache and a lot of time and money as well by just you know, going through this process, ensuring that you have your license: Master, Plumber or Electrician as well, to conduct that work in a safe and proper and up to code manner. Doing the work yourself you know and then of course getting caught would be a much more long process and much more drawn out process and might be would be a much a major headache for yourself to do that. So it's best to just follow these guidelines and just ensure that you're doing it the proper way and ensure that you do not have any violations and keep your restaurant moving along. So we have a number of questions so alistair you're next I. Thank you for the presentation. I have comments as well as kind of questions, my architect, my commercial, tenants, etc have said the DOB has been extremely difficult to deal with because they have moved the entire system to an online process. So getting questions and answers from people that are online is very difficult and very time consuming, and it's not very efficient things that take an extremely long time to get processed I think as far as small businesses go with regards to getting electrical permits or plumbing permit plumbing permits for the gas work I think that's going to be a high barrier for them to do because again, this is this is work. That's eventually really going to be temporary right. A plumbing permits a few thousand dollars an electrical permits, a few thousand dollars, let alone when DOB comes. There may be other issues that come up and I guess you know. Just on the on the on the on the plumbing side, my understanding is to get gas turned on in any type of situation is a long process. It takes a long time to do so, we're going to be in the summer months. If someone really goes through this process from start to finish with 100 percent compliance- that's my guess: I'd love to be proven wrong, I assume with the gas plumbing inspections and here's a question you are going to require the DOB pressure testing, which is at 10 times working pressure back to the back to the meter, usually when people go and test them- and this is why we have all these gas issues everywhere- is when the Ob insists on having the pressure test at 10 times, work in pressure. Things do not hold because they're old and you get a few leaks here and there because you're putting much more pressure into the pipes than the usual working pressure. Do you know if, in this situation, DOB is going to insist on that pressure test that usually causes a lot of problems for a lot of people? Well, I know that we're requiring you know gas, roughing and testing after the perform after the performance of the work as part of the inspection as well as far as the exact pressure test, I'm not a technical person myself, but I would imagine you know we're talking about gas here. So a lot of safety tests would probably be involved with the inspection just to ensure that there's you know no leaks or such yeah, but with either thing is with Con Edison, with carnets involved in dobs, not involved. They test at working pressure for some reason when DOB starts to get involved and it's a different standard. Db is a different standard. They ask a pressure test at 10 times the pressure and that's why the minute DOB gets involved. It becomes a much bigger problem when you're dealing with gas so again I. This is this is I understand this I just do not see small businesses adapting to this, because it's going to be cost prohibitive time prohibitive, and it's going to cause issues both on the electrical side, because the electrical side, a lot of stores, won't have the electrical capacity for the heaters which draw a lot of power, so they'll have to upgrade the electric I do not know if they want to undergo that cost and that lengthy cost and on the plumbings and on the plumbing side. It's just it's it's difficult. Let me ask you another question: can they avoid the DOB testing? If they get propane tanks? Is there are there any permits required for propane we're requiring inspections for both we're finding a licensed master plumber to come in and conduct work for both natural gas and propane, as well as inspections for both gas and propane? You have those heaters that have the propane tank in them is that is that, okay, because that's that does not involve the building per se. Talking about excuse me, you're talking about standalone, combustible, propane that sits under the tent without connecting to any hoses or such correct. That's part of the heating, the heater. Let me double check on that one, because why do not you put your or what the question is standalone propane, right yeah? If that's a way to avoid the plumbing permits, I guess because it's not connected to the building in any way we'll take it down and follow up with you. Thank you, yeah I will I'll follow up yeah. You can send it to me yeah by email or all these questions and I can get answers from them. Yeah, okay, thanks Joshua! So we'll take a couple of committee members questions next Megan and then we'll do Andrew and Alex thanks I mean I. Guess it's just more of a comment, but you know, as a business owner also is incredibly frustrating to hear the mayor, announce that you know we would be able to use propane heaters and electrical heaters through the winter to get us through, and then it comes out with regulations two weeks later. That makes it virtually impossible to use either you know, and in that time period everyone races to get the materials, because there's been a shortage of materials when you've got over 10,000 businesses all doing the exact same thing. There's a shortage on lumber, there's a shortage on plexiglas there's a shortage and roofing. So when they said hey, you can use heaters. Everyone went out and spent thousands of dollars buying propane heaters, which we are now basically not allowed to use, because this rules around the storage of the propane is makes it virtually impossible. It can't be stored inside can't be stored on the sidewalk, can't be left on promise. It's so you know, I appreciate the thought and I think the city's actually jumped through rings to try to make things work for Us restaurants, but I feel like the heating thing is a mess. All of the options are too time-consuming, they're too expensive. For us, we do not have any money right now and the regulations are make it virtually impossible to utilize Andrew. So I have a couple of questions because if you walk the streets of the East village right now, the vast majority of businesses that are winterizing are not following these codes. There are extension cords running out of windows through trees. There are big propane heaters actually in the street, not just on the sidewalk I, I'm sure as I do this for a living that people are not getting using licensed electricians or licensed plumbers. I'm not saying all the businesses, I'm sure there are some businesses, but this is like the wild west out there and they're actually adding permanent structures to the sides of their buildings and, while I appreciate the need for folks to do this as a pedestrian, it's becoming quite hazardous out there with this lack of following these codes, so is DOB in a position to enforce these rules and regulations, because right now most of the businesses I would say that have installed. This stuff are not following these guidelines that you that you've posted up here absolutely the Department department, is required to enforce this I mean any especially if it relates to you know any kinds of enlargements: propane storage, electrical wiring coming out of the building that should not be coming out of the building. Without being you know, without being safely, you know covered because while we obviously want to help businesses, we do not want people sitting in those homemade buildings getting hurt. We do not want people getting shocked. Frankly, we do not want apartment buildings having fires, because old circuit breakers are overloaded. So who do people call if they see these violations so just 311 and report? You know illegal wiring or illegal work like how does this get enforced? Yes, you would want to report it to 311. Additionally, you could also report these issues. You know to your community board, your council member state representative as well. You know send it to 301 if it's a complaint about electrical wiring coming out of the building or propane storage in front of the building or sorry unsafe, propane storage in front of the building. As soon as you submit that through one request and it's received by phone or through the online the department, and if it comes to the department, the department automatically creates an inspection request for that complaint right, I guess. My question, though, is that's relying on residents to make these observations. Some may not be want to do that. So is the department of buildings doing inspections? Are they are they coming out? Are they only going to come out if somebody complains we are. We mostly come out we're very complaint driven agency. As far as like construction sites that are doing like a major construction, we do periodically inspections for those rather active as far as see as far as the issues that you were seeing that we're not knowing about if they did not apply for a permit to conduct that work. You know, then, it's likely that you know we did not have inspectors coming by to see that now, in the event that you see it, you know please report the 301 contact your Community Board Council member's office and have that information come to us, so we may go out there and inspect it to ensure it's safe and ensure that there's, no, you know public or property hazard at that location, and my last question focuses on the attachments or expansion of the buildings they're supposed to post a permit like any other construction if they receive a permit, of course, that goes for electric and plumbing work as well. Oh, it goes for everything correct. If they're doing plumbing work in the space, then that permit must be posted conspicuously either on the front door of the building, it's usually on the front door, but please note that you know if you have a building say just going to come up with some random address here: 15 you know East 3Rd Street and then it goes to 17th, Eastern, Street and there's an aka on 4th street or something like that. The perm, wherever the work is being performed, that's where the permit must be posted. So if the work is happening on 15, East 3Rd street permit must be there, but if there's another entrance in the other side of the building on 4th street, for example, the permit does not need to be posted on that side, because the work is not being performed in that space unless that makes sense, but a kind of work permits must be posted, no matter what, if the, if the work was approved by the department, if it's minor work painting you know, moving off like electrical, you know like outlet covers something like that. You know minor work like that. Those do not require permits and permits do not need to be posted if there is no permit to begin with. All right, alex I was just going to voice the same concerns as Megan and Andrew, in that these seem very complicated for small business owners to be able to comply with, and also like, Andrew I, see already, at least with respect to electrical wiring. It's everywhere, I think Susan mentioned first and second, avenues having bike lanes and I see electrical wiring crossing first and second Avenue. You know to accommodate different uses that may not actually be permitted by DOB or other agencies within these structures and are probably also creating hazards given I doubt that they they're being done with any input from any electricians. But it gives me greater concern that the there's that they may the businesses may resort to trying to winterize their locations, which are just these small for the most part wooden or other. Some other flimsy structure that yes could be susceptible to, creating something that might endanger the people are actually sitting with it within it, and it's they're, tiny and there's not much of an enforcement mechanism other than what the residents on the streets see. You know and report. It seems like. If we're prepared to do this, then we should have a better way of enforcing or policing it or inspecting it. Whether or not it's sort of regular inspections or periodic inspections to ensure that everything is compliant. That's just a concern. I have and a consideration that might be made we're all suffering. We all do not have resources. We all do not have time and we're all struggling to work in ways that if we can't you can even do that, we could not before with you know, limited abilities. So it's not so easy for DOB either I get that so laura you're next and then we'll do olympia and clint thanks I mean I'm from the East Village community coalition, I'm Laura Sewell, and just to explain. We both have had a long history of supporting the local independent businesses in the east, village and residents of the east village, so I mean just to follow up on. What's already been said, I'm taking notes to give this information and move forward the circulate the the materials that you shared with. You know our local merchant groups, because they're mostly running their restaurants right now, but I'm I am very concerned about the enforcement we've had you know the open restaurants programs been running for months now, and we already have en enforcement difficulty with the existing structures, the summer temporary structures and now we've had a pretty cold couple of months, and a lot of our merchants are just enclosing these temporary spaces even further to the point where they're practic, like what's the difference between being in there and being indoors, except that you can't get out, there's not a means of egress from inside the corral. So and I have seen the same thing that has been mentioned. I have seen the kerosene heaters that look like a lamp on the sidewalks right. Next to these, so I do not know what the solution is, but it seems that a complaint driven enforcement which relies on residents to complain against their neighboring businesses that are struggling, is, you know, really far from ideal I wish we could and there's no places that do not apply for a permit are not inspected and it's really hard to get them inspected, because they're, not part of the program, so I do not know what solutions and I think second Alex's acknowledgement that the city is responding to a very challenging time and everyone's stretching beyond what they normally would operate. But what else could we do? I know D.O.T, went out and looked at every restaurant at first and not just post permit. They were. They were involved in the process and I think if that did help some things were being derailed, but they can't keep that up so I and how is DLB working with DOT. Sorry I know that's a lot, but that's what I'm being asked. So even restaurants that are not involved in the open restaurant program. Department of buildings can inspect any building within the city. It does not matter if it's part of the open restaurants program or not. You know if there's an you know, if there's a an issue or a concern that location and the department can go out and inspect initial violations, if warranted, of course, as far as our steps now, when we issue these locations permits any location that really has permits, the department does do periodic inspections like compliance inspections, tenant protection plan inspections, something along those. You know we conduct these inspections periodically as long as the permit is in place now. Sorry, the last question that you asked Laura trying to recall in D.O.T howard. How are we working together so D.O.T like as I mentioned earlier, small business services as well I believe, is involved they're, the main forefront of the open restaurants program, they're handling it as far as DOB. You know, you said our side is the regulatory efforts. Now we do mean in contact in terms of like. If we receive complaints about you know, a space, DOB or DOT may send something over to the DOB, a referral for us to go and inspect that. For that request, any issues that you see for DOT expect that you send it to D.O.T, but the department of buildings also can refer cases to D.O.T as well, for example, issues where you would suggest already stated: wiring crossing the street or temporary structures crossing into the street, or maybe there's a temporary structure that crosses into the street or into the sidewalk and is also connected to the building, DOB and ut the inspection for this space, but as far as actually the program itself, the open restaurants program, that is a DOT program. The Ob is the regulatory enforcement agency to ensure that all the requirements to obtain heating you or through the sidewalk and out of the building is maintained safe and this code is up to code. Sorry, thank you and I. Get that the gas and the electric is you guys it will you will there be like a cure period or something before people are fined, or how does that? Oh, you mean once they obtain a violation if they conduct your work depends if it's a class one violation which means that it's immediately hazardous violation, it needs to be corrected. You know immediately. Forthwith is what our code was stated. Those do not those do not have a cure date. Those were required to be fixed immediately. Additionally, you must also obtain go to the oath hearing at Oath Court class. Two and three both have cures, but that's going to be dependent upon the inspector's findings based on you know what big that is to cure the violation, okay and for just for residents and for businesses, I get the gas and the propane and the permitting the electric permitting process, but if people are just building like a more permanent structure with an eye toward winterizing who is overseeing, that work is that both agencies, if they're building it so the outdoor seating itself, those little wooden like structures that you see that are like kind of in the roadway they do not take permits from the department to build that little Hut right now they connect that space to the building right. That's an enlargement. Okay! That's an enlargement. Additionally I believe that's crossing over the sidewalk and probably blocking a portion of the sidewalk as well. Now, that's probably something that the inspector's going to have to find once they go out. If it's connected to the building, the structure is connected, that's that'll be work without a permit. That's not a that's! Not what the open restaurants program was digested. Thank you. That was very helpful. Thank you yeah, so we'll go to olympia and then clint in the there are still quite a number of hands up. So in the essence of time, if we could, you know limit the number of questions asked, we can send anything to Joshua. After also are you? What is your role at DOB? Sorry, I missed the beginning of the meeting. Oh I'm sorry, I probably should have you know what I jumped right in Joshua, Adams I work for community engagement and programming, so external affairs great, because- and you just said that if this little structure is not connected to the building, the op does not does not have any role. The structure itself for the open restaurants program. They're getting permits from the Department of Transportation, okay, hey roadway is D-O-T d-o-b. We have meats and bounds of the property, so everything from everything around the building itself, the meats and bounds of that property line department building now connecting anything from the building to the outdoor seating. We have a we so I know because I know. Anissa wants us to run quickly. Basically, my concern, I'm not sure, then it is a dop issue because it has to do with the sidewalk structures and the fact that two days ago, when it was very windy on Avenue B, actually a piece of like wooden like Wall fell next to me and a roof was also tilting and breaking up and down of these flexi structures, because they're not fixed and the second concern that I have that. Maybe somebody else alluded to earlier, but they did not I think stated. Clearly is a public health concern because it is becoming windy and cold they're going against the very idea of why we have these sets out there they're enclosing it completely. So there is no air circulation within those cubicles, and so this is going to be festering for coffee 19, and so this is, you know, very worrisome, so the and you know I have ideas about how we could avoid both issuing too many. You know tickets to these poor people who are trying to make a living, but without jeopardizing public health- and you know nearby residents and people walking by, but it definitely that's why I ask you: what is your role? I? Think? It's probably there should be a decision above the Ob about you know putting resources available to people to prevent this. It can not be complaint driven, otherwise we're going to have horrible incidents. If that's the way you Wanna go about that, but I do not think it's your purview, but so basically the concerns that I have for the temporary structures you are saying is under Dod purview. Not DOB right is that temporary structures in the street. Yes, you see that temporary structure has wires coming from it and the complaint is about wiring plumbing Hdlb. Okay, if it's connected to the building like a enlargement as I mentioned, then it's us and dlt2, because they're both playable there. Okay, thank you and then connected all right. Clint has had his hand up for a while, so Clinton and Susan I just have two quick, hopefully simple questions. I know you mentioned and I saw it listed in the bulletin. I have not had a chance to go back and read it thoroughly about wires for cords for the heating being extended over the sidewalk over the right of way. Is that only apply to heating or, for example, if they do not have a heater in their street seating, but they have lights and they have a cable. A cord running over the sidewalk to their street seating structure is that does that fall under all of these electrical requirements, or can that be out their window across the sidewalk? No, it needs to be covered, can't be a tripping hazard can't be hanging up in the air that needs to be safely secured. We're talking about electrical lines. So, if they're going to connect any electrical lines to that outdoor seating, it needs to be covered along the sidewalk with those rubber coverings that I mentioned right. You can't just have wires coming out of the windows yeah no over the place. Okay, because I've seen you know, I do see that a lot of them have. You know just for lighting, even knotting for a heater, so I just wanted to clarify if that was still applies to just lights or heating, but to anything with electric is basically what you're saying: yeah that's going on now: send it in for a three-on-one inspection or leave it with CB3 and I'll schedule, something for it. Okay, the only other question I had was. There was a listing on your on the heating side, with the propane that open flames are not permitted. I've seen a lot around this neighborhood and in some other neighborhoods they're, those torch-like things, picky torches, no they're, not tiki torches, they're, actually I, think propane on the bottom, but they have a large flame. That's about three feet: high, that's kind of in a pyramid shape. Are those permitted I think some I've seen some of them that are, that top is enclosed in glass and I've seen a couple that it's just open? Are those permitted or is that prohibited? If it's open flame? It's not going to be permitted, as stated now leave this address with this location with us. So we can take a look into it and leave that question with them, because that I'm not too sure exactly what you're referring to I may have not seen it specifically but leave it with us. We'll take a look at it and see if it's permitted or not it's sort of similar, probably to the freestanding propane, but we're talking about open flame or is it a security casing I think there's possible that there's two different but we'll send you more information, we'll take a look and I'll follow up with the Community Board Cool Susan, okay, I just wanted in response to some of the questions. As far as complaints, the Community Board office, along with the council office, we work with Josh several times a week. So if you have a complaint, please let us know and we discuss it and follow up. People are very frustrated with D.O.T. Not inspecting DOB is inspecting. The process takes too long because once they give a summons, the person is allowed to continue until there's a hearing, but that all happens I mean it all happens within a month. So we do get actual inspections on all of that. I think that was the main thing I wanted to say, and this is not just you know, resident complaints, I mean Alistair will tell you, we talk, we work with landlords, we work with the businesses when they are having trouble getting the inspections and alistar is referring to the long time for these inspections. This process is expedited. I do not know how well it'll be expedited, but it is expedited from the normal process. That's it! Thank you. Okay, we'll do the last three questions: Alistair Andrea and then Andrew, so Alistair you're up thanks, sorry, quick question: this is a this potential. This maybe could be answered by Susan. Not sure is it if we, if DOB starts finding every single small business, that's got a wire hanging out incorrectly because they did not know any better you're really going to have a shutdown of the businesses they're struggling they're having a really hard time and that's just going to be the nail in the coffin. Is there a way to, instead of issuing them a monetary fine to give them an initial warning, a warning which I think there was a program like that for a while where they have. You know it's listen. If you do not correct this, if you do not get a permit, you then will be. You will be fined. So at least it puts the business on notice and then you know they have to comply or fix the situation or then they get fined, because if we start finding them now, I think it's just going to be extremely difficult for them. So just give them a little bit of room to understand what the and again these rules are just rolling out non-stop and it's very difficult for them to understand them to comply with them, especially the mom and pops. So DOB does not issue fines. Dob gives a summons, it goes to oath, which they are willing to also come, and talk to the group and oath is really trying to work with businesses. Andrea. Thank you, Josh for your presentation. Much appreciated, I just have a quick question. Well, two quick questions. I was not able to see the link that you sent because I got here a couple minutes late, so if you could just resend it so I can have I can just have reference to it and then my second question was about just if I realized in order to get this permit, it's kind of done through the open restaurants program. I'm just wondering you know, would this be useful to or is it even possible for, like retail businesses or non-profits who operate sidewalk spaces courtyards? That sort of thing yeah just wondering if they could go through the licensing? This way, as far as far as I know it's for restaurants, that's what we're referred to as, if they're going to expedite it. That's why they we ask that they say it's for the open restaurants program. Otherwise, it's a separate request. For example, it's probably it's not going to go to the open restaurants program. If it's not a restaurant itself like a private retail space, they would probably have to go through the normal process of submitting a request and then submitting an inspection. I just sent the links in into the chat, so you should see those as well, but if you know a retail space is trying to use the sidewalk, they would probably have to go through a separate, permitting process away from open restaurants program. This is for restaurants, specifically andrew, so the other thing that we're seeing is the use of spaces in the back of buildings, spaces that are not approved for eating or drinking or occupancy, and are supposed to be for fire egress, and certainly they were never used before, because restaurants could not get liquor licenses for them, but we're seeing people just plop tables and chairs and stuff back there. So is that allowable or is that also a they have to apply and get a certificate of occupancy to use the space and make sure that this is not blocked, etc. I think we had this issue come up the beginning, when the mayor's, when that earlier Mayor's executive order, had allowed restaurant to use outdoor spaces, where you know if they had them available to use them to allow the restaurants to you, know to open our code specifies that you know if it's a mixed-use building and we have a restaurant on the first floor and tenants on the second floor and above that, the rear yard is supposed to be used for the tenants now, unless otherwise specified by a certificate of occupancy or a letter of no objection from the department as far as them, using the rear space I believe the mayor's executive order may have superseded that, but I need to double check. I do not want to like. Let me follow up on that one, because I believe that we were allowing that the mayor's disabled allows them to use the rear yard space. But if it's, if it's, if it's inhibiting these are tenements, where you're supposed to be able to come down the fire escape and use that as your blocking fire escape your egressed or anything like that, we would go out and inspect an issue of violation for that of refuge. Right they're supposed to be places you come down and then you stay safely, which you can't do if there's tables and chairs and structures and heaters and all that other stuff right. Let me let me double check anything. That's blocking egress routes of egress fire escapes that is not permitted. Does it matter if it's removed or if we have these open restaurants or not, you can't block egress. You can't block safe routes, so anything like that. You let us know, report it and we'll go out and inspect it, but I will double check on rear yard. Use I have to confirm that if the mayor's executive order, if that's the guideline, that's still committed to use the right yard, because I know they're allowing spaces so but I'll double check and follow up with Susan all right cool. So those were all of the questions. We appreciate you coming to talk to us and we will follow up with some of the questions that came up tonight. Thank you, of course, anytime cool. Thank you! So let's go ahead and move on in the agenda. There are three resolutions, the maybe we should work on the economic development resolution. There are two arts and culture ones also because that is most directly tied to this specific issue of weatherization, so megan. If you want to bring up that resolution, that would be great and I sent you. The one alex already had made some changes so, and I'd also like to thank you, know: Andrea helped, draft this resolution and brought this sort of issue up to the committee. So thank you for proposing it. Sorry just give me one minute: can you all see that now we can but I sent in your email, alec I forwarded Alex's I thought that was it sorry comments good evening. It was the last email that you sent me. Yes, oh okay, sorry I got it. I got it now: okay, cool, okay! We good! Yes! So would it be helpful if I read it with the changes or if there are any sort of changes off the bat that people have feel free to raise your hand? But it's support for grants for small businesses to winterize outdoor spaces, whereas small businesses make up significant. A significant portion of the Manhattan CB3 economy employ a large number of workers and immigrant workers and remain vulnerable to a new wave of impacts from the Kopit-19 pandemic and whereas community board 3 recognizes the recent efforts of the City, Council and Mayor's office to rescue small businesses and provide economic stimulus through the open restaurants and open store fronts program, and also by approving and providing guidance about outdoor heating to continue these programs through the winter and whereas recognizing that, in addition to restaurants and stores, local nonprofits and cultural institutions, many of whom operate outdoor spaces also add to the economic, social and cultural well-being of our community and whereas federal relief for states, municipalities and small businesses. Small businesses and workers are unlikely to become available in time to address the impact of winter weather. Now, therefore, be it resolved that community board 3 supports measures by the city and City Council, as well as by local associations, to sustain small businesses and protect the public from the spread of Covid-19 and therefore be it resolved that community board 3 requests that small business services SBS optimize, the PPE plus free opening supplies marketplace to include outdoor heating devices such as propane electrical and solar devices, and support grants for such supplies. Olympia. So is there a reason for which you want to limit the grants only to weatherization what, if they want to upgrade the structural quality of these things that fly in the wind I would extend the grant to you know this structural and weatherization and improvements of these temporary facilities pavilions whatever you call them. Yeah I think that, if is there a specific language that you would like to include, it's the first time I see the razor, but I can say therefore period dissolve that community por 3 requests that small business services SBS optimize, the PPE reopening the to include outdoor heating devices such as propane, electric and weatherization materials, or we could say, and support grants for such supplies, as well as for structural upgrades to the pavilion, do you call them pavilions? Do they have a name of these things, as well as structural upgrades to the temporary structures, the curb structures, temporary, curb structures? You can call them okay out, maybe outdoor dining areas, no I, think the temporary curb structures is good temporary. So this way they can use it, for whatever makes more sense for them. Yeah I think that is a good point because get rid of the stripe first structural, as well as upgrade structure yeah, or upgrade this basically by structural. We want to say this solidity: what do we call it like the sound, the quality firmness? Why limited to that? Why not just say and support grants for such supplies, as well as the construction of temporary, curb structures, so just put a qualifier like of high quality. You know or like something like that. You know like structurally sound, because these things are unsound. What is out there right now and support grants? I know you're, trying to say olympia like to increase the structural vitality or what's the word like safety is what you're about integrity. That's a good word who said that Andrea, okay, you support grants, first, spies as well as how did you say it andrew? We could use well I. My point is that you're yeah I think clint with stability and safety. This is not just about fixing existing structures and making them safer, because somebody may not have even built a structure. Yet it's about allowing the grants to be built to use to be yeah to build safe. What did what did clint say? Stability and safety safe and stable, temporary curb structure sounds perfect, as well as to construct safe and stable and stable temporary, curb structures. Perfect. Thank you. Olympia. I've really added in there as well to construct and maintain safety. Yeah, that's good! Thank you guys! Okay, are there any other comments or questions about this yeah I have a comment: I'm not opposed to the last, whereas clause, the second to last one about local, nonprofits and cultural institutions, but it's kind of like a non-sequitur in the middle of the resolution, so I feel like it has. There has to be something to link it to the therefore clauses like why we're mentioning it well, I think yeah I mean I'm with you, but kind of what's happened. Recently. Is this out. You know the use of the street space has been extended to not just restaurants, but now to store fronts of all types and and also to you, know, non-profits or you know it's whatever you want. You could put out there now you won't, you know, sell shirts out there. You could sell shirts out there well, I, guess that's sort of covered in the open storefronts in the, whereas, above that, these grants or support, or whatever is applicable to like anything in either of these programs I. Suppose it's not clear, though yeah. That's why it just looks like it does not fit into the rest of the resolution it could it just does not look like it's attached to anything in particular and I mean I think what anissa is saying is that because the open storefronts applies to everything else, that's how it is connected. What would you like Alex to make the connection more clearer? Would you like us to repeat that the open storefronts extends the privileges that currently are for outdoor dining to different kind of entities? Maybe we can add something that's like, whereas, like CB3 has a plethora of these, you know because I think I think you're right, Alex I seek kind of comes out of left field. It's like! Oh, why are we talking about local nonprofits and cultural institutions? All of a sudden, maybe you could say because cv CB3 has such a concentration of local nonprofits and cultural institutions, and we want to pay as extra attention to them. Well, that's a separate idea, but that's also a good idea. The other resolution. Okay, you I suppose you could just write at the end in the therefore be it resolved or further resolved small business service. Optimizing for you know for all small businesses, including restaurants, retail stores, local nonprofits, as well as cultural institutions, restaurants, retail stores and what else as well as local, nonprofits and cultural institutions right, because that's really, why you? What you want, you want continued support for and or support for all of them. Yeah! That's the reason for including it are there any other further comments. I can read it one more time if people would like or Charles brought up a point in the chat as to whether these grants would be retroactive. I mean I. Do not I do not know if that's something we should discuss, but I think it's reasonable to just ask or just add a clause about about perhaps them being Retro retroactive and like on a reimbursement basis that might I've heard from I've heard from the city that you know, or I've kind of I feel through different zooms. I've heard this that, yes, we're going to be allowed to do these things continue continually, but that the rules and the regulations around them are going to change so like do not go spending a fortune on what you're putting up this winter, because very likely the regulations are going to change, come springtime again so, which is I, think why some of these things are looking pretty flimsy. So I guess my point is even if we can't get reimbursed for what we've already spent on the outdoor dining there's, certainly going to be more money that we have to spend in the future. That also I think that I think the maintain safe and stable temporary curb structures might answer the question, because that leaves open, hey I, built this structure, but I need to fix it, etc or I need to stabilize it some more and that would the money would be allowed to do that. It's not going to pay for that. First piece of plywood you bought, but it might pay for the fifth piece of plywood to make sure your structure does not fall over. So that's I think the last I think that therefore be it resolved that we put in would allow businesses to apply in some ways for to solidify their structures, etc. Might not pay for what they already built, but it would certainly pay to make what they built safer and all right, any other comments or questions on this one cool. Do we want to approve of this now or do you want to approve them all at the end, any preferences? Let's go. It now motion to approve sorry, a second that yeah okay, so someone should say all those in favor right or are you going to do it all called no Paul, sorry, guys? Okay, how many devices open Anisha Stephen? Yes, Megan, troy, yes, Aleister Economicus, yes, Andrea Gordillo, yes, Herman, Hewitt, David, Louis, yes, Richard, ropiak, that here Rodney Washington out here and Andrew, Comey, Yes and Joe Kearns is not here right. Yeah he's not here: okay, cool! Let's move on to the arts and culture, ones and I know: olympia has to leave fairly soon, so I do not remember which one is first, but let's do I think the first one is going to be easy. I do not expect anybody to has questions. It's. The second and you told me, people had some questions yeah, but I. Think Carolyn is here, but I do not see her anymore. Oh no she's! Here Megan. Do you want to pull those up? Sorry guys I have to leave because of my kids. Can you guys see those now? It's still the old ones, that's the old one. You might want to stop sharing the screen and then share it again or it's the economic development one. Oh, it was okay, sorry, okay, energy, okay, so there are two resolutions carolyn from Carolyn and her committee. So Carolyn would you like to discuss them? Yes, okay resolution to request city agencies, including DCLA, DOT, DYCD, DSNY, DOE and parks to increase funding opportunities in the current budget for artists and arts organizations, whereas arts and culture sector has experienced extensive damage from the paws program enacted by New. York state is the necessary response to Covid-19 and whereas approximately 70 percent of the arts community has had their funding cut according to Senator Jose Serrano, who chairs the Cultural Committee in the assembly, whereas many gig economy, artists and cultural producers had no income since March and were not able to access unemployment benefits for months and whereas the prospects of new commissions and projects or non-existence since theaters venues and all live performance initiatives are indefinitely shuttered and whereas the economic hit, the parts and cultural sector is receiving, will last three to five years, depending on sector specificities and whereas artists and cultural workers are the creative capital of New York and are integral to the creative industry capital that fueled New, York's tourism and export economy for years. Therefore, in order to assuage the damage to the visual and performing arts industry, we request that the city create WPA style programs to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as impacted by arts and cultural as the impacted arts and cultural industries rebounds. So carolyn I just raised my hand, because I think the title should be more similar to the therefore I think otherwise, general grants can be confusing, because we're talking for something very specific and also I would add we somehow in the back and forth. Maybe it go away the mom, the mayors of media and entertainment should be along with DCLA and the other agencies. I'm sorry, I did not understand what you just said: olympia at the end, so there is one agency to add mom and then I was saying that the title of the reso is more generic than the actual. Therefore, and I think it should reflect instead of general funding opportunities use, you know launching a WPA style employment program. Do you want to use that in the title? Yes, because otherwise they do not correspond right. It's two very different things. Sorry I thought we're not going to discuss this series, but then I create discussion. Sorry you to request that the city initiate a WPA style program as well as have city agencies, including to increase funding opportunities. That sounds good. Go ahead, Carolyn, one more time to request New York City, to institute a WPA style program to employ artists. All right and I have a question for Susan and other experienced members. Can we direct it to New York, City and state, because I actually know that there are three senators right now in New York state that are spare heading an initiative at the state level? Can we direct it to both New York, City and New York state? What I would do is I ordinarily I would do it separately, but under well. It's different agencies, so you I would not, because this is this is directed to specific city agencies that do not correspond. So I would do maybe a very similar one to your state legislators. Great okay am I, erasing the original title, not totally because we still want them to include you know and to request city agents to get rid of resolution in front of to request city agencies and just have requests and requests to the agencies, including those agencies. No, you do not want to get rid of the request, just resolution to and to request and I. Think Olympia wanted to include mom in that list. All right, alistair leave your hand up. Sure thanks, I have a few a few questions on this one, the second, whereas I'm just curious what what the reason was that they could not access unemployment benefits for months on the fifth, whereas one, two three four five: how do we know that the that this is going to last three to five years, we're kind of in uncharted territory? So I'm not sure if someone how that number came about and then on the last. Whereas can we track the language there that we used in the district needs statement because I know we discussed export economy and creative industry, capital and I think we came up with some better terminology that we could track from the from the district green statement. That was those are my three questions to be honest, that, in my opinion, the last, whereas could also just go away. We do not need it I, I'm not so insecure that I with we need that. But you know I defer to the other people here. I do not think it's important to the question that you made about. So there are the reason people did not qualify. I mean I, do not know if you currently wanted to take the question, but the reason for which people did not qualify about unemployment benefits is because there is a huge problem when you are a 1099 worker to figure out how to qualify, and many of them were also cast economy workers and they never qualified, not to mention. If you're a dreamer, you did not qualify, and so should we change it. Then we're not able to qualify for unemployment benefits because the way it reads now it sounds they had access to unemployment benefits, but it took them months to get them because both of these instances happened. So basically it has been both of these things. I mean to be honest, it has been really horrible, plus those who did eventually access them, then hands unemployment benefits, as you probably already know, expired in July and like artists got as little as 19 a week like. If you do not have the extra 600 weekly, you can't pay anything because of the way the you know. 1099 things work, and so so the reality is that the people are facing destitution and the majority of them have left already in the city like a lot of them. Are you know, I know, I, know apartments everywhere, I know everybody you want to say, do not or do not qualify for them for month. It's fine, yeah and Carolyn argue okay. If we take out the last, whereas because we do not need it, I mean I. Think our case is strong enough. Without that part, I do not know. I mean that was originally your input. So if you want to take it out then well, my only thing is: did not we just rename the resolution to match that last. Therefore, yes, so I mean above it, whereas above it that we're talking, because Alistair said you know that expert economy was weird. That sentence right. No I know they dealt with that at the last meeting. With the district nate statement, yeah right I was just going to say: if you have it in there just track the language and the district needs things one or the other, because we I think created slightly better language and then sorry, Olympia or Carolyn. Why is it three to five years like? How do we know it's not, and how do we know it's not two. It's no I mean the thing. Is it's the you can take it out and say it's going to be long term, but there are studies both for the Americans for the arts, brookings institution and locally from the center for urban future, because the you know the heat that the industry has taken. It is so radical, I mean a lot of them, have completely gone out of business, though studies, then so then we yeah, we should cite them because it's just coming up number three but I think I think what we should. What we could say just to you know finish relatively quickly. I would say we know this is going to be long-term impact. It's going to take a lot. You know it's going to take a long time to recover, because even if it reopens it, it's not going to be day one every you know. Tiny venue and theater will be able to have a full-blown and deploy everybody back yeah and honestly it could be longer than five years. Yes, so we can say long-term impact, but there are the studies that they've done so far that I had read. They had those ranges, you know no I, believe them totally, no I believe it. But then we try to cite the studies yeah or just mention long term. That's all! Thank you guys. Okay, are there any other final sort of comments on this and then I guess we'll take out that last, whereas is sort of where we are okay, I have not crossed I'll. Just take it out right. Okay, we can vote on these two together. Maybe let's go since Olympia has to go. Let's go on to the next one. It might just be in that document. I do not think it was. Let me just put that's I think I might only have one of them. Oh, can I not put both in I. Do not think so. Let me let me look one more time. Sorry, as Megan's looking can someone just mention or just discuss what the outdoor I do not know for the outdoor performances, but I'm just worried about the community coming back and saying things are too noisy at night and I know nothing about it. Can you what kind of outdoor performances? Where are the time constraints you know? Does this mean restaurants will have bands? Are you asking what is the legislation by Council member Jimmy, Van Brien yeah, just a little I have no idea what it is. Just I would I put you the number of the legislation in the in the chat and I will try to find the actual language from the register. Here it is I attached the legislation, I pasted, the legislation, okay, Carolyn or olympia well, I think that one, the city is still going to hold outdoor performances to the same guidelines that it has about noise that it presently has at this point in time that there would have to be a permit applied for I, can't see them totally. Relaxing that and I think that most cultural institutions would be sensitive to the fact that they would be very grateful that they were able to perform in outdoor spaces and that they would not want to create a thing that would totally annoy their neighbors to the point that they would be filing complaints which people do about the noise quite frequently. You know it depends on the type and quality of the performance. Acoustic music is less annoying than amplified sound. Usually there are different ways that performers can produce something that is not as intrusive but is still effective. So I do not see how you know if they're, following the same guidelines that we've always had about sound, then they're going to have to stick to that is you know not relaxing those guidelines. Susan has her hand raised. Do you want me at this point to talk about how the office has been involved in this issue? Okay, so I have mentioned, I. Think the last two community board meetings and exec meetings that the biggest complaint that we are getting right now is about particularly music with the out associated with the outdoor dining. It is not always with the businesses. There's a lot of roving bands, so incidental music, that is not amplified, is already allowed. It was not in the beginning, but restaurants are now allowed to have like say this incidental music, that's not amplified, so the issue is a permit for amplified music. None of that is being enforced right now. There are constant both roving bands and bands associated with restaurants and just speakers, and it's I agree with carolyn. If people you know were careful about, it would not be an issue, but unfortunately that's not what's happening, and there are there are I'm just going to say, constant complaints that we can not get enforced. The police are not enforcing, there's, basically very little enforcement around open restaurants because everybody all the agencies are being very sensitive to businesses being fined and going out of business. So it's created this kind of very strange situation, but I just want to report and I think there are people here that probably want to speak to it, but the office's experience and other community boards. This comes up at bureau, service, cabinet meeting and many meetings on how to deal with this issue because it it's unfortunately already an issue hey it's just the experience that I've had in dealing with outdoor performances in the past, particularly in the plaza with the performance festival. Even you know the if you're a non-profit, you're generally sensitive about getting tickets and also about your neighbors calling in complaints. Community people go to the precinct to various and sundry other city agencies and I. Think that there's a difference between arts organizations performing arts organizations producing events and that you would grant them some sort of thing. You know that that they would be cognizant of their neighbors and the fact that neighbors will file complaints if they feel like it's out of hand. If they do there's two issues here: legally they're not going to do one thing for arts organizations. If they have a permit, it's a permit. People can apply for right, yeah and there already are complaints. I mean you complained to me a few weeks ago about it illegal. It was illegal, but it was not enforced and the police would not enforce it and that police told me that they had a permit. They did not have a permit, though they were lying, no I know, but obviously they had a friend somewhere. They did not. So what I'm saying is, unfortunately, that you've been aware of the situation too, because we worked on it together. Unfortunately, this is what the situation is. I agree with you: I wish it were different, but this is what is existing now I think if there were real parameters that really were enforced, it might be a very different situation, but this is unfortunately, what's existing. Now yeah I think that you know there could be parameters put place in terms of time frames that people are allowed to do it that it's. You know the restrictions on amplified sound and how that's thought about so I mean performing. Arts needs a place to be able to perform, and you know fab is coming up with a thing on November the 14th, where the performing arts organizations on 4th, Street and other members of Fab are applying to produce events. That would be outdoors or be able to be seen from the street because I see there are three people who have right: hands: okay, yeah, do you Wanna, hear all three all the three people questions and then maybe we can address everything together, because I really need to go. Thank you so, let's say Andrew, then Alex, then clint, Andrew, yeah, so I would be uncomfortable, supporting a blanket resolution to a loud amplified. Sound I mean we've had all kinds of problems with the park, and things happening: random parties, clubs, musical performances in the park through all hours of the night. If these were permitted, regulated a legitimate arts organization wanting to do something on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon, or something like that. It makes sense to me, but just supporting something that allows amplified sound, that I, unfortunately I could not I would not be in support of that. Based on what's been what's been happening around the neighborhood right now, I'm Alex I agree with Andrew I agree with Susan. It's you know it's an existing problem and a lot of it is left to like the Community Board office to struggle with and try to work with the other agencies to address and I. Think that if we wanted to support something like this, we should really create a guidelines for how it would work like how we think it should work. Rather than doing what Andrew was said, he was opposed to which is sort of just a generalized support for outdoor music, as it is now there are. You know you do have to. If you're going to follow the law, you do have to get a permit and there are specified hours that you can play, but exactly what Susan said is happening, which is that businesses are either allowing musicians in who are amplifying their sound or playing acapella, but are playing. Some of them are coming with pianos, which we've seen right. They may be roving musicians, they may be outdoors doing it, but they may also be just going from business to business, and then businesses are also employing them. You know, which is great, that they're employed they're trying to employ people in the arts communities, but there it's creating a whole host of complaints regarding noise, because they're not employing them to stand in the back of their business, and let this you know the sound travel out to the outdoor seating in the front they're employing them so that they're standing basically on the edge of the open storefront on the sidewalk. With their musical instruments and the amplification, so it's all basically outdoors if it's not actually outdoors, so we just have to think this through in a way that to establish whether or not we can support it and support it with specific asks and I am very much in support of trying to get this like this, the arts community are really struggling to try to help them. You know revitalize their professions because they have really I feel felt fallen by the wayside in this whole pandemic. In terms of support and assistance, I agree I'd like to make a comment: I think one. Let's just hear also from clint, he was in line and then we can answer to everybody together sounds good yeah, we'll do cleanse, and then one of the things I would also ask. Is in the legislation. Are there parameters that Jimmy Van Bramer has yeah I mean I? Think there is a little bit of misinformation here about this resolution, but that's why I wanted to hear from everybody and then answer to everybody's concern together, because the reason you see all these illegal things is because there is no legal way of doing it, and so, as long as they have bla bands like there is a legal ban on any kind of ticketed performance. Then you're going to be harassed by those people who are exploiting good artists who are going to do it for pennies, because it's illegal and they're going to not respect any rules of safety, even the safety of the artist right, because our concern is also about artists, putting themselves in Han's way in order to make a back in a gig, because the gigs that pay are not allowed anymore and so right now. What is happening is completely. You know, unethical because they have single-handedly taken out their performance out from the equation for the past summer, a moment that every european city had outdoor performance safely done. You know so I think what these legislations are going to ultimately do is address your concerns because they will have to have a framework they will have to have guidelines, etc. Now the issue of enforcement, I think, is a bigger issue, as we heard also earlier with DOB. However, I think Carolyn's point about the fact that these are going to be lifelines for important local nonprofit cultural organizations, theaters venues etc. These are not. You know, speculative outsiders. These are people that make our community and are right now denied an opportunity to pay even they're not going to make any money, but at least to put up a performance and pay out of the tickets. These artists, that they are partners, olympia I, do not think anybody's disagreeing with that. I'm certainly not, but if we want something and I do not think we have the time to do it tonight, we should really, as Alex said, lay this all out and specify what we're in support of, because what this resolution does. It basically creates a free-for-all and allows anybody to do kind of whatever they want and I'm not sure I think that, first and foremost, you just stated that you wanted clint to be able to speak. Okay and that's been totally overlooked, yeah. So, let's let clint speak yes, I think that would be appreciated. I just had a quick clarification, and maybe Susan can answer this as well. I know Susan, it has changed to allow music incidental to the operation. Is that does that include? Live music live performances? Would that be? You know a staged like a small play or something like that is or is it just music pipe through speakers? What is the clarification of that? What's currently allowed? Okay, so speakers are amplified so that that's not allowed it's a business if a business like some of ours, I'm thinking of one on St Marks, if a business as a method of their operation has live music, they are allowed to have lies music, it's at you know, background level and it's not amplified, but if I could just say and I think what Olympia and Carolyn are saying is that there's a lot of misinformation and I think we are all I? Think it's not. The reso is not specific, because I want to say. Historically, we do not have complaints about like block parties like theater for the new city or fourth street arts block when they have block parties and they have performances. We do not have complaints about those kinds of things. What we're talking about is the stuff that is all over the sidewalks and what the other thing that I have wanted to say is the way the discussion has been going is if the only type of performance you're considering are musicians, okay and I think that what it applies to is also acting. Performances plays poetry that could be done. I mean that's basically, my understanding of what fourth street's arts block is planning on the 14th. It's not just having bands up and down the street or in restaurants. So it's like there are a variety of things and that need to be considered and I'm all for having guidelines included in it, because I have dealt with my neighbors for many years in regards to sound and how they feel about it when it's intrusive and it's not pleasant to have to listen to something that you do not want to. Listen to so I think that yeah, it's a good idea to have some guidelines in the resolution, so there are two hands. Can I also give a context guys? The legislation says the term affected, art and cultural institution means any not-for-profit art or cultural group organization, venue institution within the city of New York. That was ordered to close due to the state disaster emergency declared by the governor, etc. I mean this is really like. We are not going to set the parameters for that. You know what I mean this is about, like all the independent legal theater like there are a lot of them in our district. There are a lot of other kind of performances, dance, etc. That right now they're to be honest, like they can sue the city because, of course, the nightlife industry, the restaurants, have lobbyists and they lobbied the hell out of the government and they got the open restaurants and the arts and culture got nothing. And so this is a timid attempt to give a lifeline to this industry from the chair of the arts and culture committee. This is not. You know, some whatever harassing drug addict or alcoholic who wants to come and disturb people I mean I. Think I understand your perspective, because you're people who deal with these kind of issues in this district but I also would like to make sure that you read the legislation and you understand the context from which it's coming, because I think the criticism that you are leaving is to some extent unfair and also you know unrelated, because the concerns that you have are occurring also because there is this basically more and more people, especially if you're talking about musicians are pushed to underground, unsafe situations, and you know loud situations or whatever, because these are illegal gigs that they're offered. They have no legal gigs olympia. Let's let the two folks from the public speak Dale and then Maria. Okay, thank you. Well, I'm going to speak as a resident who's having you know a lot of noise issues with things on the street that now been opened up and as a performer, a former performance artist and musician poetry, streets street stuff, all that so I, certainly you know, understand that, need and desire, and then the loss of performance spaces. But what for me is big concern because I also face Avenue a between 12th and 13th, and there is five six venues: restaurants in that open right now, and just the constant noise just from dinner people talking and more and more of the spaces of putting outdoor speakers out there, what they call background, low background music and, as Carolyn said, all of a sudden there's noise, where there is not noise and if we are resident and across from any of this stuff, it really starts to you know, deplete quality of life and the whole idea that trying to save all these businesses by putting whatever element the you know of their business, is out on the street, is really I, mean I, feel trapped by everybody's desire to survive and I want I do not want things to go under because of this, but the more we keep trying to solve issues by putting it on the street for residents who are you know facing the street and have this already going on. It's really kind of a like I said trapped. It feels like a terrible burden. All of a sudden, you know you people are directly involved. You know you have to put up for it, put up with it for the sake of business. Survival is really a tough pill to swallow, and you know, because even if it's acoustic, music, there's a dixieland or some kind of bourbon, Street Trio that comes up and down and they've got a drummer and a couple horns and a singer and those guys it just on Avenue, hey it just blasts and they'll go up and down to the various venues, for you know half hour 45 minutes an hour and you hear it until they are finally out of earshot, and you know the music is fun and great, but not when you're living with all the noise, all around the clock. Now, with everything being open and in terms of other types of performance, you know theater other types of spoken word: acoustic performance, whatever it is noise on the street and it's all subjective as to what is his background? What's you know, right in somebody's face, so I think it's an unfortunate thing to kind of put residence against all these different elements in terms of survival, because quality of life is about surviving too I wish they could put up some temporary structure in the in the park. Soundproof performances could go on in there or something like that, but the more it's just on the streets. It's really it's really fatiguing and a burden for me as a resident me as a former performer, and all of that, so that would be my comment to this is how much burden can streets and neighbors who are facing the streets? You know how much weight of that can be sustained at some point, there's a breaking point and for me it's kind of already happening just with. What's out there already. Thank you, Maria yeah thanks a lot dale. That was great. It feels wonderful to hear someone articulate what I've been living. I think we're talking about two different things here, because one is about supporting artists and the other thing is about kind of living in a kind of chaos where you do not know when something's going to start blasting- and you do not know how long it's going to go on and I've lived in. The east village on my street I live on 3Rd Street, near Avenue B for 30 years, so I've dealt with. You know, nightclubs, I've run the gamut and you know complaining about noise. Working with you know, within the community, with nightclubs having the EPA come in and measure the decibels. This is really out of control because the police do not respond. The EPA does not come and we're not talking about live bands we're talking about amplified music Djs blasting their music. You know people coming in to the neighborhood really drunk or whatever and I wrote in my email to you guys. That's they even started setting up a porta potty in front of the community garden, so yeah talk about quality of life, we're already in a pandemic, and this feels like an epidemic of sound where I do not know where I get to just enjoy the quiet of my home, so I feel kind of imprisoned here. So I appreciate the idea of artists, but this is not about supporting artists the amplified music. This is real imposition. So just looking at your language, not that I, you know I'm kind of jumping in the beginning- the middle of this, but to not specify who this is supporting and to know that there's going to be a beginning and an end and that it's going to be at a certain decibel level is crazy. Making for the residents I mean I'm not dismantling existing legislation right. There is already a regime of legislation about what you know: the decibels etc. I, I'm really I'm not understanding the perspective and the framework like had you had a chance to read the legislation. Have you had a chance to understand what we're talking about, especially for someone who comes from a background of performing arts? You understand that. Currently there is a ban, a complete ban on outdoor performance and that's why there are illegal things only happening, so you need to lift the ban, and this way the existing framework of legislation by established organizations can be. You know happening. Are you saying that by lifting the ban that then, actually the ordinances that are supposed to be in place will then be enacted in terms of the illegal noise, because I'm not confident about that what's happening now? What I'm saying is this legislation that the CB3 is doing a resolution? A resolution to support are legislations that have been established with organizations that we know local non-profits theaters, all sorts of different places that right now they can not legally have outdoor performances and a crazy bar near you. I do not know what they're doing legally or illegally, but obviously are disturbing you. But if you had a theater or if you had you know any other arts and cultural institution, they can not do anything because of the lack of any legal way to do that. So what we're saying we need to have a legal way for this kind of organizations to create their program, not just and by the way. This is not just a business perspective. This is also a mental health perspective. You know, yeah and so we're. You know clearly we're talking about two different things here: I wrote an email today and I was invited to come and speak. So you know I'll put that out there we're talking about two different things, so I'm not arguing about artists, but I'm having the opportunity to talk to the Community Board and you know so. Let's focus on the resolution and if we want to change anything in the resolution or how we want to approach this because there seem to be you know a number of different opinions. I do think that there is a little bit of like cross communication with the intent of what this is supposed to be because, from my perspective- and you know, I saw this resolution when everybody else did is that it's really to figure out a way for cultural organizations. I would say, probably not like your individual artists to have a way to do something during this time if their venues are closed. I do not know that that's fully clear from the resolution. I do not know if we can figure this out tonight or if we want. If the arts and culture subcommittee should work on. Maybe some clarifications, and so Anissa I think that if anybody has read the Intro 2068, that I also put a link in the chat. We has very specific. You know description of the arts and cultural institutions and regarding the amendment that I think Megan may have typed I think we can add that if people feel comfortable like need that to make sure that it is by established arts organizations, but I really do not see any reason to delay that, because it is very much you know, concise I mean Jimmy. Van Braber is the chair of the arts and Cultural Committee of the New York City Council, and this legislation has been designed in collaboration with the local institutions that need them, even when the so the Full board's going to. If we pass this tonight, the full board's going to have to vote on it and from this resolution as it's written, it's not clear what his what's in his proposed legislation and I think that's probably not reading this resolution. You do not know what's in this legislation, so you can't so what we say to facilitate outdoor performance for ads and events and performances. We can say by established search organization if that helps right. But that's not my point. My point is you're. Asking everybody having you read this proposed legislation, whether we have or we've not on this committee, we're, certainly not assuming that the full board is going to have read it before they vote on this resolution. So I think the resolution needs to say a little bit more about. What's in the legislation, I mean we can try to write a few lines of an ex abstract. However, usually the business of the CB3 is that we rely on the expertise of the of the various committees. For instance, when I do a euler, I'm pretty sure none of the other people have read the euler, that I read about Rikers or about two bridges etc, but they rely on me when I say that document 10-22 said x and so community port 3 recommends why. However, these are a few of the extra conversations that need to happen around arts and culture in CB3, because it's always a subcommittee under committees that obviously do not deal every day that you think are missing from this resolution. That's basically we can. We can articulate that currently there is no legal way whatsoever for arts and cultural organizations to host outdoor events. Andrew you have your hand up yeah, so I'm sorry, I will I have to leave soon and I feel as though, if like we had the last presentation etc. If there was a presentation of what this legislation is, so we could all understand it, etc. I would be prepared to vote on. This I feel ill prepared to vote on this resolution tonight and I do not want to vote on something that I do not understand and that can have an impact, a negative impact on the people in the neighborhood. So that's unfortunate, but that's where I am. If there was a much more thorough presentation of this, perhaps sorry so I think then we should just merge the arts and culture Committee and the Economic Development Committee, because we can not attend eight meetings and try to present to eight different people, because after Andrew will make a presentation for you, then we have to go to full board and then other people may raise others. No, I'm not I'm not suggesting that olympia. I think, just like we had the guy from DOB come and explain this whole thing about outdoor heating, etc. We were able to ask questions, and then we approved the resolution for a grant to support businesses to allow them to better function in that environment. All we have here is a resolution with really no background. Information and I would think you would want I would hope you would want my support on this and what I'm saying is, as it stands now at this hour with no detail. If you called this to a vote, I would have to vote against it and I do not want to do that. But I do not have anything. I need right now to support a resolution. Carolyn, you have your hand up. Yes, I, do you know, there's a way I think of drafting either another warehouse clause in the resolution to maybe address some of these issues, because the thing about it is that when I read this and we developed, this I was thinking in terms of performing arts organizations like the theaters that have been closed, okay and what the discussion seemed to geared towards, at least in the earlier part of this resolution, was more as if it applied to street musicians and so at any rate, I think you know, I would go along with Andrew's suggestion that there'd be a presentation about Jimmy, Van, Bramer's legislation and that is being put forward so that everyone has a clear understanding of it and what we're getting into that I ran a performance festival from 1996 to 2003 and I lived with my neighbors. We had one performance organization who went on until 11 o'clock, sometimes midnight one of my neighbors called me. It sounded as if it was in his living room. He was ready to kill me. Okay, we tried dealing with that particular group. They were very obnoxious. They were rude to the neighbors. Okay, there do need to be guidelines in place about because and the other neighbors who lived along this block because the with La Plaza the amphitheater amplifies the sound it sends it all the way up all the backyards. Okay, it sent it all the way up to the sixth floor of the buildings across the street, so there do need to be guidelines in place about hours most of the time. People do not object to performances in the afternoon. What they do object to is that they have to listen to it late at night and for the length of time that they have to listen to it. So I do not think that those are unreasonable ideas to put into the resolution. So if you would like carolyn, if you could coordinate some sort of speaker presentation to come and give more background about this, then it would have to be in December no but I. Think elisa. What currently suggested to Andrew's comment is to add a sentence where it says that if the outer performance you know is subjected to- and you know to certain times of the day, etc because guys like it does not make sense for us to have a resolution for December like you meet before us, then we need to meet as arts and culture also. It would not make a sense to have a presentation for these people to the Economic Development Committee. If you care so much about arts and culture subcommittee, you should attend our meeting. You know what I mean like even I'm asked constantly to come and attend the Economic Development Committee by people and I do not want to I mean you're, lovely and everything, but I can't attend 8,000 committee meetings. So if this is an issue that you care deeply about, why do not you know, join our meeting and you can hear all the conversation that you want about the subject of this legislation that is proposed by the arts and culture. If this is something that you want us to vote yes on, then why do not you provide us? The info, you know exactly our background information on, but how do you want it provided I think I think what we I think we said and I thought I just heard Carolyn agreed to is present. Have somebody present this executive or what Van Bramer's proposed legislation is, so we can and then understand, can craft a resolution that says CB3. So I'm going to make a point of order here, because I do not have anybody presenting me the 500 pages of a euler when I do my euler landing users guys I, do not I do not care about the vote, but I do care about point of order, and I'm happy that Susan is here, because this was a resolution that was passed last month and it had a reference to a specific legislation that is available to anybody who cares about this issue to read because it's a public domain document and I already posted earlier today here in this chat, I understand that you did not have a chance of reading it like. But this is not my responsibility right. You serving this committee. You knew this was a resolution that was coming in front of your committee. The reference to the legislation was there. If you could not find it, you could have asked the office for assistance or our subcommittee, and we would have provided you the link that I already put in the chat. So I am happy for us to you know, since we are a subcommittee of this committee to add a comment that you may want us to suggest in terms of you know hours and making sure that it conforms for with current legislative framework about environmental. You know how much the decibel is, etc. However, this feels, like you, guys, have a specific issue that you deal with about noise. That has to do with a very specific nightlife concern, and this legislation comes from a very different perspective that I hope by now. You understand that there is currently a legal complete ban. There is no legal way for arts and culture organizations to have an outdoor performance, and so I think we're talking about two very different issues and beyond offering like other at the subcommittee level. You know we discussed it. The legislation is there is in the public domain is a document that was referred in a result that you received before you had your committee meeting. So this is a point of order for me just because otherwise we should not be having sub-committee meetings if we're going to be having the whole conversation again. Well, that is something that can be brought up with alicia like I, mean I. Think the committee as a whole does not feel like they have enough information to, but Anissa that's what I'm saying they did have, but Susan has her hand up. Oh Susan, sorry yeah. So I would like to speak to the point of order. It's a technical thing and I think it's an important technical point, because I think what's causing the problem. So if you go into how to write a resolution- and this is based on previous problems- every resolution is supposed to be able to stand alone. So you can't depend on reading the other document to understand the resolution. The resolution has to stand alone so clearly you're not going to repeat the whole intro, but it has to give the important points, because what people and I understand the frustration people are reacting not to what the legislation says. They're reacting to what this resolution says and you need to have the whole point, be able to stand alone and be understandable in the resolution. That's part of our guidelines based on this kind of issue happening in the past, like even in a euler resolution, you can read the resolution and get the gist of what they're requesting from the euler. Is there anything that is there any language that we could add now olympia? That would give you a better sort of idea of what this legislation is asking for like is there anything in the legislation that requests sort of like time limits or decimal levels or I mean that's? What I'm saying this is where you're losing me is that this legislation does not say to take away the current regime. There is a legislative regime around this kind of things right, but there is no way of having right now outdoor performance. This is the first sentence from the summary of the legislation. It says this bill would require the city to create an open cultural program that would allow art and cultural institutions affected by Covid-19 to use parks, Pedestrian, plazas roadways or public parking areas and other approved open spaces as temporary performance and rehearsal space, because right now they can not perform anywhere it is. There is a ban, so all the illegal people can go out and do things and disturb all of us like do you want to talk about the Dave or Dale? What was the name of that? Guy I live near Tonki square park. You won't believe what are the illegal, noisy things that are happening here, but there is nothing legal and nobody is paid. This is not just lifting the restrictions. This is also allowing there were. There was legal ways to perform outdoors before, but this is going beyond that and saying to do. Outdoor performance and practice. Spaces am I right, yeah, but I think the concern that the people the residents raised was. This is going to be noisy or things like that right, and the thing is that as Susan was saying earlier, when fab or the theater for the new city or other local organizations have done events in the past. These were not the kind of events that disturb people, because they do respect the decibel Et cetera. It's a different kind of event that we're talking about, but it's not going to happen guys I have to interrupt for just a second there's. Anisha has an emergency health issue, and so Megan, would you temper it? Would you take over chairing the meeting? Yes, so what we could do, just because I know everybody needs to go and my battery is seven percent, but basically what we can do is we can try to come up and extract from the legislation, some points and submit it for the executive, if that's the way to so that it can pass on time. That's a Susan question. Well, first of all, I want to say I want to point out the resolution and I think this is what's causing some of the confusion. The resolution says amplified sound for outdoor performances so to the world. Reading this that's going to be any outdoor performance, which is the corner of my street, the exec. If you read our bylaws and I'm just going by our bylaws, it says if there is a timely issue that comes up and would be helpful. Maybe if someone could read the section you know it has to be a time. Timeliness issue that was not on the agenda that goes to the exact. We have never had a situation where a resolution could not be done in the meeting and then therefore went to the exact same so I have actually an idea, susan. That would address this issue. Well, we can offer it as a friendly amendment at the like, we can offer an amendment ourselves at the full board meeting and then, if people feel that amendment does not address the concerns raised today, we're just going to vote it down and what about offering friendly is a friendly amendment. A friendly amendment is something that does not change the integrity and this would not change the integrity, because what Susan said we should add is the framework of the Intro 2068. That explains what it entails. I get that, but that still means we would have to vote on this. The way it looks tonight and I do not think the committee is comfortable with that. Can I say that there's a resident, that's had her hand raised for a long time. Oh sorry, I'm sorry who is it I can't see that right and I see I just see Laura's name I do not see her. Can you just call on her for me? Laura? Yes, sorry, yes, no worries. It's I, just I am very supportive of the arts organizations. I've been very outspoken at how they've been left out of this whole process and I understand why it is due to gatherings and everything else, but I also feel at a complete loss to explain this to the residents that you know we serve and I wish. We I feel like with all the time we've spent speaking about it. If we had, we still do not have the answers to our questions about what's in the legislation, so I do not know quite why. That is why, if it's just not there yet or if you know the committee can't access it and share it with us and subcommittee so but I mean I, do not understand laura what you'd want to know in the sense that I want can I across the street from performance space. You know Ps New York. Are they going to be able to have kiki parties? Nothing, there's anything wrong with that guys by the way my battery is dying and my charger is not working, so I may drop out. Okay, so let's say I live across the street from a performance space. If are they going to rehearse the same dance number over and over again, are they allow? You know? Are they going to have events that are loud? You know at any time of day when something happens repeatedly to you as a resident. It's an undue burden on your quality of life, especially if you can't leave your house during a pandemic. It's really pretty simple. I understand that most organizations want to have a healthy relationship with residents, but it's just not clear from the resolution that the intent is to permit outdoor performances. That's the focus of the reso, and yet it's honed in on amplified sound, which is residents, have a knee-jerk reaction to at this point. So the I do not feel the reso is the way it's written. It is serves the purpose, which is a really high purpose, so I just you guys, could revisit it. Thanks, Laura guys, I'm going to take a straw poll from our oh okay Carol go ahead. Would it help if it was specified as a whereas clause that the permits that would have to be issued for the street performances and that they would have to follow the standard city guidelines in regards to sound and hours? Because that's the issue is amplified sound, which everybody is absolutely terrified of and the amount of time and when it's allowed to go on so I do not think anybody is opposed to arts organizations performing and stuff. The issue is about the guidelines about how they would be able to perform okay. So, if is it possible to include a whereas clause in this resolution that could be proposed tonight? That would state that you know we expect the arts organizations to follow the existing guidelines in regards to sound and hours with that p make people feel more comfortable, because there is a limit of four hours. Those are community boards only from our community board. What that four hours is only from our community board right I would be a little bit more comfortable with it, but I think my issue still is I. Do not know what the city's rules are around those permitting processes. Now how long the performances can last what the decibel levels are, what hours they can perform until that's my opinion. So if I can tell you, the city has one set of guidelines. The Community board has another set of guidelines. Sound permits are issued by the police department and all of our police precincts, respect, Community board 3 guidelines, which means they end at six and they're, not more than four hours. So if you put it into this legislation, it's not that it's not going to apply to the rest of the city, because these are community board three guidelines. We made our own guidelines because of the problems we have in our community. Okay, it could be. It turned into a whereas clause that for this community that we would follow the existing guidelines from sound and time would that satisfy everybody. You'd have to change the outdoor performances to be more specific, you know permitted. You know some so that people are aware of what you're describing not you know if you just say outdoor performances. It sounds like something on the corner instead of what you're describing carolyn right, but it's just sort of like if the that's. What I'm asking is there a way that we could incorporate a clause into this resolution now that would specify that in CB3 that they would follow the existing guidelines for sound and length Cb3's existing guidelines or, yes, that would not so see so I would say: Andrew just one Sec, I'm going to get. Let have Susan Respond to that, and then you can talk. Okay, so CB3 does not have any guidelines that say you can't perform on the street and what you're looking at is not for a street performance. I believe I believe you're looking for more either permitted street activities or permitted organizational events and I think somehow that has to get into this result all right, Andrew go ahead. Yeah I! I'm sorry, I'm repeating myself, but one simple, whereas clause is not going to unfortunately get my support for this resolution tonight, I want to support a resolution, but this is just too much of a mushed mashed up resolution for me to for me to support. Okay can I like to take a straw poll who would like to continue working on this or who thinks that it's worth working on this resolution tonight to get to a point where you have something to vote on. Are we allowed to do straw polls on the zoom yeah? So can everybody Hey guys Committee members who are on who have their videos turned off any chance? You could turn your videos on just so I could see your show of hands who wants to continue working on this night tonight and try to come to a conclusion on, whereas so that we can get it passed all in favor. Raise your hand, I'm raising it just saying as long as there's a time limit. Okay, I do not know if I'm allowed to raise my hand or not would be committee members right if you're only referring to committee members, no, I'm not, but what David louie? Are you still there? Okay, one two yeah and I go one two three! That's all we have left on okay, Olympia, Carolyn, I think we need to do a little bit more work on this and come back to the committee with it I mean I think we need to go to exec because of all this situation. It is just you know, inappropriate and it's okay, but it's there needs to be a better way, because otherwise we should not be having a subcommittee when ends up being that we need to come to this committee and actually that, like no, this no members of this committee are in the subcommittee. You know what I mean it just does not make sense, and obviously, because your concerns come from a completely different perspective, I need to I need you I need you to understand that this is basically, we are cutting almost a constitutional right of expression to these people. I understand it's the pandemic, that everybody has special privileges, but right now we are allowing sorry, I'm screaming and my kids are sleeping, but if this is just to me, it is I'm ashamed almost to be part of this community, both at this point just because I do live in this neighborhood and I have little kids that are sleeping right now right. So it's not that I do not know what quality of life means, but I also know very deeply what is happening right now in the arts and cultural world and how intrinsical it is to the identity of this district and the fact that this resolution, that is time sensitive, is being blocked in this way and for the reasons that have been raised that all have to do with you know bad ages of life. It really to me is inappropriate. I, do not think anybody on this committee is anti-arts I. Just think we want to vote on something that's responsible and we want to do it with as much information as possible. Yes, that's a that's a terribly unfair assessment of what's happening here at olympia. Tonight, yes, so I mean I. Understand your perspective. Yes, the resolution that we can vote on I'm going to I'm going to wrap this up. Okay, we're going to this is that's that for this decision, but I just wanted to make sure that everybody was aware that this needs to be discussed at the executive, not as the resolution to be continued, but this unfortunate situation, because it is not okay as a point of order for this kind of meetings to need to be occurring two and three times like otherwise. Why do we have a subcommittee right, never happened before and I think something we need to take up with olympia guys we have to move on sorry next order on the agenda. Carolyn has her hand raised. Should we vote on the previous resolution, or will we be voted on one resolution? Yeah, you should vote on the other resolution. Okay, you should probably vote on this. One too. You can't just ignore it, okay, so the first vote is going to be for the first arts and culture resolution. Sorry, can you guys still see that and then the second vote is going to be for the second arts and culture of a resolution. Everyone understand what we're voting on can I. Just ask for clarification. Are you just voting on the resolution? Yes or no, or are you voting on bringing it back or amending it? You know further work on it: okay, so the first, the first arts and culture of resolution, it's a vote to approve and that's what we're going to vote on now. The second one welcome any motion to you know bring it back to committee happy to do that. I think sorry, but the proper way to do it is you need to vote yes or no, then, if it is no as it seems from the strophol, then you need to you know, then you then it did not pass so then we as a commit subcommittee will have to decide what we want to do with it all right. So the person could not refer something back. I mean they could do both. They could vote yes or no, as you suggested, and then also vote to you know to work on it further. Okay, let's just take that first, one, the first arts and culture resolution. The resolution is to approve Anisha Stephen, not here Megan Joy, actually she's here, I think no. She called she called me: she has a health issue: Alistair Economicus, yes, Andre Gordillo, yes, Herman, Hewitt, sorry he's not here, Joe Kern's, not here, David, Louie, Alexander, Milotano, sorry, I'm here; yes, okay, yes, your yes, okay, Richard, Ropiak, Absent, Rodney, Washington, Absent, Andrew, Comey, yes, okay. Second, one motion to we're going to first vote on a motion to approve and if you want after that, we can come up with some other action on where, if we wanted to come back or something like that, Anisha Stephen out here, Megan joy, emma no yes, Andrea gordillo. Just so I'm clear. The vote is a yes to approve the second resolution, the second resolution as it's written sorry- and it's not with that highlighted bit: yes, okay, Alexandra Milotano, no Andrew, Comey, no okay. Anybody want to propose an actionable item for that resolution, so megan for the record. So it's three no and two. Yes, so, basically, unfortunately, I know anissa is not feeling well, but this is also a very close call and I'm pretty sure anissa would have voted yes, so it's okay I mean she called me earlier to and she discussed this legislation with me. But it's okay, no problem, but it is important also to keep this in mind when we discuss this at exec, because this is really not a proper way to conduct business, but I mean I am okay with all of these, I'm not going to get into it, but the I there's nothing inappropriate on how we're voting tonight on this item. No the whole. No, I'm not saying about how we're voting about this item and I made clear. What is the point of order that I'm asking here it has to do with proper way of contacting business because again, if somebody was interested in this subject the way we do it with the other subcommittees, when the knights and subcommittee give us something at the land use if we're interested within the Knights Subcommittee meeting, and we discuss it there. So this is the way in which property CB3 operates, and this is not, of course, the way it has been happening here. We are asked to come in three extra meetings every time, so that's what I mean Megan yeah. Does it make more sense? I think there's been an issue with timing on this committee for a long time and yeah, and it's not our fault in this- is neither your fault but ours, but we are all suffering from that, and so this is not okay, especially because we find ourselves in these time-sensitive situations with people that depend on us as a community, and we can not serve them. I agree. Okay, sorry, guys! Okay, that's it for that! Okay! So then it is up to the arts and cultural committee whether they can or want to take this to exec I think that's, obviously something that Carolyn and has to present to alicia or get approved by Alicia. So the last thing we have on our agenda is just the vote to adjourn. Do not you have this special district on shoot. Sorry guys, I would I would be perfectly comfortable. Kicking the special district another month being that we have such a small group of committee members here tonight can I get a show out of pants who's. Okay with that, or are we allowed to do that Susan? Sure? Okay, can I get a show a hands on who's willing to put this special district to December's meeting? Okay, that's the majority of us. Okay, that's great great idea! Andrew we'll do that. So now it's just a vote to adjourn the only thing megan I would say on that is we keep putting this on the agenda as the last item and then the clock seems to be kicking out. So if we're serious about it, we should front load it. So we can actually have some time to discuss it. That's fair I'll put that in the minutes. Okay, vote to Adjourn, Anisha Stephen Megan Joy; yes, Aleister economicus! Yes, oh sorry, you could you can vote for yourself, I guess, andre, yes, Herman Hewitt, no Joe, kearns, no David Louis, yes, Alexandra Militano, yeah, Richard, ropiak, no Rodney, Washington, no Andrew Comey, no I mean yes. Okay, no I do not want to adjourn I want to stay here longer. No, yes, thanks guys, I appreciate your patience. I know this is obviously a very emotional issue because we're dealing with people's livelihoods and people's way quality of life. So you know I'd rather wait a little while and get it done right all right, thanks for coming everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
