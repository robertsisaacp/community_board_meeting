Okay, so I guessed, but it could be wrong or what the interpretation, what it's supposed to be saying I, do not think any of any of us like looked at them very carefully.
Know, keep everyone safe, because otherwise it reads kind of like a, whereas clause right, sorry, guys I, just wanna.
Let's go ahead and start with Josh Adams from DOB who's, going to speak about winterizing spaces for small businesses and other types of institutions.
So, you know really in conjunction with department of Transportation's Open Restaurants program for sidewalk and roadway dining, the department, the building's issued of some following guidance on about how owners of restaurants install outdoor heating heat equipment and obtain the required permits and inspections that are necessary to operate natural gas heating and electrical heating in a safe and efficient manner.
The way they should go about obtaining outdoor heating is the first step they need to do is hire a license for at least for natural gas and propane.
We're going to determine the number of heaters required based on you know how many or how large the space is for the outdoor seating they're going to inspect the gas system for your building.
The license performance determines that safe connections are going to be in place within the for your outdoor heating and space.
Under this open restaurant program, the licensed plumber can follow natural gas heaters with the department through an expedited process.
They file this laa through DOB, now build and once they file it, they need to identify and state on the scope that it's for the open restaurants program when they're filing for any natural gas or propane.
One other thing that the plumber, as well as the Electrician, must make sure is that when they're connecting these flexible hoses from indoor from the indoor plumbing to the outdoor heating fixtures, you need to ensure that there's no tripping hazards when going across the sidewalk.
This is the one thank you scroll down to the next page right at the top, where the highlighted portion is so the same steps pretty much apply for if you're going to pursue electric heating for your outdoor heating.
There's other steps you need to take to ensure that your electric system can handle what you're the amount of heaters you want to use, then that's a separate permit.
You know the electric system up to date, so the electrician is also going to file permits for the department now with electrical work.
We have outdoor street seating on the outside of a bike lane and your instructions say that you know anything running through the bike line has to be approved by D.O.T, but there's no guidelines on what kind of what would be approved by DOT.
You can save yourself a major headache and a lot of time and money as well by just you know, going through this process, ensuring that you have your license, Master, Plumber or Electrician as well, to conduct that work in a safe and proper and up to code manner.
I think as far as small businesses go with regards to getting electrical permits or plumbing permit plumbing permits for the gas, work.
Wrong, I, assume with the gas plumbing inspections and here's a question you are going to require the DOB pressure testing, which is at 10 times working pressure back to the back to the meter.
Do, you know, if, in this situation, DOB is going to insist on that pressure test that usually causes a lot of problems for a lot of people.
That makes it virtually impossible to use either you know, and in that time period everyone races to get the materials, because there's been a shortage of materials when you've got over 10,000 businesses all doing the exact same thing.
And I think the city's actually jumped through rings to try to make things work for Us restaurants, but I feel like the heating thing is a mess.
I mean any, especially if it relates to you know any kinds of enlargements: propane storage, electrical wiring coming out of the building that should not be coming out of the building.
You, know, send it to 301 if it's a complaint about electrical wiring coming out of the building or propane storage in front of the building or sorry unsafe, propane storage in front of the building.
We do periodically inspections for those rather active as far as see as far as the issues that you were seeing that we're not knowing about if they did not apply for a permit to conduct that work.
You know public or property hazard at that location, and my last question focuses on the attachments or expansion of the buildings they're supposed to post a permit like any other construction.
All right, alex I was just going to voice the same concerns as Megan and Andrew, in that these seem very complicated for small business owners to be able to comply, with, and also like.
You know to accommodate different uses that may not actually be permitted by DOB or other agencies within these structures and are probably also creating hazards given I doubt that they they're being done with any input from any electricians.
I, do not know what solutions and I think second Alex's acknowledgement that the city is responding to a very challenging time.
If they're going to connect any electrical lines to that outdoor seating, it needs to be covered along the sidewalk with those rubber coverings that I mentioned right.
You, know just for lighting, even knotting for a heater, so I just wanted to clarify if that was still applies to just lights or heating, but to anything with, electric is basically what you're saying.
I think that was the main thing I wanted to say, and this is not just you know, resident complaints, I mean Alistair will tell you, we talk, we work with landlords.
Is there a way to, instead of issuing them a monetary fine to give them an initial warning, a warning which I think there was a program like that for a while, where they have.
My second question was about just if I realized in order to get this permit, it's kind of done through the open restaurants, program.
But if you know a retail space is trying to use the sidewalk, they would probably have to go through a separate, permitting process away from open restaurants.
Think we had this issue come up the beginning, when the mayor's, when that earlier Mayor's executive order, had allowed restaurant to use outdoor spaces, where you know if they had them available to use them to allow the restaurants to you, know to open.
Use I have to confirm that if the mayor's executive order, if that's the guideline, that's still committed to use the right yard, because I know they're allowing spaces.
Know: Andrea helped, draft this resolution and brought this sort of issue up to the committee.
Requests that small business services, SBS optimize, the PPE plus free opening supplies marketplace to include outdoor heating devices such as propane electrical and solar devices, and support grants for such supplies.
It's the first time I see the razor, but I can say therefore period dissolve that community por 3 requests that small business services, SBS optimize, the PPE reopening the to include outdoor heating devices such as propane, electric and weatherization materials, or we could say, and support grants for such supplies, as well as for structural upgrades to the pavilion.
You, can call them okay, out, maybe outdoor dining, areas, no I, think the temporary curb structures is good.
I. Have a comment: I'm not opposed to the last, whereas clause, the second to last one about local, nonprofits and cultural institutions, but it's kind of like a non-sequitur in the middle of the resolution, so I feel like it.
If that's something we should discuss, but I, think it's reasonable to just ask or just add a clause about about perhaps them being Retro retroactive and like on a reimbursement basis that might I've heard from I've heard from the city that you know, or I've kind of I feel through different zooms.
So like do not go spending a fortune on what you're putting up this winter, because very likely the regulations are going to change, come springtime again, so, which is I, think why some of these things are looking pretty flimsy.
And I know: olympia has to leave fairly soon, so I do not remember which one is first, but let's do I think the first one is going to be easy.
Yes, okay resolution to request city agencies, including DCLA, DOT, DYCD, DSNY, DOE and parks to increase funding opportunities in the current budget for artists and arts organizations.
Whereas arts and culture sector has experienced extensive damage from the paws program enacted by New. York state is the necessary response to Covid-19 and whereas approximately 70 percent of the arts community has had their funding cut according to Senator Jose Serrano, who chairs the Cultural Committee in the assembly, whereas many gig economy, artists and cultural producers had no income since March and were not able to access unemployment benefits for months and whereas the prospects of new commissions and projects or non-existence since theaters venues and all live performance initiatives are indefinitely shuttered and whereas the economic hit, the parts and cultural sector is receiving, will last three to five years, depending on sector specificities and whereas artists and cultural workers are the creative capital of New York and are integral to the creative industry capital that fueled, New, York's tourism and export economy for years.
I mean I, do not know if you currently wanted to take the question, but the reason for which people did not qualify about unemployment benefits is because there is a huge problem when you are a 1099 worker to figure out how to qualify, and many of them were also cast economy workers and they never qualified, not to mention.
Right I was just going to say: If you have it in there just track the language and the district needs things one or the other, because we I think created slightly better language and then sorry, Olympia or Carolyn.
Well, I think that one, the city is still going to hold outdoor performances to the same guidelines that it has about noise that it presently has at this point in time that there would have to be a permit applied for I, can't see them.
And I think that most cultural institutions would be sensitive to the fact that they would be very grateful that they were able to perform in outdoor spaces and that they would not want to create a thing that would totally annoy their neighbors to the point that they would be filing complaints which people do about the noise quite frequently.
Think, the last two community board meetings and exec meetings that the biggest complaint that we are getting right now is about particularly music with the out associated with the outdoor dining.
And I think there are people here that probably want to speak to it, but the office's experience and other community boards.
They do there's two issues: here: legally they're, not going to do one thing for arts organizations.
Arts needs a place to be able to perform, and you know, fab is coming up with a thing on November the 14th, where the performing arts, organizations on 4th, Street and other members of Fab are applying to produce.
You know it's an existing problem and a lot of it is left to like the Community Board office to struggle with and try to work with the other agencies to address and I.
But there it's creating a whole host of complaints regarding noise, because they're not employing them to stand in the back of their business, and let this you know the sound travel out to the outdoor seating in the front they're employing them so that they're standing basically on the edge of the open storefront on the sidewalk.
However, I think Carolyn's point about the fact that these are going to be lifelines for important local nonprofit cultural organizations, theaters venues etc.
What we're talking about is the stuff that is all over the sidewalks, and what the other thing that I have wanted to say is the way the discussion has been going is if the only type of performance you're considering are musicians.
You understand the context from which it's coming, because I think the criticism that you are leaving is to some extent unfair and also you know, unrelated, because the concerns that you have are occurring also because there is this basically more and more people, especially if you're talking about musicians are pushed to underground, unsafe situations, and you know loud situations or whatever, because these are illegal gigs that they're offered.
You know a lot of noise issues with things on the street that now been opened up and as a performer, a former performance artist and musician poetry, streets street stuff, all that.
Certainly you know, understand, that, need and desire, and then the loss of performance, spaces.
What for me, is big concern because I also face Avenue a between 12th and 13th, and there is five six venues: restaurants in that open, right, now, and just the constant noise just from dinner people talking and more and more of the spaces of putting outdoor speakers out there, what they call background, low background music and.
I think we're talking about two different things: here, because one is about supporting artists and the other thing is about kind of living in a kind of chaos where you do not know.
There is a ban, a complete ban on outdoor performance and that's why there are illegal things only happening, so you need to lift the ban, and this way the existing framework of legislation by established organizations can be.
A resolution to support are legislations that have been established with organizations that we know local non-profits theaters, all sorts of different places that right now they can not legally have outdoor performances and a crazy bar near you.
If you had a theater or if you had you know any other arts and cultural institution, they can not do anything because of the lack of any legal way to do that.
You know description of the arts and cultural institutions and regarding the amendment that I think Megan may have typed.
I think we can add that if people feel comfortable like need that to make sure that it is by established arts organizations, but I really do not see any reason to delay that, because it is very much you know, concise.
If, we pass this tonight, the full board's going to have to vote on it and from this resolution, as it's written, it's not clear what his what's in his proposed legislation.
So I think the resolution needs to say a little bit more about.
These are a few of the extra conversations that need to happen around arts and culture in CB3, because it's always a subcommittee under committees that obviously do not deal every day that you think are missing from this resolution.
So I think then we should just merge the arts and culture Committee and the Economic Development Committee, because we can not attend eight meetings and try to present to eight different people, because after Andrew will make a presentation for you.
I think, just like we had the guy from DOB, come and explain this whole thing about outdoor, heating, etc.
Do you know, there's a way I think of drafting either another warehouse clause in the resolution to maybe address some of these issues, because the thing about it is that when I read this and we developed, this.
I was thinking in terms of performing arts organizations like the theaters that have been closed, okay.
I think you know, I would go along with Andrew's suggestion that there'd be a presentation about Jimmy, Van, Bramer's legislation and that is being put forward so that everyone has a clear understanding of it and what we're getting into that.
And, you know to certain times of the day, etc, because guys like it does not make sense for us to have a resolution for December like you meet before us, then we need to meet as arts and culture also.
You know what I mean, like even I'm asked constantly to come and attend the Economic Development Committee by people.
If this is an issue that you care deeply about, why do not you know, join our meeting, and you can hear all the conversation that you want about the subject of this legislation that is proposed by the arts and culture.
Here, because I do not have anybody presenting me the 500 pages of a euler when I do my euler landing users guys I, do not I, do not care about the vote, but I do care about point of order, and I'm happy that Susan is here, because this was a resolution that was passed last month and it had a reference to a specific legislation that is available to anybody who cares about this issue to read because it's a public domain, document.
There is no legal way for arts and culture organizations to have an outdoor, performance, and so I think we're talking about two very different issues and beyond offering like other at the subcommittee level.
There was legal ways to perform outdoors before, but this is going beyond that and saying to do.
This, is going to be noisy or things like that right, and the thing is that as Susan was saying earlier, when fab or the theater for the new city or other local organizations have done.
Yes, so what we could do, just because I know everybody needs to go and my battery is seven percent, but basically what we can do is we can try to come up and extract from the legislation, some points and submit it for the executive, if that's the way to so that it can pass on time.
The resolution says: amplified sound for outdoor performances so to the world.
What you'd want to know in the sense that I want can I across the street from performance space.
I understand that most organizations want to have a healthy relationship with residents, but it's just not clear from the resolution that the intent is to permit outdoor performances.
That the permits that would have to be issued for the street performances and that they would have to follow the standard city guidelines in regards to sound and hours.
Okay can I like to take a straw poll who would like to continue working on this or who thinks that it's worth working on this resolution tonight to get to a point where you have something to vote, on.
I think we need to do a little bit more work on this and come back to the committee with it.
You know what I mean it just does not make sense, and obviously, because your concerns come from a completely different perspective, I need to.
You can't just ignore it, okay, so the first vote is going to be for the first arts and culture resolution.
Then the second vote is going to be for the second arts and culture of a resolution.
I think sorry, but the proper way to do it is you need to vote yes.
