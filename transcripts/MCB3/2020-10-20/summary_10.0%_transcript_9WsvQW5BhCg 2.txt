Instead of an intention to host cooking classes, no security, no sound posting, no pub crawls or party buses, happy House to apm no agreement about no weight loss,, there's no agreement about having staff responsible for patrons and noise outside all that's listed in terms of the applicant experiences that the applicant has operated in business.
When I we heard the application, I'm, sorry Look through my minutes, but for what was formerly Stanton social, a resident submitted a letter in opposition, saying that there are seven pizza, restaurants within two blocks, the previous business operated for decades without a license and that without the license there still was late- night noise from that business.
The reason why we were told we were asked to come tonight is because on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, even though beer Online service will end at midnight, we would remain open until four in the morning and Joellen.
Does the notice say tavern with minimal food and the identification as a pizza place with a prep area as opposed to a kitchen when you're talking about upgrading the menu and becoming having you an even more expansive menu than the previous business.
We do not intend to be the noisy, neighbor, I'm a little disturbed to hear that the occupancy can be as high as it as stated talking about the 74 and not the not the 24, but from what I've seen in your layout, it looks like you're going to keep it pretty much the way Rosaria was.
If they've managed all these years to operate selling pizza, there is a demand and need that serves the community and because of the upgrade to the menu and the food and putting in a full kitchen in the basement.
No, no commercial uses outdoor space, a closed, fixed facade with no open doors or windows and the entrance door.
Alex was that confirmed as a fixed facade or not yes, so recorded background music, no dj's live music, promoted and scheduled performances or events with covers no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited drink, specials, happy hours to 8 pm, no wait lines up.
Annoying, us or people annoys outside Is there, a second or an amendment Yes, please Alex, man, ask you, did get in facade stays: fixed, correct, It, says: application for a restaurant, with a full menu recording with ignore outdoor space on the ground floor and basement.
So we had an application in February of 2000 for for a restaurant with recorded music, no outdoor space.
We had another application in septem and August of 2000 for no outdoor space, restaurant, no outdoor space and the addition of live music consisting of a piano, and we made a resolution in September of 2000 that we would approve the op license for that location provided applicant would not change the method of operations.

A closed facade, no television live entertainment, level, music from 7, P.M to 11, P.M, all day, promoted events and scheduled performances, but no events, photography.
Existing sound proofing, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours, and this is a long- standing jazz venue which I know to have scheduled performances which are not consistent with zoning and which I also looked.
Music, that he's not going to have cover fees, And, then I think you may have said something about the outdoor space and being in a difficult place, but I'm not sure that I heard correctly I kind of missed, considering that last part because he broke out a little bit.
Okay, yeah, are not part of the asphalt, because the outdoor is not like it's not legally licensed for outdoor cafe Okay, all right so, but he wants to continue operating as a restaurant, serving having a kitchen and serving well.
You know a jet very jazz venue, There are many references to the regular scheduled jazz and covers so it has happened in the past that we're hearing this now Now, because there are many places that are not operating, necessarily consistent with what the zoning requires and when we usually raise it with people is when they're coming before us You know we could approve, live, music.
I belong to the gardens on 12th street, and we would not hear it unless it was in the backyard Again, I think you know, with the cold weather you're, not going to be hanging out the windows much longer anyways.
Liquor licenses, stipulations governing its method of operation with the following stipulations and consistent with voting with the following stipulations, which would be operating at the american restaurant tavern with a kitchen open and survey food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation on for the interior of 5 pm to 4 A.M all day with a just one, minute, with a closed facade with no open doors or windows.
Level;, music, yes, No djs, no promoted, event, schedule, performances or events with covers , there's no alteration without first coming before the community, board, no pub calls or party buses and what's the answer about happy hours because both which were checked off it said no happy hours or happy hours , No wait lines outside, and staff outside, so staff outside means someone who's just responsible for overseeing people and noise outside not somebody who's outside all the time.
Whenever, there's any amplifiers found, because I know people have a tendency to prop open their back door, then, with respect to security.
Tavern with minimal food recorded music dj's, know outdoor space on the first floor.
At, all times, I recorded background music only have a close to God. The Cfo is 74 five table 16 seats, the 20 foot, put 22 foot by nine foot bar with 21 stools.
12 pm to 4 am all day a prep area serving food to within one hour of closing, consisting of burritos and pizza.
And, like I said, we're not really changing anything, it's going to stay the same and look the same other than some paint, and some pictures, and I really do not want to deal with the outdoor seating.
With hours of operation of 12 pm to 4, A.M, all day, all day, no commercial use of the outdoor areas, a closed fix, a spot with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no djs live music, promoted events with covers or scheduled, performances, no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses happy hours.

The only reason I put 12 in the application is be able to give everything to be able to close, but he's a very early establishment, and when is he proposing to open the outdoor space in the front?
Do not even think he's open at 10 o'clock at night, so I'm asking about the outdoor space.
We would prove, with stipulations governing its method of operation, that being that it operates as a full- service, american restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food.
All hours, indoor hours of operation of 7 A.M to 11 P.M, all day, a fixed factor close to the side, with no open doors or windows recorded background.
