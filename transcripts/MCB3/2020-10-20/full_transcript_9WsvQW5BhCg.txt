You should give me the credit of that and then there were a lot of businesses right and then we were stuck in this real estate. Sla rut of people saying well, there was one there before. So what difference is it? How is it going to be? It's not going to be worse, it'll just be the same, and yet it could get more worse and in fact, it'd get worse and that's where we are and why we think about it a little more thoughtfully now, because we understand that just saying something was there before so that should justify allowing something again is not necessarily sufficient, but that's not. We did not just come on and just say blankly that, and you know the other thing is. I think I mean I do not it's you're going to chill you're going to chill you're going to chill business, though, because if we're we have to be, if we have to come in here like I mean you basically just what I'm understanding from Clinton is there's no way that we purchase and then we can move to a resolution to deny. If that's the case again, I'm happy to hear you explain your experience, it's 20 to one and we have four more items. So we have to move this discussion along we're just talking in circles. Okay, so then, how about this? Can we please put our experience on the record and then withdraw, or is that not necessary? Well, if you're going to withdraw you'll be coming back next month or coming back in the future, it's not necessary because you're going to be hurt again and you can write it down on a piece of paper in a more comprehensive way more time. We certainly need more time than the next 30 seconds to deal with. You know what just kind of yeah I do not want to cut you off. We have an opportunity to talk and we'll move on to something else we have to go. We have to respond and meet with us as we asked before we're very open to doing so. We need them to make themselves available. Also, we've been very open to it. Whoever is on whoever is on the line you're asking about the residents of the sorry Alex. I know you've been waiting, but we've had we've endured this long, arduous process right now, with all due respect we to make it like, we did not communicate they emailed us, they mailed every single Block association in the area. It was obviously our you know, our area that we mostly focus on. We responded to them very clearly. The residents voted we had meetings with, we told them the process. We told we showed the application to the to the residents. The residents saw what they presented. They knew the history of the thing and they voted not to support this. We represented this. They asked us specifically. There was a little delay in our communication. He did not respond right back, which is fine, because we did not respond right away either due to delay, but when he did ask we told him the issues, we're happy to have this conversation again, but this is going in circles. The issue is their method of operation. We've talked about adjusting it. We talked. We spent the entire last hour talking whatever we need a restaurant there. We need something: that's not going to have a high impact. I'm happy to talk to you again, but we've had this conversation, it's going in circles. Now I'm happy to talk to you again, I'm happy for residents to tell you how bad it's been here, since you think this area has been great. It's not it's not we're happy to tell you how bad it is. We can show you photographs anything you would like. We can show you, we can do those things. Well, I understand that's your perspective and we can. I guess we can continue to talk about it and I'm just now. Everyone shares that perspective, but, okay, all right! Well, I guess I mean I guess the issue of continuing to go back and forth. I guess we'd like to withdraw our application and thank you for your time this evening and so I'll send the Community Board office an email that you intend to be on the agenda next month. If that changes and they'll put you on the agenda automatically, if that changes, then you have to let the Community Board office know: okay, you'll get notifications anyway about the things that you have to provide in advance of the meeting. So you'll have opportunities to respond. Also. Okay, thank you. Yeah all right, good night, all right moving on to number 13, which is a beer wine license for 173 Orchard Street. This was previously Rosario's pizza. Are the applicants here for that license application we're here right and who's? Donald who's, present yep, I'm here and Joe Ellen is here and Michael? Are you on? Do not hear me well, will's on will is on who was our manager and Joe Allen? One of the owners is on I'm going to I'm going to I'll text richie. He said he was on, but he may have got pulled off. Everything took so long, okay, what's will's last name Watkins! Thank you, okay. So this is an application for wine beer license in a location that was previously unlicensed. I gave history to the committee that it was history for the other storefronts at this address. This is an application that had no listed Cfo, eight tables and 16 seats. 12, the hours are 12 P.M to 12 A.M Monday through Thursday 12 pm to 4 am or 5 am Friday and Saturday with alcohol service at ending at 12 am the questionnaire said. 4 am the notice is to neighborhood groups, it says closing at 5, Am Prep area and it's identified as a tavern. Although pizza places have usually been identified as restaurants, even if they do not have full kitchens, it says tavern with minimal food in the SLA notice. It says Prep area serving food all hours consisting of peace and associated food clothes for thought. One TV there's it says, recorded background in the questionnaire, but there's no agreement to it on the stipulations, no promoted event scheduled performance of it or covers that's also not agreed to on the stipulations at the end of the questionnaire, instead of an intention to host cooking classes, no security, no sound posting, no pub crawls or party buses, happy House to apm no agreement about no weight loss, there's no agreement about having staff responsible for patrons and noise outside all that's listed in terms of the applicant experiences that the applicant has operated in business. In long island from 2016 to 2020, but the principles on the application applied for a business at 99, Stanton Street within the sorry, within the past thing, when I we heard the application, I'm sorry, I write down a piece of paper if it was something that I had to pull after recognizing the names. I just have to go. Look through my minutes, but for what was formerly Stanton social, a resident submitted a letter in opposition, saying that there are seven pizza restaurants within two blocks, the previous business operated for decades without a license and that without the license there still was late- night noise from that business. Okay, is there anything you want to say or any presentation you want to make with respect to the application? Yes, so it was Rosario's for over 50 years selling pizza, where Rosario's just closed this year, we're taking over the space we're completely redoing the inside and we'll make some changes on the outside and we'll call it Zazzy's pizza. The menu is going to be upgraded from what Rosario's had, in addition to some very creative and interesting pizzas, they're going to have calamari plant- based foods, vegetarian meatballs and hamburgers poppers, it's going to be a more rounded menu than what Rosario's had when we submitted this. It was actually almost an administrative approval because it is beer and wine with a midnight close. The reason why we were asked the reason why we were told we were asked to come tonight is because on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, even though beer Online service will end at midnight, we would remain open until four in the morning and Joellen you can correct me, will I do not think it's 5 A.M. I think it's 4 A.M, no, it's 4:00 A.M, it's four A.M! So again, seven days a week at beer and wine only until midnight and then during the week when beer and wine service ends at midnight, the place will close only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Will it stay open, passed out without beer and wine service? It is a small place. There are eight tables, 16 seats, so Donald just so you know it does not. It does not qualify for it admitted through sort of approval if alcohol service ends at 12., the business has. To close, I understand it. I understand that. That's what that's right. I know you said. That's the only reason, but that's like a principal reason that that's just how the administrative approval process is. That's why I said the reason why we reason why we're told to come here is because we're not closing the business at midnight, those nights. So that's why we're here, as I said, we're applying for a letter of no objection according to the architect, even though legal occupancy can be 74, the maximum intended occupancy is 27.. So this is a small place. It's been operated as a pizza place for 55 years. We're going to continue to do that, upgrading the food and all of the other conditions that you would normally request, and if we missed some checks in the box, I thought a supplemental questionnaire had been sent to the office. Maybe you did not get that. I do not know any doors and windows will close by 10 p.m. It'll be background, recorded music, only there's no outdoor space and all of the other stipulations that you normally had. We will agree to. I think this says that the facade is closed. I'm sorry, it does not have the doors or windows. Sure questionnaire says wisdom. Windows will close by 10 pm 11 pm, whatever your policy is whatever you're, probably here, no the, but the questionnaire says that the facade is fixed. The question is what, because there are no, there are no open doors or windows other than the entrance. Well, that it is the interest doors that are the french doors, they're double doors they're putting in a new door. That's going to be no dining yeah go ahead; no, it's not it's! It always had double french doors. I mean we're just painting or we're putting in a new door, because the old one is old, the other. The other windows are stationary. They do not open. Yes, I understand that. Okay, there anything else. Well, I would just reiterate that Rosario's was open to 5 A.M, but we're choosing not to be to 4 A.M and the menu is quite extensive. We put in a whole new kitchen so that we can do much more than just pizza and, of course, in the Covid-19 environment, we're looking for the delivery service and contactless purchasing. We have an app so that you can pre- order and that so that we're not dealing with a lot of people in the store for long periods of time. Okay, is that it? If you have any questions, we'd be happy to answer the questions. Why is it? Why does the notice say tavern with minimal food and the identification as a pizza place with a prep area as opposed to a kitchen when you're talking about upgrading the menu and becoming having you an even more expansive menu than the previous business yeah, I'm not sure it may have been. That was the information we got when the notice went out, but we'll modify that unless, if necessary, we'll send an amendment notice, but you have the menu I've just never seen unless there is not like an accompanying bar and I'm not saying that there is here, but I've just never seen a pizza place, not identify itself as a restaurant yeah. I think I think Donald needs to amend that yeah. We can change that. There is no bar in this in this place. There's no bar there's a place where you can walk up and get food and order there there's no bar, it's a it has to be amended to a restaurant, and I think the comment about the prep is very early on. We were not sure that we could configure the kitchen to the degree that we did, but we had a terrific consultant and we were able to do it so that now we can offer this broad- based menu to the community. Okay, does anybody else have any questions or comments and are there any speakers do not does any? Would anyone like to speak to this item that is still on? I signed up to speak yeah, okay, David yeah, so again this is. This is Orchard Street Harry the dog is diagonally acrosss. The street people beat him acrosss the street too, and they've become a very noisy neighbor. Eden too, stinking is just a few steps away. They've become a very noisy neighbor. The skinny has a two decade running of being an incredibly noisy neighbor, even during the cool bid times. So this is not just Orchard Street, but this specific corner has some really serious problems with noise and people having trouble sleeping Rosario was open, which was only 20 years, not 55, even though we did not have a liquor license. There would still be cars stopping in the street waiting on food to be delivered to their car to go and they'd be blasting, their radios and music. You know two three four o'clock in the morning and nothing was ever done about that. Currently the facade is fixed. It should remain that way and I think doors and windows closed at 10, P.M or when music is being played. That's fair. We do not intend to be the noisy neighbor, I'm a little disturbed to hear that the occupancy can be as high as it as stated talking about the 74 and not the not the 24, but from what I've seen in your layout, it looks like you're going to keep it pretty much the way Rosaria was. I live in the building, I'm two floors above yeah well, first kind of if I can address that. First of all, we checked on the stipulation the provision about closing everything by 10 pm or whenever amplified sound is playing. So we've already agreed to that yeah. That's about all. I have to say so you try to get the wrong fact that you still want two nights at four o'clock and the next day. I'm sorry was that a question. I can hear that, I'm sorry, we did not hear that. Are you still by saying you agree with that when yours close still means that you you're still thinking about the two days at four o'clock in the morning closing yeah once they're, you mean closing the doors and windows? No, I'm talking about the hours anyway yeah. I mean we're actually closing earlier than Rosario's because they stayed open later we're closing at midnight during the week. Did you never lick a license? I understand that, but they, but they stayed open. Later I mean they were open. They did not have my license. I know that I know they did not have a license, but their hours were till 4 am when we're open till 4 am we're not going to be selling beer and wine that late we're going to be ending the service of beer and wine at midnight, okay, so late night hours, there's not going to be any beer and wine consumed or sold in our premises. So why told unnecessary? I still do not see the necessary four. If you're not going to sell beer and wine, what's the reason 42 hours or three yeah, it says actually four hours there's still going to be serving pizza. I mean you're talking about a neighborhood where you know you're concerned. There are a lot of bars, I think, having a place where people can go eat and get something to eat. Obviously, is it it's a good thing to have and they've been doing that night? This gentleman said 20 years, the sign says they're been around since 1963. Maybe they were located somewhere else. I do not know they were all okay and Houston Street, okay, that they got by though somewhere near the cats right there. So I know where they are, because I've been here for 50, something. I think if I think, if they, if they've been around for that long in the neighborhood, then there's obviously a need if they closed as a result of Covid-19 that that's obviously a huge operation. But if they've managed all these years to operate selling pizza, there is a demand and need that serves the community and because of the upgrade to the menu and the food and putting in a full kitchen in the basement. We want to be able to serve beer and wine, we're not looking for full alcohol. This is not an on- premises, I'm not against the bureau, but I do not see the extra yeah people seem to want it. Okay, yeah people want it, because people want after they're at the bars they want the drunk pizza. I do not I'm not. I do not have the energy right now to discuss that any further. I I'm not opposed to this. It's a logistical nightmare to try and enforce stopping serving alcohol. I know you say you're going to, but your manager's there, someone comes in at one. They want to buy another beer, it's going to happen, but that's I do not know there's I would I would I understand you making that comment, but I think again you know we have. We have to be good neighbors and we're not we're not out to make that extra buck we're we are as committed, and I know until you we live with you and you see it. We are as committed to not being a part of what you've referenced is happening elsewhere on the street, we're serving great food during the time period, where we can add the Craft, Beer, Micro, Beers and some very good organic wines. We would like to do that. Otherwise, we're just serving food and we're keeping to almost the same hours as Rosario's, because we think there's a need for that and a lot of it we think, will be delivery, not necessarily because people during Covid-19 the delivery side of the business has increased dramatically. Yes, we have one more speaker that is signed up. Dm go ahead. Go ahead, go ahead, I'll, be quick about it. First Donald I think we had confusion. It was thank you for saying, an email that I did not get. We discussed that it was not 120. I think he wrote 120 orchard. I think he meant this application, so I apologize for that. Oh yeah, would you wrote to me 120 orchard? Okay? Nonetheless, you know this is a beer and wine. We know we do not have a lot of room to really push back on anything, but I would like to state for the record just a couple of concerns. I just want clarification that basement's not there's no plan in the future to be anything in that basement, but a kitchen yeah, just back of house no patrons in the basement ever- and this is not one of those situations like in six months- we're going to upgrade to liquor right away or anything like that. Is that what we're thinking about this space and no, what is going and my other question is Joellen. You have you and your son and another partner. Forgive me, I forget his name had Michael Richie, oh yeah Michael did you have the place kitty corner to Rosario's? Is that still happening at 99? Stanton? No, oh! So that's no longer that's a covered casualty. Yes, that's the word okay, so I just okay, so this will be your only spit. This would be your only space in the neighborhood right. Okay, yes, and I invite you anytime to come down to the basement and if you did, you would chuckle because there's no way anybody, that's what a clarification, because you know that basement was yeah. It was just a concern. So my only thing Alex is, you know. You know I just we just hope that you know there's not much. We can do here, but we hope that we can adjust it's sad, that we lost rosario's, because that was an institution and we know that people did you know the pizza thing at night at five name could be a little annoying, but he's been there forever since Houston and now here, so that's a sad loss for the neighborhood. So I just want to state that I have a question on the basement. I think the basement is accessible only through the sidewalk hatch, no there's a staircase down to the basement in Interior, but it's very steep. It would not be something that you would invite a customer. We have our. We have some desks down there. We have our soda machines down there. We have our freezer down. You know a freezer, it's a prep area nobody's going to have customers coming down to the basement. I do not even go down the basement because I do not like the stairs okay. We can include that in the reservation. Does anybody Clint spoke? Does anybody else sign Herman Ellen? Do you want to say anything I can get it? Yes, I do not know ellen just got her. She muted, she said. No. She finds him okay. So then I'll go to the making of a resolution, which is that- and I did look up three hours for rosario. It was three and five, so five Friday and Saturday three other nights at least the advertised hours that I was looking at online, so so aware of clause that this is an application for a beer wine license. What the elements of the application are. I will include a basement used for kitchen and storage. What the prior use of was of the location that it was at previously an unlicensed pizza place that had been opened at that location for 20 years, but had a history in the neighborhood that went back many decades that, given that this applicant is seeking to operate a similar business with similar hours of operation, it is agreed to end alcohol service by 12 A.M. We would approve, with stipulations governing expectative operation being operating as a full- service pizza, restaurant, with a kitchen, open and serving food. All hours would be 12 P.M to 12 A.M Monday through Thursday, 12 P.M to 4, A.M, fridays and saturdays. What oh no sorry, never mind. I was reversing it when you said Kitchen open serving food, yes, kitchen, open and serving food all hours, just not alcohol, go on. Sorry! Let me just get clarified. Well was the four A.M Joelle on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or just Friday Saturday. I believe that Rosario's was Friday, Saturday and Sunday yeah. I think we've got Friday Saturday, okay, Friday Saturday, it's really Sunday! When I look at Rosaria's online, it says five o'clock, Friday and Saturday and three o'clock all the other days when I, when I looked them up originally they had Sunday, not that. I think that we necessarily would that's. Okay, we can amend that. Then we can do just Friday and Saturday. I thought I was just following Rosario's, so so 12 P.M to 12 A.M Sunday through Thursday and 12 P.M to 4, A.M, Friday and Saturday, with alcohol service ending at 12 A.M all day. No, no commercial uses outdoor space, a closed, fixed facade with no open doors or windows and the entrance door, if you prop it open closing at 10 by 10 pm or when amplified sound, is playing all right. Alex was that confirmed as a fixed facade or not yes, so recorded background music, no dj's live music, promoted and scheduled performances or events with covers no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited drink, specials, happy hours to 8 pm, no wait lines up. Stat aside and somebody responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside. Well, I think we checked that someone would be responsible for monitoring outside. That's what I said. Okay, I said somebody responsible staff person responsible for overthinking crowds. Annoying us or people annoys outside okay. Is there a second or an amendment I'll? Second, thank you, clint all in favor, aye, okay, for you donald. You want me to send a stipulation form to you. Yes, please Alex man, ask you did get in facade stays fixed, correct, yeah! Okay, thank you, yeah. I wish you could send that to me. Okay, all right! That's it. Thank you. Thank you good night, good night. Thank you good night good night. Moving on to item number 14. yeah, please sorry! For the later dollars. Sorry, my son is marco. Originally that's my son's account. So I'm so sorry about that. That's, okay! I apologize is your applicant here. Yes, he is, he was he Michael Camacho yeah he was hello. Oh you were signed in under you actually signed in under a different name. I think I said: can you just tell us your name again, because your page does not yep perfect? Thank you. Okay. So this is. It says: application for a restaurant with a full menu recording with ignore outdoor space on the ground floor and basement. That's the notice we do not. This is for the location that was Ruby. We do not have electronic history for us, but I told our own history, so we had an application in February of 2000 for for a restaurant with recorded music, no outdoor space, we had another application in septem and August of 2000 for no outdoor space, restaurant, no outdoor space and the addition of live music consisting of a piano, and we made a resolution in September of 2000 that we would approve the op license for that location provided applicant would not change the method of operations. Data in the questionnaire that we received and facade at 10 pm. The present application is, it says, for a cfo of 30, but that does not make sense with three tables and 12 seats inside 30 seats in the backyard and 10 seats out of sidewalk Cafe note: a 25 foot bar with four stools: hours of 5 P.M to 4 A.M, all days inside closing at 10 pm Sunday through Wednesday 11 pm Thursday through Saturday outside a kitchen open all hours, but then in the stipulations it says less than a full service kitchen. A closed facade, no television live entertainment level, music from 7, P.M to 11, P.M, all day, promoted events and scheduled performances, but no events photography. One security guard all days from seven to 11, existing sound proofing, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours and they're both filled out so no happy hours or happy hours ending at 8 pm. When I say both it's both sections of the questionnaire that say either no happy hour should be checked off or when they would end by no wait line. Staff outside the applicant counted 10 ops within 500 seats, with no license experience, but no similar experience. And then I sent a notification to Mrs Ruiz, because this is zoned r7ac15, and this is a long- standing jazz venue which I know to have scheduled performances which are not consistent with zoning and which I also looked up, and I saw Yelp reviews reflecting from 2009 through 2020 cover fees, service, charges for the band and music donations and also reflecting regular, scheduled performances. The background the backyard seems to have been used in the past, because people who patronized location on reference go into it in yelp they called the secret backyard, but it's never been part of the. It was not part of the original application. It's never been part of any of the renewal notices, although the type of music over on the over the course of the renewals has changed from live music to recording music, to live music and recorded music to no music specified to recorded music- and I do not know whether or not there's ever been a sidewalk cafe here. This is Avenue B. A lot of there are not many sidewalk cafes, and if there has never been one, then the applicant has to apply separately and we would not consider it as part of this application go ahead. There's your opportunity to make a presentation or a statement about the application or clarify any of the information. Thank you so much for taking all of these a few promises. Can you just speak up? Please because you sound very far away. Oh excuse me. Sorry. Okay, it's still a little difficult to hear you actually you know. Do you know where your mic is on your computer or your phone? It's my son's! I have. This is the only microphone that I have in my house. So this is the first time I'm using it. So it's my son's computer. So when you move the last time it was a little quieter. So, whichever I think you move, when you got closer, it was quiet. It was better to easier, that's better! That's a little better! Yes, yeah! Okay, great there you go. Okay has been the manager of the premises for almost six years he's taking over the existing locations of purchase acid. You know furniture, pictures and equipment. He wants to be able to keep the life of entertainment he's. He does not. One looks to charge any type of cover charge and he must be able to, and I understand because I did a couple of four requests and everything. So I understand from looking at everything between the history and everything else that certain things you know were not, you know properly done, but he's looking to be able to take over the place and keep the premises. You know quiet and seem you know community friendly and everything else. I'm sorry, I'm still having a lot of trouble. Hearing you sorry. I can try repeating I'm thinking, I'm sorry, I'm trying to find the right angle. Can you hear me yeah? Let me see if I understood what you said, you said he's been the manager for six years, that he's purchased the assets that he wants to continue having the live music, that he's not going to have cover fees, and then I think you may have said something about the outdoor space and being in a difficult place, but I'm not sure that I heard correctly I kind of missed considering that last part because he broke out a little bit. Did you say anything with respect to wanting to use the outdoor space? Yes, okay, what did you say so he's looking to use the backyard outdoor area? The only reason he's using it front, outdoor area at the moment is because of Covid-19 and because everything has to be outdoor dining at the moment. So when he references the sidewalk cafe, he just represent reference that he's referencing. Now what he's using as part of the executive order and the city CEO? Okay, yeah, are not part of the asphalt, because the outdoor is not like it's not legally licensed for outdoor cafe and it's only being used right now because of the because of the executive order. Okay, all right so, but he wants to continue operating as a restaurant, serving having a kitchen and serving well. Is there a kitchen because it said two different things, because kitchen in one area says less than a kitchen and another area, so there is a kitchen limited food menu, it's not a full- service restaurant, but then serve food service all hours, yes, but we'll be available. Also, you know open hours of operation. So if it's not a full service restaurant, what is it? It's? A restaurant bar, a restaurant, it's more of a bar, tavern, okay, so go ahead! Is there anything you wanted to say? Thank you for your time, inspiration, but we're. I would consider us I'm sorry. I can't hear you either. I consider us as a with really good food and healthy, like I can give you a description of that. If you like okay, so then how do you have live music now and what's your intention in terms of having live music going forward, we just have live music from seven to nine, it's jazz. It's like. I call it wallpaper for the environment, more than anything, ruby, a very special atmosphere about it's very romantic to the very hot date spot. Instead of background purposes. You know how you like play background music, yeah same kind of thing. Okay, so I mean you can have music that accompanies your method of operation as a restaurant or a tavern full- service, restaurant, half service restaurant. However, it's identified, but Ruby has always had scheduled performances and it has had covers, and those things can't be part of, and I just have to repeat it, even though I sent an email about it, those things can't be part of the zoning, because the zoning for this location, it's the zoning, that I've brought up multiple times with other locations that prohibits scheduled performances and events and events with cover fees and also patron dancing. But I do not have any reason to believe that any of your patrons are dancing, which is why I'm not referencing it here, but there is like I mean it, has a big sign on it. That says, basically, you know a jet very jazz venue and it's there are many references to the regular scheduled jazz and covers so it has happened in the past that we're hearing this now is why we're addressing it now, because there are many places that are not operating necessarily consistent with what the zoning requires and when we usually raise it with people is when they're coming before us and that's why I'm bringing it up now, but you know we could approve live music. We can't approve anything, that's scheduled or is accompanied by covers, and the idea of people paying a charging a service charge to. I know, but your patrons who patronize you know: you've been the manager there over the course of years, they're referencing being charged a service charge for the ban. That's the same thing: a required charge, that's the same thing as a cover charge for the band. I think it's perceived the same way right. You understand that sure do sure do, but we're not doing that anymore. We tried it. We learned the hard way it did not work for people and the musicians play for tips. Basically, so so, and there's no cover charge as we speak, the community loves the music. You know so, but that's easy for the scheduling we do not. The owner was always scheduling music, but on and off the years from what I understand so, but we do not have schedule and there's no cover, that's okay and then in terms of the backyard, when were you proposing opening it because I only have proposed closing hours? I do not know I'm just I'm trying to feel my way through this, and this is the first time that the outdoor really was an actor because of pandemic, and so I'm learning. I think she was just referring to the opening hours, not when you're yeah opening hours, not during not when you're doing pandemic. Oh I'm! Sorry, I'm sorry! That's! Okay! That's! Okay! Your business opens at five, so the backyard can't open before five correct and we we're actually we've been opening at six. To be quite frank, so the five o'clock is during normal under pre- copy, where for happy hour we would open up with five, but we're not doing that now. You know the neighborhood's kind of quiet, so six o'clock reason. You know we would open at six if we can and then we would not go very late. That's for sure I was thinking during the week we'd stay open until 10 the kitchen keep the kitchen open till 10 and on the weekends like Friday Saturday night until 11.. If that's doable, okay- and it says the number of seats you're proposing to have in the backyard, do you have tables and then how many we have tables 15 tables, 15 little round tables. Do you have two top tables outside? Yes? Are they regular tables? Are they high top tables, regular tables? Okay, all right does anybody else have any questions we did have someone that wanted to speak. Laura's soul requested to speak, oh laura, why are you muted, oops? Okay, there you go sorry, I just wanted to make sure we could all see each other. I just wanted to share some observations because I this is on my route between where I work and where I live and hello Rosa, it's nice to see you again and your dog is adorable. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, I've started I've started it now. Okay, so I just have a few questions. The right now, the music is basically happening in the yes see this. There's no point in my talking till this is over Am I might as well get like yeah she's starving. I bet go ahead, all right so yeah. I just want to share some observations, so the music is now like in the front window and then the people who are in the curbside care plane seating. You know watch which is what's happening, so you know it when it was contained. I okay, I've lived in the neighborhood a long time, not as long as Herman but a long time so when it was contained within the building. I was always glad I did not live in that building, but you know I get. I get that people like it, you know and who does not like jazz now that it is on the block, I'm glad I do not live on the block, because as much as I like it, I would not, and it is, I have to say it has been a short window. You know which is tolerable, I think, but it is. It is consistent and now I'm glad I do not live on the block, because I lit you hear it as soon as you hit 10th or 11th street. It's not amplified, but it's jazz, some somebody's playing a horn instrument. You can hear it so I might. What I'm curious about is the backyard aspect how people are coming for the music? So how will it work in the backyard are? Will there be speakers out there where you hear what's going on you know outside or how? What's that going to be? Like that's a great, no more, not at all. I know it's been a little kind of hectic between public and everything you know and everybody's trying to get their feel their weight around everything. But it's that's. Not this type of environment and you've been around long enough to know that this is not that type of establishment. So well, I want to hear what are what the plans are for this rather than because it's different we've had I've been here since through several different incarnations. You know, and I have to say the music's much better now than it was at when the frat boys were sitting in with their horn to impress their girls, but, but I just I just want to know what the plans are specifically for the backyard without making you know getting into personalities or anything just you know sure. Well I have to make this illusion here. I was nobody here knows that I have a music background, so I was a pop star in the 80s. I have a jazz background as well Beverly hills where I was like the Quote Unquote Sinatra of Beverly Hills. I was very successful at sounding like wallpaper, meaning I had to be at a low volume having dinner and it could not be too loud. So I have a real, intrinsic appreciation for volume being at a listenable level, so people can speak and talk while drinking and eating. So as far as the backyard is concerned, I'm not playing doing any music in the back backyard at all. Okay, that's all! I really need needed to know so if we could get that in the stipulations, if there are stipulations for this, that would be great. My other issues that I've heard from the open street folks for one thing it does get, it does get very crowded on the sidewalk there. The chorale is fine, and I know everyone's trying to maximize all they have but b is super narrow. So just a it's a it's been. We've constantly asked certain restaurants, and I also I represent the East Village community coalition. We are have long been small business supporters, so I get all sides of this, but just to just to remind everyone that the staff that the sidewalk is not theirs, it belongs to the people who are walking up and down. So that's just that's just an important thing that I think will help in the long term with the whole open street program, and it's really easy to be. You know you you're focused as a server on the people in the corral and not on the people using the sidewalk, but it's just an important thing to remember and the same thing goes for the street. I've heard there's been some double parking yeah, it's so difficult. I know you have you know you have you have the ash people delivering food yeah and then you have. You also have the ubers and I have I'm constantly reprimanding these guys for double parking. You know like that and it's just it drives me up a wall. I can't well- and I can't it's hard to mitigate you know. I understand. Restaurant owners are being asked to police a lot of stuff. They never had to even think about before, but it is, it is an issue. So it's just something to it's particularly, you know be sure it's not your patrons or whatever it's not my patrons, because they would. I would never allow that no way, no way. I'm really like staunch about a lot of things. So I'm very careful and mindful about that, but as far as the staff, I just wanted to ask you so you're, suggesting that the staff stay on the inside, that they've served the customers and not yeah this. It's not just you. It's just a general tendency that the sidewalk becomes a weight station and it is not it's a place for pedestrians to walk it's very narrow. If we came and measured, I do not think we'd find eight feet, so let's not have to go there right and just pull it back a little bit. I think that would be very helpful, easy, that's easy, real easy and as far as the zoning and what's permitted here, I will. I will leave that to the committee thanks for the opportunity to speak. Thank you, okay. Does anybody else, have any questions or comments? Anybody from the committee you want to go to the making of resolution Herman! No I'll just you know just comment that you know I've up and down having to be quite frequently, and I find the jazz music quite pleasant when I'm walking up and down the street. What I do not know is if I did live on, that block hearing it constantly for hours. If I was trying to do something else might be frustrating, but there are I mean you have had quite a few 311 complaints and a lot of them are non- crime corrected, which means the police showed up and did something they talked to. Someone does not mean they cited you, but it's just something to consider, and you know I guess I know the stuff is not amplified if it's in your front window, but I have a feeling- that's maybe going to just take care of itself at some point soon, anyways with the temperature dropping so, and we also spoke with alexis of the 12th, the 12Th Street Black Association, and I wanted to make sure that there was no complaints or any issues or whatever, and she then was. She said there was no complaints and I asked if she want to have a meeting with anyone else, and she said she would get back to me. Yeah there's been just in the last six months, there's been 25 and then, when I went down through here, there's counting roughly one two, three four five, six, seven, eight nine it looks like there was at least ten of those without going further that we're non- crime corrected. But again that just means the police showed up and found that you know does not mean excited you but yeah. I think I do not think 12th street would really be the issue unless you go in music comes into the backyard. I belong to the gardens on 12th street and we would not hear it unless it was in the backyard it's residents of Avenue B, who are impacted. But again, I think you know, with the cold weather you're not going to be hanging out the windows much longer anyways. So very thing and again this is like a learning curve. You know, as Laura said it's covered, so times are a little different right now, just going forward after code is over. I do not think you should continue doing that. Can we go to the making of a resolution? Now then yep, I'm ready for that all right, so, whereas what the applicant is applying for what the elements of the application are, what the history is of the location the history is approved by us and when the license was issued, what the zone and after elements of application, I guess I would put in that the applicant is purchasing the business and has been the manager for six years and intending to maintain the business name and method of operation. That's all right. Where is what the zoning is for the location, what the zoning prohibitions are for the location and that the business had operated with scheduled performances and cover fees, as well as service charges for bands playing, but the applicant has now stated that he would not have those things as part of the method of operation consistent with the zoning, and it's that I'll put in also that Laura spoke and what her concerns were with respect to the noise to the potential noise from outside, as well as emanating from the business and also at the beginning. I'll put the the applicant represented that it was not applying for a sidewalk cafe as part of this application, because it's the notice so that we had. I would then say that we would support this application. The one thing Alex is that they would not have music in the backyard. No I'm just I'm going to. I think I can make awareness clause about that, but I certainly can go to stipulations. Oh okay! Yes, that's fine! Sorry, I'm sorry! I'm getting canceled, also a number of lps in the area, and whereas, given that this is a long- standing business and the applicant is going to maintain the business name and method of operation, we would support this application for full on premises. Liquor licenses stipulations governing its method of operation with the following stipulations and consistent with voting with the following stipulations, which would be operating at the american restaurant tavern with a kitchen open and survey food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation on for the interior of 5 pm to 4 A.M all day with a just one minute, with a closed facade with no open doors or windows nope. There are open windows, though. Oh I'm sorry, because it's a closer cloud- and I just heard that from Laura- has closed this on the application. So then it would be windows closing at 10 pm or whenever there's any amplified sound, which would include sound from live music, which is specifically stated in the simulation. So okay at 10 pm, then it would be, I'm sorry so recorded and live music, and here it says, entertainment level. What you described was background level, I'm not quite sure, and it sounds like it's entertainment level rather than background levels, I'm not quite sure how to identify that the sound level. So there will be live entertainment, but it will always be at background level. Okay, so it's recorded in live background level; music, yes, no djs, no promoted, event, schedule, performances or events with covers, there's no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses and what's the answer about happy hours because both which were checked off it said no happy hours or happy hours well, happy hour, 28 pm. Yes, I'm sorry happy hour and eight okay, happy hours, 2:8 p.m. No unlimited drink, specials, no wait lines outside and staff outside, so staff outside means someone who's just responsible for overseeing people and noise outside not somebody who's outside all the time. Yes, we'll speak to security, because security is something that was listed in the questionnaire I have not addressed, but with respect to the backyard. So it would be a backyard with no more than 15 tables. Yes, 30 seats. Yes, I'm just going to do hours of 6 P.M to 10 P.M all day yeah, so the weekdays and 11 P.M on the weekend yeah I know, but let's see, let's see we just made the one just down the street. Did not the restaurant Jose Lewis did not. We make them close their backyard at nine Michael. Are you okay, 10 P.M, seven days a week? I could do that. If that's what that's what they prefer, I think 10 people would be better. I think we made the thai place or the Italian Thai Mediterranean, whatever they are: nine and they're, 186 or 180. I think the only one that's open longer has been like a long- standing backyard yeah. I believe he's open till 10, but does not matter Alex. Can you repeat the number of tables in the backyard and see all right what I said: 15 and 30. 15 tables 36., 15 tables 36, yes, yeah decent size, so I'm okay! Well, so what would? What do you want to do with respect to the backyard okay? He said he was okay with 10 pm days, yeah, six pm to 10 pm all day, no music in the backyard done, okay and that door closed whenever there's any amplified fan that applies to the backyard door too. So it's any front or rear entrance door and doors have to be closed. Whenever there's any amplifiers found, because I know people have a tendency to prop open their back door, then, with respect to security, he has one security guard all days from 7 pm to 11 pm. Does anybody want to have that's the only outstanding stipulation? Yes, no on the weekends, because we're open until 12? Now I usually have the security guy stay until you know until midnight? Is that okay? So what is it? 7 P.M to 12 A.M usually comes in at 6:00 6 to 12.. He also is also acting as a mature d as well seating, which, days all day, he's there Wednesday through Saturday all right now I had a guy on Sunday through Tuesday, but I had to let him go so okay, but is it your idea that you would have somebody there all day, all the days yeah? I prefer it. You know, even though it's not we're not like a typical bar, where there's a lot of nonsense that goes on, but I prefer because I like to protect the sanctity of the people who are dating there's a lot of a lot of like tinder and okay, a lot of people that are there and we have a history of people meeting and getting engaged. We've had some engagement celebrations there and they get married and they come back. So I do not Wanna, I'm just going to put I'm just going to put one security guard from 6 P.M to 12 A.M as needed. Yes, all right, all right: okay, okay! Is there a second or any amendment for this resolution? No. Second. Thank you Herman all in favor, yes, hi! Yes, all right rosa! Do you want me to send the stipulation to you? Yes, please, okay, all right, that's it! Okay, that's how you're going to get good email from the Community Board Office. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Okay, good night, good night you're welcome all right. Moving on to number 16.. This is an lp application for 218 avenue, a for a tavern with minimal food. I see John and Michael. Kelly are here there for that application. Tavern with minimal food recorded music dj's, know outdoor space on the first floor. Okay, this location was previously the horse box. It was last approved an op license in February of 2010 the stipulations to have hours of 12 pm to 4 A.M all day, employee security. At all times, I recorded background music only have a close to God. The Cfo is 74 five table 16 seats, the 20 foot put 22 foot by nine foot bar with 21 stools. 12 pm to 4 am all day a prep area serving food to within one hour of closing, consisting of burritos and pizza. That's what stayed in the questionnaire closed facade not available, no agreement about no wait lines. There is an agreement to have a staff person responsible for patrons and noise outside the apple king. Had nine ops within 500 feet. I also counted one pending one and he's operated numerous businesses in the area, including another business, on Avenue, a so okay, your opportunity to make a presentation or a statement. I had some things in John did not speak there. Yeah, I'm sorry did you say you have something good? Is that what you said? Hopefully it's a little early for me. John did speak to Andrew Karami, who had concerns about outdoor seating, which we won't have, except possibly open restaurant seating due to Covid-19 he's happy it's going to stay a sports bar in the neighborhood one. We will be trying to hire some of the old staff back because they're, the ones who know the regular customers that come in nobody lives on the second or third floors at this time and John has spoken to the resident on the fourth floor, which he can speak to. Basically, the only change that's going to happen is the ownership and John. As you know, an accomplished operator on the lower East side. Okay, go ahead, you want to say something: no, you said it all other than some paint and cleaning up a few things. You know the staff did not realize that they were going to be out of work. They thought they were coming back, so I actually reached out to maybe four or five of the old staff, so they're going to be coming back, they're looking forward to it and, like I said, we're not really changing anything, it's going to stay the same and look the same other than some paint and some pictures, and I really do not want to deal with the outdoor seating. I already I'm dealing with it now and it's chaotic enough- and I made that clear to the landlord, but the only way I would have to deal with it is if you know something happens in the summer and it closes down again where I had no choice because obviously I'm on the hook for the rent, but I did make a deal with him. You know when we do have a lower capacity to pay lower rent. The only way is that they shut things down totally where I could not have anybody inside and I'm going to have no choice but to deal with the seats outside. But realistically I do not want to deal with any more seats outside you know. I've had it it's chaotic to deal with, and it's you know enough. Okay, can you serve the burritos and pizza all hours, not within one hour quickly? Did you say during your portion that the closed fixed facade are? Do not those windows open John? Oh they do not. Okay, I looked I mean unless I missed something, but no I just I was remembering them opening, but I was not positive. Okay. Does anybody have any comments or questions? No, I think I'm fine with this. Okay, all right. So then I'll do the making of a resolution which will state that this is an application for an op license. What the elements of the application are when the last location was approved, when the license was issued. What the history is for this applicant, the number of licenses in the area that the applicant has stated said he will maintain the method of operation and some of the staff of the pre- existing business and given that this was a previously licensed location and that the applicant intends to operate it in the same way at and with some of the same step. We would approve this with stipulations governing the method of operation, those being that it operates with a as a tavern with less than a full service kitchen throwing food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation of 12 pm to 4 A.M all day, all day, no commercial use of the outdoor areas, a closed fix, a spot with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no djs live music, promoted events with covers or scheduled performances, no alteration without first coming before the community board, no pub calls or party buses happy hours. Dave. Excuse me: okay, you're asking for just writing down what the happy hours are. What happy hours to 8 pm? Okay right, that's, not true! No unlimited, drink specials, no wait lines! No! Wait! Lights, John, if you can help it no wait lines and stuff outside it's a small space right, 650 square feet: yeah! Okay, so was there an there's, one security? So what is it one security guard at the door, thursdays through saturdays from win to win. I usually I'm not sure what that space. Yet I sometimes have them coming eight o'clock, nine o'clock, I'm not 100 sure, but till four in the morning. You want to just put it: you want it for 8 o'clock, yeah sure 8 pm to closing yes, okay! Is there a second okay or any amendment? Second, okay, all right Michael! You want me to send it to you. Yes, please does you do John? Do you want to be included? I do not think I have your email, though you want me to type it on this thing, yeah. That would be fine. How old? Is it your computer? You know whose computer is making that noise because he's muted, so it's your computer or I think it's as my mother would say the internet that I'm hearing it's just tired. It's worn out yeah! That's how my computer feels. After all this, okay, I'm tired and worn out- oh there, it goes okay, one more! I got it, you got it okay! All right, I will send the office will send you the stipulation. Okay, all right! Thank you awesome. Thank you guys, take care, Mike and moving on to number 17. rosa. Are you also here for number 17? Can you hear me? Okay, are you here for number 17,359 grand street? Yes, oh okay, we thought you were just hanging around because you enjoyed yeah and Emily is also here. For that jedi mind I set up my son's computer and I'm still trying to figure out how to use it, but you sound louder. So is emily the applicant no the apple here, where is the applicant he's home, taking care of newborns? He tried to stay on, but they woke up. I guess we'll have to decide what we do about that, because generally we have to have the applicant present to hear an application, but we'll see, I understand the circumstances in the late hour, we'll see how it goes, but he's a long- time operator he's been in operation for over 30 years. No adverts, history, no complaints, no violations. He owns a bunch of places throughout the city pick a bagel. Some places have liquid licenses some places. Do he owns Friedman's lunch pick a bagel and he does a bunch of deli places. No lately establishments, it's a very family oriented business, okay, so the this is an application, then, at the location that was previously randall yeah. This is randall. We approved in September of 2017 to operate as a full- service. Barbecue restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 11 am to 1 Sunday through Wednesday 11 am to two thursdays through Saturday having a sidewalk cafe with four tables and eight seats within the building line, without even 12 to 10 all day, closing the facade at 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for adult without coming to us alteration without coming to the community boy. Excuse me having happy hours to 7 pm, they're hosting pub crawls at party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having lane lines and having staff responsible for overseeing people in noise outside this application has a cfo 74:11 tables, 40 seats of 15 football with six stools. No outdoor space, 7 A.M to 11 P.M all day the kitchen open all hours serving american food, a closed facade, no tv's recorded background, there's no promoting events scheduled performances or event, recovery fees, no security, existing sound proofing, no pub calls or party buses; no happy hours, no wait lines and staff outside there was a letter submitted from space, which is a residence association in that area, stating that they support this application because of the moderate hours of operation and the understanding about the what the method of operation which would be, which is as a full- service restaurant. One thing I want to even correct is that I thought I heard you say no outdoor space, your notice said no outdoor space and there is not any outdoor space reference for the questionnaire okay. So, in the outdoor question, when I filled out the questionnaire for the Community board, I filled out cyril. Cafe: 10 seats, rear yard 30 seats. Did you not get that? No? What did you tell me what you what you? Okay, Community Board Questionnaire? Oh she's, right Alex, it's on the questionnaire not on the application for the SLA. So that was the title for the Community Board, I said. Excuse me, so I can't pay. 10 seats read your 30 seats and I gave a diagram reflecting that well yeah. So I do not remember that when I went through this questionnaire, the application on the questionnaire at least the one that I downloaded today was sidewalk. Cafe: 10 seats back patio 16 seats. I have it here. I have 30 and this is the only copy I have, because this is the copy I scanned over to the Future Board. I did not change anything. Oh yeah, I mean this is just the one I downloaded earlier right before the meeting from the website. You know I do not understand, but it's the only copy that I have and that's the only thing I sent over to the Community Board. Oh yeah, I see what point says: Sidewalk Cafe 10 seeds, patio 16., but did you give a diagram that reflects what that looks like? I did because I purposely had their architect send it over to me, so I can send it over to you the only well, the only I do not. There is no diagram. All I see is a drawing of the blocks hold on yeah because, like I'm just looking for everything I mean I do not. I do not think we'd have an issue with the space within the building line. That's in front of the business. I do not know what the space behind the business looks like and those strips are different behind each of them. So it's hard to, and there was not. This was before Randall's. It was. This was an unlicensed location. It's always been a rant. Well, it looks random beforehand. I know that. That's all a lot of open spaces and I'm so sorry, you know what you're right. I was still in room. I apologize, which is why I was looking at 30.. It's I'm looking. It is 16. That's my fault! Oh that's! Okay! It's late! I was in Ruby. That's my fault, I'm sorry! Okay! So it's ten on the front sidewalk cafe and sixteen yeah, I'm sorry in the back Tennessee and ten, and what is that it just says seats. Is that five tables ten seats? What are you talking about? I do not, and I do not see the backyard yeah. I do not see the diagram okay, so one second, I just see the interior and tables outside and 16 in the patio. No, but is it five tables in 10 seats outside it's? He always does everything even numbers, so 4 divided into 16.. I'm sorry. What does that mean? Well that well, 16 seats with four tops would be four or four tops, but in front it's just ten. So is that five two tops or two four tops and a two top? No it's! He always does everything even well. What's the 10, then two fives, two fives, do you think it's two tables in this and then what are the proposed hours for the outdoor space because that's not included so the outdoor space is going to be 10 11.. He always closes his places at by 11.. The only reason I put 12 in the application is be able to give everything to be able to close, but he's a very early establishment, and when is he proposing to open the outdoor space in the front? He always opens early. So he always opens his restaurants by six o'clock in a while without breakfast. But then the cafe will only will only go out, unlike between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, so you're saying it's open between eight and nine o'clock in the morning outside closing at 10 pm. Yes week weekdays, and so then what is weekends, Friday and Saturday? No, he pretty much has his open hours of operation the same the same time, seven days a week, so he normally oh! No, I'm sorry, I heard you say 10 and 11., so I'm just trying to figure out what you're asking for the outside no for the morning he's because he always serves breakfast because he's a very early morning establishment. So he owns the pick of bagels to Friedman's lunch, so he's always open early in the morning to be able to serve breakfast and then he always closes for like 10. I do not even think he's open at 10 o'clock at night, so I'm asking about the outdoor space. So when would the outdoor space be open and when it was phones, the outdoor space will be eight o'clock in the morning to win to 10.? No, oh god he closes the outdoor space about maybe nine o'clock at night eight o'clock at night. Is this something that you're going to need him here for to go through? Oh he's, not a establishment! No, I understand that, but is it? Is it necessary for him to be present so that we can go through what these outdoor uses are going to be? Because I do not want to try to negotiate stipulations and then we have to renegotiate them. It will be eight o'clock in the morning until no late later than 10 o'clock at night. So that's what I asked, but then you said no nine o'clock yeah. So it's outside, you should be eight o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, so you're asking for that for both the sidewalk cafe in the backyard. Yes, okay, okay and I do not know what, because I do not have any photographs- I do not. I know you said: there's big open space behind 359, but some of those places have space behind them and some do not. I do not know what it looks like so it's over there when I looked it up, it looks like it's, not a strip mall. It's all one unit, it's on a very private street with only one story: there's no residences behind! Oh yeah! It's here! I can thank you. So if you zoom into the map, on the left hand, corner yeah, but here you're seeing it's true, it's just so it's right in this trip, because it's nice it's in this little section right here. So it's even shielded. It's shielded a little bit even from the Seward park, co- ops by this, the back of this building, so there's residences going around, but there's nothing right next to it. Okay, so then I think we just have to decide about whether or not we agree with those hours of operation for the outdoor space spaces. You want to go. Do you want me to go to the media resolution, or does anybody have any questions or suggestions? I'm fine! Oh, so you know what the only thing I might say: Grand Street, I'm fine with 8 A.M. I think that's fun. I just wonder if 8 A.M, not that I think it's going to be crowded and loud is, I think it's shielded enough. I think it's probably okay. I think I'm okay with it from what well I was just thinking. 8 am if people were out there at 8 am talking. Are those voices going to carry over no he's really a breakfast joint where he does like his bagels his coffee? I think yeah, I'm okay with it. I was thinking about it, but okay, anybody else, so I'm, okay, all right ellen, are you. Okay. Can we go forward with a resolution? Okay, yeah? Okay, so this applicant is applying for an op license. The next warehouse clause will be the elements of the application, the history of the location when the previous license was issued, the number of ops within 500 feet and the applicant history, and, given that this was a location, was previously operated as the restaurant, the applicant is seeking to operate it in the same way with daytime hours daytime and early evening hours of operation. We would prove with stipulations governing its method of operation, that being that it operates as a full- service, american restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food all hours, indoor hours of operation of 7 A.M to 11 P.M all day, a fixed factor close to the side, with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances, events with covers djs or live music and just no alteration without first coming before us. No pub calls or party buses, no one unlimited drink, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and a staff person responsible for overseeing people and noise outside with respect to outdoor space. The applicant would have a sidewalk cafe within its building line or consisting of two tables in 10 seats and hours of operation of 8 am to 10 pm all days and backyard, seating for dining, consisting of four tables and sixteen seats with hours of operation of eight am to ten pm all days. Okay is there? Does anybody want to amend them? Or does anybody want to? Second, this? Second, all right all in favor, aye? Okay? So so I will send this one to you as well. Just write it down. So before we adjourn with respect to the district needs statement, the needs statement, we have to vote it. There were only two corrections that I was going to make fill language which do not change the substance at all, and they were on the last paragraph that we drafted last month. So in the middle of the paragraph it says the city elected to again allow this use in June of 2020. I was going to take out again and again allow and put continue and the last sentence says these conditions have highlighted the need for sufficient all hours. Enforcement of outdoor dining areas and cafes- and I was just going to put these conditions- have highlighted the need for all hours, enforcement of outdoor dining rooms and cafes, and that's it. Okay, that's good! That's fine with me all right! All right make a motion. Okay, I second it all in favor, hi, all right, four of us, and then we have to this- is still here. We have to jump. Okay. Well, not a surprise, it's very late! Sorry! I knew we would have a lot of things. Yes, I knew we would have a lot of things that would cause some time. It would be painful. Go ahead! You want to do a motion to Adjourn Herman. Did a motion to adjourn okay, everybody in favor ellen you too. Yes, apparently we're supposed to do a roll call vote, but I feel like we're intimate enough at the gathering to not have to do that, because we can not be better. We all. We all acknowledge that we all said think I think I got you all right. Okay, all right! Well, thank you. Thank you.
