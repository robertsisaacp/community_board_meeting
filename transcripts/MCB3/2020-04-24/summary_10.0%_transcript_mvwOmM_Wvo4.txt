Maybe can go over possible dates and we'll shoot it to you and let you know what extra night that will be for another zoom meeting for exec and just or at least until further notice, but right now, I'm, aiming for it 6:30, which is June.
They needed the money to be spent at a community board, a community- based organization, and so Susan and I did not want to make that decision on behalf of the board, because it is it's tough to decide how to spend six thousand dollars and get it to a community- based organization that is doing Covid-19 related work.
We could not use Eric's organization because we sit on the exec right, and so we asked them to come up with some organizations that they already had in on a list, and you know they named one of the organizations, They received the 6,000 dollar reward award on behalf of the community board, so things like that do come up, and so I am just saying to you.
I mean, like questions, come up or decisions that have to be made similar to this decision that we had to do with the find a group of people that need something or whatever you know like anything like that.
Another item that I wanted to talk about was I asked everyone to come up with some ideas of policies that we may need to create during this time.
Was it just making sure that we're meeting as needed and that we're not having people held up for long lengths of time in meetings and I wanted to correct something.
Also, publicly SLA I know that you need to run a little longer because your meetings are on zoom' and I would never limit the amount of time that you need to meet with the applicants for the SLA items that you're seeing And I want to commend you for doing a great job at the moment that you're dealing with all of this stuff, because I know it is difficult to meet with applicants on zoom' and then having to each item needs to be talked about, so I do want to come in Alexandra The SLA chairperson, as Megan, is stepping down in the month of May Sorry, not SLA.
One of the things that we discussed that we're going to ask all the chairs to do is that if your committee is not meeting in any given month, if you would at least take the time 10 minutes, 20 minutes, however long it takes to check in with all of your committee members, you know not necessarily well this check, but just to check in to make sure you know see how they're doing See, if there's any issues they're having related to the community board or things that meet that they want to bring up.
If your committee is meeting- Life, goes on, unfortunately, during the pandemic and a lot of other city agencies are sort of figuring out how to conduct business as usual, and so is the federal government, and that means the Census.
Jackie, yes, I'm, just wondering if I organize a in for most zoom happy hours with my committee, members, do I ballet in the open meeting laws or you should be fine, So you can not discuss community board anything.
I'd, rather not send them for my personal email, but you want me to I I know she was out for medical reasons brewing for at least two months, I, just I'm, assuming that was taken into account when the attend I do not think so.
So I'm, going to let Susan go ahead and report on the budget, because it we may need to really look into that friends account for some assistance.
This year, however, they're, taking 8,000 out next year, which is a really large, amount, I'm sure not going to get money from the council again on, Because the city's broke 8,000 out of our budget does not let us buy a pencil now at the last exec I had said that I would ask for discretionary funds from both council members.
Actually Mr., 24,000, plus right below, where it says 2000, as we were, going to hire a number of consultants, threats for the school paper and a number of other things, and we could not find anybody so that money is there now of that.
So there's a few things like I want to get another laptop to be prepared for more work at home, but we have other money that the board can spend alright.
Just we've been sitting on that money for a while, and you know, I think needs are going to be really great in the next six months to a year.
Only thing is that we have to form that committee and we have to meet which we have not been meeting, and so that's what has to be done first to Stuart so far that those funds is not necessarily of the spending like Susan saying is mainly when it's necessary.
Yes, so I know how that works kind of, although we have to send out notices, asking who would like to sit on that committee last time.
You know what am I saying to Ben's, office, I The final thing is that we would prefer it be coming from a council member in our district who can speak more to how it relates to our district, as well as what the overall issue is.
Issues, ask different people to cover different issues, and but it's not going to be a two minute thing, because they really do need to talk about legislation pending legislation.
He's, all over the whole world, working with everybody, so Is housing legislation we're asking Carlinhos on the Parks Committee to talk about parks, budget cuts because they're drastic So I'm working on having them organize it, but we're trying to make it productive, And we're trying to make it relate to whether we need to do advocacy now for the executive, budget?
Some of the emails like from every agency, like Department of homeless services, is doing an incredible amount of work and moving people around, and you know doing things very differently, So this is just all time consuming a lot of the agencies or a number of them Have.
One problem I see a tremendous amount of work being done, but there's so much need in our community that I think coordinating it all with you, know: Agencies, elected officials, CBO's all doing a tremendous amount of work, for instance they're all calling all their clients or everybody's name.
We want to kind of look at the things that have come up and shown gaps, or what do people think it's really a hard thing to figure out what to do when you've never been in this situation before I know for businesses So, just from the business perspective, economic development does not have a meeting set for May, but in June I'd like to discuss the needs of small businesses , I think we're going to have a little bit a better idea where you know where the loans all shake out and some of the regulations and have a better idea of what all the needs are, that right, then, but ideally getting together a resolution that all of the borough or all of the boards in the borough can sort of sign on to would be.
Think that a lot of our you, know, nonprofits and human service agencies and use agencies- would need a little bit more time to figure out exactly what to ask for 21 to 22.
Fine I will try to project So. First of all really excited to work with you all And I think been working very closely with Michael and with Susan and with Tati, Tatiana and sorry, my five month old, daughter, The quick headline here is really that, as Susan mentioned in her manager report, there is an overwhelming amount of information that is out there right now in a wonderful way, but in a way that we really need to figure out how to curate and tailor to our to community Board, three But one is that are at the end of the day.
The other thing that we're trying to do is make sure that we're posting events and local news that truly is local and truly is Rep relevant to Community, Board, three and so Thus far Susan has done most of the work as with as with most things but Michael and I are trying to source various newsletters or various sources that have events that we think might be relevant to in the district.
Do, not I mean, let's see, and if people are commenting that they want different kind of sections, but I think for right.
We have that information up, there, I, think to the other question that you're asking about just like posting events or even frankly, things that you're doing that are relevant to the community and Susan Michael, Alicia and I As, the reminder, the policy that we voted on our last exec believe it was or full board meeting, was that basically.
As you know, like, the majority of our time has been spent working on this special enhanced commercial district, which we're going to have to put a pause on right, now, one because those city agencies are just not functioning for anything other than non- essential work, right, now, but also because I think we need to be focusing less on restrictive measures right now and more on how we could be proactive and help small businesses and there's a lot of you.
Is put together a list of small business needs and see how you know kind of talk with Susan Alicia and just see how the community, but what points the community board can help with all those things.
The council it the summer So I, want I, would like CB 3 to write a letter of you know in opposition to the cancellation it we have already voted on SYEP and that it's part of our budget, priority.
There was a letter that some community boards signed on to in April on April, 10th And You know because we're talking about the July and everybody needs like talk to their City Council member.
Something I think we need to discuss, because without the pools being open, I really do not know what a lot of these kids are going to do for recreation I do not know if women do here at exact Susan to talk about advocating for this or if we want to carry out the full board.
You know the work has not been done to prepare them, but it seems like a lot of other summer.
Can, I, say one more thing that I forgot my report, The governor's executive order around open meeting law, And I just wanted to make sure everybody's read them, and let me know if you have any questions any other old business.
And I want to thank her for her service as I think this may be her last executive meeting, possibly until we get further notice from well from the borough president's office about our new placements I'm going to do a roll call vote to adjourn, but do not sign off because, as noted after this, with unit talk for about ten minutes about friends up so after the roll call vote to Adjourn.
