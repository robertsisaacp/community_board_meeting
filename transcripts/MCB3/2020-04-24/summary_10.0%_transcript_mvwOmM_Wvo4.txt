They needed the money to be spent at a community board, a community-based organization, and so Susan and I didn't want to make that decision on behalf of the board, because it is it's tough to decide how to spend six thousand dollars and get it to a community-based organization.
We couldn't use Eric's organization because we sit on the exec right, and so we asked them to come up with some organizations that they already had in on a list, and you know they named one of the organizations, They received the 6,000 dollar reward award on behalf of the community board, There may be times when decisions have to happen and it has to happen right away.
I mean, like questions, come up or decisions that have to be made similar to this decision that we had to do with the find a group of people that need something or whatever you know like anything like that.
You, know they're kind of minor things, but I agree, I, don't I, don't think we should like do we need to like set something in stone that, like for the pandemic, you have certain executive authority.
Another item that I wanted to talk about was I asked everyone to come up with some ideas of policies that we may need to create during this time.
Was it just making sure that we're meeting as needed and that we're not having people held up for long lengths of time in meetings and I wanted to correct something.
And I want to commend you for doing a great job at the moment that you're dealing with all of this stuff, because I know it is difficult to meet with applicants on zoom' and then having to each item needs to be talked about, so I do want to come in Alexandra I encourage you to get to know her she's been with us for a little while she's been under Megan's wing, and she has really been doing great work.
One of the things that we discussed that we're going to ask all the chairs to do is that if your committee is not meeting in any given month, if you would at least take the time 10 minutes, 20 minutes.
You know not necessarily well this check, but just to check in to make sure you know see how they're doing See, if there's any issues they're having related to the community board or things that meet that they want to bring up.
If your committee is meeting, Life goes on, unfortunately, during the pandemic and a lot of other city agencies are sort of figuring out how to conduct business as usual, and so is the federal government, and that means the Census.
Jackie, yes, I'm, just wondering if I organize a in for most zoom happy hours with my committee, members, do I ballet in the open meeting laws or you should be fine, So you cannot discuss community board anything.
Yeah I went through an analysis of the 50 members and their attendance at the full board meetings, as well as all of their committee assignments, including the executive committee, and by the way I'm going to some time and suggest a new format Susan if you'd be willing to consider it for whoever enters the attendance so that we wouldn't have to do this computation.
I didn't have that information, so I'll send that letter drafted that letter again, it's written under a useless signature If the board could send them out, I'd, rather not send them for my personal email, but you want me to I I know she was out for medical reasons brewing for at least two months, I, just I'm, assuming that was taken into account when the attend I, don't think so.
Hewitt about going over the discretionary funds, and also this account that we have call friends, Let Susan go ahead and report on the budget, because it we may need to really look into that friends account for some assistance.
Some of you may remember is that when I first became district, manager- Do, and I created an extra account with the city that, unlike our budget, that money is ours year after year, so we can roll that over, which is why I call it that I stopped doing that, because there's a lot of restrictions on it and it makes it difficult for us to spend the money then, where it says: cb3, accounts.
Just we've been sitting on that money for a while, and you know, I think needs are gonna, be really great in the next six months to a year.
We're asking Carlinhos on the parks committee to talk about parks, budget cuts, because they're drastic, so I'm working on having them organize it.
Some of the emails like from every agency, like Department of homeless services, is doing an incredible amount of work and moving people around, and you know doing things very differently, So this is just all time consuming a lot of the agencies or a number of them Have.
One problem I see a tremendous amount of work being done, but there's so much need in our community that I think coordinating it all with you, know: Agencies, elected officials, CBO's all doing a tremendous amount of work, for instance, they're all calling all their clients or everybody's name they have, and then today the mayor's office said they're gonna start calling everybody too.
We want to kind of look at the things that have come up and shown gaps, or what do people think?
It's really a hard thing to figure out what to do when you've never been in this situation before I know for businesses So, just from the business perspective, economic development doesn't have a meeting set for May, but in June I'd like to discuss the needs of small businesses , I think we're gonna have a little bit a better idea where you know where the loans all shake out and some of the regulations and have a better idea of what all the needs are that right, then, but ideally getting together a resolution that all of the borough or all of the boards in the borough can sort of sign on to would be.
Think, that a lot of our you, know, nonprofits and human service agencies and use agencies- would need a little bit more time to figure out exactly what to ask for 21 to 22.
And I think been working very closely with Michael and with Susan and with Tati, Tatiana and sorry, my five month old, daughter, As Susan mentioned in her manager report, there is an overwhelming amount of information that is out there right now in a wonderful way, but in a way that we really need to figure out how to curate and tailor to our to community board three The primary pieces of content that we want to direct people towards is the website and YouTube, because the website is kind of a good centralized clearing house for all of our meetings and YouTube is kind of the true record of all of our meetings that need to be recorded.
The other thing that we're trying to do is make sure that we're posting events and local news that truly is local and truly is rep relevant to community board three, and so thus far susan has done most of the work.
, don't I mean let's see, and if people are commenting that they want different kind of sections, but I think for right.
We have that information up, there, I, think to the other question that you're asking about just like posting events or even frankly, things that you're doing that are relevant to the community and Susan Michael, Alicia and I As, the reminder, the policy that we voted on our last exec believe it was or full board meeting, was that basically.
Is put together a list of small business needs and see how you know kind of talk with Susan Alicia and just see how the community, but what points the community board can help with all those things.
You know, decided that the council it the summer So I, want I, would like CB 3 to write a letter of you know in opposition to the cancellation it we have already voted on SYEP and that it's part of our budget, priority.
Something I think we need to discuss, because without the pools being open, I really don't know what a lot of these kids are going to do for recreation I, don't know if women do here at exact Susan to talk about advocating for this or if we want to carry out the full board.
You know the work hasn't been done to prepare them, but it seems like a lot of other summer.
That's, pretty easy plastic bit that is first Street Park is closed, but that's because it's all playgrounds, No, All business, I'm, sorry, Can, I, say one more thing that I forgot my report, The governor's executive order around open meeting law, And I just wanted to make sure everybody's read them, and let me know if you have any questions any other old business.
And I want to thank her for her service as I think this may be her last executive meeting, possibly until we get further notice from well from the borough president's office about our new placements I'm going to do a roll call vote to adjourn, but don't sign off because, as noted after this, with unit talk for about ten minutes about friends up So after the roll call vote to adjourn.
