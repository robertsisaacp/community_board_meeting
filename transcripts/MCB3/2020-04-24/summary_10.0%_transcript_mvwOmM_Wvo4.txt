We never got it out there to the public, no So a couple of things: people, because I'm sharing my screen I think it was Nike actually last time that we were trying to figure out where to give the money In order to direct money that occasionally will come to us is something we should deal with when this is all over, because we have the beginnings of dealing with it.
So we could not have pre-selected, but I was support the general idea of revisiting completing it thanks Can you explain Alicia what you meant in terms of what are the parameters under which you'd make a decision without consulting yes, so it would be like if the mayor's office called and they needed an answer to a question that maybe have already been voted on out on our website or something like that resolutions, or things like that and I am not able speak to that capacity, or it might be something that can be easily answered without you know us all having to get together.
You were going to speak about when we were going to hold meetings and when we weren't for committee meetings right That's, the only that was the only policy thing that I'm specifically asked for right now , it's SLA landmarks and maybe land use Currently, it's just SLA landmarks, executive and full board and executive Gonna have two meetings for the month of May for right now, if we don't need the second meeting, then we'll cancel it like I said, but you should be prepared to have another executive meeting because stuff will come up yes, so that was that, was it just making sure that we're meeting as needed and that we're not having people held up for long lengths of time in meetings and I wanted to correct something and I want to commend you for doing a great job at the moment that you're dealing with all of this stuff, because I know it is difficult to meet with applicants on zoom' and then having to each item needs to be talked about.
Let's go right into your report, saying upcoming meetings and the limit One of the things that we discussed that we're going to ask all the chairs to do is that if your committee is not meeting in any given month, if you would at least take the time 10 minutes, 20 minutes However long, it takes to check in with all of your committee members.
I'm gonna, stop sharing for a second I, went through an analysis of the 50 members and their attendance at the full board meetings, as well as all of their committee assignments, including the executive committee, and by the way I'm going to some time and suggest a new format Susan if you'd be willing to consider it for whoever enters the attendance so that we wouldn't have to do this computation.
Some of you may remember is that when I first became district, manager- I did what the city wants us to do, and I created an extra account with the city that, unlike our budget, that money is ours year after year, so we can roll that over, which is why I call it that I stopped doing that, because there's a lot of restrictions on it and it makes it difficult for us to spend the money then, where it says cb3 accounts , The Friends of is a group formed by community board.
No one has talked at all about taking this money back I would say, find a way to fund something before anyway, Meghan joy, Susan My question is for the Friends of account: What's the restrictions on sponging that I said there's a resolution: we have it well, it needs two people to sign.
He would like to come to our board to ask us to do a resolution and the Summer Youth Employment, which has been a hundred percent I, explained that we were already planning to do that or should I ask one of our council members who are already given reports on city budget to talk about it?
You know what am I saying to Ben's office If we have a council member that serves on the committee that it's relevant for I didn't actually did this for the district service cab meeting so that people- don't repeat the same issues, ask different people to cover different issues, and but it's not going to be a two minute thing, because they really do need to talk about legislation pending legislation That's addressing problems , we're all dealing with I'm asking them to briefly talk about what their office is doing.
There's a tremendous amount of work going on that people are not aware of in everybody, making wellness checks and calling people and delivering food, although I got to say probably the hardest working person in Tassie beats : Is housing legislation, we're asking Carlinhos on the parks committee to talk about parks, budget cuts because they're drastic so and we're trying to make it relate to whether we need to do advocacy now for the executive budget.
It's really a hard thing to figure out what to do when you've never been in this situation before I know for businesses Just from the business perspective, economic development doesn't have a meeting set for May, but in June I'd like to discuss the needs of small businesses , I think we're gonna have a little bit a better idea where you know where the loans all shake out and some of the regulations and have a better idea of what all the needs are that right then, but ideally getting together a resolution that all of the borough or all of the boards in the borough can sort of sign on to would be.
At least we posted the businesses that are open in the East Village in the Lower East Side I think to the other question that you're asking about just like posting events or even frankly, things that you're doing that are relevant to the community and Susan Michael Alicia and I The reminder, the policy that we voted on our last exec believe it was or full board meeting, was that basically, once an item is sent to Alicia and Susan for approval or rejection, they have 24 hours to give us that approval.
We had one item of old business, not that was heard at committee, but that we voted on at full board We heard last month, because I thought that they have submitted stipulations, but they, the applicant, decided, not to submit the stipulations and may not even be going forward So. It's a reworking of the resolution to deny, because we didn't receive the stipulations, any questions for SLA all right, seeing none we'll move on to transportation but, as you know, like the majority of our time, has been spent working on this special enhanced commercial district, which we're gonna have to put a pause on right now, one because those city agencies are just not functioning for anything other than non-essential work right now, but also because I think we need to be focusing less on restrictive measures right now and more on how we could be proactive and help small businesses and there's a lot of you know.
A list of small business needs and see how you know kind of talk with Susan Alicia and just see how the community, but what points the community board can help with all those things.
You know the delivery and all that it's something that youth could do The summer So there was a letter that some community boards signed on to in April on April, 10th and One of the things we could do is write a letter and send it to all of our elected and also we could base it on that template and just update it and customize it more for us , That's all I have to say we have a question from David Crane, so it sounds like you're proposing that we go through a process of writing a letter and getting it noted on I actually think, given that it's been a tree, it's been to the top of our budget priorities for years that you could just write that letter I, don't know if anyone that doesn't I hadn't mentioned when I gave my report earlier, that this was the process that we've actually done in the past and advocating at the executive budget.
We didn't meet this month, but one of the most important legislation happening right now is Brian We are inviting Brian cabinets office to come to a full part to speak and talk about it and I Think later We might need to call the committee members to have a formal discussion on that to see if we want to and support that bill.
Something I think we need to discuss, because without the pools being open, I really don't know what a lot of these kids are going to do for recreation , don't know if women do here at exact Susan to talk about advocating for this or if we want to carry out the full board, what I'm, what I would suggest?
Sorry can I say one more thing that I forgot my report, The governor's executive order around open meeting law and I just wanted to make sure everybody's read them, and let me know if you have any questions any other old business.
