The second page of the executive committee agenda is the resolution.
The only thing I've got is ask to unmute, which seems to work, but only temporarily right, Okay, great, I, don't know what in the world headphones, don't work.
So he knows just want to ask people as far as your agendas.
One of the things we do is if we need to invite somebody we always like to have that confirmed by the exec, because you never know when it'll be a problem and you might have to change the agenda like, for instance.
That people did go to was one put on by the civic engagement commission and it was on board elections, and it was really unfortunate that they investigated all parliamentary procedure, but not community boards and open meeting, and they gave a lot of incorrect information and the bur aldrin from the borough president's office By the time we had our borough service meeting.
That was that was the big issue, and so I just wanted to make sure that people were aware of that, and I will talk more during the budget priorities.
It says the proposed temporary modification to section 1.3 point b of the community board 3 by-laws to enable voting during teleconference board meetings, and it currently is very simple.
Is it allows for remote meetings right and that- That comply with open meeting law You, it should probably say remote voting methods which comply with open meeting law must be implemented not at the end You were the chair of the last bylaw committee.
We didn't, which we did not have the agenda and give public notice for I mean we're not going to have this vote until November, right, So I.
I, don't even know how you would switch people to the electronic ballot to vote and then to come back to the zoom meeting.
It's a different level of public, yes, And I think that's what michelle's concern What about the google poll idea and that we just tell people in advance that it's going to be?
The rankings from within each committee has never changed and the way we've always done it in the past is the office collects all the ranked priorities and we make a straw like a straw poll list based on the way they were ranked, the previous year, and then that is brought to the exec and then the exec goes through them and makes any changes that they think are necessary.
Think a lot of people are still having are more trouble this year than last year, at least in the public, and understanding what priorities are, and I thought it might be helpful if I sent last year's priorities out to the whole board and say you know just say this is what we did last year, just to give you a sale, an example of how it's done.
Sometimes it's members also, who kind of insist that there are programs that don't exist, that is be waste, it'd, be wasting a priority because what happens if you vote on Something- and another thing people can look, at- is the answers from last year.
I just wanted to talk about our October meeting, so, like everyone else, we also will be you know doing the budget priorities and district needs and voting on it.
And that's for the land use meeting and also I want to talk a little bit about nature subcommittee as well, because we are planning to reactivate an hsf committee in October, and I have submitted agenda to susan.
I think there was a big committee and from board members which caused an issue because folks were like.
Was that we were looking for a resolution that talked about the permanent re of the ecology center to east river park, which is not in the plans at this point and that there be a temporary reload that they'd be temporarily relocated somewhere in the neighborhood.
I, completely understand the complications of pier 42 as a permanent location, but I'm, not at all sure that that's what was being presented- A similar thing happened in the land use committee on a on a different subject about just clarity about when a resolution can be suggested when there's a when there's an update listed on the agenda.
The agenda item will now read for October that we're going to discuss the temporary location, we did not say pier 42.
It is an agenda item for October parks and resolutions.
There's going to be a resolution, we try to be very clear that there will be a vote and what it will be specifically on, and this is something that's in the last few years have come up a number of times in the exec.
I, would like for parks waterfront to move up in the committee reports for one month.
I am unmuted now I still am not clear with what is the wording that requ that is necessary for their to allow for a resolution and what I guess I want to know what specifically has to be in an agenda to allow it to have a vote.
So people know it in advance: I'm, not pointing a finger at any committee.
