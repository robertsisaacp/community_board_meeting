The, only thing I've got is ask to unmute, which seems to work, but only temporarily right, Okay, great, I do not know what in the world headphones, do not work.
Second, Vice, chairs, report, Lin, Lisa!, No, I do not have anything to report, but could you just instruct me when the best time is for me to ask my little question that I sent everybody the information about in an email sure when we get to that particular topic?
So he knows just want to ask people as far as your agendas, You know, they're made up the committee.
You know both with agenda items from city agencies as well as issues that you went.
That people did go to was one put on by the Civic Engagement Commission and it was on board elections, and it was really unfortunate that they investigated all parliamentary procedure, but not community boards and open meeting, and they gave a lot of incorrect information and the bur aldrin from the borough president's office.
That was that was the big issue, and so I just wanted to make sure that people were aware of that, and I will talk more during the budget priorities, section.
We did not, which we did not have the agenda and give public notice for I mean we're not going to have this vote until November, right, So I.
Since people join our meetings, you know from their phones, they're not going to be able to you.
I do not even know how you would switch people to the electronic ballot to vote and then to come back to the zoom meeting.
Depending on who's, running, I feel like people might want their vote to not be public, as it traditionally happens to public But, maybe not like in person calling out.
Just we just got to be careful with that: It means somebody has to create that Google Doc and test it and make sure it's correct, and then we have to figure out what to do about people who are only calling in on their phone and do not have Access to a computer at that point Sounds like a lot of work.
It's a different level of public, yes, And I think that's what Michelle's concern Well, I like what the alternative, what about the Google Poll idea and that we just tell people in advance that it's going to be Google This is the ballot and we can distribute it in advance and you fill it in beforehand.
Think a lot of people are still having are more trouble this year than last year, at least in the public, and understanding what priorities are, and I thought it might be helpful if I sent last year's priorities out to the whole board and say you know just say this is what we did last year, just to give you a sale, an example of how it's done.
We met, and we did have one resolution which was about returning application fees for applicants, who've applied for sidewalk, cafe licenses and it was discussed at the committee It was passed besides that we just worked on district AIDS and sort of the usual things.
So, like everyone else, we also will be you know doing the budget priorities and district needs and voting on it.
So often you know you may have seen some of these boxes in the park like like Thompson Square, for example, so they've always had one outside the door on Allen Street, so they also want to locate it there.
It's going to bring in all these people who will be a danger to the children at the library when it reopens, and you know, Definitely be able to come in here and ask questions, so I think it's a little complicated with what's going on in Chinatown.
And that's for the land use meeting and also I want to talk a little bit about nature subcommittee as well, because we are planning to reactivate an hsf committee in October, and I have submitted agenda to Susan.
We still have to spend some time to work on it to see what else we can do to make sure The October meeting is smooth and productive, and that's all I have But I think you're going to have to have a conversation with Jackie and myself.
I think there was a big committee and from board members which caused an issue because folks were like.
You know it was given to us by the city and turned into a park, and I really do not think people understand that you can't just say we're going to move one particular facility to another area without really doing extensive community outreach.
And I think I can speak for at least one other member of the board that suggested a resolution at that meeting.
I, completely understand the complications of pier 42 as a permanent location, but I'm, not at all sure that that's what was being presented- A similar thing happened in the land, Use Committee, on a on a different subject about just clarity about when a resolution can be suggested when there's a when there's an update listed on the agenda.
The agenda item will now read for October that we're going to discuss the temporary location, we did not say Pier 42.
, I am unmuted now I still am not clear with what is the wording that requ that is necessary for their to allow for a resolution and what I guess I want to know what specifically has to be in an agenda to allow it to have a vote.
So people know it in advance: I'm not pointing a finger at any committee.
They do October 14th, okay , The other, I'm, not asking for an answer now, but maybe that's something the committee subcommittees can think.
