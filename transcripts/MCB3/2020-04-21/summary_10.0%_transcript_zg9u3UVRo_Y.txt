Then we have K corn, door, Kristin, sorry, Justin,, that's, okay, the community same or The committee and also I just want to see how things are going, how this new process is happening, living in the East Village for a while now and wanted to be part of a community?
You know I like to think I mean things were moving in a good direction from the lease standpoint as well: again,, so I'm, not sure you know if certain language will change, but hopefully the neighborhood will embrace the use.
Fourth, Avenue they're, applying for a sidewalk cafe permit We approve this applicant for a wine beer.
Closing, its facade at 10:00 p.m. playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration before coming to the community board, not seeking an upgrade, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having them limited, drink specials with food, not having happy hours, not having wait lines outside application is for seven tables and 14 seats with a row of two tables and four seats on 4Th Avenue and a row of five tables and Tennessee on East 13Th, Street and proposed hours of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days.
Applying for this unenclosed sidewalk cafe the seven tables as described five on the 13th Street side, a single row with planters.
I think feels like an impediment, and you know: I want to be supportive of local businesses, But Yeah, okay committee members, other than clay What Herman's microphone, apparently is not working.
So on the 13th Street side is the measurement we tweet from the planters on or from the seating on from that it has to be from the perimeter of the sidewalk cafe.
Would it be possible to remove that last planter to allow a little more space for people walking by there Then there's a clearance, that's required for that this mesial, but I just- My concern would be if this is where your service I was coming.
You're going to have your patrons trying to get in the sidewalk cafe your waitresses and waiters trying to get by and pedestrians that could make it a little tight just right in that little section, and you can devise a way to change what the perimeter is like right.
A signpost right between the mailbox signpost and newspaper boxes We, heard that the issue is the edge of your sidewalk cafe on 13th Street ends up abutting the beginning of a series of street furniture and fixtures that may make it difficult to get by I mean the alternative is to shorten it by a table, but it works technically.
Yeah, I'm, south of them on south of the proposed by buck, A fanny, search, Street, and ask that a resolution be devised to perhaps create more space between the sidewalk cafe and the newspaper.
If you know there was less, we could question it, but Just, because there's a lot more traffic on 4:13- Are, you able to pull it down, see how it measures the 8 feet from the line of the sidewalk cafe?
Does anybody agree with Ellen with respect to the tables and seats on 4Th Avenue or want to be heard with respect to not approving on 4th Avenue There's a couple places a little further down on 4th Avenue on the other side of bar bacon.
The second, with state with the application, consists of in terms of what heaps and tables are requesting and at proposed hours of operation and where the seats and tables would be located?
Would, consequently, support the proposed sidewalk cafe with the following change: order, and then the change order would be for seven tables and 14-feet, with two tables and foresty in a single row: flush against the facade of the building on 4Th, Avenue and five tables, and ten feet flush against the facade of the building on East 13Th Street.
In a single row on East 13Th Street, with hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days.
We approved in March of 2019 with stipulate a stipulation to operate a full- service, American restaurant, serving food, all hours, having kitchen open and serving food all hours having hours of operation of 4:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Thursday through Saturday closing at Posada ten playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming, just having happy hours to 7:00 p.m. Not having weight lines outside and having staff outside or responsible for controlling noise and crowds, outside.
They were proposing as having a sidewalk cafe, have six tables in 18 seats, with four tables in 12 seats on East, 6Th, Street and two tables and 60 seats on 1St Avenue, and we told them that.
And, we're asking for community board members help, but This cafe the sidewalk cafe their weight and sense of open we're seeking for, as you know, we're seeking for 13 tables and 26 chairs.
So, at this time, we're just wondering if it's possible to get the cafe license, which would tremendously help us and I feel like it will also help the community as well just open up the doors making 6th Street a little more enhanced to the eye.
I, would not need any help with the selected otherwise for the menu so essentially is started with that, and we've been we've been following every guideline keeping you know good neighborhood spirit, keeping things down where we're essentially family from business where people come in from around the neighborhood and as far as the complaints as far as the complaints, I am NOT I'm, pretty much sure that he's been the one calling all the complaints and our music Music Do not have a DJ or any kind of amplifiers that will amplify kind of noise for the neighborhood We can't see if it's the same caller or different people, but it did start on January 1st.
There is the phone booth furniture which are fixed furniture like specifically at the far end, do not think there's enough clearance there for a sidewalk cafe.
Do, not think that there's enough clearance between your sidewalk cafe and the phone booth at that end for it to be there even for the weight line.
I do not know if the garbage can, because if again it has to fit in with all the other streets in it, and you can't put it anywhere, else- I think there could be a space in here where he could put a table Is it worth it to have one table on that.
Sorry, just like Clinton explain this for a second This nine feet, eight inches goes to this to the edge of your sidewalk cafe.
I would approve only like one single row of tables along East, Sixth Street, and then my expectation would be that they would have to be flush against the facade of the building.
You understand that we still think it's an issue about how your doors open and whether or not you can accommodate the sidewalk cafe the way we think it needs to be accommodated, which is on this We get that you said, does not have much life to it.
It's just what the application is for a second, where clause which outlines what the sidewalk cafe consists of in terms of number of tables and see it's where they would be located in proposed dollars that were having reviewed, submitted.
It would be one row of two top tables of seven tables and fourteen seats against flush against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side, as if it said, okay, do I have to include none on First Avenue.
All right now know that I put that into the resolution and then the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe would be 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days.
This is a rest prod for whom we approved administrative leave proved a wine beer license in February of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full- service, restaurant at a Japanese, high Stuckey Styles tasting menu and a kitchen serving food open and serving food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. all days, no use of outdoor space.
And now, I guess even with the situation given I think that we just need any anything that could help us survive when we reopen I, think just even having this you know, liquor license could help even just a little bit of increase in sales for us to.
In the neighborhood we have like papayas and sushi restaurants, And I know it's not gay bars, but we're quite different from that right.
I could see that needs to and if they're hopefully going to open when this is all over I like to support businesses that could so.
One thing we've talked about in the past is: If we are going to issue upgrades, is it to people that we feel are you know legit restaurants, not something that's going to masquerade as a bar?
This would be you know, after other, where of clauses which I could get to, but given the residential character of the street, we typically would not want to approve a full license for an eating and drinking business mid- block, even with a period of operation, but are considering doing this, because this is a less than seven hundred square foot restaurant with less than four hundred and fifty square feet of Patron Accessible area, two counters that see 14 people, hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. daily and method of operation as a restaurant, with a tasting menu of no less than at least twelve courses that taste at least two and a half hours so would accommodate only one to two seatings per night.
I mean I, think all of those things we could put in there to support going out of the norm and approving something like this on a residential side.
You said right: now, you're generally having one seating, but if you are going to have two seatings, because it's I think what Alex said, because it's a residential street, you know you can't have, even if it's only 14 people waiting outside at 8:30 or whatever blocking, is sidewalk or anything waiting for the next seating.
They can be consistent, open, Like people are coming to us and saying, and if it is, if this is the case, then I'm on board, because you guys have been doing this longer.
There are a block of businesses that fit into that administrative approval that are like the wine bar that just stays open till twelve and has recorded music or the restaurant.
