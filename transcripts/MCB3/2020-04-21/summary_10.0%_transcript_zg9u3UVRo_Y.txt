Any motion committee members, any motion, I, think Herman, but he was muted Is there, a second seventh, fourth Avenue they're, applying for a sidewalk cafe permit We approve this applicant for a wine beer license.
Closing, its facade at 10:00 pm playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration before coming to the community board, not seeking an upgrade not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having them limited, drink specials with food, not having happy hours, not having wait lines outside application is for seven tables and 14 seats with a row of two tables and four seats on 4th Avenue and a row of five tables and Tennessee on East.
Thank you so much first of all for having us So, you don't have a choice once you put your application in and when we reopen so we're dig we're a farm to counter restaurant You know as close to home, as we can Applying for this unenclosed sidewalk cafe the seven tables as described five on the 13th Street side, a single row with planters.
You don't have enough space between the sidewalk and the furniture You read it and the idea There planters stop a couple feet before the newspaper box mm-hmm what it was If. You guys look at the mm-hmm, the one online, the diagram it doesn't go over like you're, saying Alex, but it hits all the minimum requirement.
I think feels like an impediment, and you know I want to be supportive of local businesses, Yeah okay committee members, other than clay So on the 13th Street side is the measurement we tweet from the planters on or from the seating on from that it has to be from the perimeter of the sidewalk cafe The planters would then constitute the fed, walk.
, you know the tables are a little bit further to the east, maybe just to help pedestrian movement Would it be possible to remove that last planter to allow a little more space for people walking by there My concern would be if this is where your service I was coming out.
Right can't be like a portion of the change order, which is something that regulates the cafe If this, if we're gonna prove it, we can note that we think that the planters come somewhat close to the to the newspaper stands that are located a fanny search Street and ask that a resolution be devised to perhaps create more space between the sidewalk cafe and the newspaper.
Don't know how that works, because I'm pretty sure that they're out there to permit, which is why we see them consistently in the same place and for the same newspaper, would consequently support the proposed sidewalk cafe with the following change order and then the change order would be for seven tables and 14-feet, with two tables and foresty in a single row: flush against the facade of the building on 4th Avenue and five tables and ten feet : flush against the facade of the building on East 13th Street in a single row on East 13th Street with hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe of 11:00 am to 10:00 pm all days If there is there any amendment or exception to any portion of that little motion or a second second Jessie.
I got it if you want to go ahead, Alex in it and give a summary of the application We approved in March of 2019 with stipulate a stipulation to operate a full-service American restaurant serving food all hours having kitchen open and serving food all hours having hours of operation of 4:00 pm to 1:00 am Sunday through Wednesday 4:00 pm to 2:00 am Thursday through Saturday closing at Posada ten playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming, just having happy hours to 7:00 pm now hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines outside and having staff outside or responsible for controlling noise and crowds outside They were proposing as having a sidewalk cafe, have six tables in 18 seats, with four tables in 12 seats on East, 6th Street and two tables and 60 seats on 1st Avenue, and we told them that, given that there hadn't been a sidewalk cafe at this business, we would have to consider the sidewalk cafe separately when they submitted a DPA application.
It's a family-run business Upper pressure on you know down to the cleaning of the restaurant, which my sister's helped me do So We're just wondering if it's possible to get the cafe license, which would tremendously help us and I feel like it will also help the community as well just open up the doors making 6th Street a little more enhanced to the eye Since.
This whole thing that's going on with a Covid-19 19 You know, since we are essentially brand new business so that for the purposes of the sidewalk cafe, so it's 4 pm to 10 pm all day Any members of the public that had anything any comments or questions for this applicant You had 18 301 calls, and ten of them were non-crime corrected.
I, would approve only like one single row of tables along East, sixth Street, and then my expectation would be that they would have to be flush against the facade of the building So that means either they sit in between your open windows that don't fold back flat or you keep your windows closed so that you can accommodate your sidewalk cafe right to see how on the easternmost portion are the westernmost portion of the sixth Street, which is the farthest into the block Does.
It would be one row of two top tables of seven tables and fourteen seats against flush against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side, as if it said, okay do I have to include none on First Avenue All right now know that I put that into the resolution and then the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe would be 4:00 pm to 10:00 pm all days.
It's an application for an upgrade This is a rest prod for whom we approved administrative leave proved a wine beer license in February of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full-service restaurant at a Japanese, high Stuckey Styles tasting menu and a kitchen serving food open and serving food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation of 6:00 pm to 2:00 am all days no use of outdoor space First.
So right now we don't even have a bar inside It's, only seating for dining, so we are applying for an upgrade to a full liquor and now I guess even with the situation given I think that we just need any anything that could help us survive when we reopen I, think just even having this you know, liquor license could help even just a little bit of increase in sales for us to, in addition to, of course, providing a better experience for our guests.
It's not going to generate a lot of street traffic, I mean I, think all of those things we could put in there to support going out of the norm and approving something like this on a residential side street okay, in which case the resolution, would the first paragraph to say that this is an upgrade application and where what the application consists of, which are the element that has described as a summarize in the application that it was previously administratively proved a wine beer license in February 2010 and the stipulations that were approved at that time, that its license was issued.
A lot of people are saying different things about what's happening with the licensing process You know, Clint's been talking to you for the block from the block Association, the business applicant Another state You know with family members and then I will send them out to the attorney tomorrow?.
