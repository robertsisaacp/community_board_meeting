I might actually go. Oh we're recording I'm going to okay. Then we got Nina Eden. You know here you sorry about that yeah good you're here for the Headless widower correct. Yes, some you Fidelis. We dome you to apply for the sidewalk Cafe Mm- Hmm, Mary, Loftus hi I'm, here to hear about the dig. Sidewalk cafe I'm, just a member of the public. Okay, we've got, we know. Jesse Beck is on the committee. Herman you-- it it's one of our community members. Ellen Blau is a committee. Member Laura Sewell is with EB cc. Yes, hi I'm, just here in general to hear the new format and see what's going on and we are interested in the Tsumiki application. Okay, then we have K corn door, Kristin, sorry, Justin, that's, okay, the community same or kind of your just see how the new format works was perfect. Okay, Sonia, hi I am would like to actually tour. The committee and also I just want to see how things are going, how this new process is happening, living in the East Village for a while now and wanted to be part of a community? That's it! Okay well welcome and we have Alex hi Alex Karras, hi I'm, a member of the East Village community, have been for many years and I also am a retail broker and I was representing represent the tenants for 1:57 East Houston Street, which they withdrew from this month's meeting. But hopefully next month's was for the copy Leah, 24-hour diner, but I, just like your last name, Karis ka Ras and I work with Winnick Realty Group. Now one question Alex: they are they planning on coming back next month. I do not know. No I was actually asking Alex that just spoke sorry. He said he was representing them previously. There we go sorry about the. My understanding is yes, I spoke to the tenant the other day and he told me that his attorney could not you know was not working at this time and okay and I said well, look it's a zoom call. You know. I know I know that the calendar was down for a period of time, while this was all going on and then when the calendar came back up, they were on there, but then, a day later or maybe two days later, there was a line struck through. So that's when I spoke to the tenant- and he said you know, his attorney is not available for whatever reason. Okay, but at this point they are coming back. I think we may have got the impression that they maybe we're withdrawing completely, but we were not sure. So. No, that's not my impression. Okay at all and I ended their first meeting a couple months ago at the at the hotel. Was it the public? Yes, and no that seemed to go pretty well, but there were questions the feedback I've had in the meantime was that he's met with Eldridge Block Association more than once they've sussed out the Banting. You know they're not here, to kick anyone off, certainly right out of the gate. You know I like to think I mean things were moving in a good direction from the lease standpoint as well again, that was pre Kovin, so I'm not sure you know if certain language will change, but hopefully the neighborhood will embrace the use. Thank you if you want to go to the first agenda item Clint yep. So the first item is technically number two on the community we're calendar. It's dig and approval of previous month middle! Oh sorry! Yes, so does anyone have any number one? Yes does anyone have any changes? Corrections comments on last month's minutes, any motion committee members, any motion, I think Herman, but he was muted. Okay, Herman, your on you see muting himself. He said he's unmuted. Is there a second okay, all in favor just raise your hand for Clint account I'm raising my hands. Okay, we hear we hear your oral Jesse yeah right here. Yeah, okay, yeah go ahead print next, okay! So next we have item number two which is dig in it's located at one: twenty: seventh, fourth Avenue they're applying for a sidewalk cafe permit oh yeah. You want to go ahead and give a summary. Yes thank you. So we approve this applicant for a wine beer license. It was administratively approved in June of 2019, with stipulations to have a kitchen open and serving food all hours having hours of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days, not using any outdoor space. Closing its facade at 10:00 p.m. playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration before coming to the community board, not seeking an upgrade not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having them limited, drink specials with food, not having happy hours, not having wait lines outside application is for seven tables and 14 seats with a row of two tables and four seats on 4Th Avenue and a row of five tables and Tennessee on East 13Th, Street and proposed hours of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days. I did look on the Fla website to see when the license was issued, but I could not find any information about this location. I'm finished. Ok, so at this point do does the applicant I guess that would be Brenna or Nina. Do you have anything to add any anything else you want to say? Yes, thank you so much, first of all for having us I'm exciting to be on zoom with all of them, so you do not have a choice once you put your application in that's what happened so great. So thanks for having us agreed, we did apply for the beer and wine license and we actually were approved. We have not picked it up yet, but we're closed right now for the Co vid and when we reopen. We will pick that up just a certain background on that and maybe why you could not find it online just a little background on who we are so we're dig we're a farm to counter restaurant we're serving American food seasonally, it's mostly vegetables and we're sourcing it from farms and partners. You know as close to home as we can and we opened at this location in mid November of last year. We do serve lunch and dinner. Seven days a week, 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. inside. We have eight tables 16 seats and for eating counter stools and outside we're applying for this unenclosed sidewalk cafe the seven tables as described five on the 13th Street side, a single row with planters. One of the seats would be an ad a seat and then two tables with chairs the same on the 4th Avenue side- and you know our architect- did the drawings according to the code and the regulations and we're going through the process. What I will say is you know we want to be a good neighbor, we're excited to reopen when this is over and get back to the city that we all know and love, and so we're just here to answer any of your questions and see if we can come to an agreement. Thank you, ok, I do know, there was I, think Meri Loft us was here to find out in any information. Mary, did you have any questions or any comments about this yeah I mean the sidewalks are so narrow, as it is and I'm sure that you know your architect work to code or whatever, but in light of what's happening right now you can't walk down that block and social distance. You know somebody comes at you from the other way you have to walk out in the street, so the idea of putting a sidewalk cafe there and I know that now I think it's bar bacon has an enclosure for their entranceway and even just to get around that which would be the and that's smaller than what I would think the sidewalk cafe distance is it's difficult and that's a busy corner. It's right around the corner from the fire station and there's a bike lane on 13Th Street too, so there's a lot of traffic there. Well, certainly the design was on drawn up prior to the Covid-19 crisis, could not have predicted it and we absolutely need to and we'll be mindful of social distancing when we reopen all intents I mean we all need to do that for one another. So again, the design was not created to disrespect the social distancing parameters. Yeah I mean there was not I was trying to like see a layout or anything. Usually the applications are available online, and that was not the case right now, which is why I came. It actually is online. If you would like to see it, I can share that I can share the screen and show the diagram sure yeah. That would be helpful hold on one. Second, let me just make this full- sized sorry for that technical difficulties here, a second. Let me just fix that I will say as an aside that if there are social, distancing requirements that are that have been created for such an executive order, the executive order counter bans any existing law, rule or regulation. So if you are unable to comply with social distancing- and you have a permit for anything and your permit compromises that ability to do it, you have to modify your permit or not engage in the youth. So that's the requirement of all of us under the executive order. Large enough, you know so we're really just considering this sidewalk cafe. As to whether or not it's appropriate for the space- and you know the size of the sidewalks, whether it's compliant in terms of what we see about the measurements I will say- which is very confusing- is that, although, if you look at the diagram, although it looks like it's an architectural diagram, it extends past the sidewalk, so it extends onto the street, which is very strange. The parameter which says 15 feet I think that it would still be the appropriate length in terms of what's usable, sidewalk left, but I do not understand why the architect included the street when he did the design and I. Think that question for me was whether or not the sidewalk would the sidewalk on 4th Avenue would be able to accommodate any tables, because it's slanted- and it is yep very congested and tends to be narrow, I mean tends to feel narrow when you're walking down it is one person right yeah. Thank you. I know this is helpful to see, but I mean it shows. You know the minimum clear path is six feet. That's for everybody, walking down that sidewalk I! Think it's the date. Where are you looking at it? No, it has to be at least 8 feet under the law, but I think she's. If you are you talking about on the 13th Street side, Mary yeah right between the newspaper, Box Mm-, hmm, they did clear it out by the mailbox. There's nothing there so that there's more of a linear feet. Yeah. What are these are the 13th Street. Are these planters? This one has proposed planters, they're removable planter boxes, they're, not a fixed or anything to the sidewalk. So when you have the planters, you do not have enough sidewalk on the edge on this western edge. You do not have enough space between the sidewalk and the furniture. This is the know. They're there is I. Do not what does it say? It's a box. Can you read it and the idea it's a newspaper box, yeah I'd, be then, but it says it's a five foot, but it looks like that line. If you go directly up from the box, there planters stop a couple feet before the newspaper: Box Mm-, hmm, what it was. It's a bit easier to look kind of online. If you guys look at the Mm- Hmm, the one online, the diagram, it does not go over like you're, saying Alex, but it hits all the minimum requirement so I feel like we can yeah well I mean I, can't dispute the minimum requirements, I'm just saying as a human being walking down the street it's crowded now and having a sidewalk cafe here. I think feels like an impediment, and you know I want to be supportive of local businesses, but I just feel like this is encroaching on something. That's already crowded, mm-, Hmm question, 4, Brenna or I. Think Nina! You are not proposing flower planter boxes on the 4th. Avenue side are, you know, do not see them noted. You would not be able to fit them. Yeah, okay committee members, other than clay yeah clemontic, all in them. Let's start with Jesse any questions. Comments: nope, I'm, fine Herman! Surely you have any questions at all Oh your? What Herman's microphone apparently is not working. He says no comments or questions Ellen any questions or comments. Just a point of clarification. So on the 13th Street side is the measurement we tweet from the planters on or from the seating on from that it has to be from the perimeter of the sidewalk cafe. So the planters would then constitute the Fed walk the perimeter. So then it's five and not eight- is that correct yeah. It is eight to its eight. To that I mean it's. Five is I. Guess is that the question is the planter, the perimeter or the planter is supposed to become reading. He constructed somewhere as separately so I'm, just trying to clarify with I think I agree with the five from the planter to the newspaper box. It's five, it's correct, yes, I! Think we're talking about the plants are not being the newspaper box not being what would be considered fixed street furniture. Even though it's their Straight-6 street furniture might be the tree, it might be a tree, it could be a bench, it could be a phone booth or to the garbage can or mail box. So I'm just trying to understand and how do we can you bring that up again clintus? I can fit it again. How do we deal with the newspaper box, for example? So it's not considered, so it's not breaking a regulation say, but necessarily it's there. Unless someone removes the newspaper box thing, so it does not actually have a. Unless that's on the other side of the photograph it does not or the diagram it does not have a straight line from the planters yeah. It's over here side: okay, there's an 8 foot, and can you just say what it depicts, because I can't see it yeah this line over here, I'm here I think I can annotate this somewhere. This line over here there is a this line. Is an 8 foot, clear path to the planters from the edge of the sidewalk Mm- Hmm, and then, if we go move over here, this diagonal line here shows so there's this line here, which is a 5 foot, but that's a diagonal. If you go straight, there's technically 8 foot here and I think what you were referring to is the newspaper boxes are not permanent, fixed street furniture. I do not think that they are. Is it, but even so, I think table there, though right, so it the table stops before those yeah the tables the tables over here building the tables are against the building, but it's the perimeter of this sidewalk cafe that we have to measure from the tables, if you're putting planters out you're, making that your perimeter well but I think but the planners that stopped before those boxes too right. So then we're still at our minimum Mm-. Hmm, all right, I mean I. Think that's fine I. The only thing I might ask, because you are not. You know. The tables are a little bit further to the east, maybe just to help pedestrian movement. Would it be possible to remove that last planter to allow a little more space for people walking by there yeah? That makes more sense, possibly yeah, just I think just to keep the perimeter out there of some sort and then there's a clearance, that's required for that this mesial, but I just- I my concern would be if this is where your service I was coming out. You're going to have your waiters and waitresses walking out through that way, you're going to have a pinch point there between the newspaper box and the planter, and everyone is going to be congested there you're going to have your patrons trying to get in the sidewalk cafe your waitresses and waiters trying to get by and pedestrians that could make it a little tight just right in that little section, and you can devise a way to change what the perimeter is like right there. Something have to be consistently planters. No, it does not. This is true and I. Think I think if your referred to the SLA requirement about an enclosed, cafe, I think as long as you have barriers around your tables. You know your cafe really is not starting to where your tables, which is that a oh wait is it. There is a table. Oh I'm, sorry I was looking. If that is I thought that was a hat. I was not even seeing that chair there. That is a table. Yeah Mm-, hmm, that's a that's! An accessible table within a DA chair, I was sorry. I was not seeing that when I was looking at that, but I think the server's would come in and out through the 13th Street entrance on that far side they would not necessarily have to go. Oh okay, so they would. They would be coming out come out either over here and yeah I mean our experience so far of 13Th Street is there is not a lot of traffic on side and I. Guess who is jurisdiction over the newspaper boxes? I mean whose are those. Why are they there could? Can they move our experience of doing this at another location? Was you know we? Well? Actually we have a sidewalk cafe up by our Columbia University location. We did not do a community board meeting for that. They just do not do it there, but our experience with the DCA was there was a lot of back- and- forth with them about all these measurements and all these types of details you know, so it's a pretty rigorous process. I think if you could even have those two newspaper boxes, shifted I, do not like I, think that's a good question. I do not know the answer to that. Do you know Alex or Herman I. Imagine that they're they have a permit to have them there, so you would not. You would have to be reaching out to the company that and our companies the newspaper places that has them or DCA what I wonder is if those two newspaper boxes could be shifted to the west to be closer to the signpost. I think that would alleviate the whole thing as well. There's a signpost right between the mailbox signpost and newspaper boxes, okay. Otherwise we do not know if that could happen. Yeah. We heard that the issue is the edge of your sidewalk cafe on 13th Street ends up abutting the beginning of a series of street furniture and fixtures that may make it difficult to get by I mean the alternative is to shorten it by a table, but it works technically as now correct, Mm-, hmm, there's nothing wrong right. Now we can just put in to make the attempt to try and move it or ask them to cut it. Does not I do not know we do not I do not think we can write it into the revolution. I do not think that we can rent it into a change order. That's true! No I do this can't be like a portion of the change order, which is something that regulates the cafe. So if this, if we're going to prove it, we can note that we think that the planters come somewhat close to the to the newspaper stands that are located. Leave that determination up to do fine, yeah, I'm, south of them on south of the proposed by buck a fanny search, Street, and ask that a resolution be devised to perhaps create more space between the sidewalk cafe and the newspaper the newspapers stands. Yeah I would rather try and let miss Benson I call it a table. Mm-, hmm, all right. Does anybody want to go to the making and realization and that, with respect to 4Th Avenue committee members, you want to look at that or do you are you not opposed? Are you I mean I know see how far that's fine? It's I mean it has a fee. It has the eight feet of minimum clearance, which, if you know there was less, we could question it, but I mean I'm not really in favor of fourth Avenue. Just because there's a lot more traffic on 4:13- and this is not weird because you can you pour down- are you able to pull it down, see how it measures the 8 feet from the line of the sidewalk cafe? But then the AAP goes out past the curb? No, if you go right, there see the 8 foot minimum clear path. Ok, now I see it yeah, but it's very confusing because he clearly measures just the curb. Yes, ok, all right, all right! So does anybody agree with Ellen with respect to the tables and seats on 4Th Avenue or want to be heard with respect to not approving on 4th Avenue I him I'm I? Guess: I'm! Ok with it, there are a couple. Other I've been up and down 4Th Avenue. There's a couple places a little further down on 4th Avenue on the other side of bar bacon. That one little place has a couple tables and benches out front, though the sidewalk may be a little wider down there. We have 8 feet so I'm in support personally Mm-, hmm I do not know it's I, do not know what you're talking about cause I do not think any place on 4Th Avenue other than the hotel has a actual DBA per minute. I think it's called the damn palak and he has bench yes, okay, they do not have tables just benches yeah, okay, all right! So then there would be a resolution. The first, where is clubs with state what the application is? The second, with state with the application, consists of in terms of what heaps and tables are requesting and at proposed hours of operation and where the seats and tables would be located, and the third would say that, whereas clubs would say that we have a concern about the clearance between the planters proposed to be located around the sidewalk cafe on East Third Street Ie, 13Th Street and the newspaper different sensors located south of the proposed cuts out this north of the proposal. Cafe on the sidewalk and asked that a solution be constructed to create greater clearance between the planters and or the edge of the sidewalk cafe and newspaper dispensers, or that they may moved because I think I mean I think we could just make clearance greater clearance between them and the sidewalk edge of the sidewalk cafe and then I think the newspaper boxes were shifted to the west. I think that would do it yeah, but I do not know how that works, because I'm pretty sure that they're out there to permit, which is why we see them consistently in the same place and for the same newspaper. So then there would be a where of Clausing would consequently support the proposed sidewalk cafe with the following change order, and then the change order would be for seven tables and 14-feet, with two tables and foresty in a single row: flush against the facade of the building on 4Th, Avenue and five tables, and ten feet flush against the facade of the building on East 13Th Street in a single row on East 13Th Street, with hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days. If there is there any amendment or exception to any portion of that little motion or a second I'll second Jessie, second, okay, all in favor No hold on. We can write that in. If there is the weekend. Let's finish the vote, so all in favor raise your hands, so you can see why I'm raising it. Do you see it? Okay, Jessie, Herman Ellen. We need a verbal from you, no okay, Herman! We can't see you. We need to hear you. He raised his hand, I, can't being sorry. Okay, you can click on gallery view. Alex. You might be able to see better I do not know here. He comes so three. Yes, one know: you're everything: okay, we're going to move on to number three now I'm, sorry, so Brenna and Nina. With respect to your with respect to the agreement that we've come to, we drafted an agreement I'm going to send it to you tomorrow via email, and then you are going to be given instructions to sign it and return it to the Community Board office. I just want to double- check with you. What does should I be sending it to your attorneys, your attorneys email address. You can send it to them. You can copy me I've received Ralph for this zoom meeting directly, so I believe you have my email address and I RSVP'd I believe that Ellen already wrote it into, but you can eliminate it if you want into the change order for contact information because we filled in that portion of it so I have your email address. Your attorneys email is part of the notice. Is that right? They submitted the paperwork because that's key and bookman. Yes, okay, those were the stipulation which postman is it I'm in accident, Robert and Max. We work with both of them for a long time. Yeah. Thank you. Okay, well, I know that Tedeschi does not submit thanks. Charlie Gordon, okay, so I'm going to either or thank you go ahead, Alan. What were you going to say this with the stipulation? It's still random Miller as the contact all right? Yes, okay and then there are planters and there's no awning correct, no awning, correct and Brennan. As we said, your contact information is in the syllabus form for contact information, but if you want to update or change that or put somebody else's contact information or add somebody's contact information, you could do that. Okay got it. Thank you. Okay. You're. Welcome all right. Moving on to number three, which is the head listed. Oh wait, I'm! Sorry about never mind you! Yes, thanks take care! Thank you. Okay, so yeah I got it if you want to go ahead, Alex in it and give a summary of the application. Okay, this is who's Opie license. We approved in March of 2019 with stipulate a stipulation to operate a full- service, American restaurant, serving food, all hours, having kitchen open and serving food all hours having hours of operation of 4:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Thursday through Saturday closing at Posada ten playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming, just having happy hours to 7:00 p.m. now hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines outside and having staff outside or responsible for controlling noise and crowds outside. At the time they informed us. They were proposing as having a sidewalk cafe, have six tables in 18 seats with four tables in 12 seats on East, 6Th, Street and two tables and 60 seats on 1St Avenue, and we told them that, given that there had not been a sidewalk cafe at this business, we would have to consider the sidewalk cafe separately when they submitted a DPA application. They're now proposing 13 tables and 26 seats with eight tables and 16 seats on East, 6Th, Street and five tables and 10 seats on 1St Avenue. They do not have any proposed hours of operation and the license for this business was issued. October 4th of 2019 all right go ahead, quit ok, so I guess it was a deaden okay. Yes, please go ahead and feel free to add any anything. You would like to add or comment. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everybody for bodies to the meeting, my name is any Chadwick. I have run the headless Widow we're proud of having the hospital in the neighborhood the neighbors taken like in a Nova's, the braces and as the community we feel like. We've been embraced with open arms and everybody seems to like what we're doing there and we're looking forward to opening up again eventually and we're asking for community board members help, but this cafe the sidewalk cafe their weight and sense of open we're seeking for, as you know, we're seeking for 13 tables and 26 chairs. You know we know this that's happening. We had a great start where, over nine months, operational we've been doing great. We looking forward to again helping the neighborhood with our without products which is American and European food that we serve. It's a family- run business. It's a real moment. Upper pressure on you know down to the cleaning of the restaurant, which my sister's helped me do. So it's a real intimate operation. So, at this time, we're just wondering if it's possible to get the cafe license, which would tremendously help us and I feel like it will also help the community as well just open up the doors making 6th Street a little more enhanced to the eye. Since there is no cafes on that block, we were just wondering if we could, you know, join the neighborhood since we are young and early just hoping. You know, for the neighborhood support, I'm, sorry or planned for the liquor license. We think yet over 400 signatures, which I personally went around and collected, and we just were just hoping that we could come through with just you know, keeping everything instead of positive note. You have proposed hours of operation. Yes, so the proposed hours operation is will be from 4:00 p.m. so 10:00 p.m. okay. Thank you, okay, I! Do not think there was any okay. Are you finished? Did you have anything else to add? Well, I, just just keep it in mind that we are a new business, essentially just open, so we've really been hit even harder. With this whole thing, that's going on with a Covid-19, so we was just wondering you know we could you know, get any help. We could get really. You know, since we are essentially brand new business. Can I get the days of operation sure so it's Monday through Sunday, so Monday through Sunday and from 4 to 1 a.m. excluding Thursday, Friday and Saturday, which were operational 4/4. It's where okay, so that for the purposes of the sidewalk cafe, so it's 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. all day. All days correct, yes, okay, I do not think there was. Is that is there anyone else? Any members of the public that had anything any comments or questions for this applicant okay, I, had I had a couple questions one. When I pulled the three one calls it seemed starting on January 1st to February 20 February 17th, you had 18,301 calls and ten of them were non- crime corrected. Do you know what started or what happened? Starting on January 1st non- crime corrected means they required a police response and they found a condition that required them to say something to you or the manager, and 18 is a high number even for a year and ten non- contracted of 18 is a high number of non crime corrected as far as I know, and we do have a neighbor upstairs that we have an issues with he's been calling constantly the police on us he's complaining by noise. He was you as far as I know, he's the only one complaining and the building he lives right upstairs from us and he's been, you know, he's been a Bob ever since we started renovating the place he came in a few times. You know ask him, you know, ask him to help us correcting wines and different things that this time I told them you know, I would not need any help with the selected otherwise for the menu so essentially is started with that, and we've been we've been following every guideline keeping you know good neighborhood spirit, keeping things down where we're essentially family from business where people come in from around the neighborhood and as far as the complaints as far as the complaints, I am NOT I'm, pretty much sure that he's been the one calling all the complaints and our music is a background. Music do not have a DJ or any kind of amplifiers that will amplify kind of noise for the neighborhood okay, I mean it. I do not know, but I do it does seem. It does seem very consistent, not quite every day, but there's been a very consistent I actually put the download of the phone calls on the screen. You can kind of see, it's been pretty consistent, I do not I do not, and I thing is on what we have information of. We can't see if it's the same caller or different people, but it did start on January 1st. There were no calls. You have no calls at all before January 1st. It started on January 1st and it ends on February 17 and, like I said there were 18 total calls. You'll see some of them say they responded in with the information available. I observed no evidence of a problem, but there were out of those. There were about 10. That said, they took action to fix the conditions, so Clint just to clarify art. Is that time? The time they called is that 421,342 yeah so they're, calling in the afternoon they're calling in six no that's 1116 101 in the morning and then 10:15 over here I'm sorry I was looking at this other call and call him in. Oh sorry, that's I, know, I, know, I, know military time. Yeah, look at the creative data and looks like so most of them are like 10:11 o'clock seem to be when they were when most of them were called, but it does seem like back to back to back to in one day like this is called. This is time on this one, the 25th they call theirs at 11:59 and then or 11:30, and then 11:59 like they're, not even giving a chance for things happened. This does seem alike a this. If I might, if I may say something the same neighbor oh I was talking about, he did come in and asked us to help us out with the wine with the with the food and I explained the gentleman that you know, we've been in the business I've been in the business for a while and I had an almost amount of yet he's my best friend of mine. He was yelling me out with the mines and he did ask for free food and I told him I could do is give you discounts as your neighbor, upstairs and after I have spoken to him when I told him that he just rushed out of the rushed out of the restaurant and threatened to call the police and threatened to call the landlord operation, but just a month and a half period of calls. So when exactly did that discussion happen with him December the end of December? What are you going to recommend to you? If you have not done it already, is to go to the ninth Precinct Community Council and ask them to check your 3- 1 months. You can do it yourself on open data, but the precinct itself can tell you if the complaints are coming from one person or more than one person. I have spoken to I have spoken to the officers when they come in and they have told me is it's been. They think it's the same person upstairs, which I bet them will have proof. We need some sort of documentation, get the phone calls. So they know they can't necessarily give you the information so who's making the phone calls history when they're anonymous for us, but for them they get all the information. So they're able to say comes from one person. It comes from more than one person. If it's him, then maybe they can. They can arbitrate something. If it's more than one person, then you should know that right so that you can address the issue, but they have the ability to tell you whether or not it's one person or more than one person, okay, so what I would suggest is working with them, but also just you know, I know you had been open before and it does I even thought to myself earlier. It did seemed odd if they started January 1st and went to February 17, so I do not know. What's going on with that, but just something for you to consider- and you know- try to make a conscious effort to if it is loud or if your music does get loud. If there's any issues, just you need to pay attention to that, we definitely will cure it right away. So the other question I had and I can actually share. I can share the diagram just so everyone can see what we're referring to on your sidewalk cafe. You have the tables against the facade and on your facade, your windows open and your windows open out so and they back up to each other, so they're kind of perpendicular to the wall or the are not the windows going to interfere with your sidewalk cafe. No, they were not interfere because the way the tables are lined up, they open right in between them. So there will be a lot of accident. Do not be Isis on both sides as well as the service they could come out from any side. They won't because those they're French windows, the doors yeah. They look like that right. Yes, so your tables are going to be the tables and chairs are going to be arranged in between there they'll fit, yes, the they fit just right. Cuz I mean if you look at. If you look at just in this middle window with the two stools, there is not much room be really for a table in there. It looks like it would just be a little tight with what yeah it won't be tight, but I think would be enough space for the two people to see they come from server-. Coming from the side. Okay, I mean that's, not that's, not necessarily, there's I'm not saying, there's anything wrong with that. I was just questioning it because it did not quite look like it would physically fit, but we tried it and it will work. It just will be a little tight Hey. So I have one other comment too. If you're, if we're looking at the diagram- and this is kind of the same thing we were talking about with the previous applicant on the first Avenue side- there's an existing garbage can there's a mailbox, a mailbox, the traffic light. At the other side, there is the phone booth furniture which are fixed furniture like specifically at the far end I guess it would be the North End where the phone booth is I, do not think there's enough clearance there for a sidewalk cafe. Well, there's not because if you look at this right, it says well at the most here. So it's 15 and 4 or 15 feet, and then maybe a quarter or a more than a quarter. I had several senior, but then here it says the cafe would be five feet and four inches. So that means that the phone booth would rest within the 10 feet. This is more than two peaks yeah, so like I. Do not think that there's enough clearance between your sidewalk cafe and the phone booth at that end for it to be there even for the weight line. I do not think there's enough. If you removed a table, you would still have the issue with the weight line. Yeah the service I would mean the service tile. Thank you, I think Harmons a minute thumbs up and at the opposite end right. You still have this is nine feet: they're measuring it as nine feet, eight inches from here right, but then all this street furniture is here so I do not know how he walks. Yeah, that's all fixed up, considered, fixed furniture, and you have to have an 8-foot clearance between the furniture and the edge of your sidewalk. Cafe would be which would be this dotted line, designating the service aisle so I'm not quite sure how they came up with these plans, given the existing furniture on First, Avenue and I recognize First Avenue is very difficult to walk on. Just as a single person in this area is it's very narrow and if there are a number of people it's hard to get through, even if the illusion is that it's much wider. Do you understand the issue that we're seeing which houses Cyber cafe is constructed on First Avenue and have the street furniture exists? I understand, I could see. I could see what you mean by because the size is still it is it's 15 feet. It's only 15 feet. Yes, just wonder. Is there cheese I mean we're looking at your plan and it does not appear that can be because your plan has five and five feet: four inches for the single table and in order to accommodate a wait, aisle right, you need to have a weight aisle that's set five and a quarter which leaves a remaining nine and eight inches and a quarter. But then the street furniture is here and you're a junior architect or your designer did not measure the distance from the tables to the street furniture. These are all considered fixed pieces of furniture, so there has to be eight feet between them and the weight aisle so I do not see the eight feet between them and the White Aisle I mean I, think the garbage can are out than a foot which is going to bring it within the eight feet. So these two distances here between the edge of your sidewalk cafe, which includes the table and the service aisle and then the distance between that and the mailbox garbage can existing. There looks that's not meeting the required eight feet that the DCA requires and that's not our I mean that's, not something. That's not our requirement. That's DCA! Looking at the middle seat, so, let's get past the garbage can so now we have to multi there and it seems to be enough clearance for those two tables to co- exist. He did not do the measurement, I would say: maybe you could have one table and then is it really worth it to have the one table I do not know that we would make a cafe that has one table. I do not know that this is sufficient clearance right. That goes from remember the way tile. The edge of the way tile to the garbage can I mean the only thing again. I do not know if the garbage can, because if again it has to fit in with all the other streets in it, and you can't put it anywhere else- I mean that's. What Department of Sanitation would let you, but it seems to be thick there for a reason. I think there could be a space in here where he could put a table or but I do not know again. Is it worth it to have one table on that side? I was thinking, food will not get to their claim here. Is that too so, right there and there's plenty of this plenty of space, there's over nine feet, eight inches for those two tables. Now here's the other crime are. You are you not using this basement doorway at all. It's here that we do not use the basement door. Well, he did not do that anyway, because of that existing phone booth- those can't be there at all- that's not those are out. That's out. I still think it looks like the garbage ins right before that chair yeah right there yeah still it's not the chairs for the garbage. Can it's the edge of the way right? It's the entire perimeter. Yeah look at the clearance there. It seems like there's enough, because this is nine feet. Eight and a quarter inches, wait! I'm! Sorry, just like Clinton explain this for a second it's just so let me show it's nine feet so I'll. Let me highlight this again, so this nine feet, eight inches goes to this to the edge of your sidewalk cafe. So that means between the curb- and this is nine feet- eight inches. So that means the garbage can would only be able to take up one foot eight inch in order to have eight feet of clearance right, and so that's why we're getting rid of that one. If we get rid of that one table that table there below yeah so that one's out, so what does not that mean that those other two tables are fine I? Do not think that this one is fine. I, do not think the second southern table I think it's still too close, because I guess it could move a little more north to make a look, because we're getting rid of that table. That's acrosss from the phone booth. They could move up I just that space to me looks like I can fit two unless I'm missing something I think this is too much for us to try to yeah are so. These are inadequate, planner and I. Think that's a given that the way that they're presented to us, we can only approve on East, 6Th, Street and then I would not be approving a to top table on the easternmost portion of East sixth Street, which is the farthest into the residential street. I would approve only like one single row of tables along East, Sixth Street, and then my expectation would be that they would have to be flush against the facade of the building. However, your devising that so that means either they sit in between your open windows that do not fold back flat or you keep your windows closed so that you can accommodate your sidewalk cafe right to see how on the easternmost portion are the westernmost portion of the sixth Street, which is the farthest into the block. There's a to top tables. I think it should just be one single row, which is one two three four one, two three five six seven tables and fourteen seats. Yeah I could do that. Does anybody disagree with me or agree with me so that we can figure out if we need to go to the making which can go to the making of a resolution? Or do you understand? Do you understand that we still think it's an issue about how your doors open and whether or not you can accommodate the sidewalk cafe the way we think it needs to be accommodated which is on this and we get that you said, does not have much life to it. But sixth Street is a residential street, which is why it does not really have that many tall cafes. So as if it's going to go into sixth Street, we think they should be. The tables should be up against your facade. The way we see your door doors opening. We do not know how you're going to be able to do that. You said you could so it's either you're going to either have to do it by putting them between the doors, the tables or and having the doors Jut out into your cafe, because that's what's going to happen, your weight person, it kind of could have come against the doors unless the tables are exactly flush with the doors or keep the doors closed. When you have the cafe open- and that may also be an issue with respect to noise, but talk to the police about it- maybe not just the who respond, who may or may not be your NCOs you're, like neighborhood officers, but go in to a precinct council meeting and speak to your neighborhood officers and the special operations lieutenant. So you can understand where the complaints are coming from, because if there's more than one person complaining about noise, it may just be that your facade is wide open, so business that was there before you quiet, I'm. Guessing these complaints all came from January to February I'm. Guessing your facade was not open at that time. The French door is actually open to the facade so moving the moving the tables and the chairs, because we could choose which windows to open I mean no I, think that's fine I think I just make sure they're flush again. As long as your tables are flush, we do not care where they are just as long as you know. It works yeah as long as you get that and you keep whether you have to keep the windows closed, whether they fit between the windows, if that, if they do that's fine or if you know figure something out, but just keep just so the tables are flush against the facade not outside. Okay, want me to go to the making of a resolution. Please. Okay, so it'll begin with where it's closed, it's just what the application is for a second, where clause which outlines what the sidewalk cafe consists of in terms of number of tables and see it's where they would be located in proposed dollars that were having reviewed, submitted diagram. We have complete concern about tables and seats located on First Avenue, because on the north side they would be within the north side. Table would be within or tables two would be within a seat of a phone booth. On the southern, the southern side, the tables would be within 8 feet of other street furniture, that being mailboxes and a garbage. Can so would not approve? We could well I can say that we're four. We would then approved with a modification not to have a sidewalk cafe on the First Avenue side of the street and limiting East sixth Street sidewalk, cafe to a single row of two top tables against the facade of the building and therefore would approve with a change order for did I count them right. 67 tables at 87 tables and fourteen seats in a single rose to talks against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side of the business Ellen. Do you have that day lose Ellen? She has her new Don, so she can't hear me sorry, Ellen, yeah, eight tables and seven tables and fourteen seats will be low. The cafe will consist of seven gables and fourteen feet. So then the numbers in the filling boxes, the change and at the bottom you would put seven the sidewalk cafe would being located. It would be one row of two top tables of seven tables and fourteen seats against flush against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side, as if it said, okay do I have to include none on First Avenue. All right now know that I put that into the resolution and then the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe would be 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days. Okay and then for the remaining questions. Can I ask them now? What about sorry, we did not go. You mean I did not go through to see if anyone else so Ellen go ahead. If you have other questions, sorry about that, it's okay! So for the dream in here, so for this Iowa cafe, will you have planned triggers railings fence, nothing just for as we're beginning process with the cafe, but we will keep with within the boundaries of community for members there will be a balcony, yes, I'm, sorry we're not doing any fence. As of now we're just going to put up the single table with its four chairs. Okay and there will be an awning I- know, there's already existing on it, okay and then during the warmer months, will you open or remove the establishments windows and or doors? We will open up the now, remove the doors, okay and I'm sorry Jessie did you of it. I did not go through the Geo, any questions or comments, Jessie, no I'm, good Herman, that's a pass on anything! Okay. Is there a second for the resolution? A second for any amendment. Did somebody pick in it I? Second seconded? Oh thanks, mom favor, yes, okay, your contact information! Ellen! Do you have his contact information, the eight four seven, eight, three, five number, yes, widow, a gmail, yes, okay, and do you want us to send that year, the form tomorrow? Do we send it to your attorney and CCU? It's fine see they had looked at him. Yes, thank you. Okay, all right! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're moving on to number six now it's an application for an upgrade. This is a rest prod for whom we approved administrative leave proved a wine beer license in February of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full- service, restaurant at a Japanese, high Stuckey Styles tasting menu and a kitchen serving food open and serving food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. all days, no use of outdoor space. Clearly it's without a 10:00 p.m. playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration before. First with efforts coming before the community board, not hosting Huff curls their party buses, not having am limited, drink specials, not having late lines outside the license was issued. November 1st of 2018 the business opened on June 24th of 2019. The application is as follows: it has the CFO 74 with zero tables in 20 to 22 seats. The applicant has written in that the business now sits 14. The counter Sushi Counter is 16 foot by 8 foot by 12 foot with 8 stools, and there looks like there's a second counter with four stools. So I'm going to ask the applicant to speak to that, because photographs of the location, the way it exists down and as advertised show two counters where the chef works in between with seven feet so on each kids like sitting on each counter. The hours are 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. Tuesday through Sunday closed Mondays, which are reduced hours, kitchen open all hours. There's no answer about the facade. Although, when I looked at pictures of the business it looks like the facade is fixed. No TVs recorded black background music, no promoted event scheduled performances are covered, their security, existing soundproofing, no pub crawls our party buses, no happy hours, no way lines. There's no agreement about having somebody responsible for overseeing the sidewalk outside there are 15 Opie's within 500 feet. The applicant has operated business of 177 First Avenue since January 2017, 128, West Houston streets in September of 2012 and 15 Gridley Street in Saratoga, Springs and April of 2017. The 177 first Avenue is a little tongue middle shop, which has a beer wine license, issued March 2nd of 2017 and 15 Grizzlies Street is a hotel with a hotel, license issues October 25th of 2017, and I could not find any MLA history regarding 128 but Houston Street. There was a letter submitted by the 9Th Street, a one- block association in opposition to this upgrade citing too many like businesses. The fact that it's mid block on a residential zone straight. This is our 8 D zoning and that other nearby jet Japanese restaurants have beer wine licenses. That's it ok, so your opportunity to make a minaret anything or change anything Karen, okay. So oh, my okay, yes I'm Karen, karen Lynn I'm, one of the partners at Tsukimi, and thank you all for making the time and for putting us on the agenda today. So just a little bit of background, so Keisuke style restaurant so that basically, the multi traditional Japanese multi course restaurant. Where we serve with the progression of dishes throughout the evening, it's a seasonally focused. We change our menu I'm recording to season. So again, our focus is more on the progression of the meal and the service and kind of give like a deeper, culinary experience for our guests. So, regarding the seating in sight, so we are quite small. We had initially a little ambitious thought. We could do 22 seats and that's what how we apply it, but right now we only have fourteen and the way that we had to renovate the interior. As was mentioned before, we only have two counters now, with seven seats on each side, so we can only fit 14 people in our space at the moment. So it's a very limited seat. So, right now we do not even have a bar inside. It's only seating for dining, so we are applying for an upgrade to a full liquor. Initially was because we thought it would be a good experience for our guests to offer a little bit more variety for them to have a better experience. We have had guests pre lockdown. We had yet to come in that asked, for you know like an after- dinner beverage, and since we only have a right now, we did not have anything that we could offer them, so that kind of you know encouraged us to pursue this more and now I guess even with the situation given I think that we just need any anything that could help us survive when we reopen I, think just even having this you know, liquor license could help even just a little bit of increase in sales for us to, in addition to, of course, providing a better experience for our guests, I did want to add I understand the concerns about having other you know, 15 other establishments in the area that already have full liquor licenses and we're not a bar were we're very quiet, we're not where we only really limit our seating. We've been and I know we're on the residential block, which actually is really in line with what our philosophy is for our type of restaurant or concept are our service style. So even the residents in our building the signed, our petition there they're supportive of us so I- think that's encouraging for us to also hopefully apply for this liquor license also with the other restaurants in the neighborhood are Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood we have like papayas and sushi restaurants and I know it's not gay bars, but we're quite different from that right now. Also we're only doing one seating and after we reopen we'll, probably continue that for some time we might have to also decrease capacity since we're so small, but we're hoping to you know when we reopen, we will have all our tools to you know survive. So hopefully we can upgrade our license. Oh that's! All okay, I do not think well. Actually there was so I. Think Laura you were here. Did you have some? Did you have any comments or questions? Yes, please I just wanted to say that we're very much sympathetic with how difficult the climate is right now we're doing everything we can to support local businesses. We just launched a map of what's open and who's delivering and all of that and I realize that you know your model, just it's a$ 200 per person. Very it's you know exclusive experience, it's not something you can send out via overeats, so well there. It is a concern that you know how recently you've opened and I'm not worried about. You know you have pinks next door, there's a lot of other liquor licenses in the area, but you're not a bar. It's a very internal and historically the restaurant at that location has been a very internal experience. The facade is fixed. You go downstairs to little space, so not worried about rowdiness we are concerned is just something everyone's starting to think about. You know if you do not come back the way you expect to or if something changes that we're licensing a place that potentially you know could become, it could become a problem for the neighborhood and I. Do not know whether the committee has thought about that, and if there are any ways we could possibly address that also just the hours is it in, because I think the beer and wine had slightly later hours and I just would be concerned about it going until 2:00 a.m. like right now, you're. We have your word, which I appreciate saying it's just one seating and that's your intention, but we do not have in writing what it's going to turn what it could possibly turn into. So those are our concerns. Thank you for listening. So well as long as it's still tsukimi and it's under our ownership. We definitely do not intend on opening late I mean even you know, even if we try to do more than one seating, it's actually going to be physically difficult for our team, but in terms of the yes right now we because of our concept. We have not been able to do delivery or takeout, unfortunately, we're just relying on you know some of our even some of our neighbors, who have actually bought gift certificates for us to you know, keep us open when we reopen you're concerned about us, possibly changing our concept or philosophy. I guess I can you know I can only say you know say verbally, but yeah and we've been thinking about this restaurant for so long and we're so lucky that we found the space in the East Village, which we myself and our partners. We feel very attached to this neighborhood, so we're so excited and we just opened we're barely a year old. We want to keep me to be a part of this community and, of course, we're always open to what the community would suggest and any advice, anything that we can become have a better connection with our neighbors and we're definitely open to that. So I do not know. If that would answer your concerns or questions. No, it's really for the committee. Thank you, Mm-, hmm, okay, I! Guess we'll go through the committee now Jesse. Do you have any questions or comments? I do not have any questions. I would just say that I do understand with the reduction of seats, the need to kind of compensate for that. If they were thought it was going to have twenty two and now it's fourteen, so I could see that needs to and if they're hopefully going to open when this is all over I like to support businesses that could so, but that's all I have Harmon. We can't hear you Harmon. No, yes, maybe no question. Okay, Ellen I do not have any questions. Okay, I! You know my only my I only kind of pause on this because of the fact I truly think. If we were to give an upgrade I think you are the type of business that it was legitimately. A restaurant I do not think you are a bar have any intention of being a bar or drawing a bar crowd, and your hours are till midnight, so you're, not a late- night business. My only concern and I'm not I'm, still trying to decide in my head how much of a concern it is that, typically, we do not approve upgrades in mid- block on a residential side street, because we are still trying to maintain a residential character on those side streets, and it is, you know if it was a previously licensed location. That would also be it would probably make it a lot easier for me, but the fact that it was a previously unlicensed location- and it is mid- block- makes me think about this. A little bit more than I would normally, but we have talked about you know. One thing we've talked about in the past is: if we are going to issue upgrades, is it to people that we feel are you know legit restaurants, not something that's going to masquerade as a bar? Now you know, that's I think this is an example of that I do not think I do not think it is a bar or would serve as a bar with a late- night crowd. That's yeah I totally hear you man and it's not Karen. It's not about your restaurant per se. I think the concern here is what, if you guys, do not survive by the end of the year, and you already, you know we would approved a spot that was not like license before right. So that's sort of you know forethought there. So it's not necessarily representative of a critique of your restaurant hope we survive. We want to survive any more years and we want everyone to survive-. That's definitely want to. You know we want to be an establishment in the East Village. You know like an own establishment in the East Village and in the with everyone involved. So you know on our big I know it's. Oh sorry, I was just looking at your diagram. How big do you know offhand how many square feet your total space is think it's like 700 square feet about yeah cuz. It's like 40 looks like about 42 feet, deep and 16 feet wide. The kitchen is slightly smaller than a dining room. Kitchen looks to be probably about the kitchen. Is 130 square feet, so it's like 10 by 13, oh here it is on there. So the kitchen is 130 square feet. The main room is 470 square feet, so you're like 600 square feet, even a little smaller than you thought. Oh, if you include there's a vestibule 20 feet in a bathroom of 30 feet, so yeah I think overall you're, probably just under 700 square feet. I understand the concern is more: if we're not there anymore, I guess yes, then what are we stuck with because they seem to last interminably licenses? So I have a just a couple of questions: you're, maintaining the method of operation which, as I, understand when you say, Kentucky style menu at the 12-course tasting menu. So it takes at least two and a half hours to seat the people that you seat is that right. Our goal is right. Now is two and a half hours for one seating and when you had even the open with these, our is 6:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. I thought you were contemplating them to two seatings. Were you contemplating two ceilings within six to twelve or within six to two Oh within six to twelve? If we were able to do two sittings, that in the application, which says 16 by 8 foot by 12, foot Sushi counter with 18 stools, is that what you originally contemplated? Yeah, because you as opposed to only and you know the application- should be what exists now so good thing that exists now are 230 counters of what sighs two counters, but it's not and we do not actually serve Sushi, but it's if they're, just like dining, no I'm, sorry I'm calling him that but two counters, but of what side I'm so sorry I would have to pull up the plan, but it could seat seven people 10 to 12 feet or 12 feet for each counter. It's a seven seats per counter, so it's 14 total right now. So it's seven feet but I'm talking about feet, seven seats per counter yet yeah. So you would not necessarily want to have one foot per person right, especially when they're eating. So you have a little more than one foot for personality. That's why I said is that it can you approximate the length of the counters just so I know that help yeah. It's a little bit different is what you originally were proposing: yes, not what actually fit. No that's. She said: that's smaller 14 feet. This I made this one thick yeah, so it's 14 feet per counter and then that other counter, that's here at the entrance or in the back I can't tell which it is it's in the back that does not exist either. Is that what you're saying here at the bar counter there's no bar counter? Oh this is this: was a okay now I'm, seeing what you have this? Is this yeah, this drawing wound very first ones, which we just I just wanted to clarify, because that's the drawing that we were given that son Accurate drawing it's just two fourteen speed counter counters on either side of where the service happened. Is that right? That's correct? Yes, okay! So it's kind of like an immersive meal experience with people, so this front section with this little this little entryway and bar counter. That's all gone! Okay! All right does anybody else want to speak to whether or not they should be approved. So this would be one to two seating. The night with two and a half our tasting menus or tasting menus are a minimum of two and a half hours proceeding with the hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. and even though the wine beer license was checked off for closed facade at 10:00. It has a fixed facade. Anybody I can only see the very grand well I see you guys at the time here. I'll stop, sharing its final, clean I. Think I would be okay with this, maybe reluctantly, but and nothing against nothing about your business Karen, but just in general, with our you know our kind of history and what we generally approve but I. Think given the size of space, given their business and I would I can I think approve this. So do you want to approve this with may be aware of clause that, given the residential character of the street, this would be you know, after other, where of clauses which I could get to, but given the residential character of the street, we typically would not want to approve a full license for an eating and drinking business mid- block even with a period of operation, but are considering doing this, because this is a less than seven hundred square foot restaurant with less than four hundred and fifty square feet of Patron Accessible area, two counters that see 14 people, hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. daily and method of operation as a restaurant, with a tasting menu of no less than at least twelve courses that taste at least two and a half hours so would accommodate only one to two seatings per night. Yes, do they make them? And you know yeah I mean I, know we can't and I'll. You know, I think you mentioned early hours, it's not going to generate a lot of street traffic. I mean I think all of those things we could put in there to support going out of the norm and approving something like this on a residential side street okay, in which case the resolution, would the first paragraph to say that this is an upgrade application and where what the application consists of, which are the element that has described as a summarize in the application that it was previously administratively proved a wine beer license in February 2010 and the stipulations that were approved at that time, that its license was issued. November 2018 it opened in June of 2019 that is located mid, lock on a residential side streets on RIT, where there had been a longtime, restaurant or restaurants. But with my near licenses that the type of business is the type of businesses is Kentucky's. A Japanese Kentucky style tasting restaurant that has one to two seating of people per night or patrons per night, twelve course or multi- course tasting menu. That takes at least two and a half hours to served and with two and consists no more than two seating per night of patrons for its tasting menu. The experience of the applicant would be you know, as I described it would be in a film where a clause we would put in the where I Clause that I suggested with respect to this location and how we view this, but that, given that this has limited hours very limited, seating and seats are limited, seating and seats. We were to prove it with stipulation and then it would be as a full- service, Japanese, restaurant and I I'm going to qualify that but I think Ellen is probably going to probably going to have to be at the bottom, because I do not think it'll fit in the top Oh. Can you hear me yeah? Do you want me okay, relation on this? No, not yet so, then the hours would be 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. all days, I'm. So sorry, we're actually closed on Mondays and Tuesdays I forgot to mention yeah Barry, so Tuesday through Sunday closed on Mondays and Tuesdays Monday. That's what I thought your web page says and articles have said about you, but that's not what this application said. So Ellen did you get that so it's Wednesday through Sunday, 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. closed Mondays and Tuesdays. She has their Mic off. Oh she's made it again, hey sorry, yes, I got it closed. Monday and Tuesday Wednesday, just Sunday 6 p.m. to 12 a.m. no commercials outdoor space. The facade is fixed enclosed. So it's the section on the right recorded background music. Only you know the DJ's live, music, promoted events scheduled performances or events discover she's, not applying for an alteration with efforts coming before us: okay, no pub crawls our party buses, no unlimited drinks, special, no happy hours, no weight line and because it's a residential zone street I'm, really the essence of anybody. It's having somebody responsible for overseeing the sidewalk. That does not mean that somebody is standing outside like a doorman Karen, but it just means that one of the responsibilities of one of your employees or one of the responsibilities of all of your employees is that they are mindful about whoever's outside in front of the business to ensure that nobody's making noise or loitering for too long absolutely. Okay, I have one more question in regards to that. Given that you have you know you have once eating, or even if you were to have two seatings, because the that seating is at a certain time, you do not do you have I mean I know you said right now, you're generally having one seating, but if you are going to have two seatings, because it's I think what Alex said, because it's a residential street, you know you can't have, even if it's only 14 people waiting outside at 8:30 or whatever blocking, is sidewalk or anything waiting for the next seating. If you are going to have seedings, you know, I do not know if you have a text system or something where it's specifically that they would show at a certain time. So that they're not waiting outside at all we're, definitely going to have to the time of reservations and also we're giving ourselves at least 30 minutes to prepare in between so that, okay, all right, they can actually come in. So you won't have that problem of people overlapping and waiting outside block okay feel comfortable. Having people wait outside. Is you know it's depending on the weather two of me? If it's nice, it's fine, but yeah. So then that last thing filling at the bottom Mm- hmm. It should say that this is them that I will operate a full- service, Japanese, high Stuckey style or Japanese restaurant with a Keisuke styled tasting menu consisting of multiple courses and will have one to choose feedings per night. Did you get that and I should also add it, whereas clubs with respect to the letter from the next Retail Unlock, Association and edct their statement? Okay, is there a second for any amendment, I'll? Second, all in favor? Yes, all right! Thank you Karen! Can we send this to your attorney? Yes, okay, what is your it's Karen at all blue DOT? Us all blue one word. Yes, that us okay, so much okay! Thank you! Everyone! Okay! Thank you too. Okay, all right, everybody, okay! So until there Thank You Laura thanks what you doing, she has your thing wrong: she's, muted, okay, so far, that's all any of us can say: that's all we can say. Okay, so far, so that's all we can say and Lawrence I mean this is a public meeting. So it's fine for you to be here. This can be I, guess technically, under new business, we've been thinking for a while about, and you actually might have some input on. This we've been thinking for a while about, because we'd be getting so many of our admin approvals that are coming back in six eight months for upgrades. We've talked about this and I think it's finally time. We actually need to do it. We need to put in our in the admin approval a time frame. I do not know whether that I think maybe a year is a little bit too short. I think two years might be too much. We might get too much pushback I'm thinking. Maybe my thought this is just me is something like 18 months just because that gives us a full cycle of a year to one and sure they're going to remain open to we get through all of the seasons, because, if even if they open in July, they may not really get started until August September October they've missed the summer. If we give them a year, it's not. You know if we do 18 months, I, think that gives us enough time to really see how they're operating, how do I mean they're different from season to season? Yes, they can be, they can be different. They can be consistent, open yeah. Anyone else have any thoughts on that or harm agrees. We're saying all administratively approved have to wait at least 18 months before they come to us. For that we would put that in. We would put that in right like right now, there's no time limit in the administrative approval they just have to adhere. We've been talking about a time limit is that is that solving anything or is that creating a problem? Is that creating a solution trying to find a problem? Like people are coming to us and saying, and if it is if this is the case, then I'm on board, because you guys have been doing this longer, but if our people, if people come to us three, four five, six eight months after they've, applied we're going to make that argument, we're going to say cuz, it's been long enough. I just do not see creating a rule for something that we'd already mentioned. Unless I miss anything I, think what it's preventing is. You know we're getting on our agenda each month, at least on the past couple months. It's been at least two or three upgrades that have only been open for six eight months and we spend our time then going through it telling them the same thing, but we're taking up time in our meeting and extending our meetings and making more work. If we had any say- and even if we made it, you know, even if we at least made it a year. You know I'm not well. Of the 14 sounds a little more comfortable to me, but I'm open to I'm, open yeah discussion, I mean I just kind of picked 18 months, because I feel like for some reason. I feel, like twelve, is a little short just to really see how they could make it through all seasons and how they are, as an operator I. Think two years is probably too long. That's why I just randomly picked eighteen months, but is that giving them any sort of flexible I mean again just to play? Devil's advocate on that for a second, but like? Is that giving them any flexibility on they open it and things like the woman we just had and they thought they could fit. 22 people and, let's sit. Let's give them benefit of the doubt. They had 22 people and then that could work, but they realize they can't fit that many people they need a 14 and they got a license at the end of 2018 and it still took them an additional eight months to open their business, so their opening process has really been. In that case, that's really been extended. Iii I get I, get what you're all saying and I do and I see we're going again just to play. Devil's advocate because I I'm also hesitant making a rule during this time when we're about to lose a lot of businesses. I do not know, but because we're about so a lot of people come back and be like yeah, hey I, do not have any money and I do not know many workers. I do not know. I do not know. We do not know. What's going to happen, I know Ben, but it's frightening. It's a frightening time. Well, I do not think I mean I. Do not think that rule yet that rule will not make much of a dent in this circumstance, like they're, already open if they're already so a woman Bank, it won't go back. We're saying new bills because they do not have they do not have it in their stipulations. Right they've already had an admin approval. That stipulation is not in there I just I. Just do not I guess I, just I hate to put undue burden on why I do not know, but here's the thing I do not think it's an undue burden because they do not have to apply for an admin process. They can come to us, otherwise, so you're saying so. Instead they could come and say we want to follow up here right off the bat yes, rather than this, using the administrative approval process to get. You know it's within the door yeah and then seek the upgrade much sooner when we may be created all so. You know we want some good face to go into the administrative approval process that you're. Actually you know the type of business that we're seeking administrative Lea proved, not one that just wants to. You know, circumvent the process of being heard and really understanding what your intentions are. So, if I understand that makes sense. So if I understand this correctly, like if I'm a new business and I, if I'm a new restaurant and I or bar or tavern and I, make a good- faith effort, so I would come in and I am not administered by I apply for just beer wine, then I would not have this rule put on because I'm like I'm coming to you. This is what I want to do. I've got this petitions I've done other things, then I could come and I'm like, but you know, maybe in ten months once we've warmed up and we've proven ourselves, but by the next season. We'd have the opportunity to speak to you and that we recomm out. Eventually it comes out right. So it's encouraging people to come before us, rather than get in Ministry of Labour well to come before us if they want their business to evolve in a certain way within a certain amount of time, as opposed to there are a block of businesses that fit into that administrative approval that are like the wine bar that just stays open till twelve and has recorded music or the restaurant. That is open till eleven is that you know sit- down restaurant like a Italian. Restaurant only wants to have served wine right. That is getting the beer wine license because they come together. You know there are those businesses and those would be the ones that will be fine, saying that's not going to bother me, because this is how I contemplate my business for the near future. We just are concerned about those that group of businesses that seems to be turning around saying. I need a change in my business now, the minute the administrative approval was really for a business for like a defined business model, at least defying for a period of time, but we're getting less than a year. I do not know, then we, it does not seem like they really have that definition, but that they're, just using it as a tool to get to get in the door, I think easier to get approve the admin approval they do not have to come to us. They apply. They submit the paperwork right once they get that they think. Oh then, we can just go for an upgrade so they're taking up double the amount of time in some ways when we would have just heard them one would this, and that makes sense to me. Is there anything that they was that this would inhibit for the state SLA like? Would they say like? Would they go hey? We wanted to apply, but we can't even do it because the Community Board says no. Would this day be like well, we do not really agree with that. So we'll just let you would like to we'll. It would have bite us in the back when they hold it well yeah, and then they go well. You guys did not hear them so we'll approve that I do not know you guys noticed it. I do not know. I have to I would have to investigate that a little more because there are places there are community boards that have sort of probationary period and we used to have like an unspoken nine months. This was way back in the 90s when I first started, and but nobody really enforced it. So it did not have very much meaning a nine month probationary period, where you were not really supposed to change anything, but that was not something that we communicated to the SLA or that was enforced. You know in any way enforceable, so I would have to ask if you know we can hold them to it. Do not come back to us within 18 months. We might not be able to do it yeah we start yeah. Let's see if we try to change it before we try to change the admin process we should find out if we can legally do it or if the state would uphold that, because if we put that in there and the state says no we're not going to do that, then they could just skip over us and then go for an upgrade than that right, yeah! That's what could make things worse for us by the way we could meet anywhere, which I explained last week because the meeting requirements are suspended. So if we no need to sit around and talk about stuff go on and on any applicant can just go over us, Village Tavern they went to and the state sent them back and then they applied again and did not show up Laura and I risk getting the Corona, but they subsequently sent me the email saying that we were still three degrees apart but and then wait Laura. You were in that one as well. Yes, she was cuz that, because you had a meeting that we had a meeting that night at the and I was like clear. It's getting us exposed made a decision like you did not have to speak or anything I stood up in to see I just said the reason I said. Look the reason. We're opposed. Is you know this and I said they've been closed for several months and they pretty much they're like? Oh, all, they want to do is sell the license, but we're denying they. It took us a whole two minutes or three minutes up in front of them, but that meeting was not a Moute meeting. They were in Albin II and we were in New, York, yeah and I quit because they already do the remote right, yes, yeah if they can figure out a way to keep it going. And if you read, if you read the SLA website right now, they have an executive order in the in the wing kind of for business for when they need to start handling things remotely and separate from each other, but they're allowing the commissioners to review certain applications and put certain applications through. Oh I mean you have to read it. So this idea that- and there do not seem to be 540 hearings- I gather cuz- those have to be in person and with a J- job right. If you're approving something I do not know why the application process would not continue, because it does not seem to require at this point the sitting Commission. It seems to only require an evaluation by the chair, and then, if the chair makes an assessment, there has to be a hearing that I guess he was scheduled a hearing. But that's my reading of what definitely was not today, you know was curious to see if they had any Covid-19 related directives that they were sending out to people or posting for people and I do know. A lot of people are saying different things about what's happening with the licensing process. That is I need that applicants do not want to engage in it, which it has not been my experience. So you know Clint's been talking to you for the block from the block Association the business applicant. You know they happen to find themselves stuck in another state. You know with family members. That seems to be what might be an impediment rather than I do not know. What's going to happen, I do not want to try. I have not been getting that yeah. All right, I have to go because I'm starving to death wait. So we need to identity in the work motion to adjourn the stipulation that you change orders in the morning in an email claim. Can you send me in a minute no Jesse did the minute I did the minutes. Can you send me the minute? Yes, Agon and then I will send them out to the attorney tomorrow. Oh I know you are but Laura I have won one thing for you: did you see on TV grave that what's- his- name opened up the doors of Gusto house and was playing the piano on 4th Street? Yes, I did not see any degree, but he's been doing that. Oh he's been doing that before, like opening up the front doors and playing for outside I, just I thought I do not even grieve I did he has the space next door, that's actually a storefront that he's got all his pianos in ok, where he does like tunings and things. So it's not the space proper, oh okay, I, just I kind of thought on TV grieve! So I did not it's a it's the storefront where he has all his pianos and he does open the doors and play once in a while. Okay, yeah I got ta check in with him and what Alex just said. What we? What Susan has told us is the Jade withdrew her application for 235 and it's not pursuing it. She did not help me that last time I talked to her. It was just kind of on hold because she was still in Florida and so I do not know. I do not have any more information other than Susan said it was withdrawn, but I do not know okay good to know withdrawn. He talked in and this man who came said that majority knows they're applying for next month, yeah so yeah, who knows TBD and who knows where we'll all be next month. So for a second.
