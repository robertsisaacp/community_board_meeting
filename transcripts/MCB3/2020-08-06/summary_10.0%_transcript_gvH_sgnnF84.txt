I know that we have heard from lesson in the past around specific programs that they run in our district, but I think that we are sort of in an unprecedented time of changes with our in within our economy that are affecting individuals like never before in this committee.
We talk a lot about small business and sort of larger real estate and economic development things, but we have not, at least in the past couple of months, talk specifically about how this is really affecting the people that live in our community.
Think tank policy, organization- It's, been around for about 25 years now, focused on expanding economic opportunity, reducing inequality and building a more inclusive economy here in New York, and we do that through research by publishing reports and studies that unpack some of these issues in detail, that put forward practical and achievable recommendations for policy.
So Anish invited me here tonight to share a little bit of that data with you all on your district, specifically, the lower East side and and parts of Chinatown, and I can share some of the latest data, both a look at where we stood in these in these neighborhoods right before this pandemic and then sort of a sense of where we may be right now, because of this crisis, and of course, happy to you, know, take any questions or discuss any further, but I did have just a few brief slides to kind of keep.
, Anisha Absolutely we've been really busy since March, but I focused on all sorts of different effects of the of the crisis, and certainly if anybody checks out our work or does not know us before tonight, and you have any thoughts or questions , you can just contact me directly Some.
It was about 3.6 percent in the lower East side in Chinatown about a year and a half ago, and one other trend that I won't spend any time on really tonight, but certainly is geared up in my heart in the work that we do at center for urban future, which is that the population of the lorry side has really been aging significantly, as it has been in the whole city, but about 14.4 percent of the population was 65 or over.
You know, obviously been at risk of contracting the virus but have held on to their jobs, but so many other new yorkers are out of work right, now, and that includes about 20, to 28 of certain census, tracts on the lower East side and in Chinatown It's, not a number for the whole neighborhood.
Of course, there are many more folks who are artists but have a day job frankly likely a job in one of those hard- hit industries, but those folks, those thousand or so working artists in the district have certainly been hit really hard, As well, This is the most recently available data.
I mean it's basically the hardest hit industry in the whole city, and that is where the greatest you know concentration of residents in the district work in restaurants.
So, almost 6,000 people and You know clearly the number one I think impact by industry that you would see in the district right, now.
It's also kind of worth noting that there are a lot of residents who are relatively, have been relatively spared by the economic impacts and all of those yellow industries have really held job losses down, and that includes Healthcare, unsurprisingly, but right down at the bottom advertising public relations and related services.
You know generally fared a lot better architecture, engineering, jobs, computer systems, design, which is basically the single largest industry within what we think of as the tech sector.
Clothing stores really leaps out at me, a particularly hard hit industry again seeing job losses of almost 70 since February And, just in clothing stores alone in the neighborhood individual and family services, which includes a lot of social services organizations which have also seen some pretty serious losses as they've dealt with diminished revenues and other challenges and construction.
You know we're talking about administrative staff, custodial staff, all kinds of people that work in colleges and universities and that's a generally an industry.
We do not know what the job losses look like by occupation, but we can kind of imagine given what some of these occupations say about where people work in terms of industry, And I did just want to put this forward because I think it's interesting to kind of get a sense again of where you know where your neighbors work , You, know, there's a lot of people that are working in management.
You, see chefs and head cooks, all of which are in industries that have been hit really hard right now and artists and related workers, one of the larger occupations frankly in the district, and sets blurry side and Chinatown apart from other parts of the city in that way.
Certainly, we've seen some new data that suggests that jobs have come back about 20 or so of the jobs that were lost from February to May started to come back in June, and that seems to be closely linked with the success I think, of the open streets initiative so certainly worth you know , The second comment: much earlier.
That's tracked in the data and in this case we're just you know, rather than there's a large number of residents who are not employed, including a large number of those 65 and over residents that we talked about before So we're focusing on people that are generally speaking in the workforce and seeing either are they working and if so, where are they working?
A large number are especially in New York City, but are not we missing something by not capturing them in terms of their employment The employment data that we're looking at is anybody who's in the workforce, so that includes people that are over the age of 16 and have a job That's separate from the data on educational attainment, where we use the 25 and up cut off, but you know your point.
You know it includes everything from graduating, with a CUNY college credential, but working in food service and not in a field that aligns with the degree That's a significant challenge that we hear about quite a lot, and certainly for folks with a high school diploma.
That performing arts in general is one of those industries that has been the absolute hardest hit and actually Joe. You know this is just to look at the whole city.
I do not have this data just for the district, but you can see you know the by far in a way the greatest job losses have been in full service, restaurants, both new America, you know total numbers and also the share of all jobs lost since February, But, but right up there at the top is performing arts.
We have, I, think, we're the second or third of the 59 boards in the income, diversity, gap, So It's kind of like having, as I've heard it described one fire one hand in the fire one hand in the freezer and Saying everything's great, I'm wondering because of this we have in past divided our district into 10 sectors, because we have some extremely low income right next to some extremely high income.
I think it's worth pointing out, but as tourism has become increasingly important to the lower East side's economy, it makes the lower east side more vulnerable to this particular crisis, whereas in previous crises like the great recession, which you know, hammered jobs and finance, but did not barely touch jobs and restaurants in New, York City, at least it also is.
There's two ways to cut employment data you can cut it by businesses or by workers, and I think that a lot of what Eli has shared tonight is maybe more by workers So much about the people who reside in the district and where they work, But there is a lot of information about the businesses in the district that are employing people outside of it and that's significant as well.
That might be a little bit about where my question is Eli, on what you might be able to say about employment losses for the categories of businesses within the district, as opposed to the residents who work anywhere in the city in those industries.
Gas bar Just, to hear about what David and Gaspar are going to discuss is that you know when we think about recovery, and you know how we'll move forward as a city and as a community district workforce development has come up as something that's an important piece of an equitable recovery for the economy and obviously Lessen is our.
You know by the time like by next year, we'll also have the 14th street tech Hub, we'll sort of be starting to move a little bit, more.
And I'm joined tonight by David Garza, the executive chair for the network, but also executive director for Henry Street settlement, and we just have a very kind of pretty straightforward presentation, just to kind of give you all an overview of what workforce development industry actually is and the state of it under the current previous to the pandemic, but also now under the current duress and crisis of the economy and then try and wrap up with some recommendations that we have gathered and gleaned.
That David Garza is actually a part of led by New, York, City, Employment and training coalition, and then last also a little bit about what lesson is up to during these times.
We can tonight of trying to be really concise and hopefully open it up to questions because as community- based providers that make up the lower East side, employment, network- We're, really, you know every data point that Eli shared there's a human being behind it and that every human being behind us either trying to feed their family or trying to raise a child or trying to take care of a senior or trying to keep a roof over their head.
But the field as a whole is really responsible for that for connection to the labor market, for training and education, as it relates to employment opportunities for advocacy and then for retention and support services and the circles you see on the on the first slide really represent all the stakeholders and New York City is you know in many ways one of the most dynamic cities in the world for Workforce development opportunities and possibilities, and that density and that kind of vast spectrum of possibilities translates into a system, You have the labor market.
, you have philanthropy, you have government, you have the Workforce investment board Then you have a number of intermediaries, partners and data, and research and analysts like center for urban futures and our friends there, The data with the story and See how the kind of work hits the street.
So, as I began, to mention that you know, New, York city system has a number of assets and strengths and a number of challenges and liabilities on the strength, side, Henry Street and the organizations that make up the lower East side.
Eight of us are amongst 200 community- based organizations that provide job placement and career services to new yorkers who need that support either unemployed, underemployed or have been disconnected from the from the workforce.
The funder for that particular program is concerned about is the potential of discontinuing funding the program in the absence of job placements, because largely the New York City Workforce system is a paid for performance system and that's understandable.
We can creatively to extend resources to provide people with vital skills and training that they'll need and we'll come back and circle and talk about that a little bit more on our recommendations.
What the funder has challenged us to do with the funding at stake is to pivot and find a new sector to of the labor market, to connect our participants to that's, going to be very difficult in a short period of time, we're fortunate that we were able to leverage some of the ppp support to create a longer runway and Now we are diligently looking at other sectors like advanced manufacturing, industrial food, prep or commercial, food, prep and other sectors that we might be able to pivot to.
Workforce, recovery strategy, group and I'm also on a NYCHA post, Covid-19 recovery group and a lot of the concerns and the recommendations that are being made are consistent, and so that is to invest in education and training now to try to identify public works and infrastructure projects where we can anticipate job creation and therefore know where to prepare people and attach them relief.
Programs, because I think some of the challenge here is, we have to do the triage, but then we have to do the investment in long- term recovery, but there absolutely has to be some relief in the absence of job opportunities and then, of course, small businesses and support for other businesses that are that are amongst the stakeholders.
, it's our future bleeding and then the other component is training that the one thing we have right now is time, and we really reject this notion that, because there are not as many open jobs available, that there is not an appropriate investment to be made in workforce development.
So, we think really training is imperative and then support for small businesses, whether that's wage subsidies or other creative ways to get people to work and help businesses get back on their feet.
Certainly in Manhattan one of the most unequal districts you know, we've always had you know underemployment or people who have been left out of the labor force, but now we have so many of them in a variety of different skill levels and how we sort of appropriately get folks back into potentially better wage and good jobs of many kinds.
I will give an anecdote on some workforce funding, because that is where I think some of the advocacy and the needs statement needs to go that we have seen like one of the one of the city.
So I think the advocacy point is to build on- ramps to programs, because you know some of the information that Eli pointed out, like 26 percent of people have less than high school diploma.
It's really hard to kind of stack and find the accountability for you know where it stacks up to the department of small business services, Has some training dollars as well, and then there's areas and departments where things are very purposely funded like, for example, Department of Social services.
Discussion of you know who, if we are going to take any sort of position, even though that's not what the district needs statement is, but to say something about small property owners or small landlords, and what the impacts of the pandemic have been on.
There is no good answer or definition for small property, owner, I think, probably because nobody wants to actually define it because it'll exclude or include people, but we did find a couple of proposals at The. Rest of the district needs has not really changed that much, except to do cleanups of what everybody else brought up the other day or last month.
I think we can sort of summarize that sentence into like the rising cost of doing business in New York, City, yeah, Because I, you know the payroll is definitely the number one expense for Their office really struggled to define it We could just say a small landlord Maybe we could even say small landlords that provide affordable housing in their buildings.
Maybe aleister could help us with the term of art, but I do not know that small landlords defines it, but I, but I would agree, I do not think we can come up with a definition of how many units are under people's control or not under people's control.
We should not abandon this in any way, but it should be revisited when back to a more of a normal trend, whatever that may be in the future, and things have kind of plateaued, because we do not know where things are going right now: And I think, with a 20 unemployment, presenting something like this to officials.
If we feel like in within the next two months that it's the right time to start talking to people again about this- And, you know maybe how we want that to work, because I do not know if the same narrative is the narrative that people might respond to again.
