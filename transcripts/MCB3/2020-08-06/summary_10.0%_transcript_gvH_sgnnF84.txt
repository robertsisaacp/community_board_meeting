I know that we have heard from lesson in the past around specific programs that they run in our district, but I think that we are sort of in an unprecedented time of changes with our in within our economy that are affecting individuals like never before in this committee.
We talk a lot about small business and sort of larger real estate and economic development things, but we haven't, at least in the past couple of months, talk specifically about how this is really affecting the people that live in our community.
Think tank policy, organization- It's, been around for about 25 years now, focused on expanding economic opportunity, reducing inequality and building a more inclusive economy here in new york, and we do that through research by publishing reports and studies that unpack some of these issues in detail, that put forward practical and achievable recommendations for policy.
We do this in lots of different ways, but certainly research on the state of new york city's economy is a big part of that, and this is just a tiny piece of what we do if we kind of take a look at the data that informs better policy.
Making, So anish invited me here tonight to share a little bit of that data with you all on your district, specifically the lower east side and and parts of chinatown, and I can share some of the latest data, both a look at where we stood in these in these neighborhoods right before this pandemic and then sort of a sense of where we may be right now, because of this crisis, and of course, happy to you, know, take any questions or discuss any further, but I did have just a few brief slides to kind of keep.
Absolutely we've been really busy since March, but I focused on all sorts of different effects of the of the crisis, and certainly if anybody checks out our work or doesn't know us before tonight, and you have any thoughts or questions , you can just contact me directly, Some.
About 68 600 employed residents in the community board district about two-thirds are people of color race other than white on the census about 36 percent born outside of the united states.
Another 16 17 excuse me are high school graduates, so in particular you know this is maybe unsurprising, but there are major major concerns about that 26 in particular folks who don't have access to the kinds of employment opportunities that are more resilient in this particular crisis.
It was about 3.6 percent in the lower east side in chinatown about a year and a half ago, and one other trend that I won't spend any time on really tonight, but certainly is geared up in my heart in the work that we do at center for urban future, which is that the population of the lorry side has really been aging significantly, as it has been in the whole city, but about 14.4 percent of the population was 65 or over.
It is a factor, certainly when we think about workforce issues, though, because among other factors, age has been correlated with job losses and a lot of older workers have really struggled in the last few months.
I mean it's basically the hardest hit industry in the whole city, and that is where the greatest you know, concentration of residents in the district work in restaurants.
So, almost 6, 000 people and that's you know clearly the number one I think impact by industry that you would see in the district right, now.
These are all major industries for residents of the of the community that haven't been hit as hard Clothing stores really leaps out at me, a particularly hard hit industry again seeing job losses of almost 70 since february, and there it's a fairly large concentration of workers in that, and just in clothing stores alone in the neighborhood individual and family services, which includes a lot of social services.
And You know we're talking about administrative staff, custodial staff, all kinds of people that work in colleges and universities and that's a generally an industry.
We don't know what the job losses look like by occupation, but we can kind of imagine given what some of these occupations say about where people work in terms of industry, Because I think it's interesting to kind of get a sense again of where you know where your neighbors work, You, know, there's a lot of people that are working in management.
Not only are artists, struggling, I think, because they've lost all of their opportunities to you know to show their work to present their work, concerts and dance performances and theater performances, etc, but also so many artists, Work in the service, sector, , really been kind of a double whammy: they've lost all of their work, all of their income from their artistic practice.
There's a lot of food workers in the lower east side and all of those you know all of those jobs have been decimated since february.
Certainly, we've seen some new data that suggests that jobs have come back about 20 or so of the jobs that were lost from february to may started to come back in June, and that seems to be closely linked with the success I think, of the open streets initiative so certainly worth you know , The second comment: much earlier.
For example, you know we use a 25 over cut off for for the jobs, figures, we're looking at people who are employed.
You know that's a separate category, that's tracked in the data and So we're focusing on people that are generally speaking in the workforce and seeing either are they working and if so, where are they working?
Take a take a separate look at this sort of 18 to 25 band and where those folks are working, I, think you know.
You know it includes everything from graduating, with a cuny college credential, but working in food service and not in a field that aligns with the degree That's a significant challenge that we hear about quite a lot, and certainly for folks with a high school diploma.
I. Don't have this data just for the district, but you can see you know the by far in a way, the greatest job losses have been in full service, restaurants, both new America, you know total numbers and also the share of all jobs lost since february, But, but right up there at the top is performing arts.
You know, or the only other neighborhoods that are seeing similar job losses to lower east side and the rest of Manhattan has done.
You, know, learned from eli, so much about the people who reside in the district and where they work, what kinds of jobs.
That might be a little bit about where my question is eli, on what you might be able to say about employment losses for the categories of businesses within the district, as opposed to the residents who work anywhere in the city in those industries.
Certainly, I, think you do see those same two top categories: restaurants, retail, definitely a big one that doesn't pop up when you look at occupations, but absolutely as a factor are those cultural venues of which there's so many It's everything from movie theaters to you know performing arts centers that have all.
I do think that the tourism related is another big category where it's not just employing people who live on the lower east side, though many do, but is drawing workers from all over the city.
You know you're, looking at a bare minimum or baseline minimum to access those jobs of a four-year college degree or even more, and the huge disparities in terms of attainment for those kinds of credentials definitely changes.
Gas bar Stick around for this part too, just to hear about what david and gaspar are going to discuss, is that you know when we think about recovery, and you know how we'll move forward as a city and as a community district workforce development has come up as something that's an important piece of an equitable recovery for the economy.
We can Tonight of trying to be really concise and hopefully open it up to questions, because as community-based providers that make up the lower east side, employment, network- We're, really, you know every data point that eli shared there's a human being behind it and that every human being behind us either trying to feed their family or trying to raise a child or trying to take care of a senior or trying to keep a roof over their head.
But the field as a whole is really responsible for that for connection to the labor market, for training and education, as it relates to employment opportunities for advocacy and then for retention and support services and the circles you see on the on the first slide really represent all the stakeholders and New york city is.
You have some perspective about what it looks like on: lower east side So, as I mentioned, lower side, employment network has done about a thousand placements since its inception, with an average of 120 placements a year, but the community-based organizations that make up the network.
To mention that you know, new york city system has a number of assets and strengths and a number of challenges and liabilities on the strength, side, henry street and the organizations that make up the lower east side.
Eight of us are amongst 200 community-based organizations that provide job placement and career services to new yorkers who need that support either unemployed, underemployed or have been disconnected from the from the workforce we represent and serve about half a million people in new york in new york across the city system and out of the lower east side.
I. Think some of the assets of the system are there: lots of creative programs like the lower east side, employment network, where our mechanism was a response to anticipated economic development and largely all of these phonetic stakeholders put community-based organizations in a position where they're more likely to compete for resources than to collaborate.
That can materialize as obstacles to employment is another really important role that The community-based providers on lower east side play and then, of course, advocacy and analysis where we get to look with a little bit more proximity and granularity to what's happening in the neighborhood.
The number is 40 of americans, and certainly this probably plays out even more dramatically on laurie's side only had 400 in the bank when this pandemic hit, so the exposure and the vulnerability become marginalized, just really exposes to initial point: You know in the solutions, I think largely our workforce.
Development system in new york provides a really vital service, because if someone is trying to accomplish those things that I mentioned before, whether it's a roof over your head or food on the table, a job is a necessary component.
The funder for that particular program is concerned about is the potential of discontinuing funding the program in the absence of job placements, because largely the new york city workforce system is a paid for performance system and that's understandable.
Small businesses, most workers in new york, city, 67 of the city's workforce, is connected to small business, so without small business engagement, support, We're, really working in with zero sight lines to how things are going to open.
What the funder has challenged us to do with the funding at stake is to pivot and find a new sector to of the labor market, to connect our participants to that's, going to be very difficult in a short period of time, we're fortunate that we were able to leverage some of the ppp support to create a longer runway and Now we are diligently looking at other sectors like advanced manufacturing, industrial food, prep or commercial, food, prep and other sectors that we might be able to pivot to.
Now to try to identify public works and infrastructure projects where we can anticipate job creation and therefore know where to prepare people and attach them relief, programs, because I think some of the challenge here is: we have to do the triage, but then we have to do the investment in long-term recovery, but there absolutely has to be some relief in the absence of job opportunities and then, of course, small businesses and support for other businesses that are that are amongst the stakeholders.
Thank you to the committee to invite us to present to you all and ultimately the point I think was to try and orient some of those of you dive in a little bit more about what workforce development actually means.
It's our future bleeding and then the other component is training that the one thing we have right now is time, and we really reject this notion that, because there are not as many open jobs available, that there is not an appropriate investment to be made in workforce development.
Certainly in Manhattan one of the most unequal districts you know, we've always had you know underemployment or people who have been left out of the labor force, but now we have so many of them in a variety of different skill levels and how we sort of appropriately get folks back into potentially better wage and good jobs of many kinds.
I will give an anecdote on some workforce funding, because that is where I think some of the advocacy and the needs statement needs to go that we have seen like one of the one of the city council initiatives, for example, is cut 26 percent a lot of private.
The advocacy point is to build on-ramps to programs, because you know some of the information that eli pointed out, like 26 percent of people have less than high school diploma.
There is no good answer or definition for small property, owner, I think, probably because nobody wants to actually define it because it'll exclude or include people, but we did find a couple of proposals at The. Rest of the district needs hasn't really changed that much except to do cleanups of what everybody else brought up the other day or last month.
I think we can sort of summarize that sentence into like the rising cost of doing business in new york city Because I, you know, the payroll is definitely the number one expense for Their office really struggled to define it and they came up with something because they had to for their legislation.
I think that is somewhere along the lines of what lesson and the new york city, employment and training coalition is looking for, like a more centralized funding stream or like significant program through this recovery period, that will upskill and train people.
If we feel like in within the next two months that it's the right time to start talking to people again about this- And, you know maybe how we want that to work, because I don't know if the same narrative is the narrative that people might respond to again.
