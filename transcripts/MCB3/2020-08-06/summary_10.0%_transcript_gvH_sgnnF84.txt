The first is from eli dorgan who's from the center for an urban future, and the second is from david garza and guest barcaro from henry street and lesson You know, as we've been talking about, the district needs I wanted to introduce some information and data around unemployment.
We talk a lot about small business and sort of larger real estate and economic development things, but we haven't, at least in the past couple of months, talk specifically about how this is really affecting the people that live in our community I'm the editorial and policy director at the center for an urban future we're a research organization think tank policy organization- it's been around for about 25 years now, focused on expanding economic opportunity, reducing inequality and building a more inclusive economy here in new york, and we do that through research by publishing reports and studies that unpack some of these issues in detail, that put forward practical and achievable recommendations for policy makers and I think, ultimately, that do a pretty good job of shining, a light on issues that have gone overlooked and getting them onto the radar of our elected officials We do this in lots of different ways, but certainly research on the state of new york city's economy is a big part of that, and this is just a tiny piece of what we do if we kind of take a look at the data that informs better policy making.
Absolutely we've been really busy since march, but I focused on all sorts of different effects of the of the crisis, and certainly if anybody checks out our work or doesn't know us before tonight, and you have any thoughts or questions you can just contact me directly Some you may be well aware of, and some may be helpful to to take a look at in the context of of this crisis and what a recovery might look like joe Just a few quick data points on what the workforce looked like in the district before Covid-19 about 68 600 employed residents in the community board district about two-thirds are people of color race other than white on the census about 36 percent born outside of the united states.
Restaurants and other food services, which you know in in-person dining, has seen job losses of 69 from february to June That's, the latest data available So, almost 6 000 people, and that's you know clearly the number one I think impact by industry that you would see in the district right now It's also kind of worth noting that there are a lot of residents who are relatively have been relatively spared by the economic impacts and all of those yellow industries have really held job losses down, and that includes healthcare Unsurprisingly, but right down at the bottom advertising public relations and related services.
That's definitely some, you know cause for concern, and then cooks also is in there as well, separated out from chefs and head cooks , There's a lot of food workers in the lower east side and all of those you know all of those jobs have been decimated since february Certainly, we've seen some new data that suggests that jobs have come back about 20 or so of the jobs that were lost from february to may started to come back in June, and that seems to be closely linked with the success I think of the open streets initiative so certainly worth you know , The second comment: much earlier.
This is looking at a data on The. First, one is for a couple of the different data points is 25 and over just aged age, 25 and over and for educational attainment That's, simply because there are a lot of folks who are still in school before that point, so to have a fair sense of the share of the adult population with a high school diploma You know we use a 25 over cut off for for the jobs figures, we're looking at people who are employed You know that's a separate category, that's tracked in the data and so we're focusing on people that are generally speaking in the workforce and seeing either are they working and if so, where are they working?
Well, the employment data that we're looking at is anybody who's in the workforce, so that includes people that are over the age of 16 and have a job so we're not missing them in this employment data That's separate from the data on educational attainment, where we use the 25 and up cut off, but you know your point: Does look at people where younger folks are employed, Take, a take a separate look at this sort of 18 to 25 band and where those folks are working I think you know our colleagues at at henry street have a lot to say about that, but you're, absolutely right- One is underemployment, which was at you know, potentially at sort of epidemic levels of a quiet epidemic before this crisis for young adults.
Now, that's a difficult thing to track in terms of census data, but we hear about it, and you know it includes everything from graduating, with a cuny college credential, but working in food service and not in a field that aligns with the degree and that's a significant challenge that we hear about quite a lot and certainly for folks with a high school diploma.
I mean it's worth pointing out that performing arts in general is one of those industries that has been the absolute hardest hit and actually joe I don't have this data just for the district, but you can see you know the by far in a way the greatest job losses have been in full service, restaurants, both new America, you know total numbers and also the share of all jobs lost since february, but but right up there at the top is performing arts, it's actually even higher in terms of the share of jobs that have been lost A lot of artists may not appear in the data as full-time working artists.
So you know some full service, Restaurants stopped being full service restaurants, but still stayed open The one other thing I wanted to mention that you know it's harder to capture this in the data by either industry or occupation, Obviously a lot on the lorry side and many of those jobs have gone to neighborhood residents, but just the overall impact of tourism.
Whereas in previous crises, like the great recession, which you know, hammered jobs and finance, but did not barely touch jobs and restaurants in new york city, at least it also is you know, previous recessions have kind of borne out the idea that that tourism is relatively recession-proof and obviously this particular crisis is wiping out those gains as well It's just one other thing, we're thinking about in terms of the broader effects of the crisis.
There's two ways to cut employment data You know learned from eli, so much about the people who reside in the district and where they work what kinds of jobs.
A little bit gas bar yeah great gaspar Stick around for this part too, just to hear about what david and gaspar are going to discuss is that you know when we think about recovery, and you know how we'll move forward as a city and as a community district workforce development has come up as something that's an important piece of an equitable recovery for the economy and, obviously lessen is our You know our best workforce development providers, which is why we wanted them to speak.
We'll also have the 14th street tech hub, we'll sort of be starting to move a little bit more, and you know, cb3 has a role in the community advisory board for that So I think there's an opportunity here also to sort of make sure that sort of a signature workforce center around a growing industry in new york city You, know, workforce needs and advocate for things that our district needs.
So guest bar That was a really phenomenal presentation and really appreciate the data You know: I'm the partnership director for the lower east side, employment network and I'm joined tonight by david garza, the executive chair for the network, but also executive director for henry street settlement, and we just have a very kind of pretty straightforward presentation, just to kind of give you all an overview of what workforce development industry actually is and the state of it under the current previous to the pandemic, but also now under the current duress and crisis of the economy and then try and wrap up with some recommendations that we have gathered and gleaned from the workforce.
In fact, founding partners, and here we are 12 more than 12 years later, having accomplished a thousand job placements in the district and we're going to do as good a job we can tonight of trying to be really concise and hopefully open it up to questions, because as community-based providers that make up the lower east side, employment network-- we're really.
And, so our mission, centered focus about trying to attach people to the labor market is really sometimes a question of survival or not for the people that we serve We generally serve the residents of the neighborhood that tend to be either marginalized or not connected to the labor market, but the field as a whole is really responsible for that for connection to the labor market, for training and education, as it relates to employment opportunities for advocacy and then for retention and support services and the circles you see on the on the first slide really represent all the stakeholders and new york city is, you know in many ways one of the most dynamic cities in the world for workforce development opportunities and possibilities, and that density and that kind of vast spectrum of possibilities translates into a system.
You have some perspective about what it looks like on: lower east side As I mentioned, lower side, employment network has done about a thousand placements since its inception, with an average of 120 placements a year, but the community-based organizations that make up the network We also do placements outside of the network activity and all told that probably adds up to about a thousand job placements a year and I think it underscores something when we get down to either like the need statement or recommendations that there's considerable opportunity to invest more in workforce development, and you know, resources and money is often the low-hanging fruit in terms of recommendations You know aware of the belief that if you don't resource a function, you don't get it and that money equals mission and in order to help individuals gain the skills, education and training, they need It costs money as any business You, know owner or anyone will acknowledge and recognize that you need to put money in the system in order to yield good results.
New york city system has a number of assets and strengths and a number of challenges and liabilities on the strength side, henry street and the organizations that make up the lower east side employment network Eight of us are amongst 200 community-based organizations that provide job placement and career services to new yorkers who need that support either unemployed, underemployed or have been disconnected from the from the workforce we represent and serve about half a million people in new york in new york across the city system and out of the lower east side organizations.
We generally serve the individuals who are low income or who have been disconnected from the labor market system and so providing wrap-around services, whether it's financial literacy, child care, referrals and resources to other resources that could help people either stabilize or resolve circumstances in their own That can materialize as obstacles to employment is another really important role that the community-based providers on lower east side play and then, of course, advocacy and analysis where we get to look with a little bit more proximity and granularity to what's happening in the neighborhood In order to advocate for approaches like the lower east side, employment network and really turn policy issues into service solutions, which is really the task at hand.
That's placed hundreds of people in hospitality roles with virtually all of them and ending up unemployed when the pandemic hit What the funder for that particular program is concerned about is the potential of discontinuing funding the program in the absence of job placements, because largely the new york city workforce system is a paid for performance system and that's understandable, What we're seeing, especially in the absence of an active labor market and after labor market sector, is that if you find a system that rewards and pays for performance, people are left out of that equation So how can we make investments in people during this time in order to prepare for what we hope is inevitable?
The digital divide is certainly a concern We've seen that with people connecting to educational opportunities, but certainly people connecting to jobs that have some level of resiliency or sustainability in particular in this circumstance, but in the certainly in the future, that's gonna, Small businesses, most workers in new york city, 67 of the city's workforce, is connected to small business, so without small business engagement, support we're really working in with zero sight lines to how things are going to open up.
Workforce recovery strategy, group and I'm also on a NYCHA post, Covid-19 recovery group and a lot of the concerns and the recommendations that are being made are consistent, and so that is to invest in education and training now to try to identify public works and infrastructure projects where we can anticipate job creation and therefore know where to prepare people and attach them relief programs, because I think some of the challenge here is: we have to do the triage, but then we have to do the investment in long-term recovery, but there absolutely has to be some relief in the absence of job opportunities and then, of course, small businesses and support for other businesses that are that are amongst the stakeholders and then we'll open it up to questions after we get to maybe some more refined recommendations.
I've been calling it kind of like a split dollar theory, so that if we go back to what we did previously and invest dollars in this kind of more transactional workforce development system, we're going to get what we got, which is a really fragile, You, know not equitable system, and so my perspective is that we need to invest not only in triage and connecting people to employment, but also in wealth distribution, also in asset building, also in ownership and entrepreneurship for people, so that we can kind of not only create it's our future bleeding and then the other component is training that the one thing we have right now is time, and we really reject this notion that, because there are not as many open jobs available, that there is not an appropriate investment to be made in workforce development , We know construction jobs are going to become available if certain political results materialize, there's largely going to be public works projects or infrastructure projects.
I would say, is that I you know definitely would want to keep the committee updated, as you guys figure out what the sectors are, that you might pivot training programs or any of these programs into you know Certainly , you know, cuff has facilitated some of them about like what the growing sectors of the economy are and if we do live in, certainly in Manhattan one of the most unequal districts you know, we've always had you know underemployment or people who have been left out of the labor force, but now we have so many of them in a variety of different skill levels and how we sort of appropriately get folks back into potentially better wage and good jobs of many kinds.
I was thinking along the lines a little bit of you and yourself, but basically, two questions that would be useful for us is once how were you impacted by the recent budget cuts whether there are specific, you know, streams that were cut, that you would need, and we need to make sure that you know we ask for them to be reinstated or amplified et cetera and also locally I, mean in terms of workforce training, I'm, assuming that now I don't know if you were able to move some of your workforce development online and are you training people for digital jobs, because especially the younger people may have you know a faster chance of getting back to work if we were able to provide them with this kind of training Take the first one I'll Let gaspar, take the second one on the tech training As far as far as budgeting goes, the lower east side, employment network budget, which really supports gaspar and his colleague carmen lynn, because they play a kind of a pivoting role in between all of our organizations-- is very stable.
I think that is somewhere along the lines of what lesson and the new york city, employment and training coalition is looking for, like a more centralized funding stream or like significant program through this recovery period that will upskill and train people a variety of different skill levels.
We had approved the resolution for also you know megan, since you sort of led to this in your time as chair Why, don't you give like a 30 second overview for the new folks on the committee about what the special enhanced commercial district is So. We we've been talking about it for years, and the overall goal of this was to increase retail diversity in our neighborhood.
