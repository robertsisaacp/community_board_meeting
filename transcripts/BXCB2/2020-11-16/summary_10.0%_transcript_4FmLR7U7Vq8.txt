Evening, Today, I took off my map just for a quick minute, because I am in an area with a lot of people, So I have to make sure that I'm protecting myself.
I'm here to talk about the test and trace programs that the New York, City, Health and hospitals, pets and trace teams are working.
I want to start by saying that you know we do have a local office in the Bronx.
Covid-19, so 24 hours, a day, we're working, on, Covid-19, we're monitoring the data, you're hearing, everything that's going on, and so just to give you a little update.
The testing trace program is really focused on helping all those people who have been identified with positive cases of Clovis and, As you know, Covid-19 is also known as Corona or coronavirus.
Right now, The test and trace program is really focused on trying to identify people.
Let's, try to capture it and make sure that it doesn't continue to spread right because, as I mentioned in the slide before one person can spread it to two.
Okay next I want to mention that in New York City, we have a lot of testing the New York City hospitals offer free testing for anyone who walks in you don't need insurance, you don't need to have any documentation.
Okay, It's important that you know that, but we're also working with other organizations that are offering it for free.
It's, really important for everyone to know, and the location in the Bronx is 1309, Fulton, Avenue and or some sorry in full country.
You know we're having people get tested and making sure that young people get tested as well, because we are seeing an increase in cases in younger people.
What I wanted to mention is that testing is safe, It's, easy and free, and so what we want to make sure is that people are going to get tested, there's tons of spaces where you can go and you're doing it for yourself, you're doing it for your loved ones, you're doing it for your colleagues, your neighbors, because we want to stop the spread.
We want to flood this neighborhood with information so that people can be aware and can get tested, so we've had it in the trunks twice.
This is a really important track piece that I want you all to know.
They, want to know where you've been what you've been doing, who you've been around because we want to test those people, and we want to make sure that, if there's transmission, that we can help them so get tested for free make sure that they have the resources that they need.
The health department uses for tuberculosis for HIV, So this is a program that has been around for many years in case you have not heard about it, but this contact tracer will help connect you to all the resources that are available so join the isolation and quarantine.
Okay, It's also important that you know that medications we're working with pharmacies that are able to deliver patient at home and other services connect, and so this is what I want you to know today in order for you to prevent the spread of covis.
Six feet away right, So we need to know and inform the community about this and then Washington for any virus.
We could start a what is it get tested day of action, which means that we would get a lot of people in our communities to go out and spread.
So we're seeing that in the hunts point area, people are going out and getting tested all right.
So far, we've had about over 5,000 of the 100,000 population, so we're making sure that we're converting the data, and so, as you see it's point, 76 of people tested next and then in the hunts point area, 10,459 we're seeing.
We want to make sure that people use these services and then know about these services and in terms of the contact traders, as I mentioned, These folks will be calling and if they can't reach you on the phone they may come to your household.
Then the four core things that I want you to know and take with you tonight is stay home.
This is the most important one because we don't want you to get set, So we are offering free flu shots at my office in the Tremont section of the Bronx, which is 1826 Arthur Avenue.
If people want to know where the data is from well, thank you, So much Anita we're not going to open it.
The situation is that until the mayor calls for in-person meetings, the elections needs to be halted until that point, and only because there is an issue of confidentiality when you're voting and secondly, and most importantly, anybody that wishes to be considered as a candidate needs to meet with the committee in person, and we can not have no in-person meetings until then.
And, we can't have the confidentiality of voting at the election, get that Iran pass unanimously and we have quorum, and they just want you to know that Ralph and I have been having several meetings with agencies.
What I would like to do is recognize our councilman, who is online councilman, Rafael, Salamanca Junior, all right, guys, First I want to welcome everyone back to session.
The community boards are are not in session, but I also really extremely want to welcome back the the new members that have that have joined the board.
If you have more than three absences for a committee that are unaccounted for, You will not be reappointed, and you know I, as a former district manager, I understand the value of having a quorum and when you don't have when you're, not present, it makes it much difficult to have a quorum and therefore business can not be conducted other than that.
You know rolled out well, send us an email of a proposed map in the summer and then did not follow up and automatically install these CitiBikes throughout, not just community board too, but throughout my entire council district as well, and so there's a back and forth with DOT and the community board in my office as to locations.
And, then finally, You know just to give you an update as to some of the work that my office has been doing.
That would I would think that that would be something that is going to be discussed between us and urban and as well as parks Department, But that was one of the conditions that Parks Department wanted to make sure that somebody was going to take care of it so that they can move on to do other.
He stayed in these states and made sure to continue the health coverage that we needed in this community.
You know I want to keep that on the burner, because I think we should.
I've got complaints as well about the locations, but I'd like to reach out to you, so that we can make better for coordinating stuff because I know Ralph does great work there, but I'm, also an elected official that gets involved and can help you guys out.
Our communities were hit terribly, but I want to ensure and encourage everyone to make sure that they take all the personal protections they need.
My office email, give us a call, we're happy to help we're visiting a lot of the schools to make sure that what we're seeing is that our kids are in a safe situation when they return to school.
We are in constant communication with the chancellor and the DOE, because you know our kids and they number one most important things in our lives, so I want to keep them as safe as possible.
What's going to happen every time we get close to the removal of the moratorium, because you know, if we're going to have massive evictions, a lot of people are going to be homeless.
You know I'm, proud to say that I think we've done a lot to help the families in our community.
Only thing that I need to ask you is that I know Ralph.
I know that sergeant Guglielmo has been on the line and sarge I want to, I'm, sorry, but.
Now, with the state liquor authority regarding some of the open restaurants in our district, I know that sergeant Guglielmo has been very helpful and are monitoring all of these locations and making sure that they're in compliance.
I want to thank Anita, Also because I've been working with the Ohmh over the summer.
You know the you know spreading of any type of like Covid-19 for an example, but once the office is open, we'll, let everybody know we're still working remotely.
If I can district manager's world president's report, Is anybody from the Bp's office, unlocking Hey Bobby, good evening, Community, Board.
I like to know who, in the city is doing that because, first of all, as you stated, it's a Friday.

You know and make sure that everybody's safe on that day, I'm just going on the record, because God forbid something goes wrong.
I, don't want it to be said that community board 2 sanctioned something like this and somebody got hurt and or that the 4-1 get blamed for something that you know.
You know: I, don't want lately.
And I, thought I saw Maritza, Ron I, don't know if Marissa wants to add anything else from what the council member stated, hi.
I saw Justin around I, don't know if Justin wants to say any few words.
That I want you to know.
You got two minutes all right, so I just want to give you a quick, really update on what we are working.
So we just want to make sure like the community is informed that, as I say, I will put all the info on the chat, and thank you great, thank you.
I just wanted to announce that over the summer the comptroller has been doing a lot of work when it comes to education, homelessness, small businesses and providing support at different pieces.
