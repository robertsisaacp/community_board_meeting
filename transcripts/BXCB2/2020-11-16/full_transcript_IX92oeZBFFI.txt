This is why you don't see the invite when you go and check for it again, so you have to go into your calendar where your emails are all right. That's it! Thank you yeah! You know. Thank you Cynthia. You got to explain that to me when I call you because I don't understand what you're saying like the first couple of times crazy I thought, I was I thought the emails were getting deleted and it was because, once you accept it goes into your calendar. Oh okay, all right so anyway. I want to thank everybody for sure for showing up. I know it was a short short period of to put this together, but there were some very important issues that came up that we need to address. One is the November calendar that we need to address, but also some issues with committees, I believe the Lang, not the language, but municipal Committee economic and municipal committee have some presentations that need to be approved. They didn't have a quorum and some other ads, so the Dflp I think am I correct Ralph. Now the flp was have to go to the full board right. Well, we got too many just from the background, but there was one item that gottabled. So the only items that we need to vote on tonight would be the current echo. That's it that's all around the screen here, but let's go yeah. Let's go down the agenda. Okay, but I just want to say thank you to all the exec members for coming on. I know that it's a short period of time to put this thing together, but time is it of essence at this time, right: okay, so let's go over the full board agenda, we're still scheduled for Wednesday the 28th. We still have not created the the webex, so we still got like two weeks. You know week and a half of that I'll do that on Friday and then we can update all of the stuff. That's here. So we have two. We got a couple of big items, so the first one is public section, but I'm gonna switch that to number two and then number two. We have to have the public hearing, capital and budget expense report. That's gonna take about 10 minutes of me explaining it and answering any questions, because I gave everybody a deadline of this Friday, the 23rd to complete that and I sent out the capital and I sent out the budget that we submitted last year. So people can use that as a rest, then we got our normal business coming up the chairman's report, Dms adoption administrator elected officials, then we got a bunch of voting items if everything works out, so we got two for Maria Right depending on what happens today, and then we got four actually three items for Flp all discussed that length at the committee. The last one had this item has been tabled. We just want to leave it on the agenda for the record. That item was tabled, then we had Lewis who had his committee, so Lewis will give us his report. Those are the only committees that I know that met so now. I have Cedric, Yvonne and Larry on you guys are scheduled for this week. Nothing is going on with with that. So I don't think we're gonna be having an education in youth Committee unless you guys have something Ralph, yes, how's it match that so I have the note the minute. Oh, yes, you got the minutes for that. Yeah I typed it up. Yes, I'm gonna send it to Cynthia, that's right, so you gotta add a b and add housing, not a problem. I'll! Send that perfect right! I'm sorry! Thank you Paula and that's it. Those were the only committees that met four committees which I'll take four committees in this time and era. You know, and we do have five voting items also along with the public hearing, so six meetings, six votes. Well, the public hearing is not a vote. It's just we're going to review what was submitted as priorities and then I gotta entertain and you gotta vote on it. I already informed. No there's no vote. It's already submitted whatever's gonna be submitted. I gave everyone a deadline: okay, yes, you're right, we're gonna tally those whatever was submitted and that's what I'm going to review, I'll, entertain questions and then that's it. City planning is aware that it's only board members that are doing it. Each board operates differently and we for the past 10 years or something have only opened it up to board members. So, no matter what how the process will be opened up to, they will encourage to have a public hearing. I said this works. Fine, because I can have everything has to be submitted by the 30th of Friday. So I'll have everything done hopefully by the 29th I should have everything done by I can actually put it up here if you guys want it, but that's so we're eliminating a couple of items here on the agenda, but anything else for the full agenda. We just gotta add we're gonna switch one and two Cynthia, and then we got a thousand, not a problem. Okay, so back to our agenda here, Canada now, November is crazy. Guys, you guys gotta, look at this calendar and tell me because we don't have no idea what we're doing here. Well, we do have an idea and I support these days every day, so we got as soon as the month starts. The second we got and human services the off then we're closed Tuesday, the third Wednesday, the fourth special events, environmental, which I think Roland, is on I. Think Roland is informed that he would like to resign right, but you're going to stay on as a com as a board member right, no I'll stay on as a board member. Yes, okay, all right! Let me just say right now that environmental then will be included back into the Municipal Services Committee right, where I'm sorry to municipal services. Okay, so anything environmental that comes in will go on to the economic or municipality, probably because of the municipality right. So Thursday is the 41st president. Now the next week, Monday the second education. If we are going to meet on the 10th Tuesday Flp, then Wednesday, where the office is closed for veterans day and then Thursday the 12th will be youth, then the following week, Larry you got any problem Larry. What do you say? No I got no problem on that date. I'm sorry! Okay! Thank you! All right go ahead! Ralph! Okay! That's! If we do me, if there is anything, then the following week, we got executive on the 16th echo on the 17th, the full board on the 18th. We never meet the week of Thanksgiving. We never put anything for that week or the week if there are any days after Thanksgiving is the 26th of November a special day in my heart, but that's this is the agenda or the calendar for November that we set up all right any problems with the the tech, the ninth Cedric or Yvonne hello Yvonne says no problem. How about you cedric now for the committees, if you do not have any items for your committee meeting, please let the board, let the staff know the district manager and Cynthia and Danielle so like that. We can then remove that committee on our website, as well as the calendar. If you don't have anything, please let us know: okay, all right, great yeah louis! You got any problems with your date. No I'm good! Okay! Thank you! Second, and we're wait. Okay, all right, okay! So the next thing number three the office, so the building is still closed. If you guys see on only Tuesdays and Thursdays, they open it up shortly to go over mail, Cynthia and I try to go in on Tuesdays and Thursdays for an hour. So Cynthia goes to check the mail. I go just to sit at my desk now I had some work done. I think I went last week for a couple of hours, just to make sure that everything on the computer is still going. But and now the office is coming along, they changed all the lighting right, they changed all the lighting and then they have to now do the vent system, the havoc system. Oh, so that's what we're waiting on to get done, since it was I think last week when they were there doing like a walk through with the contractors. For that, so one more thing about the office and they have to do with the rent. So you know we, the lease expired in February. The city has been negotiating with the landlord for the past before that I mean since 2019 right since, like now last year, this time they've been negotiating with the landlord on a five-year option. The landlord agreed to everything at the last minute in February. He wanted some wording changed on the lease and b cast came back to me to say, hold off on paying the rent, because this guy's playing games with us all of a sudden. He wants certain worrying change and we're not going to go into that. I could have went into a month to month, but I didn't long story on March April may June those four months for the fiscal year. Rent has not been paid now that money is sitting in an account of hours. That OMB is not allowing me to access because it was in last year's fiscal year, so I have to go through the controller's office and explain why I'm requesting our money, it's to our money and I, don't control that budget. But since we stopped paying the rent, which Decas told me to do so, one arm of the city told me, don't pay the rent. Omb is saying. Well, we want this. We know we're in a financial crisis. We want this money back and I'm trying to explain to them. Listen: it's not money that we didn't use like excess money. This is the right money. It did I. It's been going on for like about two weeks now. Hopefully this week, I'll get an answer regarding that, but I just want to keep everybody updated, so we're fine from July forward. That's not! The issue is March April, May and June. I'm hoping to get this resolved. I got the Bp's office involved. The controller's office understands what's going on, I'm just waiting to hear back a final answer, so I just want to keep everybody abreast of. What's going on with that, since we're talking about the office now when the office does open, if I don't know, I don't have a date. Social security is still closed, so the building is somewhat closed. We do have access to the office if we need it, but we can't even conduct meetings in the office right now and I'm a little hesitant until they actually do the work, which is the air circulation in it. So are there any questions regarding the office and what's going on the office itself and with the rent from last fiscal year as long as we get the approval from you know, office, that's what we just got from the controller's office, yeah and I'll get you I'm once I get the controller's office right now who has to approve everything? So that's all I'm waiting to hear back from the moment. I hear something I'll, let you know I'll inform everybody of that the budgeting capital expense right now. We just went over all of that, so I sent it out to everyone. Only Maria has me: I'm gonna ask you to put it in writing. Maria made it a request to have more traffic agents on the brook due to all the construction. That's going on there. It's a nightmare any time of day that you any day of the week you pass through the Bruckner unless you're going like on an overnight or something it is from, like 149th street, all the way to the turn to get on to the to cross over to the other side of the Bucknell there on by the Bronx River, but Ralph really quick. So it's a nightmare getting out of hunch point like starting at three o'clock to get garrison to get out to get to Bryant yeah, it's getting all clogged. So we it's like. We need somebody over on 163rd and hunts point and also at the light by Bryant, because it's just it's really bad and that's all caused because of the construction they're doing on the bridge right. They because they're doing the bridge and then they're going to do the Sheridan simultaneously they should have had. We should have been asking for agents a while already so we have say we have we've always been denied I know, but there's no trafficking, sometimes DOT will. But this is state DOT. Also so they're not giving up. They don't do nothing. This is over that side. Right am I, correct, oh I, don't know, let's pull it outside I. Think I can't say: I know that Guy Assembly yeah dodgy has garrison, but clearly that's the 85th assembly. That would be the Elect, Virgos and Biagi I know has garrison. So she might have that part of the Bruckner to state right because, okay, honestly I after two o'clock, I, don't I stay away from that part of the world. You know I rather go all the way around before I go through that area and I'm sure that Julia does the same thing and everybody else. You know and it's crazy. You know, and you got guys that are just cutting off other people. You're gonna have a big problem. There one day we're having a dangerous situation where the people from the service road, because it goes quicker when you're going like from I'm gonna, say Beretto or Tiffany going into the hunts point. Drawbridge people are cutting from the service road into. So if the cops want to give out tickets, that's a great place to give out tickets, mostly in hunts, point they're all cutting over. They don't care who they run over. They don't care. People are crossing they're, just dodging traffic, so that's a good place to put a person. Maybe we can talk to the councilman, also Ralph yeah. Maybe we could get some kind of an agreement with Pd or traffic whoever's gonna deal with it. I don't know right, but that's the only thing that I got in the bag on the budget and capital expense and Maria I need you to put that in writing. So I'm just letting that's what it is. That's the only thing I'm just giving that up now we have to anything else regarding the budget and capital expense report, negative okay. So these are the new board members that's coming up. That was the one item that was giving me a hard time to download. I could read all the names we have. Six all right just bear with me, and some of them are already known to us. Let's just all right. The first one is love, Bettencourt, Pasquale, Gomez. All right, we all know Pasqua. We all know love Right, general colwin, that's Jennifer from open arms, okay, Miles Burnett! Everybody know miles: he was the executive director of Southern Boulevard did Rashawn Z, who was a former board member a couple of years back, I'm gonna, say I, don't know if I was the dn I think I was the dm, so it has been about three or four years yeah. She resigned because are you sure I was the secretary? Then? What's not the secretary all right yeah? So that's why it's familiar. She looked at me yeah. So you have three former board members, Pasqual love and lachanze that are back on. Yes, all right and the last one is Sartori Mccoy Greg yeah, she said she's been attending meetings, yeah she's been attending meetings, one two, three four there's six got six new board members and then for the reappointment. Everyone was reappointed except Edward Martinez. He was the only one. Not reappointed can I make a request. The New Board members Mr chairman, is there any way that you can remind them that they can not use the board to try to better your situation or anybody's situation. I'll give you an example: I'm interviewing the folks for that building, but I'm only doing the homeless right now. I get people wanting from me to sneak them in, and we can't sneak anybody and it's not like it used to be so. I got threatened by one of the new board members that was just assigned she's going to take me all the way up to God and every anybody she can support me I hear what you're saying I think Ralph and I know what you're talking about, but we'll be talking to all six of them. It's a conflict of interest. They should know that they can't use their position on the board to try to gain anything like that should be something brought up in the orientation saying that they can not send any emails with letter like claiming to be a board member or any letters or posing any TV things as a board member unless they get the approval from the board, no you're right. That ocean is included, and all of that is touched upon, but with Ralph and I when we meet with them. But you're. Welcome to you know you guys. The Executive Board is welcome. Yes, yeah I just think that people sometimes have a hard time recognizing what a conflict of interest is. So we just have to remind them that you know that's a no-no all right. Thank you. But honestly, this is a behavior that I see repeating over and over, because some people are part of the board and the board member. They think that they have more right than all the people and I think that's something that needs to be established and clear as a water that, because you choose to be a board member, that doesn't mean that you're getting better things that other people and you I, don't know. I think there has to be something like Julia said it has to be written or, like Cynthia said people understand that, because you're part of the board, that doesn't mean that you have more benefit or you have privilege no you're, correct, you're, both correct on the issue and Ralph and I always keep reminding board members, especially the new ones. When we meet with them that they're, they are technically city officials under the city charter and not technically, they are and based on being on. Sorry, yes, mama, sorry about that. Technically, basically, we've told them that it's against the city charters policies that it is a conflict of interest, but we'll continue reminding them bro. Yes, okay, so we'll set up that meeting, I! Think Bobby you should we should let the executives know when that meeting is gonna, take place, it'll be Monday, I, don't know what time you're available everybody works: okay, 10:26 setup meeting with new members: okay, 6 p.m. All right, instead of executive, we'll have that all right. The next thing! This is why we wanted to get rid of all of that stuff, because now we're going to get back to this we had echo. There was only two members on two committee members and we had two voting items so that both chairman Crespo and Chair Chairwoman Torres, decided to take this to this, commit this body here and Elvis was the only other committee member on and both Maria and Dalvis Consensus was to support and approve both of these motions. So I'll, let Maria take it over now. Okay, so the first one we have here is the parks department is seeking a letter of no objection from the board meeting regarding concrete plant park structure, and so they gave a presentation where they, the structures inside of concrete plant park, are decaying. You know some of them are rusting and things like that, so they want to make you know the corrections to it, make it safer for people and also fix it so that people I think people used to climb them a little bit stuff like that. So they want to correct those things so that people can no longer climb them, but then that they have safe structures that we don't have to worry about collapsing on anybody right now. It's been closed off with a fencing. They'll continue to do that and they, let's see you know I did, will they have to close the park down again? I'm sorry, I forgot, I think they. You know they can do it. They'll have fun they're, gonna close certain parts of it, including the bike lane or temporarily, until they make the renovations here yeah, and this is something that wouldn't take place until probably like the spring of next year. So you know we're behind that. We want to, you, know, keep that park safe, and so this was something that needs to be done as well. So that's the first resolution right so Maria before you continue Ralph. Can you take the exact thing off so like that we could see each other. You could do that. You could do that. Okay, it's okay! I'll! Take it off yeah, because it's not my computer, so I don't know how to work it. Okay, I'll! Take it off no problem! Thank you, wow! You guys look so handsome and pretty so go ahead. Maria anyway go ahead. Yeah! Yes, did anybody have any questions about regarding the comfy plant park, construction, otherwise pelvis and I approve it and would like to see it go forward with the letter of no objection from the community board. I'll have pictures as well. So if anybody wants to get that email to them, there was general consensus of the entire committee members that were there that they both approve of the plan. But, however, since they didn't have forum to vote, they were short. One body had to come before us. So that's why Maria is asking. Is there any questions or any concerns hello? If I don't hear nothing, I'm going to deem it to be approved? Okay, yes, you know I have to write. Well, you have to vote right. What are I, don't have any questions. Louie doesn't either okay. Do we need any second thing of the motions or anything or just go into? We do? Yes, we do. We need it to be second well. We needed to. We need a motion here, because we need a motion here to accept the presentation and then second I make a motion to accept the presentation. Okay, I like to second that and that every second it's okay, so anybody opposing to the project, no not hearing any opposition I deem it unanimously from the committee from the executive committee. If you collect park snow tomorrow on this okay, yeah they're gonna have to be present at the full board meeting right. Okay, the next resolution was also it was department of Transportation New, York City DOT, regarding a project that they want to do on Westchester over by 165 and Fox we're going to expand the sidewalk. It's just out. It's right under the two train on Westchester. How there's that area? Right after where you can kind of you have a triangle going in! You have a stop sign and then the light, if you're coming through fox, it's all kind of very confusing and jumbled. Elf has the presentation if people want to take a look at it, but this was to kind of expand. The walkway put a concrete triangle for pedestrians that are crossing it's all things to make it safer for people to push through as well as cars. You know going back and forth. We also felt that was a an important project that needed to be done to make that area safer, so pelvis and I approve it and we're bringing it to the group and Ralph. If you had anything to add in terms of from my presentation of what they were doing, please well I think you know they put a traffic light now on 165 and Fox, which is good. We already got the trap by the Fox and Westchester. It's going to be elevated. You know it's going to be above the curb they're, going to put some trees there. That parks are going to manage and it will. You know, prevent any of these cars from driving recklessly over there and they'll give people pedestrians that are walking on another place where they can just stand in between lights. I guess, that's the only thing I think of any questions presentation as well. What was that huh? Did they send you? The presentation as well like parks? Did yeah I got the yeah, we saw it. You know, remember: yeah I got that we saw, but did you do you have that in case? There's any board members that want to see it yeah I mean I could put it on the screen. Now no I like seeing everybody's face, especially Bobby no I, just want to make sure that you know, because some people may feel that it's you know, I have special presentation and I have copy. You can email it. I can put it on the screen. I can do both just let me know what y' all want all right. First, anybody got any questions concerning what Maria stated on this particular project. Everybody knows the area, everybody understands the area, I just looked it up because I couldn't picture it. So that's what I was looking at so yeah. It's needed very much. It's that block over from from urban health plans. So a lot of times right and you park on Fox, and you come out. That's what you're coming out yeah, so I think I can look it up. But although we're ready to make a motion I'll make a motion, anybody want to. Second it I'd like to second it Larry Robinson will second it it's about time. They made those changes. Exactly that's what I was thinking about yeah well, I could tell you how that was a walking tour between the councilman and I was not in town, and they took them specifically there and they came up with this plan and everything's going to be ADA accessible. I'm saying that: okay, yes, yeah! Yes, so that's always a great thing. The only thing that I would like to add if they, since they need a letter of Support Ralph yeah, that they make sure that Parks Department will make themselves responsible for cleaning that particular area they keep putting the parks right. They keep putting it always two parts and then parks come back and say we don't have the money, we can't do it and then we get stuck with a dirty area. So there was a motion. Remember none of this was done at the committee. It wasn't I know that I know. Now you are amending the most. You want to make an amendment to the motion to have in writing. The responsibility of the maintenance of it falls on parks. There's no amendment because there was no motions made at the time of the meeting. That's what I just said. Nothing was done. Wednesday. There was emotion made today. That was second and you want to make another all right. Yes, correct, you're, correct, yes, so discussion on it any discussions on this hello. No, anybody opposing this question. If I don't hear none, I'm gonna deem it unanimous. Okay unanimously approved great exactly but Rockman. That's it available. Thursday I mean Wednesday, yeah, I know, Cynthia reaches out to them, and Cynthia does a great job with that. Okay, yeah we're good right. Yes, sir! So both items we already put on the agenda, so it was just a matter now, just deleting any of them, but they're both on and then we discussed the items for the flp, which are three of them, one of them being the wedged a letter, a letter of objection to so and I have that recorded and I already spoke to the general counsel of the state liquor authority regarding of the wedge. So the next thing on the agenda is V, wants to discuss the 35th annual halloween parade, but it's not a parade and I don't want to put words in V's mouth so v. The floor is yours, V, good evening, everybody all right, so I've been working alongside Lewis and Julie, and we kind of discussed on how we can still have something for the community and not make it such a big thing this year. Obviously with everything going on and I think that all three of us agree that this community still deserves something. This is something that's been going on for 35 years and we collaborated and came up with on how to host the event in a safe and secure way and I linked up with Lewis, to you know, hand out some things and promote. You know public health and the safety of it and how serious this thing is, and I spoke with Julie on how we can incorporate the seniors- and you know, have them feel like they're, also a part of the community, so we're gonna have something very small and it's gonna be a Halloween demonstration. Basically, we're gonna have a pop-up event kind of like what casita Maria did a few days ago, maybe a week ago, or so, where they just popped up and they had like a little live band outside and that's kind of what we're going to do and we're going to end it in Saint, Vincent, De, Paul, we're going to you know, have a little show there for the seniors everything's going to be outdoors nothing's advertised, it's gonna be pretty much a pop-up event. If you're there. If you're, not you know you missed it and I can let Louis jump in if he wants to add anything or Julie yeah. When I spoke to v, something that maybe we can take advantage in terms of educate the community about social distancing about you know Covid-19. So what I suggested was that maybe behind the marching band we can walk, we can give out face mask. We can give out hand. Sanitizer I already spoke to Anita from the oh, and she gave me a whole bunch of a face mask and hand sanitizer. We have information about telehealth about the testing, and this is basically what we really want to do. Promote I mean like they were saying. This is something totally different. What we always done before, so we have to do something different and I guess doing it. That way, is it's like us, the community board doing our part and promoting the best. What needs to be done in this time of crisis- and you know, I- think it's pretty I think it's a really good idea and we still can make a little noise and just commemorate the Halloween parade yeah. The only thing that we have to just make sure because people tend to gravitate towards music and all of that, so it's going to be up to us to make sure that people don't congregate. You know, there's no pictures that are taken us promoting an event and showing so many people congregating. So we got to make sure that doesn't happen because it'll go back to saying look for community board too, so it's gonna be up to us to tell people no six feet apart and just you know, keep reminding them of it because we're human. We tend to congregate, so right yeah, but we can do, but we can do it absolutely, and I've done a couple of these events already in the city. This is my field. This is what I do for a living and we've also I've been talking to Petey, and you know after this meeting I'm going to have a side conversation with a few others over there. So we're all working together to make sure that we do our part as a community to keep everything safe and, of course, I'll raise awareness and also keep the spirit of Halloween alive as well and you're gonna. Keep it up on the sidewalk right, we're not doing anything on the street. I didn't ask for any permits. There's nothing we're not doing anything closing anything or nothing like that. Nope we can control stuff. So let's go ahead and do it and then this Saturday October 24th 5 p.m. Is there going to be candy giving away at this event? That is something that I'm going to talk to Louis about on the side. I'm not sure. If we're going to distribute any candy this year, yeah I, don't think anything. I didn't I, don't think so. Yeah now we're going to the hand sanitizers and face masks. So that's what we're going to be pushing so then I just want to ask the question: how does that keep the Halloween Spirit, because Halloween is for kids? Yes, you have Halloween is for everybody mainly for children. We might as well give something for the kids too, as well. We could put it in their bag if you're gonna be, the only thing I would say is if you're gonna and you have anybody handling bags I want them to wear gloves. That's fine, wear gloves and masks, even if they're, on the line waiting, they have to have masks anybody participating in handing out anything hand, sanitizers candy. Anything like that. You need to have now. I know that I was a little against it, but it's my understanding. You know that this is being done in the four row in community board, one it's also being done in the 4-3 in the same fashion, nothing big, nothing out of control, nothing advertised, we're not advertising they're! Already advertising yeah. We have a lot of people, advertising we're, not advertising yeah. He started before one with anything or such a square bid is doing something big, so you know they're doing actual marches, we're not even trying to do them all so and remember Paula that we didn't think about candy, because it's not it's going to be whatever is going to be on the street and if we plan and we promote to have kids, the kids are going to come. Otherwise we're not going to see kids and walking around, probably at that time, maybe few now, if someone, if the ones want to bring the candies that takes more probably planning, because then you have to go, buy the candies I, don't know! If we have the money to buy the candies, we have to buy the little bags to you know. Candies Louis I think okay, I think it will take more preparation and also the idea of giving our face mask and enhanced sanitizer is as we walk. We always gave the candies at the end of the walk and we make people a lot. People make the lines so I, don't know how and logistically, if you're going to have candy how's it going to do it, but the other part the face mask and the hand sanitizer it will be. While we walk well again, we I don't think that nobody's gonna be walking. I think that what we want them to do is to come by we'll set up the line and everybody the kids will get their candies the pair the family, the adult will get hand sanitizers and masks and to put it together, I think we can I say this. I'm sorry to interrupt people to put that together, right, I and I don't mean to interrupt or cut you off, but I have a plan and I will discuss with Louis a little bit more in detail on what that plan is and again I've been working closely with Pd and I. Have to get in contact with them a little later this evening, I'm gonna send out an email and I have a conference call with them tomorrow. So we there is a plan. I just need. Everybody to you know just give us a chance to show the community. You know what we're gonna do and how we're gonna carry this out safely and I guarantee you guys won't be disappointed. I did an event in the city a couple weeks ago. It was a success and it had kind of like the similar concept. So I'm not worried about that. Okay can I, just add one more thing. Just on a side note, if you're gonna do this on Saturday the 24th. Can we also just remind people that is the date that early voting starts in New York City, so please absolutely remind them to go out and vote. So are we confirmed with that date? Is that going to be the actual date? Yes, the 24th, this Saturday coming excitable. Will that be enough time, because that's only giving you two three two days to prepare, I'm good, it's a pop-up. We don't want it to get out and have a thousand people show up at any corner. What's the time yeah, so I don't mean that yeah to prepare to put the candies in the bag. You know I, don't know, that's a lot of infection control issues, I'm not even going to do this healthcare and we're living in a different world. That was fine with the sanitizers and and the thing because we live in a different world. If we were gonna, do like a kids thing, a kid's party, then I would go along with it, but this is totally different v. You have my support, 100, whatever you need from me, you got my number. You call me and I'm gonna be there with you on the 24th. Well, let me ask you questions. We are going to stop in front of your place. Where is the best place for the seniors to be able to see? Well, I'm going to have to tell you, because we have a lot of department health regulations. We might have to keep them across the street okay across the street, unless you guys want to close it for a couple of minutes, and Pd is usually pretty good about that, because not much traffic that's going by there, but they can't get on the sidewalk where the seniors are at. That's fine, that's there's! No construction right! The street food has construction. It's left now, because the building is almost ready, we're almost there but we'll make it work v. Whatever you need from me. I want the seniors to see something count on me for whatever thank you. What's the time, 12 p.m, 12 to 1, to one it's going to be no longer than an hour. Honestly, it's not even going to be something crazy. Okay, when everything is over right, yeah v, we got it. You always be mindful about those pictures. We don't want people taking pictures and having a whole bunch of people in the picture and say look what community board did so, let's all be mindful, let's all help each other, the 40th precinct and the Westchester Square Bid have already blasted out flyers they're having a parade of their own, so I understand what you're saying, but we're not the only ones, but the way we're doing it I think we're the only ones taking into account precautions I think anything. People will notice the difference this year. Yeah and I think that they're going to appreciate that we still did something. However, we also kept in mind the safety of everybody, and you know still respecting the governor's orders, so I think that people will still appreciate it and see you know the vision and understand the concept and what we were trying to do. I just wanted yeah and I wanted to apprec I wanted to say thank you because you thought about the seniors, and they do this as a little bit of something. So I really do want to thank you for thinking about them. You're welcome and you know, in the same spirit that Porter was saying you know you can't have Halloween without kids or anything like that. I really would like to have the kids there. You know give them something, but be the only thing that I you know since I will be in town, but the only thing I definitely am going to really be concerned with is the handling of bags and candy and I would want them to all wear gloves. You know and can't find gloves, let Cynthia know and we'll try to find something from some place. The mask that kids wear they're wearing their own mask, but they gotta wear another mask underneath that you know we gotta. You know Bobby, because I'm in healthcare I do a lot of the glove talks and everything you can't use the same glove for a certain amount if you've got to keep changing those gloves yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying yeah, but you can't do it not even for like 15 in a row, you have to keep changing them. I see people wearing the same gloves they're touching their face. They're touching this they're touching them touching this and Lewis knows what I'm talking about, and people think they're safe, because they're wearing gloves, but those same gloves, they're putting them close to their face they're pulling up their glasses they're fixing their hair. So infection control you can't bag dry same candy with the same, I'm letting you know, because that's what I don't know and that's one of the reasons why I had asked v to talk with you and for and with Lewis, because you both are the health experts on the board. So this is why Lewis and I were saying, sanitizers and face masks. It has to be you know. If somebody wants to do candy, then let them we don't want to be the cause of any spreader of anything like that. If you want to get candies out, you know do it to your heart's content, but you could put them in a bag. You could say who's touching that bag, the plastic carries virus every ever, like you said, not more than 10, not more than 10 touches. Remove those, but those gloves and give new gloves. I haven't never seen anybody do that. I've seen it because I work in that, but I've never seen anybody do that. I've seen people serve a whole two hours with the same gloves. I've never seen anybody do that, but if you can do it, you've got my blasting I know: I can't do it Bobby. What happened is that probably 10 people are going to pass in one minute by you, so you will have to constantly every two minutes taking the glove off and on, and it doesn't make sense like I was saying it's much easier that you put alcohol in your hands constantly when you're giving it away and do it that way. I, don't you know, I, don't have a problem Louis. My only concern is the safety of the kids and the safety of every of the adults and that we do not get you know slammed. We had. We didn't think about any of these things. So that's why I'm telling you to talk with you and to talk with Julia so like that we can get a better understanding of what and how it's being put together. But that's exactly what we, what we're giving here the idea. Okay, all right, let's say when you packing, if you have your glove when you're packing the day two three days before all those candies and all that is already it's already clean, so you don't because what happened is that what you're going to be doing when you give it away, is touching it outside inside it's clean all right, but that's something that and Julia can work out, and you know because, like Paula said you're going to do something a halloween, you know you got to make sure the kids get something out of this. You know if I remember, we live in a different world now, I understand that the world I understand that, but we need to be I understand it, but we need to do something. You know where kids feel you know you basically locking up all the kicks in the book. The community I wouldn't say it that way. No I'm gonna take that way, but Rob Bobby remember that mostly of we out there with kids, we are the ones danger. They are not the population I service is the highest risk population. If we're going to mix it this way, I think you and I have to talk to people who can do it differently. I can't put anybody at risk. I really can not put it they're, not getting any candy they're. Just yes, you're, not getting it you're, trying to if you're gonna give up you're gonna forget about candy, and this is an open discussion right if you're gonna give out candy the seniors are not really gonna want the candy you're inviting kids to come and get the candy. So you know no, you missed your apples and peaches. No, the kids are just going to see the kids walking by that's it. That's all! That's the way, I'm getting it. Okay, I'm a little uncomfortable. So so how about we do this? We don't distribute any kind of candy in front of Saint Vincent. If we decide to do that, we'll finish it up. So what we usually do end up in the plaza and that's the freezer. You look at the plaza, then perfect. Do you need to have a meeting going forward? I need to know that and the 41st precinct have we already contacted them. I am good. I'm going to reach out like I said after this meeting I have to send an email over. That was the conversation we had and then you know we'll go from there, for one does have our support. They we do have their support and they advise me anything that we need they'll be more than happy to help us out. As far as the candy I have a couple of ideas and I'll talk to Julie on the side and Louis and I'll run it by you. Obviously, before Saturday, but I have an idea and I wouldn't worry too much about distribution. All right cool just make sure. Besides Lewis and Julie, which I think is the best idea, you got to keep at least Bobby and Paula inform just in case. If there's any monies or anything that like that, you know, yeah, that's not a problem. Everybody informed just try to keep everybody informed, but I will take. I've been doing that I've been doing that yeah I would take Lewis guidance and I'll take Julia's guidance for sure. So all right. So let me know if you need me to set up a meeting or anything like that between now and then. Let me know where the meeting place on Saturday is at 12. Where is the meeting please? Okay here you want me to bring it on the email now send it on an email. That's fine! Okay, I! Don't want you to be repeating yourself sure over and one got involved in the route. They are okay, all right cool, so moving on with the agenda for today at all the main things that we needed to go over. What we have now is old business, new business and announcements, so any old business I have new business. So today this goes under this might go on the language or Ray Arroyo from the banknote. Building he wants to do renovations to one of his buildings and the banknote building is landmark, so the landmark preservation told him he has to have a public hearing, so I think he set up the date. Public hearing, but he needs to present to the full he needs to present to our housing and land Use committee on the renovations that he's looking to do. We have to vote on and then I have to submit that back to the landmarks. So I told him. This isn't gonna happen to next month, since the housing was met this month, so I'll pas I'll follow you out of paperwork. Regarding that the building is 938 garrison and there's already a garage door there and he's going to replace the garage door with a regular pedestrian, walkway door and he's having I can't remember the name of the agency, but I know that they deal with special needs population, but he'll present. All of that at the housing and land use committee on whenever we already went over November's calendar I, think that was the third or the fourth or something like that. The housing will be meeting all right. That's my only announcement or a new business I just wanted to put it on everybody. You know I, don't know if anyone has any other announcements or any business. So as of right now, there's no youth committee, no education for this month. So today is what the 19th our next meeting will be the full board on the 28th unless v wants to have a meeting regarding Saturday but other than that. That's it. I have one thing: real, quick! That monitory became officially the 150th historic district in the city. That's right! Congratulations! District! To to raise the glass! Hey! That's great! That I know you did a lot of work on that Maria everything every day, I know and I know what you have to go through anything else. So from my understanding, they want to have a press conference regarding that in person. So Maria. Let us know when that date comes so you know board members want to participate. I'm waiting for the council member to get back to it to me about a time, that's good for him and also we're trying to work with the council chamber to figure out if to do the battlegrounds again, the Thanksgiving giveaway. That's right a couple of little things we got to figure out, but hopefully we can't close the street yeah. We can't close the street now we can't do tickets either it should be on a first come first serve because those willing to get there five next morning need it. Just don't put. No just don't put no end time if you're putting a fire out because sometimes I see that we put those like four o'clock and we're already finished by two thirty. Three I just had a question: how come they can't close? The street no street permits all right, then all right and I don't know if the 4-1 is willing to do it on their own. We can't. Ah you know that might be asking too much if they're willing to close the street down, but there's no death sample. There's a free permit, no nobody's getting street permits, so we think, but the last time that we did for Thanksgiving Ralph over at the point we didn't do any street permit everybody was on the sidewalk. No, that's not true! You and I were on the street. What are you talking about? The whole thing that we closed down the street may be something different yeah. We did yeah all right. We have to put the permit in all right, we'll try to figure it out, then all right, that's it! Okay! So that's it so listen! The next meeting is a full board meeting unless something else pop off v. Let me know whatever you need for me. You know you got my support, 100 and I. Guess that's it. We're done all right! Anybody else got any concerns. Questions, Larry, I, didn't hear from Larry Sir, no I haven't heard of Harry or no questions no concerns all right, hey good night, guys all right take care. Everyone good night.
