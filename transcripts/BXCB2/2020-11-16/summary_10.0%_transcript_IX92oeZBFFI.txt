You got to explain that to me when I call you because I don't understand what you're saying like the first couple of times: crazy.
We got a couple of big items, so the first one is public section, but I'm gonna switch that to number two.
So people can use that as a rest, Then we got our normal business coming up the chairman's report, Dms adoption administrator elected officials, then we got a bunch of voting items if everything works out, so we got two for.
Maria Right, depending on what happens today, and then we got four actually three items for Flp all discussed that length at the committee.
So I, don't think we're gonna be having an education in youth Committee, unless you guys have something.
You know, and we do have five voting items also along with the public hearing, So six meetings, six votes.
Okay, yes, you're right, we're gonna tally those whatever was submitted and that's what I'm going to review, I'll, entertain questions and then that's it.
Think Roland is informed that he would like to resign right, but you're going to stay on as a com as a board member right.
We are going to meet on the 10th Tuesday Flp, then Wednesday, where the office is closed for veterans day and then Thursday the 12th will be youth, Then the following week, Larry, you got any problem.
If you do not have any items for your committee meeting, please let the board, let the staff know the district manager and Cynthia and Danielle so like that.
I think I went last week for a couple of hours, just to make sure that everything on the computer is still going.
The city has been negotiating with the landlord for the past before that I mean since 2019 right since, like now last year, This time, they've been negotiating with the landlord on a five-year option.
The controller's office understands what's going on, I'm just waiting to hear back a final answer, so.
What's going on the office itself and with the rent from last fiscal year as long as we get the approval from you, know, office.
I hear something I'll, Let you know I'll inform everybody of that.
It's a nightmare any time of day that you any day of the week you pass through the Bruckner unless you're going like on an overnight or something it is from, like 149th street, all the way to the turn to get on to the to cross over to the other side of the Bucknell there on by the Bronx River, but Ralph really quick.
There one day we're having a dangerous situation where the people from the service road, because it goes quicker when you're going like from, I'm, gonna, say Beretto or Tiffany going into the hunts.
I, don't know right, but that's the only thing that I got in the bag on the budget and capital expense.
Boulevard did Rashawn Z, who was a former board member a couple of years, back, I'm, gonna, say I, don't know if I was the dn.
They should know that they can't use their position on the board to try to gain anything like that should be something brought up in the orientation saying that they can not send any emails with letter like claiming to be a board member or any letters or posing any TV things as a board member.
And I think that's something that needs to be established and clear as a water that, because you choose to be a board member, That doesn't mean that you're getting better things that other people and you I, don't know.
They want to correct those things so that people can no longer climb them, but then that they have safe structures that we don't have to worry about collapsing on anybody right, now, I did, will they have to close the park down.
We want to, you, know, keep that park safe, and so this was something that needs to be done as well.
If anybody wants to get that email to them, there was general consensus of the entire committee members that were there that they both approve of the plan.
You had anything to add in terms of from my presentation of what they were doing, Please well, I think you know they put a traffic light now on 165 and Fox, which is good.
I, just want to make sure that you know, because some people may feel that it's you know.
I can do both just let me know what y' all want all right.
Basically, We're gonna have a pop-up event kind of like what casita Maria did a few days ago, maybe a week ago, or so, where they just popped.
We're going to you know, have a little show there for the seniors.
We got to make sure that doesn't happen because it'll go back to saying: look for community board too, so it's gonna be up to us to tell people no six feet: apart.
You know after this meeting I'm going to have a side conversation with a few others over there.
He started before one with anything or such a square bid is doing something big, so you know they're doing actual marches, we're not even trying to do them all so and remember Paula that we didn't think about candy, because it's not it's going to be whatever is going to be on the street.
I think that what we want them to do is to come by we'll set up the line and everybody the kids will get their candies the pair the family, the adult will get hand sanitizers and masks and to put it together.
Okay across the street, unless you guys want to close it for a couple of minutes, and Pd is usually pretty good about that, because not much traffic that's going by there, but they can't get on the sidewalk where the seniors are at.
You know since I will be in town, but the only thing I definitely am going to really be concerned with is the handling of bags and candy and I would want them to all.
And Lewis knows what I'm talking about, and people think they're safe, because they're wearing gloves, but those same gloves, they're, putting them close to their face.
And Julia can work out, and you know because, like Paula, said you're going to do something a halloween.
They are okay, all right, cool, so moving on with the agenda for today at all the main things that we needed to go over.
But I know that they deal with special needs population, but he'll present, All of that at the housing and land use committee on whenever we already went over November's calendar.
That's right a couple of little things, we got to figure out, but hopefully we can't close the street.
You know you got my support, 100 and I.
