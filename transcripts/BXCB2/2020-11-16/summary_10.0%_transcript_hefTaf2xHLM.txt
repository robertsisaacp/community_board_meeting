Give me a text message, but if you do have an issue with your building like right, now, I'm working with Miss Brown from 941,951 hoe, Avenue.
You watch the video, but that's what they're doing now, they're doing a lot of smash and grabs so, but if you guys see anything going on even stores that are not supposed to be open, you know definitely shoot me a text message or give me a call.
If you have any fire prevention concerns, any kind of issues that you need to be dealt with, feel free to reach me anytime, I, don't know if sanitation is here.
The residents on Seneca Avenue are abusing our dumpster to a point where now it's becoming a health hazard, we called 311 last night, the captain of the engine, and they spoke to about possibly getting some surveillance from the sanitation police, because you know it's bringing rats into the you know into the area and the next thing.
Everybody's family is healthy and safe, and you know let's continue practicing what the mayor has stated as it pertains to the minutes.
I really want to acknowledge and thank your district manager, Ralph Acevedo and your chair, Bobby Crespo, because not all community boards are doing what you guys doing.
I know that the board is working and communicating with all of your board members, but, to be quite frank, I, don't see community boards meeting again to September.
You know we need to I need to work with the different markets and the different businesses to ensure that we're getting the appropriate supplies for the community.
There was a big hiccup from the mayor's team where they took parking on Spotford Avenue from Tiffany to Manida, and there was about 75 parking spots that were lost and it made absolutely no sense for those parking spots to be lost and again this is a failure from the mayor's office, because you know they never communicate.
We all know, Monitor street was a one-way going towards Lafayette and it has been a smooth, transition, and.
I recommend you reach out to Tom Lecania or your district manager, because if you did not reapply chances are you're not going to get reappointed for those board.
So I want to ensure that whatever legislation we pass on, the council we get to, you know, keep and save jobs, and.
You allow me to, but before we take any questions, Mr Councilman, Councilman, Salamanca I, want to thank you on behalf of the board for the help on the distribution center, and it was a big fight.
And I want to thank Captain Sherbling, also who worked with us on that issue, But most of all you who brought the commissioner from D.O.T the downtown commissioner Commissioner Pollock to come down and speak with us, and it's like that.
You, know when, when the Covid-19 hit, because he needed medical care and Lincoln Hospital as well did an extraordinary job.
We have Senator Smith, Mr District manager very quickly before I just want to let all the board members know.
I also want to thank you, Bobby and you Ralph, and all the board members for this meeting and for the work that you continue to do it's extraordinary the kind of work that all of you are doing and in the community like ours that need as much help as possible to have each and every one of you do and participate and contribute.
Most of us have had close to our have closed our district offices because of the Corona crisis, Corona Covid-19 crisis, But we are doing a lot of work with the community.
Most of the things that we're working on right now is on helping people get tested, delivering or getting food for people helping people with evictions, especially unscrupulous landlords that are trying to exploit tenants.
They're, going to be giving out a lot of food for people who are in need, so I urge you all to make it there as soon as possible, because sometimes when we open up these, these pantries, the food goes quickly, and so anyone that you know that needs help can always reach out as a backup in case.
We, don't divulge any information, We protect the confidentiality, but there's been a an uptick on domestic violence issues in our homes, and we can see why, if you need help, but you can't get to my office for any reason.
You can call 311 and they'll help you same with people that are in need of mental health issue.
You know that the Bronx has the highest percentage of positive results when people get tested for Covid-19, but unfortunately we're being shortchanged, because we have this, the lowest number of tests done in the entire city, even though our people are suffering at a greater rate.
They will have telemedicine people available to give you information on the spot, and if anybody tests positive, there will be medical help and all of this the important thing is free of cost.
And, I'm working with the governor's office and other electives to make sure that we can bring this program throughout the entire nitro development and then get locations.
One of the major issues that we're going to be tackling is revenue, because the governor has refused to tax those that are extremely wealthy in this country, and we are proposing four taxes that help us cut the deficit and provide funding for programs like like medical care and schools, but medical care, very importantly, because there is a proposal to cut Medicaid something that I find completely insane under the conditions, especially in our communities.
That, unfortunately, Despite a lot of the work of our leaders, we still last in terms of health care indicators, so we're raising hell with the governor to make sure that the Bronx, especially these areas in the Bronx, where you have a lot of health issues, do not get the shoulder under the stick on housing.
Many of them are going to need assistance with rent, but also individuals that that are trying to reach or have reached the american dream and have a one to two to three family home that need help with things like paying the property taxes and paying the emergency they're, Also taking into consideration and their needs.
What they had stated that we need to do is that if we know any seniors that do not live in these buildings, so call 311 and they will connect them and they get registered, and then they will start having the lunches delivered to them.
The best thing that I could tell you is to go call 311 and just let them know that they want to be registered for the senior citizens delivery, program, and then they will connect them to that.
I was told that there's a listing of sixteen hundred workers that they're looking for and they should be calling 311 and ask for the SBS line and say that they want a listing of the jobs to make sure we can have it.
So I'm asking you guys that if you know anybody, that's looking for a job.
That's, presently right, now, still waiting for the unemployment check that they should start go to SBS and ask go to the 311, ask for SBS and look for the and ask them to let you want to register for the jobs that Fbs is promoting.
I am going to nominate three people for the nomination committee, which is Jesse Harris, Roland, Ronan, Lopez and Stephanie Cordero who's, a new board, member.
So I was going to place a motion to see if we couldn't hold the election until September when we all come back because even like Salamanca said that there's a possibility that we're not coming back until September, so I think it's is.
You know making a motion to hold that election until September because of the Covid-19, and also because we all need to be present.
I, didn't have five people board members, so we're gonna have to open this up, so.
But what I send out is official from the mayor's office and from the governor's office and by any means, If anyone has any questions or need, resources, please reach out to me.
A confirmed eleven thousand seven hundred and eighty seven hundred and eight confirmed deaths and five thousand two hundred and twenty probable effects of Corona virus a little bit of what New York the Department of Health is working on is, as we all know, coronavirus is a community transmitted.
We all know, This is an executive order that the governor issued children less than two years old of age should not wear face coverings, people with breathing problems or another health issue that makes them unable to tolerate a face covering do not need to wear one.
Community boards and elected officials, as we all know, New York City parks, including darts dog parks, are closed.
Specifically, the supermarket is not directly inspected by us, but we're working on creating a list to ensure there are any specific areas that need outreach more in regards to our social business team policy and our faith, everything we want to know so.
You know you could go through New York state of health.
That means that we're trying to engage communities that have been mostly impacted by club 1919, identifying unique needs of these communities connecting with community-based organizations, elected officials or social workers working with city agencies and officials to address the narrow disparities that we're seeing.
You know, I, won't repeat a lot of what the council member did state, but something else that the health department is working on is with this pandemic.
You know some updates about the hunts point meat market and these emergency generators.
At a time like this, You know we really want to make sure that we are protecting the city's food sources as much as possible.
The year, 2017 Councilmember Salamanca allocated about 3.45 million towards the purchase and installation of these emergency generators, So the city was able to help with the remaining funding needed to complete the project.
You know we are in 2020, and these generators are still not there like a total waste of time from EDC.
Gonna, ask the district manager to email, this presentation and the design packet, and that will complete what we need from the community.
And right now, There's a lot of truck drivers that are coming from across the country, delivering food and other essential items into New, York, City and in science point in particular, and we want to make sure that we had a safe rest stop for these treasures through park.
You, know in any given day, If you drive through hunts point you're gonna, see probably hundreds of trucks parked all around the neighborhood men.
Yes, This is a positive thing, but you're just adding more responsibilities to the forward, precinct, meaning that they can not patrol you know they you're, taking them away from our streets to do security at these bus stops so they're, not there on a permanent basis, it's as part of their rounds, they're, making rounds through here in the event that there may be an issue.
I don't want to keep on hitting on this, but Charlie I want to have a conversation with your team in my office about this, because there needs to be better enforcement and we can depend on the same resources that should be protecting our community to do something that EDC could put funding for to actually have proper, enforcement.
You know, historically, that these trucks are already in hunts, point already parked on the streets, giving them a safe place to be able to rest that they're not driving around looking for a place that they're, not in many cases.
Or, it's a spot for that they're taking spaces that belong to the community, we're actually giving these truck drivers safe, a central location for them to park, and we believe that the right move to get them into one location, I understand that there's questions, safety, security and we'll get back to you on those answers.
Mr, chairman, I, think you're right in terms of the way information is communicated to us.
When is the forward going to do what they really need to do, which is protect our communities.
This week, with EDC with the 401 and NYPD, to figure out how we're going to give them the resources that they need so that there's no interruption and services for our community.
So you know I'm asking like.
I think, one of the first board meetings that I've been to in an innovative kind of way using technology as a way to make sure that the government is still doing its job in a local, community-based level.
As we know, this unfortunate pandemic is has affected, so many communities especially has a negative adverse effect to people of color African-Americans Latinos, and so we want to make sure it's important.
But, in addition to that, we're working to make sure that not only our hospitals but our health care centers have the capability to do working with in the community to have the resources they need to be able to help, treat and hopefully have currently and will be near future.
And I just want to respectfully let all the other elected official reps know you have two minutes.
Good evening, so I just want to kind of thank the community board for all they have done so.
As of now, As you know, I'm, one of the representatives for Alexandria Biaggi, representing the 34th district, we're working around the clock just to make sure that constituents are receiving the help that they need.
Gloria and, on behalf of the board, send our get well to the council member and you stay safe, because I know you like to be walking all around that area.
So, If you know of a senior that is in need of food, other than.
I just want to thank you, Ralph and the staff on behalf of the board, because all three you have kept us up to date with all the new guidelines and all the news from the city and the mayor's office.
And I want the board to know that Ralph and the staff has worked very hard, even though they're not in the office.
What's going on I, Let them know who to call.
You know, As far as what we could do and what we can't do every day things are changing, so I just want to acknowledge.
Don't know how we're gonna be able to justify giving all community boards.
