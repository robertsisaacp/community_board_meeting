I just want to make sure everybody know who's.
Health is an issue right now that is so important and what's going on in the community with.
It's a really great idea to bring urban health plan and since then, the biggest community health center in our district, they can give us an update or let us know what you're doing, how you're doing.
If you need anything from the community board, How can we support the work that urban is doing so for that we have the CEO and president of Urban Health plan, Ms Paloma Hernandez that she's gonna be addressing some of the issues.
It was really at that point, and all of the focus was on the hospitals as it should have been, But no one was looking at the primary care providers on the ground and trying to figure out how do we keep some semblance of a health care system that wasn't going to be flooding the emergency rooms at that time, back March and April.
We figured out how many people could be in a given space at a given time so through the use of a grid, which kind of tells you more than x, number of people based on what exam rooms based on seating in your waiting room, coupled that with walkie-talkies couples with clickers, where we keep counts of everybody, That's going into our facilities, we've been able to maintain right, now.
Oh, one minute, I, don't know right now, and that was my granddaughter hi granddaughter, And. We started bringing in dental, So we always had two dentists who did emergency dental care throughout the crisis.
You know how emotional I get, but it's because I, the human factor is such a big deal in all of this and humans are resilient and we survive and we move forward right, and so we one of the things that became very evident to us and foundations, would ask me other than health care.
We've done some patient satisfaction, surveys, and so one of the things that really has intrigued me is like how do people feel going back into the center and by and large people have said that they felt that we reopened in a proper way and in a safe way, and that's really good, very few.
Gabrielle Torres is from my staff and is going to be speaking about Medicare Advantage, open enrollment.
That focuses just on outreach and navigation and insurance enrollment and when we closed in March, we shut down all of our non-clinical offices, including her office, and she requested not too long ago that we think about reopening the center, because there are a lot of people who need to come in and need to bring papers, and it's just not so easy to do through scanning and through the computer.
In a couple of weeks, we're going to be reopening the health information center.
Many of you know, him is in there twice a week and is helping people with applications and resumes, and really they needed to do a lot of the registration for the Ged program and testing in person.
Don't know why I'm hearing myself, we have one health center, that's opening up on southern Boulevard in East, Tremont.
You know what the community says not only about the community, but also about the urban health plan.
Now, like Paloma, was saying it's for some people, especially for our Medicare population, is coming up against the open, enrollment and.
Like Paloma was saying we do provide enrollment of health insurance, for you, know, for the people not only for our patient, but for the community in general, And. I believe it was really good to bring somebody who who's not an Hmo or health insurance that if they come, they will talk about their products or what they can do for the community right.
I know you brought a presentation which we already have on screen and feel free to start talking all right, perfect, hi everyone, again.
So, Let's get started so again, I'm, really just going to talk about the Medicare Open enrollment period.
If there's anyone in the community that needs assistance when it comes to even Medicaid, applying for Medicare or even guidance, to try to figure out what plan to select at our office, What we really do is we look at the patients or the clients primary care, doctor specialty, you know even certain medications that they might be on, because when it comes down to them, selecting a plan, it's best for them to select the one that's going to give them the most coverage.
You know, I find that there are times that our clients jump from different plans, because Medicare advantage plans also have Otc, which is a benefit which actually gives money to individuals enrolled into advantage care.
I, you know, provided our information there, but also who I wanted to provide on Medicare.
Now, when it comes to selecting a plan, We do have health insurance reps that we built relationships with to be able to you know.
You know for anyone when it comes to Medicare the Social Security offices out letter about the open, enrollment period and a lot of information.
They'll, send it to them and then also too, You know think about Medicare coverage, needs.
Do, you think the office your office is going to be open by that time or not.
It comes to the long-term like if someone needs home attendance services and long-term care services to be honest, Medicaid, especially because, In order for someone to get home attendant services, they have to be enrolled into Medicaid, right.
But I do want to acknowledge that last month we spoke about having the Ohmh, make a presentation about Covid-19 and track and tracing, and at that time it was decided to have them present full board meeting for September right, but.
I, think that was the whole point of trying to you know capture as many people and in those resources that I needed provided so I.
For, the you know, the people in the shelters, but I'm hearing that maybe November 1st, We will probably start signing the leases.
Are you going to have any set aside for people that live in this like seniors that live in this district.
They, don't want to provide the services, they have cut out completely the social day care from the clients, benefit, and we, You know just kind of looking for a little bit of support from everybody, because when this pandemic is over, you know this continues: we're not going to exist.
I know we have been working with open arms for so long, not only through the community board, but also we have done a lot of collaborative work with urban health plan and over open arms.
So, it's very important that we all understand that in order for us to know, if we have the virus, we have to get tested, right.
