To Chairman Otto, okay, the floor is yours and your first item who's that officer, so Cola is here all right. Thank you. So Cola I want to thank everybody for being patient with us. This is I, know brother, a little hard to put together when these virtual meetings would have been at the board. It would have been a little different, but unfortunately we still don't have permission to go into our offices. But, however, we have several items that are for the franchise license. Permit committee. There are four items, but I know that some some people I'm on camera now because of other places to go to and other meetings that they have to attend. But the first item that we have to address is the: what was the address again: Ralph 672,673 hunts, point Avenue, 673 hunts, point avenue known as club. W am I correct, yes, well, Mr chairman before we allow them to speak. I want to acknowledge that we are joined by representatives from Senator Biaggi's office. I see that state senator Sabudai was on I, think he'll be joining us shortly and we have assembly member Elect, Kenny Burgos on and we also are joined by council member Rafael Salamanca. So I just want to acknowledge all the electives that are here. Okay, thank you for recognizing them and because I can't see them, their names are not here and I can't differentiate. Okay. So, let's start with the agenda number one which is club. Well, there's no! Is there anybody here representing club? W yes, I am my name is Martin mailer, I'm an attorney and I represent angel for men. Who's who's by the way has formed a corporation. So I can give you the name of the corporation. If you want that, it's called p, p-a-M, Unspoint Corp and what we are filing for is an on-premises liquor license for a nightclub. The nightclub will feature a disc jockey recorded music, employee, dancing, exotic dancing, tapas dancing, and we have security. So Mr Fermin is a former police official who has about 27 years with the New York City Police department, and intends to have a very extensive security plan in place. In terms of how this premises will be run, we supplied you with that security plan and Mr Fermin is here to answer whatever questions you might have with respect to the type of operation that will be conducted within the premises at all times, it will be orderly at all times, we'll adhere to whatever laws it is subject to and he intends to have a well-respected premises by the time he opens for operation yeah. Is he on the air I believe so I saw him on the air before yes, I am chairman all right and how about your security person? He is the security person. He is the police security he's not the principal. Yes, he is he's the principal he's one of the principals. Yes, he is he the president of the corporation. Yes, he is he's the president of the corporation Ralph. Do you see any I? Don't have the paperwork in front of me? Can you please verify this? For me all that to us was the certificate of occupancy police without a first page and a security plan. So there was nothing with a title of or a tax attack. You know W-9 or anything like that. Well, I was only told to give you the security plan, the lease and the co and, as I just explained, we have since filing with you. People formed the corporation as well. I can give you whatever you want I understand. First of all, we don't you're stating that Mr Furman I guess is the principle. The president of the corporation, the situation is that we don't have that paperwork in front of us, and so we, you know it's hard for us to take it, not that it's that you're lying to us, but we need to see that people, but secondly, I don't know who ever said that this is all you needed to present to us. I could show you Bobby, that's the information that we requested, because we weren't what was sent back to us. Wasn't for this a renewal. So my question then to Mr, because Mr Fuhrman, if I'm not mistaken, you presented to the board last year, were didn't. You is Mr Permanente. Yes, I'm on and I yes and I showed up and at that time I was going to run security. Since then, I've moved on to become a partner and revamped the security at the venue when we opened and I'm gonna be running security and be a partner now in the location, so being a partner, you still have the same entities that present it they're your partners, no they're, not the two people that were there before are no longer a part of this thing and Mr Fuhrman has other partners, and it has nothing to do with the people that were there before so who are the other partners? Okay, Mr Furman. You want to explain who they are. The other partners are Miriam, Fleischer and Peter. They are the backers. They are. They they're just the financial end of this one. They have nothing to do, but these are the same individuals that presented. So how long have you been taking over the operation? Well, excuse me, sir I, when you say these are the same people. They are not the same people as what was there before I. Don't know who's Peter, you want one. The the total of people will be three and Peter was Peter's last name he didn't give Peter's name. Oh, I'm sorry Peter for Chetty, so it's the same beautiful chatty that came to us last year, correct, yes, Peter and myself. Okay, so you guys have been operating the three of you. How long have you been operating this managing this location? Now, look? Can I explain what happened. There was an application filed with the New York State liquor authority. It was filed by something known as I believe it was six seven through. No I'm sorry. No I'm sorry. There was a corporate change filed for something known as 673 Jrv Corp. The two people who came before you as the owners or the proposed owners did not pass liquor authority scrutiny, so they left, which threw the place back in terms of ownership to the existing lice principles. Someone by the name of Ellucian Mark Martins is the current principle of the licensee. A deal was struck so that Mr Furman and his group could buy the business and that's what is before you there's a new corporate entity known as Pam hunts, Point Avenue Corp, and that is what is going to apply with the New York State liquor authority. Whatever what happened before was that the two individuals that filed needed financial needed finances and Peter and his partner supplied finances. They were never paid back and now they're looking to recoup by taking an equity position in the new corporation, but they're just the financial people, then they will not be running the day-to-day affairs yeah, but there will be lifted as business partners of Mr Furman Correct. Absolutely yes! So this was the same case that presented to us last year. Nothing has changed here, except that it went from one entity that the state liquor authority denied and I was going under Mr Fuhrman's name, no it. That is not correct. What happened last year? What if I, can get this straight? There was one second Mr, Martin I have all the documents here. We even have the attendance sheets of all these individuals that we're talking about they came. We have a recorded meeting that they were going to assume or corporate change and you're correct. It was denied in December, Mr Fuhrman was a part of that group. So, instead of now under John, it was under a fellow by the name of John's name there. The license is the Mr Furman's name, but it's still Mr Fuhrman and it's still Peter. That's a part of this. If I made corrections, there were two individuals originally somebody by the name of Mengali, and it's someone by the name of Diaz. Those are the two that filed when they fought no and Mr Mike Diaz presented a letter to the board approximately a year and a half ago, stating that he is the principal right time. Then, when last year, when we had the meeting, it was stated that Mr Mr Diaz was no longer the an owner and as in fact the operation was being ran by Miss Lucy Martinez's license when they were not supposed to. They was they. She had sold the business to the other individuals. This that's. Why my only question was how long because Mr Fern, as far as we know, you've, been a part of this since last year, correct that is not correct. When I presented in front of you I was totally there. They had hired me to provide security and to revamp their security and to possibly run security. Since then, I've evolved to become a partner based on the fact that the other investors were not going to get paid and I decided that it was a good business opportunity for me, Mr Furman. My question is, and to Martin these other partners, then they've been a part of this since last year, correct no, they were up until just now they were lenders. They had nothing to do with the operation of the business, and just we have statements as otherwise conflicting that Martin, I'm sorry I, don't want to take up much more time with this, because I don't have some of our elected officials on and I would like to open the floor. Yes, if they have any questions, thank you. Thank you. Mr District manager and thank you Mr chair for putting this together. Mr Furman. Just a question: for you know: I was a former district manager Bronx community board too, and in my time there you know. I worked closely with NYPD to shut down topless entertainment bars that we had in hunts point because of the violence that was coming out of these clubs and the issue of prostitution and just overall, you know a negative effect on our quality of life. I'm just curious: how is it possible that you will be in charge of security and running security and also be running and be owners of the club? How are you going to handle both roles? That's pretty simple! I'm going to be on premise: I would say at least seven days a week towards the start and that by being on premise and being the general manager on a day to day running, the security is also going to be part and parcel of that. That's not going to be an impossible role to also ensure that security is running up to the standards that I've written in the security plan. That's not going to be an impossible task for me, I'm already going to be on premise and I'm going to ensure that security personnel follows all the directors. According to the plan that I've created for the venue. Are you aware of the violence that was coming out of this club in the last two years that they were open, am I, aware of violence? No, I'm aware that there were some incidents, but I do not. Prior to my involvement regarding the security. I was not aware of any violence per se. Are you aware of that? There was a young lady that I believe was coming out working a club and was sexually assaulted, down the block coming out of this club within the last two years, but yeah I was made aware of that yeah that I am aware of okay, all right. Well, look I just want to make it clear. Look. I I would not be supportive of this application. I would write a letter to the state, liquor authority and I urge the community board too to to deny this application. These type of businesses are not needed, nor they are wanted in our communities anymore. You know they played their role, they have tarnished our communities, they have tarnished the south Bronx and, to be quite frank, you know another type of a topless entertainment bar is not what the hunts point. Community needs and I really don't know how why you're, even applying for an application, given that Covid-19 the city's, not the state and the city, is not even going to allow you to open up, and so you know, I, just I, I'm just curious to why you know your partner's so adamant to open up given with the endemic that we're in and the state's not going to allow you to open up. Sir, can I answer that I mean you. Are you stating that, because of Covid-19, these places won't ever open up again, I mean there's a condition that exists now. It affects many places. Many restaurants, many bars many nightclubs, but I guess they're, all hoping that at some point, Covid-19 is behind us and that a vaccine is created and that and then they be allowed to reopen. They fully understand what the limitations are now but they're, looking to there's a business opportunity within this premises, I fully respect what your position is with respect to topless bars, but they have a right to exist in the city of New York. This area that it's located in is one of the only areas in the city that will allow this type of entertainment and what we're trying to present here is a 27-year veteran of the New York City Police department that can run a proper establishment, and it's just saying that per se. Just let me finish, you can say what you want afterwards, but you're telling me that, regardless of the demeanor of the person that we're running the place is despite the qualifications of the person that will be running this place, that, in fact, you are prejudging that there is no possible way for this premises to operate within the law. I respectfully disagree with that premise and you're prejudging what is going on. This gentleman has gone before the local precinct has made. A presentation has told the the precinct what he intends to do. It is my understanding they are not adverse to this application at this point and I take tremendous exception to the fact that you say that we can't even file and I mean that just totally against the rules, the regulations, the constitution, for that matter, their first human rights, mind. This is Mr Quest folk I, don't think the councilman ever said you can't file. He just said I, don't understand why you're filing when we're having such a critical pandemic in the city? That's what I think he's leading to. He never said that you couldn't file correctly and, let's not put nobody's words in anybody's mouth, no I, never intended to do that. Okay! So, let's we'll start all over again I appreciate it. Look Mr Martin, let's be clear, you're your applicant there you know within the law he can file an application, but my questioning here is, like I understand, he's a veteran for 28 years. I'm going to tell you my experience as a district manager for Bronx community board too. The reason that we were able to shut down all four strip. Clubs in the Huntsman community was because security can not control the crowd. They could not control the violence that was tarnished in our communities and they did have police officers at head of security. There was a time where they were trying to open up club king of clubs, and we had we had correction officers who were the owners, the principals and they were in charge. They were going to be in charge of security and the community board. Given our experience was past clubs. We knew that, regardless of the experience that you have, you know you can't control. The behavior of your patrons this community for decades has suffered from this type of establishment who have in return, given us a negative environment in our communities and as a result of this negative environment. Our police department has had to station themselves in front of these clubs so that they can prevent the violence, that's spilling out their clubs onto the street and it's unacceptable. We've suffered enough and therefore I will do everything that I can in my power to prevent this application from moving forward. If you look it up, you, google, it you'll, see how successful I've been, and this would be no different. Thank you can I come in now. Can I try that I would like to recognize senator said and I like to follow up with what some, maybe some other history that you're not aware of Mr Martin, saying that this is perfect. This was a per. This is a perfect area for this particular establishment. Go ahead, Senator. Thank you. Bobby look. I too, have written a letter to the state, liquor authority and I had a conversation with the general counsel and I agree with with Mr Acevedo, who says that some of the information that you're providing is inconsistent with some of the documents that we reviewed and some of the information I have. Pursuant to my conversations with the general account with the council for the state liquor authority, you know I'm gonna make this as simple as possible in our communities. We want our kids, our families, that no matter where they travel throughout hunts point in that area that they have a sense of pride, because we people who have lived here for many years have attempted to bring establishments and business and economic development. Okay, I got it. Thank you, man now I can tell you, along with Councilman Salamanca, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that you don't see the light of day with this application. You know, I, don't know Mr Friedman and your council, if you would like these kinds of establishments in your backyard, you're welcome to put it in your backyard in your neighborhoods, but we are sick and tired in this community for people that don't live in this community to come here and put these kinds of establishments. It is not fair. There are new sheriffs in town that are vehemently opposed and insulted by these kinds of applications and these kinds of establishments I have family here. I, don't want my kids to be walking around topless bars. I, don't want the children in this community to be topless bars, I, hope it is another matter. It exacerbates a bad situation, but this community is going to fight you to the end so to make sure that your application does not see the value of the day and I'll. Tell you what I did in West farms, another area where they try to establish. They try to create an establishment. Several years ago about seven years ago, where I personally went with cameras and other of my friends and we started videotaping the patrons that were going in and we know some of them were married. Some of them had girlfriends that didn't want to be on video going into these types of establishments. I am prepared to do the same thing with this establishment. So do yourself a favor and open these establishments somewhere else. We don't want it here, we're going to fight you tooth and gum. You have the entire political leadership that is opposed to these kinds of establishments. Thank you, Senator Assembly, member, Virgos, I, don't know if he wants to chime in also with any comments, Kenny yep I. Thank you for the time I mean I'm listening. I'm here. Listening in this is a lot of day. I'm learning as we go, but I'm right now taking out the information we have and I'm gonna stand with the councilman and senator you know, I think hunts. Point community has suffered for far too long with these kind of establishments and we've worked very hard. You know Ralph's, you know, Salamanca have worked extremely hard to change the fabric of this other community, so for us to go backwards, would just be a step in the wrong direction. So that's all I have to say thank you Ken. Thank you. Kenny I think Mr, Martinez, John I think thank you for the opportunity. Thank you Ralph. Thank you. Chairman principal I, appreciate this opportunity. I do agree to some extent for the fact that this community does need a better opportunity, better leadership, and we need to make sure that we being adamant to what we place in our communities. This is something very important for those who are following us behind us, so I want to make sure that in that regard, we are we're taking initiative to make sure that establishments like these are being not being in this community, but also put something very impactful for our kids to follow by. Thank you so much I appreciate it. Thank you give our regards to the senator yeah I. Think I just want to get I wanted to see sergeant Guglielmo from the precinct, because I know that they made contact with the precinct, so I know we have sergeant Guglielmo and Officer Sokola and Officer Maldonado want to just say anything for the record Saj sergeant. Can you guglielmo me yeah without you now sergeant, go ahead, sergeant, hey how you doing good evening, ladies and gentlemen, sergeant Guillermo from the 41st precinct, so just to clarify a couple of things. We have not actually met with anyone from the the establishment. The new regime that has taken over I have spoken to Mr Fermin. They did request a meeting. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get it together, but just to be clear, we don't take a stance one way or the other, but we do report on the crime statistics and in the past you know there were a lot of serious incidents that happened there. It started with a slashing. We also had a a female that was actually was kind of a kidnapping, slash sexual assault. She was taken and then it culminated with a shooting and to the point where I personally was working that night and the captain and I. You know we deemed it necessary to put units in that area only because of the traffic going in and out of there and by the grace of God I mean I was two blocks away. My unit was actually one block away when the shooting happened and we were lucky enough to apprehend the suspects and no incidents were you know nobody was injured, but at the end of the day you know it happened in the parking lot, but it all stemmed from the club. So you know we don't take a stand one way or the other. We just report on the crime statistics and there was a severe uptick in crime in regards to that club. Okay, thank you so much sergeant so Mr Furman a year ago, when you came before the board or before the committee, you were only going to do security and you say that you was a lieutenant in the police department and so forth, and so on and so forth, but now you're just coming in as a regular citizen that you come with some experience and security. That's all well and good, but as my district manager has stated before the one and the councilman has stated major problems, and then you just heard the sergeant here that there's major problems going on because of this type of establishment. That was the reason that we had to make a blanket move and remove all these establishments from the hunts point area. Worst of all. First of all, worst of all, a year ago, I told you and the four individuals that were with you that day that we had female girls were going to school, stopping board members and asking us that what kind of establishment that is and what kind of how could that be such a great establishment for the community and then, when I asked that when I asked that back, then nobody can answer it. I have homeowners right across the street from you. I have two schools right in the middle between both of yous between your establishment, a junior high school and an elementary school I can't see and I, don't know how in God's name, this application has come up before the state liquor authority because they have all the documentation. They understand everything that we have stated. They have assured us that they would not approve any kind of license for this particular location and now you're coming in and you're saying. Well, I was this, but now I'm this. It gives me a feeling of hairs going up my the back of my neck, because it's saying I'm just there I'm the front. Now. I'm the front, I'm the one, that's in front of everything and I'm you know it's not like if you stole a police officer because they wouldn't allow you to do it anyway, but if he was a police officer, it would be your reputation if anything went wrong. If something goes wrong now, it's not your reputation, nobody's gonna, say anything, everybody just gonna say clubbed up or the wedge, yeah and then our kids are gonna, be seeing girls coming out, definitely dressed. Okay, we had three major and again and I, don't understand how SLA approved this three major issues, a shooting that the patrol car was just going by when the shooting occurred, a rape and kidnapping, which is what the sergeant defines it as okay and then an assault that was occurred in there three major instances in one year: okay- and this was all doing why your other partners that you came in with then we're running the establishment, we're running the establishment- and this was still going on and thinking that nobody was going to say anything. Then we find out that it's not really yours, it's using another person's license which was again wrong because she, the minute she sold the establishment and surrendered that her license to the state liquor authority, as required by law. So my situation here is, as the chairman of the world is that I gotta look at this and say how admit how all of this going on? How is this all going on? You know you. First you your only security and now your security and an owner I'll get to you Julian security and owner, and then on top of that then I hear oh, you know well I, I'm gonna have the security force you're not gonna have the security force. You know that and I know that there's no more cameras that you could you can't put in there because there's approximately some cameras that were put onto that established when Al had the place and even then we were having problems. We couldn't prove it. We couldn't prove it, but I'm just saying what where in your mind, do you think, or your attorney thinks that this establishment fits in our community, because in that all honesty it doesn't, it does not fit in our community because, obviously, you haven't walked through our community. You have not seen what's going on through our community with all the new construction. That's going on in the hunts point area, all the new housing. That's going up in the hunts point area, all the new jobs, we're trying to bring to the hunts point area, and we don't need an establishment, that's going to bring back an Hbo piece like they did the last times, and so I know that I've got a board member. My first vice chair, Julia Cruz, that wants to say something go ahead: Julia hi good evening. Thank you for having this and thank you for waiting for me to come on. First thing: I want to see, is you two gentlemen, Mr Martin and Mr Furman? You should be totally embarrassed on how unprepared you came to us if I was to address a body of people who took time out in the evening to listen to you and approach you the way you approached us I'd be embarrassed. You did not know people's names you're trying to hide information, I, don't trust what you're saying we don't want this in the neighborhood I agree with the councilman or the other legislators with my chairman. It is an embarrassment how you came to us, we're not idiots we're, not dumb. We well educated people, I think you should be embarrassed on how you approached us and how you're trying to hide information from us changing names around. We don't fall for that kind of stuff, so you do not and will never get. My support. I stand with my chairman and I stand with my committee. Ralph I just want to make sure that we're on record that, because right now the license is under the old owners that we know are no longer a part of this establishment and they have not for quite some time since at least 2017, since 2017 they've been attempting to do a corporate change and has been denied, but I just want to go on record that Lucian and this other individual, the two individuals that licensed it was just renewed, and it's nothing to do with these individuals now Mr Furman and his partners. However, they want to be identified. They've been as they've been part of this since at least 2017 that we know fact- and it's been documented, along with the state liquor authority, so I just want to go on record. That license is currently under the old owners who have not been a part of this establishment. So Ralph I like to know. Why is it that SLA has not they denied the corporate change, so they renewed under the old owners is what they did, but the old owners are not no longer there Ralph, that's what I think they were in them. So there was a couple of things when I spoke with the SLA that they brought to my attention and they used, they just wanted to know exactly moving forward. What was gonna what was happening so I told him that we were gonna be meeting today and I need to follow up with the state look authority. I'm basically just stating that the owners that the names that are under the current license are not part. This new establishment, as per Mr Fuhrman, who just told me, there's him himself, a female name, I think he mentioned and Peter I, don't know if we ever met the female but she's not on record now with the state liquor authority. So that's what I need to figure out. I, don't know if there's anyone else for the sake of time, we should be moving on and you do have quorum of the executive officers and they are seeking a letter of profession. So I don't know how y' all want to move with this, but I don't know if there's anyone else that wants to speak, Maria, Taurean yeah, maybe Maria wants to speak, hey Maggie I'll get to Maggie Maria, not then we got to move on Maggie, Speaker, Maria, well, I would just say this just seems to be a lot of confusion about the ownership and there's a lot of moving parts that just don't add up in my opinion, so I feel like it. There needs to be more clarification before I'm comfortable with this moving forward in any way shape or form, because all the paperwork I've seen I, don't even see Mr Furman on it. You know, honestly, I've seen other names. I haven't even seen his. So it's just seems very you know, botched and confusing right. They're seeking a transfer is what they're seeking but they're seeking it with the same finance according to Mr Miller and Mr Fuhrman they're seeking it under the same financing background. The backers are the same individuals, so this is like honestly, they're getting us a second bite at the apple here. It's the same financial background people. They got denied once with someone, and now they have Mr Furman here who they're attempting to get the license on there. So Mr chairman, yes, I, don't know if you want to take an executive officers here now any questions I'm gonna, see. If Larry has any questions Larry, you got anything to say: no, that's it. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah, we can hear you no problem, okay, hello! This is Paul and Phil. Conyers I would like to have something to say yes, Paula to the two gentlemen that are presenting in reference to this license. I just feel so hurt and offended by your actions, because the simple fact we, the community, has worked very hard to reach that type of establishment in hunts point and to come back now in this time and to go for another license under whomever. It is whether it's you, whether you're front for somebody or whoever it is I, do not support and I will not ever support that type of business in my district, so I will take a moment from any of the executive board members that are online right now. Excuse me before you take a vote. May I just say a couple of things, because I take tremendous exceptions. Some of the things that was said towards this presentation number one never had the fact of what type of entertainment you propose for the premise number two I made it very clear that Mr, Forshetti and Mrs Fleisher had nothing to do with the premises except they supplied the funding for the previous applicants who filed for the the corporate change. We are not filing for corporate change. Mr Furman has been up front. He was security. He saw an opportunity. He went with the backers who were lending money who are trying to recruit the tremendous loss they've taken by trying to obtain the liquor license in their own name. So I take tremendous exception with the term front, with the terms of people that you don't know about you, you've, not addre. You keep saying that. There's no way that anyone can adequately supervise this premises, despite the fact that there can be nobody with more impeccable credentials than the Mr Furman. Who is going to be a part of the organization. Now he's not really going to be an employee when you, when you're putting your own funds and your own time into this thing, it's a big difference than being an employee, so you're going to do what you're going to do. How could you be saying to us that you're going to that he's putting up money and time all he's doing is putting up time? Sorry, do you have any idea of what this application is going to say you you've taken so many liberties with what is granted the premises had problems I hear this I understand what you're saying, but you're also saying that it is impossible for this type of operation to run in an orderly. Yes, fashion is you're not telling us anything different than what we had before. Okay I think. Can somebody remind me we gotta. Can somebody remind me exactly what is it that they're coming for you just remind me of no objection. Yes, Ms Cruz they're seeking a letter of no objection for a new license under Mr Fuhrman's name. Mr Miller am I correct with that yeah, it's a new application for on-premises, with a license for the premises. Yes right, okay, so make a motion that we do not provide that matter. Two seconds: okay, high. Second, at polar fields, Kanye's Paul, it's four seconds: okay, Ralph! How we Cynthia are you on? We have just the four officers here that are taking this vote, so we're already in one motion, one second and then there's now Larry. What's your vote? Larry I? Second, not to give him a letter- oh okay, so tomorrow I know all four unanimously I'll contact the state liquor up there. No I'm! Okay! Thank you! Oh he does. Okay, I find it somewhat condescending and paternalistic for council to say that you know that we don't know what this is going to bring when we have a history of this and I just want to make it clear, I, don't care if you've done everything by the book. We do not want these kinds of establishments in our neighborhoods. You want to put it in your backyard in your neighborhood go ahead, but we've dealt with this for years. We've dealt with the violence. We dealt with all this nonsense that comes with these kinds of establishments and we're just fed up with it and I don't care. If you've done everything correctly, we don't want it there and I reiterate I along I'm sure we councilman Salamanca and Kenny Burgos we're going to do everything we can to make sure that this application doesn't see the light of day. Thank you, Ralph all I want to say is to the state elected officials to Senator Sepulture to Kenny Virgos. We need you guys to send a letter to the state liquor authority, together with the councilman, who has been upfront with this particular establishment, since he was a district, the district manager and as a letter of objection to this particular license in any form, because they're not really with our councilman to handle this situation. For us, I've already set my my disapproval and if we want to do a joint letter with the state, electives and Councilman Salamanca, I'm prepared to do that either way, but they know already that I'm vehemently opposed to this establishment. Thank you. So much I think the councilman wanted to send a letter. Also yeah I mean no I appreciate the opportunity, but speak I have no problem. You know, I will be writing a letter and I think it would show more power if it's a joint letter with myself, the senator and the Assembly room assemblyman and we'll be working on that together. Thank you very much all right. So we voted on this item. So we're going to move on now on the agenda. I'm just going to give me a second.
