In in Argentina and seeing that there were electric mopeds everywhere and knowing that was also in the major cities around the world, a really convenient, easy, green way for people to get around.
You know, move slowly, trying to work very closely with communities with government as well to make sure that we're doing the right things, we're keeping everyone happy.
No there's no riding on bike lanes highways or sidewalks, so they're a little different than maybe some of the electric bicycles e-bikes that you've seen on the road they like I, said before they must park legally, which means on the street not on sidewalks.
We have a couple of stats here we like to share just about how people are actually using rebel, so 65 of the riders in New, York City say that they're replacing car share or personal car rides.
Revel is a good replacement for that, because we see our riders going on average three miles actually more, like 3.5 finals in the summer, and that's also the average car trip is three miles in New York City, as well.
Or we're actually seeing a lot of people using it to get from kind of the outer areas of the borough into job centers.
We also made sure to expand our service area because we thought it was really important to have hospitals included so that these essential workers could actually get to and from work.
If you look at the image, here, like those flags actually represent major hospitals in New, York City, that everybody under our health care program has been able to ride to.
You have one of those skiller ships or you're getting out of work at 12 a.m, one two three you're actually able to hop on a rebel and get home in a quick, way.
It's like I, don't mention before, because we use the public right, away, It's, really important for us to partner with the communities we work with, and the elected officials and NYPD.
There is a phone number right underneath the dashboard and we encourage community members to reach out and let us know we want to hear your complaint, so we can fix it.
That program is fast just because it's really hard to socially distance when you're trying to teach somebody how to ride a moped, but we do have in-app videos, That kind of will show you like what the moped is like, where you like how the throttle works, how to park all those things.
And we're working on a long-form video that will be available in the next couple of weeks for people to just kind of familiarize themselves, a little bit more and during peak demand, times, which is really when it's nice and sunny and warm.
So any issues honestly, please reach out, and let us know because, as I mentioned, We do want to fix it.
If you know anyone who lives in Brooklyn or Queens, where we've been for over a year, I, think we've built really strong relationships with community members.
And after they ride, and that thing as well, Okay, I think those are my questions.
And I think that Carol and Miguel should maybe try to link up when it, because Bobby is going to want to talk about hiring so.
And I, don't know if Carol mentioned, but our plans on opening it have been somewhat delayed because of coronavirus, right.
I mean I, don't know what kind of deliveries you can actually do on a moped, but just I think a community, a line of communication just to be good, neighbors and understand, I think Amazon.
Employees that live close by can take advantage of when they're leaving or maybe just coming right across the street, going in the moped and taking it.
You know parking it in a place where there's no alternate side, parking, You, know, but I think just reaching out to them and establishing being good neighbors with each other and then taking them there, and we can assist with you know, setting up or meeting with the our contacts over there at Amazon with Jessica.
If we can help our community to get around a little easier, I think that they and they're having they're opening up another site there in hunts point which is I, think another 200 employees, either Michael or Ralph knows the numbers on that on the new site, yeah they're gonna at 1080.
Don't know the actual number of employees, but I think that's been delayed.
If you have a car right, now, I think they'll go all the way upstate to Yonkers exactly have to go to the work.
We can follow up after this with the job postings and figure out a good way to get that word out and just like that, you know.
Another way that you might be able to get moving on your when you decide to open up, You know, people working in the Bronx may have to go to Queens or go up from this side of southern Boulevard.
They may have to go up to sound view and they don't want to take the bus or anything like that, so it, Yes, definitely, and my only last question is because you mentioned restaurants, and we don't have many restaurants here in the Bronx.
I don't have a date on when it's going to be open, just want to be fully transparent, but we are hiring in our Queens and our Brooklyn location and possibly also our Washington Heights location in the next little while, but eventually the Bronx will house at least 50 to 60 employees, all right.
So is that, like an insurance, issue, I believe it'd still be covered under the third party liability insurance, but just knowing you know, people, everyone's gonna get sued.
I also work at the point CDC, which is a another local nonprofit in the area, and we always looking at resiliency electric vehicles and trying to you know, reduce energy, and things like that.
And, how maybe you know, working together with our with the residents and things like that as well.
We can just suspend users, So if someone's you know riding on a sidewalk or running through red lights, or something like that call 911 and report them.
I think the Bp's office might want to come around and say that we have to have a public session, So we might have to just you know, to have a meeting and Cynthia's already working on the agenda stating that if you want to speak at public session, you have to provide the information beforehand.
Looking on the data, Everything comes up, So, it's negotiating with the city and the state where stuff like that, but they do break it down by zip codes right now, so they bring.
I'm gonna ask Jose to send you a pdf copy of that, and then there are also listed restaurants, that maybe we could you know, connect Revel to also when it comes to making deliveries.
