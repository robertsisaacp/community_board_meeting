The folks on the committee and city planning and HPD know all of our projects.
It closed at the end of August, and we and we're waiting for HPD, and then we opened the lottery because the mail was really slow and we had a huge number which I expected.
So I did not talk to Paula, but I went without the glasses worked up, because I know that her people were going to be much more on the paper applications and Bobby.
I was in touch with Ralph and Cynthia via email to make sure that everybody, you know if they were getting calls if they were getting outreach to make sure that that we were touching as many people as we possibly could from the community.
Again, it's my only concern, has been with everybody that everybody's been sending out the information during a major pandemic issue in the city of New York and in all true honesty, I, Don't think many people paid attention to those flyers or whatever.
We were left with three tenants: Il Forno, the Bronx brewery and and Bascom, and the brewery decided to step off all very good relations because they actually made a decision that they actually didn't want to brew beer, And so this is a production space.
At the end of like a huge amount of in time and money investment in El Forno, We actually came to a joint decision and a recommendation to them to Ramon that they should actually buy a building.
They right, now, rent, the building and they're, paying like twelve dollars a square foot, originally five dollars a square foot in space and have saved up a huge amount of money.
Actually, the pandemic we've been doing a huge outreach, We have hired, we've put it out through all types of food media outlets, and we have probably over a dozen to 15 interested tenants.
Okay, So you know that's why I'm asking for you to chime in so like this, Because I know that it was something that somebody wanted to have a discussion on coming back, but I didn't know what it was for.
You might want to put who's going to talk for one b, ble I, please I, don't know who's talking.
I also know that for building 1b, the DOB has visited the 1b site two times now to check for Covid-19 compliance and both of those visits.
I know, we've got a hundred guys on site.
Yep bye, all right, well, Bobby will definitely be sure to get you the numbers and keep you up to date on local hiring for both sites.
Yes, Paula is asking questions as far as Covid-19 they're doing in both 1a and 1b measures on site.
I'll do that now, Okay, well, I want to make sure that Ralph gets all the all the numbers and addresses to these companies like to see who they are we'll get all the addresses and names to Ralph.
I, don't know if anyone else has anything they want to say we have one.
So I, don't know how y' all want to proceed with this any nays on the any names from the committee members to adjourn all right, there.
