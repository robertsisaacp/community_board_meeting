So Mr Fermin is a former police official who has about 27 years with the New York City Police department, and intends to have a very extensive security plan in place.
In terms of how this premises will be run, We supplied you with that security plan and Mr Fermin is here to answer whatever questions you might have with respect to the type of operation that will be conducted within the premises at all times.
There was an application filed with the New York State liquor.
That's what is before you there's a new corporate entity known as Pam hunts, Point Avenue Corp, and that is what is going to apply with the New York State liquor, authority.
Nothing has changed here, except that it went from one entity that the state liquor authority denied and I was going under Mr Fuhrman's name, no it.
And Mr Mike Diaz presented a letter to the board approximately a year and a half ago, stating that he is the principal right.
I, worked closely with NYPD to shut down topless entertainment bars that we had in hunts point because of the violence that was coming out of these clubs and the issue of prostitution and just overall, You know a negative effect on our quality of life.
I would write a letter to the state, liquor authority and I urge the community board too to to deny this application.
I really don't know how why you're, even applying for an application, given that Covid-19 the city's, not the state and the city, is not even going to allow you to open up, and.
You know, I, just I, I'm, just curious to why you know your partner's so adamant to open up given with the endemic that we're in and the state's not going to allow you to open up.
And what we're trying to present here is a 27-year veteran of the New York City Police department that can run a proper establishment, and it's just saying that per se.
There you know within the law he can file an application, but my questioning here, is, like I understand, he's a veteran for 28 years, I'm, going to tell you my experience as a district manager for Bronx community board.
They were going to be in charge of security and the community board.
Pursuant to my conversations with the general account with the council for the state liquor authority, you know, I'm gonna make this as simple as possible in our communities.
We want our kids, our families, that no matter where they travel throughout hunts point in that area that they have a sense of pride, because we people who have lived here for many years have attempted to bring establishments and business and economic development.
Thank you, man now I can tell you, along with Councilman Salamanca, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that you don't see the light of day with this application.
So I want to make sure that in that regard, we are we're taking initiative to make sure that establishments like these are being not being in this community, but also put something very impactful for our kids to follow.
So Mr Furman a year ago, when you came before the board or before the committee, you were only going to do security.
That's all well and good, but, as my district manager has stated before the one and the councilman has stated major problems, and then you just heard the sergeant here that there's major problems going on because of this type of establishment.
First of all, worst of all, a year, ago, I told you and the four individuals that were with you that day that we had female girls were going to school, stopping board members and asking us that what kind of establishment that is and what kind of how could that be such a great establishment for the community.
And I, don't know how in God's name, this application has come up before the state liquor authority because they have all the documentation.
That's going on in the hunts point area, all the new housing.
You did not know people's names you're trying to hide information, I, don't trust what you're saying we don't want this in the neighborhood.
Ralph I just want to make sure that we're on record that, because right now the license is under the old owners that we know are no longer a part of this establishment and they have not for quite some time since at least 2017, Since 2017 they've been attempting to do a corporate change and has been denied, but I just want to go on record that Lucian and this other individual, the two individuals that licensed it was just renewed, and it's nothing to do with these individuals now Mr Furman and his partners.
This new establishment, as per Mr. Fuhrman, who just told me, there's him himself, a female name, I think he mentioned.
So, Mr, chairman, yes, I, don't know if you want to take an executive officers here now any questions I'm gonna.
I just feel so hurt and offended by your actions, because the simple fact we, the community, has worked very hard to reach that type of establishment in hunts point and to come back now in this time and to go for another license under whomever.
Okay I think, Yes, Ms, Cruz they're, seeking a letter of no objection for a new license under Mr Fuhrman's name.
