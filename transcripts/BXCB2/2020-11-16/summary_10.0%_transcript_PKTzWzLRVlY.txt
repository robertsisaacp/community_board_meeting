We just want to apply for the liquor license just to provide if they want a wine or beer while they're eating.
We are opening the side, which is another location, So we want to do like a private party event, but the most it fits.
She told me that it was just wine and beer, but we actually want to apply for the full liquor license if possible.
I'm, sorry Mr Chris, but we can only entertain what was submitted to us by the state liquor authority, So we're only looking at beer and wine.
Also I, don't know how it's going to work with the 25% capacity, So, if you're at 60, if your capacity misses 60 people you're, actually not going to be able to have 60 people inside because right now, the city ordinance is 25.
She just stated that she wants a full liquor license and.
I want to re-emphasize that Covid-19 is very much a problem, not just this city, but in our community, and it's not really the right moment for us to be thinking of expanding a species where people congregate so as much as possible.
You know one of the challenges that we have in the state budget and the city budget is the ability to provide funding for our safety net programs such as the food pantries, such as supportive services and so on, and so forth, and in order for the city of New York and the state to provide these services, We depend on these businesses to pay taxes so that we in return can turn around and we can pay for these services.
You know this is a small business, That's providing food and, at the end of the day, they're, going to generate more tax revenue so that we can pay for our food pantries and provide for safety net services that we need in our communities.
Just saying that I personally believe that at this point in time, we need to be a little bit careful on how we expand some of these businesses either in approving or renewing licenses.
We've got a few places in the board that are not complying and sergeant top of us, letting us know and, as a matter of fact, making one particular location, they're planning to close it down because of them not complying and becoming a nuisance to the community.
I don't want to keep beating a dead horse, but I would like to see you know, especially in that area where, across the street.
None of the locations ever know whether it's a restaurant, a bar or a nightclub.
I sent the board the the renewal 30-day notice, I'm on file with the New York State liquor, authority.
I was the attorney that did his original liquor license application two years, ago.
Basically, a liquor license with their wine right, now, tier one.
Okay, So I, don't think anybody here is all right.
They, just because as of right now, the license is issued under the old owners and I wanted to go on record with Mr Fuhrman and his attorney that the old owners are no longer at this location.
And I'm going to send that to the state liquor authority, so they can have it on record, So there won't be like minutes.
In case you want to know we're going to get a flyer passing around October 30th at 3.
