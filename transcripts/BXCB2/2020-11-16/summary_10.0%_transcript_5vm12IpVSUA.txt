You want mute, yourself, okay, all right, I, guess we're gonna get started with Amazon.
Know, really great conversations here about our locations there in the Bronx and really excited about the meeting here.
We thought we would start with just a quick update on what's going on at dnj3 or what we call dnj3, which is our delivery station in hunts point which Brad and I can give you.
How many 400 and 450 people directly employed by Amazon, and these individuals are getting all at least 15 an hour, if not more, Medical dental vision, paid, leave, 401K life, insurance, basically, the same benefits package that Brad, Christie or Pj or myself get so the same that we give our corporate executives and they, you know, are working hard to deliver packages in addition to those 450 full-time associates.
We, don't expect those numbers to change much because we're basically running the site at full capacity because of Covid-19 I, don't know Brad.
We appreciate the support, Ralph and Chairman Crespo that you guys have given us that yeah with the hiring events and being able to broedcast that through the community board, that's been a great effort and great level of engagement.
You know I think one of the things that we want to do now with Christy and Pj and Board is talk about how we can engage through you guys on our efforts there in the Bronx and what they're going to be looking to accomplish so.
Our, Amazon logistics business is our last mile delivery, business operating there in hunts, point and other places in the city and around the country and about I think in May or sorry.
We've come up with some guiding principles that help us focus on the types of outreach and the types of organizations that we want to support in the communities where we have operations, but ultimately we're really driven by a hyper local focus.
You know he outlined the work we're doing operationally and our goal really is that you know at the end of the day, You guys feel that we're being a good neighbor and that you like having us in your neighborhood and some of the ways that we've this even the last few weeks been engaging with communities in the Bronx, and then you know, certainly in throughout the five boroughs.
Or you know, doing a lot more school work from home and having to stay plugged into a computer.
And, if you can I understand, and the reason why I'm asking is because you know we have people in the community that are in need of employment.
A lot of a big need in this city, and especially in this area, is a lot of our kids are just in terms of internet Wi-Fi in their homes, I mean Amazon, be able to give hot spots for these kids to be able to do online schooling, or even for the schools to distribute amongst the local schools here in the 104 in the peninsula, as well as whether it's computers.
Sorry I just wanted to follow up on the previous question, because I found those old, emails.
It looks like, and this again was backed in late January, So obviously, things may have changed, but from the zip codes immediately surrounding the hunts point area about 81 or around you, know, close to around 15 percent of our associates, are from there.
This is again updated information because you know there's turnover, but I just wanted to make sure you guys have the latest and we're happy to look into that.
We will work with them and they will identify lots and say all right, we're going to do a short-term lease with that lot, and so, Therefore they may not come directly through Amazon.
Within, this meeting, I'm trying to think I had another question: did you guys are also not necessari.
Process, just correct, It's basically, You know our grocery delivery service that we're looking at for that location, so it wouldn't operate.
A lot of them are gassing up right across the street, from the Mcdonald's on garrison, but for the most part, I have not heard any major complaints, which is a good thing to hear that you have 450 employees and viele plus another 500, drivers.
So you know if you could just reach out if Amazon could reach with and partner with the pals and the casita Maria's in the district that house and do a lot of work with the students in the district.
I know that we were told today that you guys were having some break-ins on some of your trucks in hunts.
Ability to help us engage with the 401 was also really helpful in the midst of the pandemic, and you know, unfortunately, When there was the riots and some of the things going on the relationship, you guys helped us establish there.
Actually, We had a report come through from the precinct that there might be an incident where they were targeting our trucks heading out of hunts point, and so we were able to shut down the facility, get everyone safely out of the location and get and make sure that our employees and our drivers were not put in harm's way, and it was really great.
They have a whole, their whole team here, So I really appreciate the efforts that they made and following up with whatever they can assist in their community, like what Madam Chair had mentioned.
I am with the New York City Parks Department, and I'm, going to talk to you today about a capital project for a dock replacement at hunts.
You'll help you out with any questions you might have, but then we'll need a letter of no objection from the community board for us to move forward with permitting.
Like I, said reconstruction of the floating dock at hunts, Point Riverside park, which is, if you're not familiar at the end of Lafayette Avenue, I'm, the project manager, I'm, the deputy director for Marina infrastructure for the Parks department, it's being designed in-house by one of our in-house engineers.
We want to repair and also there's an environmental problem with the dock design that has to be fixed for permitting purposes.
This is the only place it's going to work, but we think we have the funds to do it.
They, don't have that problem of cramming them in between the pilings, and we think that engineering-wise that works, fine, which was good for rocking the boat, the operator, but also for anyone who wants to pull up a kayak or a rowing skull or whatever they don't have a nice flat ice to work.
I. Don't think this project will take that long, But that means that the completion time would be fall of 2022.
You, like I, just want to say, Madam chair that you don't have quorum in your committee, Although we have three executive, offices, I, don't know how you want to handle that before we have any questions or if anyone starts to make a motion, there's no quorum for the committee.
A letter of support would be great too, but some just something letting us know that this community board has no issue with the project, So we can move into our permitting.
If, there's background noise, This is Nate Grove, I'm, the chief of waterfront and marine operations for New York City parks, I, appreciate that concern expressed I responded directly to the Starlight Park tragedy losing track of the years, but maybe five six years ago, and we we did a lot of thinking a lot of discussions, a lot of engagement with all interested parties.
Being you know, kind of like a kiddie pool that, if a kid wanders off a toddler that there's a gate there, that they can't, they can't open themselves a toddler, but but ultimately, the rule of protecting our waterfronts is that people need to be able to get out as well.
We obviously have in concrete plant park where people just go in the water, regardless whether you have a dock there or not are kind of some of those challenge sites as well and.
You know it's I, think it's one of the best things we can do to ensure safety along our waterfronts.
Okay, thanks and nice to hear from you, Mike, I'm, just trying to think you know the other concern with that doc in the previously was I know under hurricane Sandy.
It should work as as designed it should be able to go all the way to the top of the pile and back down in the event of something like Sandy.
You know it's hard to stop perfectly storm, proof: everything and a lot cheaper to probably replace a dock and to make it impervious to every kind of weather, event.
So then, in a week and a half correct, all right, so I would say you know if Miguel has no concerns on this project.
I'm, not sure what they can do about prostitution outside of the park, but I'll speak to them and let them know that something's going on.
I mean I, see them come out of there in the morning as well, and so I, don't know.
So I, don't know if they're running a cluster site on the low, but a lot of these guys do come out of that building in the morning.
And I know you might want to give us an update on.
You know tree pits and things like that for the next day.
Like your question, Ralph well, Maria, I'm, sorry, First of all, I, don't know about enforcement, but you got guys.
And I know in the past, we've had meetings with the bid and the 4-1, and we really hashed out exactly what we wanted to see get enforced on the boulevard and what we were kind of okay with letting go, right.
I think a lot of times before food vendors were okay, People said fine, but.
So I, don't want to know I'm not trying to meet that.
Okay, So it's something that chairman Crespo was mentioning Myles and it was like you said before you came on, but I think you really need to revisit is division, zero policy where you're not gonna, allow any street vendors on the bid.
Okay, just we'll have to follow up because you I in order for me, You know Bobby wants me to have a meeting, but we've got to tell you the whole purpose.
So during difficult, times, I think it's been a good way to not only show the bit all the businesses within the bid that you know we're here, we're back on here.
So I think he just didn't want to be Sl. We're having another cleanup day in November, earn sorry in October, Okay, I got you.
Don't want you to feel that this is a committee that you don't want to come and present to, and we will you know we always try to have that.
