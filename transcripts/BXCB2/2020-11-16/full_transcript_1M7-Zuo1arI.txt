In in Argentina and seeing that there were electric mopeds everywhere and knowing that was also in the major cities around the world, a really convenient, easy, green way for people to get around and they thought hey. You know why doesn't this exist in Brooklyn? We could desperately use something like this, and so they started with a very small pile of 68 mopeds in a couple of neighborhoods in 2018. We as a company, try- and you know, move slowly- trying to work very closely with communities with government as well to make sure that we're doing the right things we're keeping everyone happy. So they started a small pilot and then in 2019 moved to a much bigger expansion from with a thousand mopeds from Astoria down to Sunset Park and then today, what we'll talk about is kind of the expansions we've done in the last couple of months and how we've ended up in your neighborhood. So rebels are fully street legal vehicles, they operate and they park on the street. So there no there's no riding on bike lanes highways or sidewalks, so they're a little different than maybe some of the electric bicycles e-bikes that you've seen on the road they like I, said before they must park legally, which means on the street not on sidewalks. They park parallel to the perpendicular to the curve, with the rear wheel to the curve, and it takes about three feet of space, not a lot. It's way cheaper than a rideshare service. So it's really great for commuting and they're 100 electric, so we're not adding to noise pollution or just like overall emissions with these vehicles. So a couple of the rules and regulations around it. We require all of our users to be over the age of 21 years old. That's just a company policy. We want people to have a couple years of driving experience under their belts. You must have a valid driver's license. That's a New York state rule. In order to operate one of these vehicles, each one of the rebels comes with two department of transportation. Certified helmets and all of the safety equipment is also mandated by the New York State. Dmv as well with every ride, so when you get on a Revel and start your ride, you're automatically covered by third-party liability insurance, it's not an additional adder. It comes with the ride and every moped is throttled at 29 miles per hour. That speed is also set by the New York State Dmv, and it's just kind of fast enough to keep up with city traffic, which is at 25 miles an hour. So these slides will kind of give you an overview of what the app looks like. So everything works through the app is really the key to the moped. So if you were to go through the sign up process first, you need a couple of things. So a driver's license a debit or credit card and a selfie just to verify that the person is actually opening up the account and the image right here. You'll see this is a map of our current service area, so your neighborhood is included in here and if you zoom in a little bit more you'll, see these blue and black dots. Those are the actual mopeds that are around you. So if you were to click on that, they will show you the license plate. What the battery life is on, that particular moped and how far away it is from you. So it's just some things about like the way that it works, starting with starting and ending rides. So rebels are available in the outlying zones, which are like the lighter highlights in the indie map and all the rides must start and end there. So it's essentially a parking map. However, if you wanted to go like let's say further north from where you are up throughout our service area, you could and you would be able to park, to pause your ride. So you wouldn't be able to end your ride, but you could pause it. You will still be charged for the time that is lost, but then you can hop back on your vehicle and go back into the zone. It's a free floating system, which means you don't have to worry about. Finding a charging station or a dock. You just park anywhere with their street parking and for parking, there's, obviously no parking by fire, hydrants meters, no standing zones or within 24 hours of alternate side rules. So it's pretty much like a car in that way. Please. So we have a couple of stats here we like to share just about how people are actually using rebel, so 65 of the riders in New, York City say that they're replacing car share or personal car rides. Revel is a good replacement for that, because we see our riders going on average three miles actually more, like 3.5 finals in the summer, and that's also the average car trip is three miles in New York City as well. So it's actually a good replacement for that, whereas you'll see bikes and e-scooters in other markets, average trip distance is more like one mile or two miles. It is a good way or we're actually seeing a lot of people using it to get from kind of the outer areas of the borough into job centers and so we're seeing 27. A quarter of our rides are ending or starting in job centers. A lot of people particularly are using them in transportation deserts to get to places of work. We also each Revel when it's fully charged can go up to 60 miles, which is pretty far so we see people take kind of leisure trips down to Coney, Island or to city island just for the day to go to the beach and get out of the city and the hustle and the bustle, and we also see about 80 percent of our rise. Our solo rides. You can accommodate a person on the back, and so we do sometimes see couples traveling around together. That's typically the most common two rider use cases for couples, but because you can travel alone, it's becoming more and more in the coronavirus crisis, a way for people to commute on their own or even just to get out. It's becoming a thing to do, because you know you can't go to the movie theater, you can't go to a restaurant or a bar, and so people are using ripple just to get outside and explore the city. Please survival really because of this crisis has truly become an essential transportation service. So in March of 2020 we announced free rides, so healthcare workers and first responders, and that program has been incredibly successful. We have over 2,000 different individuals under that subscription type and this traveled over 55,000 miles. We also made sure to expand our service area because we thought it was really important to have hospitals included so that these essential workers could actually get to and from work. So if you look at the image here, like those flags actually represent major hospitals in New, York City, that everybody under our health care program has been able to ride to in April, we decided to partner with local restaurants and provide them with unlimited 30-day membership, so they can actually move over to being a delivery only service. So, as you know, restaurants are limited now to just take out a delivery, but a lot of them just didn't, have the infrastructure to do those deliveries or had to pay 30, plus percent to an uber ease or postmates in order to make those deliveries happen, so we partnered with them. We've actually extended that partnership. All the way through June 1st so like our 25 partners, are have all stayed on board with us and they're really happy with the service, and we just did a post check with them over, like 70 of them, said that it's been a tremendous financial help. So we're really proud of that and then may 2020 we with the closure of the subway overnight. We just made the service 24 7. So now, if you're going to work- and you have one of those skiller ships or you're getting out of work at 12 a.m, one two three you're actually able to hop on a rebel and get home in a quick way. It's safe traveling alone, and it's reliable next time, please so something that our company did all the way from the beginning of when we were founded. Is we created a 40 discount for any individuals who are participating in public assistance programs so including people who live in NYCHA housing or any local state or federal assistance program, and so far we've saved riders over 125,000, which is pretty great. We also like to partner a company with local organizations like ace, if you've heard of them or Brooklyn workforce innovations to train and hire individuals who are disadvantaged and re-entering or trying to re-enter the workforce. So we have a couple programs with them as well. It's like I, don't mention before, because we use the public right away. It's really important for us to partner with the communities we work with, and the elected officials and NYPD just everybody is happy with the service and they understand what we're trying to do. So. We work with NYPD to kind of educate them on what the vehicle is, so they feel comfortable when they see a writer. Perhaps fighter didn't stop at a red light and they know that it's a fully legal vehicle, so they can actually implement the law with our elected officials who he you see here, Salamanca and Vanessa Gibson, just letting them know who we are. What we're trying to accomplish in the Bronx and this this right here is a proclamation by a speaker of the House Corey Johnson and we're really happy. He welcomed us to Brooklyn as a green transportation. Alternative so also from the beginning, our founders decided that they didn't want to use the gig economy a lot of micro mobility. Companies rely really heavily on the gig economy to service their fleet. We decided that everyone who worked for Revel would actually be an employee, so they have access to health care benefits the same health care benefits. The CEO has access to as well as paid vacation and paid sick leave as well, because there isn't kind of an existing workforce of people who understand electric mopeds because they're new. We also do a lot of on-the-job training for our employees and we have a rebel rangers program where, if we get any complaints from the community, there's mopa that's parked illegally. It's in my driveway. It's blocking my I'm trying to get out of a parking spot and I can't get out of the parking spot, we'll be there within 30 to 45 minutes just to fix the issue. So, on the last slide, you'll see our phone number, but also on every Revel. There is a phone number right underneath the dashboard and we encourage community members to reach out and let us know we want to hear your complaint, so we can fix it. We can make it right absolutely and, along with that, it's really important for us for people to be safe, not only riders, but people on the street. So every single mob comes with two helmets in the back, so a larger one and a smaller one, and these are required by New York state assaults by rebels. So if we get any photos or just phone calls, emails from anybody saying, hey, like I, saw x, moped at 2:17 p.m, crossing whatever boulevard will actually call that user and we'll suspend that account, because it's really important that safety is the number one priority so like. This is something that we have no tolerance for. We do offer lessons out of our Gowanus HQ seven days a week. You can go online and just reserve a spot and we'll have a group lesson right now. That program is fast just because it's really hard to socially distance when you're trying to teach somebody how to ride a moped, but we do have in-app videos. That kind of will show you like what the moped is like where you like how the throttle works, how to park all those things and we're working on a long-form video that will be available in the next couple of weeks for people to just kind of familiarize themselves a little bit more and during peak demand times, which is really when it's nice and sunny and warm. We do pop-up lessons. So if there's a group of like three four people, the same hunts porn will actually go to you and set that set the lesson out. Please so yeah! That's the end! That's our contact information right there customer support number sporting, gorilla.com Orchestra support team is 24 7. they're located right here in New, York City. So any issues honestly please reach out, and let us know because, as I mentioned, we do want to fix it and we're new to your neighborhood. But if you know anyone who lives in Brooklyn or Queens, where we've been for over a year, I think we've built really strong relationships with community members. We recognize that Revel is using the public right of way, and so it's not just for users that we care about. It's also everybody else who's using the same streets, and if you called me actually pick up I had a couple of instances this morning where I was trying to call a couple of companies and I couldn't find the number so just something that is really I, think a highlight for us yeah. So we're happy to take some questions. Go ahead, Maria I'll! Let you go first. Okay, yeah I had a couple of questions here. So I know you mentioned that you had discounts for people on assistance and or you know in NYCHA. But what is your regular like fee for it? How does that work? And then you said that you had lessons coming out of at Acronis. Do you plan to especially you know when we're off of lockdown? Do you plan to do have any in the Bronx or close to a little bit closer and then the last one is about charging, and you mentioned that dude. You know people aren't responsible for charging, but how does those get charged and do you take them to there to get? You know? How does that work sure? So your first question on pricing: it's typically a dollar to start to unlock the moped and then 31 cents per minute. If you're in the access program, you receive 40 off that total, so it becomes really like 18 cents per minute, so it's quite affordable that way in terms of charging the way that we do charging, we don't have stations. What we do is like we have our full-time staff that actually goes around and they swap batteries so like the moped doesn't have to go anywhere. It can stay exactly where it is. The battery will be swapped by a team member and that's pretty much it like the user doesn't have to do anything on their end. Yeah and just add on the lessons piece. We are planning on hosting lessons in the Bronx. Also upper Manhattan and in Queens as well, once we get off lockdown, okay and oh then I just had a another quick question with the helmet. You know, because now you know you got to be crazy about everything, but to clean the helmets you know or to make sure that everything stays kind of clean. You have people come out and do that periodically as well or is that something each new rider? And it should, you know, handle themselves or something we yeah. We definitely clean them. We've always cleaned them. It's really important for that to be clean because they're shared, and so we did ramp that up, though, in a much more detailed way when coronavirus started and so we're using. You know, CDC approved disinfectants for the helmets, the visor, the strap, as well as every high touch surface on the moped itself. We also offer, in the helmet case, you'll find disposable hair nets that are there, that you can use and you can throw them out and we're looking to also getting kind of disposable wipes, just kind of sanitizing wipes. That will also be in the case as well, but we do also encourage our riders to follow CDC directions so clean, like wash their hands before and after they ride, and that thing as well. Okay, I think those are my questions. I don't know if anybody else has any I'll mute myself, I think Bobby does, but I just want to acknowledge that we were joined by Miguel Carson, who oversees one of our job centers in the district. So I'm happy that Miguel is here and I think that Carol and Miguel should maybe try to link up when it, because Bobby is going to want to talk about hiring so and I know you missed the presentation you go, I can forward you the presentation itself and I think maybe after the questions are asked, we can do a two to three minute briefing: a rECAB on it just for you, okay, so just bear with us. Thank you very much. My apologies for joining later I was at another meeting, but thank you for joining us Miguel and thank you for the presentation both to you. It was a good presentation, but before Laura got on I think we were I was asking: what is the length of your lease on that property? The Bronx warehouse? Yes, three years, yeah, okay, and are you expecting to move it someplace else after three years or no that's just kind of our typical lease agreement? Is we try and do three years for every property we have and I, don't know if Carol mentioned, but our plans on opening it have been somewhat delayed because of coronavirus right. So unfortunately, it's not open. Yet we are looking at possibly opening a much smaller warehouse in Washington Heights and we are hiring right now for for Queens and Brooklyn locations. So how many schools are we planning to have in the Bronx location? We don't have a final number right now, but we do recognize that right now there aren't enough for the density, So, council, member Salamanca actually called us yesterday and said: can you please split more because he and his team really enjoy riding them? We're a little bit delayed. Everything is delayed because of coronavirus, but but we will be putting more there in the next little while I. Just don't have specifics yet, but when you're coming up to you, I'm sorry, so our goal is to have a Revel within a three to five minute: walk of everyone who wants to ride them. That's our target goal. Okay, and when you get online in the Bronx warehouse, how many workers are you planning to have there about 50 to 60 and that will service the entire city? It's a little bit, because it's free floating they'll probably do the Bronx as well as possibly northern Manhattan as well as possible, possibly northern Queens as well. So it's just kind of like where the demand is and where the batteries are discharged, where they need to be serviced. Okay and you're, saying the insurance is third party insurance right all right, so that means you guys are gonna, be charging the insurance yeah, it's third-party liability insurance. So if, if you're on a rebel and you damage someone else's property or injure somebody, you call our customer support line and our customer support walks you, through on how to file an insurance claim all right ed. Let me ask you, since you're Cr I, believe you're across the street from Amazon yeah right around there. Have you had any discussions with Amazon on their delivery service programs with you guys we haven't? No, should we talk to them? I think that was a concern that Ralph had one time am I correct, though not a concern, I mean I, don't know what kind of deliveries you can actually do on a moped, but just I think a community, a line of communication just to be good, neighbors and understand, I think Amazon. Employees that live close by can take advantage of when they're leaving or maybe just coming right across the street, going in the moped and taking it home. You know parking it in a place where there's no alternate side parking and that's their end of their responsibility with it. You know, but I think just reaching out to them and establishing being good neighbors with each other and then taking them there, and we can assist with you know, setting up or meeting with the our contacts over there at Amazon with Jessica yeah. That would be fantastic. That was fantastic, that'd, be great, thank you yeah and if you need contact names or whatever I think Ralph can help you with that on that side. So I think that and it's good because even we believe in the walk to work pro policy or who believes in that. But if we can help our community to get around a little easier, I think that they and they're having they're opening up another site there in hunts point which is I, think another 200 employees, either Michael or Ralph knows the numbers on that on the new site, yeah they're gonna at 1080, Leggett they're going to be doing their like whole foods and, like they're, you know all similar to fresh direct I. Don't know the actual number of employees, but I think that's been delayed. Also, maybe Miguel might know, but I can follow up with that and they can speak directly with Jessica with that anyway, okay and I only have two more other questions and I think one of them I already know because I see his face when you put down the whole program, I'm assuming that was Mike Miguel. Yes, when you in your presentation on your presentation, I think the page before this one. You had shown that you work you with a hope. Where is it not this one, yeah I, don't think that's done, I believe you've been in contact with our colleague, Daniela and she's kind of leading okay go Miguel. Are you familiar with this? Can you I can hear the audio? Can you show me the page? Yes right here but I think it's the whole program, which is the form of sustainable soft Bronx yeah that project? That's not us exactly project class right, the sustainable part, the whole program, sustainable funds- yes, okay! So just like that, you know Miguel helps out in the at the community, but he's also a member of the Eco Committee, but he also helps out in doing from job fairs. So you know with your 50 or 60 people that you're planning to hire. He might be a person you may want to talk to it's like that. He could probably help you with that stuff. Also yeah 100. Absolutely do you think that there's people in your community who would be willing to commute to Queens and it's for the time being? Yes, yeah, okay I feel like Massmut is not that far. Maybe if you have a car right now, I think they'll go all the way upstate to Yonkers exactly have to go to the work exactly we have an organization in Queens that does work with direct support and we've. We we've had clients that are that'll. Tell us that's why Mr Quest was absolutely right in this day and age. I've gotten so many phone calls for people that are looking for work, they'll travel. They have to travel, they'll travel, okay, awesome! We can follow up after this with the job postings and figure out a good way to get that word out and just like that, you know. Miguel's program is sponsored by one of our biggest employers in board, two, which is urban health plan, and they got sites I think just about throughout the city. That's right! That's another way that you might be able to get moving on your when you decide to open up. You know, people working in the Bronx may have to go to Queens or go up from this side of southern Boulevard. They may have to go up to sound view and they don't want to take the bus or anything like that, so it you know it might help out on your promotions on this on this new venture. Yes, definitely, and my only last question is because you mentioned restaurants, and we don't have many restaurants here in the Bronx. First of all, can you give us a list of the restaurants that you guys are working with like that? We could see, and is there any in board two that you're working with yeah I can take that. So we have a list of 25 restaurants and I. Can it's hard for me to remember all the names off the top of my head, but I can follow up after this meeting with the list of all our New York partners, and we don't have any partners in CB2 at this moment. Well, there might be a person, I, don't know if he he's willing to, but there's a other city tamales very good yeah. Oh, that's video I'll, look into it and I'll reach out yeah. They do a lot of deliveries, and so maybe you know I, don't know if they're using grubhub or whoever they're using, but if you're easier for them. Maybe that might be something that you might want to look at. You know my thing is that I'm my main goal as Ralph knows: Maria and Megan who've been with around for a long time. My goal has always been as much jobs as I can create in community board too the better. It is for community board too to have new industries come in and this is totally new to our community. So whatever we can do to help out, I know that the councilman has driven some of these a few times already and I, see that he's still walking so I know that he's not there's no legs to break or anything, and if the, if he broke the machine, don't charge it to us. But the truth of the matter is that's my job to create as many jobs as I. Can that's why I said? Maybe you can use Miguel to do your outreach for the jobs Ralph can help you out with with Amazon Rob can also help you with even Siri Tomales. He can help you out with they're very good, and I've eaten a couple of times already so they're really great and they're, not that far from you guys, I think right, rob high five they're on their own point, they're on their block in and they're closer to Chase Bank. So that's down by long, not long fellow, by fail they're right across the street from Chase Bank on Oak point so yeah we can I can say Israel, okay, that was my. Those were my questions and thank you for being helpful on this. Let me see. I just had a quick question as well: I mean I missed a little bit of the beginning, but about how many people are you looking to employ with this warehouse here in the Bronx yeah? So the Bronx is unfortunately delayed. I don't have a date on when it's going to be open, just want to be fully transparent, but we are hiring in our Queens and our Brooklyn location and possibly also our Washington Heights location in the next little while, but eventually the Bronx will house at least 50 to 60 employees all right. Thank you. That's the other thing, though Maria has the other hat, which is our local EDC in the hunts point area and import Community Board too so she's. She wears a couple of hats just quickly. I know you said they have to be over the 21, correct yeah. How would you verify their nature residents so so there's a link that Carol can share with you guys as well, but it's on our website. So after you sign up, you go to the website and you upload any proof that you're living in night show housing or, if you're, on snap benefits or anything we're pretty flexible with the proof, that's provided, and then our customer support team manually, reviews it and says okay yeah, and then they apply that discount to your account great now, I have some silly stuff here, I'm on one of your mopeds and I'm crossing the Throgs Net bridge who's paying for the toe, so the Throgs neck bridge is actually you're not allowed on the frog's neck Throgs neck, because if the speed limit is too high, so you can only go 30 miles an hour. So it'd be pretty dangerous. So probably, if you get that you get a phone call from our customer support and they would they might suspend you for a short little while you'll be able to send me on the bridge with customer support, yeah going to be told you go back to the user as well as parking tickets, red light tickets. All of that goes back to the user. Okay. Now we're talking about also linking up with some of the small businesses for deliveries. My question now is regarding your insurance, you're, primarily passengers. So if a company is using it for deliveries, would that fall under the company's insurance? Because now the moped is not a pleasure right, they're actually conducting business with it. So is that, like an insurance issue, I believe it'd still be covered under the third party liability insurance, but just knowing you know, people everyone's gonna get sued. If something else happens, that's what people like to do is allow everybody's name to the lawsuit but yeah. The third party liabilities will cover it. Okay sounds great I, don't know if Cynthia Danielle has any other questions Maria. Thank you so much yeah. How old does the passenger have to be because we do have a lot of parents and that are very daring to put younger kids on that's a great question: yeah go ahead Carol. We actually require the passenger to be 18 years old. So if you see like a five-year-old six-year-old, you should definitely call our customer service because that's not allowed okay, I need to say this was also accessible in up in Manhattan. Right. Is that east and West side correct so anywhere north at 65th street, so it like totally connects and you can go all the way and there's like smaller bridges that will connect to the Bronx. So those are fine as well. Okay, how about you going into the queen? So right now, if you are in the Bronx or in Manhattan, you can not travel to Queens or Brooklyn, but if you are in Queens, you can go to Brooklyn if you're in Manhattan, you wouldn't belong, so that you should bother us through separate systems. Okay, cool! Thank you. So much is that, because of the bridge correct exactly now, we don't allow any major bridges so for now, they're, just operating kind of separately, otherwise you'd be floating with the fishes. We don't want that. So we're not here we're not there. Yet I have a hat, for that, maybe is if we do the Randalls island connector to get to Randall's island right, and then you maybe special person today, who said that to me and I hadn't thought about it before today, so I'm gonna look into it. I found the hack, yes, connector, that'll get us right there, okay, great any other questions. I mean this sounds exciting. I mean you know from the as they mentioned. I'm also I also work at the point CDC, which is a another local nonprofit in the area, and we always looking at resiliency electric vehicles and trying to you know, reduce energy, and things like that. So this is something that is very interesting to us as well. So I guess. The next thing is having access to the presentation. If we had a pdf of that and I just guess, keeping in touch you guys are already in the area like the bikes are around already so I haven't seen any yet, but again, I haven't left my house. Yes, they are in your area for sure and we're happy to provide a pdf of the presentation. We're probably going to have to make board two one of the stations, because this was Danielle can get on it after the meeting and go home a lot faster sure. Thank you, Bobby, that's not a problem! I'll forward it to Cynthia I, think I can send it out to you guys and then Carol I'll follow up with Jessica from Amazon, with the email introduction to you and Lauren, and then you know y' all can take it from there perfect thanks so much and on my behalf, I want to thank you guys really for the presentation and taking the time out to show us. The best part is that it's not gas, it's electric, it doesn't give no emissions to the area, which is one of the biggest fights we have with all the other trucks in the area, and so it's a great project and I know that the councilman has chewed my ear off a little on how great it is and how convenient it is. So I'm sure it'll work. Oh one last question: I meant to ask what happens at overnight when you park it you take and the person decides to leave the helmet like I. Guess that's the trunk that you see there so right. So when you end your ride, it'll first ask you to make sure your helmet is back in the back trunk, so you'll leave them there and you lock it. So when you end the ride everything locks okay, so it should be there for every other ride after that, one. What if something is broken before they start writing. So if you go to your ravel and you notice, maybe like the mirror is broken or like there's a missing helmet, you would just contact customer support right away and they will take care of it. They'll like mark it down and operations team will be aware. Okay, yeah and you can report it right in the app also and what's the time period for your response team to this, to whatever happens to the vehicle. So if it's like a community member, has called our customer support and said, hey, this Revel is parked illegally or it's blocking my driveway or something like that. We try and be that we try to get there within 45 minutes depending on traffic. If it's something like it's missing a helmet or it's mechanical issues, it might take us a little bit longer than that. Also we're still staffing up, so we're not fully staffed right now, but we try to resolve those issues within 24 to 48 hours. Thank you very much yeah. Thank you. Well, Rafael is your show? No, it's actually she's the chair of the committee. So Maria is there anything else, Maria where you at I, don't see you here, listen as a host, so I was I was deferring to Ralphie with any other things. I mean I. Think I'm good on mine, and this is all very interesting and like I. Thank you again I thank everybody for coming on to discuss this and I'm gonna keep my eyes out. You know looking for more of these bikes around and you know well, maybe I might want to contact you at a later point once we're open again and on behalf of the point and how maybe you know, working together with our with the residents and things like that as well. Yeah I think that's good, because the point is one of our environmental justice groups and you know we can utilize you guys and as an example of you know, being able to travel without causing any of admissions in our district. So thank you Maria, for that would make sense and I just sent Jessica from Amazon. I'm sorry I just sent Jessica Schumer an email from Amit to a casino, Amazon and I included you all Carol and Lauren. So you have to step on that and then take it from there. She'll get back to you and I can set something up. Thank you. So much appreciate and Maria I think we would love to do some collaboration in the future whenever you guys are ready. Okay, yes, that's good! Thank you! So I think that wraps it up right, Ralph, yeah, Carol, Lauren. Your girls are great. Thank you. So much stay safe. It's good, seeing you again, Carol come to the office. To give me a preliminary presentation. Cynthia and I are very skeptical of this, and you know about having passengers on break-ins. They reassured us and not only that the council member and his love people program. They are taking they're utilizing these mopeds whenever they can throughout the district. Already the weather's getting warmer so I just hope. It's a success for us. That's all I can see it as long as there's no issues with you know any criminal elements. This is a win-win for the community and and I think we could both use each other's as examples of working together, in particular with the point in our environmental justice organizations. Here, Ralph I, I'm glad you said criminal elements that I'm sorry. It's just one question that I have to ask what happens if you're riding it and you're waiting for the light, and somebody pushes you off and tries to take the bike away from you. I mean seriously. You know you got to think of that. You guys shut the bike off from yours from your site. If something like that happens, so we can. We have to wait until the vehicle is not moving anymore, but incidences like that. We also work really closely with NYPD because that's actually unauthorized use, it's actually a criminal activity. So that's also like a good point. We love when community members. Let us know if there's anything, that's happening, so we can suspend the users and take action on our side. But if there's anything, that's like endangering somebody else, 100 call 911 first, because this is a motor vehicle and they can enforce the law. We can't enforce the law. We can just suspend users, so if someone's you know riding on a sidewalk or running through red lights or something like that call 911 and report them. Thank you very rough. Does that wrap it up? Yeah? Okay, thank you much. Everyone yeah thanks for having us off tomorrow. Yes, tomorrow we got a meeting with Bronx works at 1:30. Yes, okay, that's you me Maria and Cynthia. No I just thought this. Their meeting remembers their meeting, so it's their meeting and it's a community advisory and I invited sergeant Guglielmo to attend the meeting. Oh I told him to get the numbers of the 911 calls from January to now. Us again he doesn't know the numbers offhand, but he knows that is clearly the number one location with the most with the highest 911 calls, but he's going to give me the numbers for that. We talked about the truck. Stop. We talked about the budget, there's really nothing, that's the only thing is: oh we're gonna, we I, don't know if we need to have a full board meeting. The only item would be Maria had to give us everyone an update of what just took place. If we do, it would be Wednesday the 27th and the reason why I'm not sure is I think the Bp's office might want to come around and say that we have to have a public session, so we might have to just you know, to have a meeting and Cynthia's already working on the agenda stating that if you want to speak at public session, you have to provide the information beforehand in writing. That way, when there's 60 people on you know we're not going to just open it up to public section, we'll all know who's going to speak and who's not going to speak, then, after that, it's just going right to Maria's committee report attendance and we're in and out so we might have to I'm not sure, really just the same amount that we always do for the public session. Cynthia. No three minutes and what is it? Five people yeah? That's it right! Yes, yeah I have 23 minutes each if we've got people to submit beforehand. So just put that in my I'll, let you know we can set this all up hold on I. Don't know if you're going to tell me about it, I by the 20th next week today, next by next Wednesday, we'll know for sure, because we still have to set up the agenda and Cynthia is already working on a draft agenda for this, and we just got to know. This is the only thing this is the only technical meeting we're having, but Tom might turn around and say: hey you need to have a puppy. You need to have a meeting to have a public session. We already heard updates from the Department of Health. We heard updates from EDC. We can also have NYPD, you know the 41st president and the 41st priest sent and on the part of their reports. Also, but that's it it's just rewarding. Keep that in mind. I'll. Let you know, though, by Wednesday of next week, yeah actually Thursday, it's Thursday. We have girl board the 21st round and then we'll know if we have to have it if possible, Ralph, if possible, I would like to know from department of Health what are the numbers of Covid-19 positives from 10459 10455 and even though I know we could go on it, but I want to every day it changes and that map doesn't change every day. Yes, it does every day, because the stats change every day, I send them out everyday, purposely and the links the numbers are almost the same, because everything is declining. Now, where we're on the yeah, it includes all the zip codes it breaks it down, but holds it breaks it down by gender by we put all of that up on Facebook every day you can go to their websites too, and just look at the data. Looking on the data, everything comes up. Hospitalizations deaths cases, the number of new cases, the number of possibilities, the number of deaths they have. The only thing that we wanted at one point was to get it by community board. That's what we've mapped breaking down by community board, so they broke it down by zip code. So it's negotiating with the city and the state where stuff like that, but they do break it down by zip codes right now, so they bring. They give you the number of positive cases and the percentage of people being tested that are positive, which is real big. So in one place before we have a low number of positive cases right, I'm talking numbers one of the lowest in the borough. When you look at the percentage we're one of the highest, so we might have 300 people that have it in 10474 and 500 people took the test, so that number is going to be way over 50 percent. That percentage is one of the highest in the city, but we have one of the lowest numbers of total positive cases in 10474, 10455 and 104. Five mana are in the second to last range, and then you have the entire Bronx one of the highest in the world. Actually, because we're the epic center of it in the city and the branch are percentage-wise for people is the highest. So if New York City is the epic center, the Bronx is the epicenter of the city, so we're in the middle of it there so yeah all right, bro. Okay, we can have them on if people have questions or you know, but if we had, because I'm just I was thinking that, but then I after I said it I said you know what this it's just going to extend the meeting longer than what it normally is. Okay, I want that we did that already and if people need any information, I'll be born every day, I'm sending it out, but I can also direct you to the link and I'll show you how to navigate them. That's kind of not I, think I did it one time when I wanted to do this. How do you feel about this stuff? No, it's good, I! Think it's good! You know if they use Miguel for the to try and get workers. I know that, then. That means that community board two gets quite a bit of pieces, you know and if they use they use it for the restaurants and I, don't know what they can do with Amazon, but to do something with Amazon that'll be great, because then that's more usage, I, don't know. Jose shared that he completed the business guide through SBS NYC Avenue Npc funding, Jose Tavares, no okay, so we have copies of the business guy in my office. What I'll do is I'll instruct Jose I think he wants to present it at a meeting to you guys, but what I'll do office? I'm gonna ask Jose to send you a pdf copy of that, and then there are also listed restaurants, that maybe we could you know, connect Revel to also when it comes to making deliveries. Okay, thank you all right that other issue about Joe's. Let's talk to Millie see what we could do yeah she did. We ever make her a city vendor yeah. Okay, all right, we're good! Then, okay, quick question is Millie still open for like takeout or she shut down during this whole thing, she's only open for catering, like she at one point, was trying to do takeouts and it didn't work out. So we saw her open the other day. Like hey, you know it's 11 o'clock in the morning she's like nah I gotta order somebody food, a big catering job. You know a couple of trades or something so but not take out not like on a normal takeout, because she wasn't generating no type of traffic. She told us so yeah, just let her know just let her know how much we can spend per person and she can't go over that and if she can't do it, then we gotta look for somebody else. You know I was kind of just showing her invoice that Joel's place and then that way she can match it and that's it yeah, because she you might as well make the money, because you're gonna get this amount versus get nothing exactly right. This will only be maybe September October. If and when we do have a fortune again, because you get me more depressed man, maybe I'm sorry by the time it gets to us, we'll probably be in the middle June or late June and then July and August. We don't have no meetings anyway, we're not in session. We got to find out how that works, because, even though you three are more than six feet away from each other, so that's not a problem, but how do we deal with the traffic people coming in we're not letting them in? Also if I go I can't come in? No, you better stay home. You don't sign my timesheet, my boss does I know, but I signed your first one Bobby's an exception for that, but nobody else is going to be allowed in the office. So listen. What am I gonna do just sit there and thumb. You know Twitter my thumbs, you know yeah, you gotta, wear a hat. You gotta wear your hat, though all right this is it guys. This is okay. Thank you know good to see you guys. I want to say something really quick if anybody's ever interested in this, for the cold bid. Just to know that if you're, if you've been a carrier, exposed I have a number and you can find the location, I didn't actually I got swabs. It's like seven minutes. It's not even that long. I did it at in college. If anybody's interested just hit me up on the phone I'll give you the number just in case just give you a calorie right now. Okay, that's perfect! Thank you. Bye, take care, everybody, Jesus Christ! This thing does shut up. This thing: don't want to shut up Ralph.
