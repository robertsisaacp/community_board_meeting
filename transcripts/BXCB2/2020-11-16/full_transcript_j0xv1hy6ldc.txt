Started recording so thank you very much for being here today. My name is Luis Marrero, I'm the chair of the health committee and what something that we always do and I'm not sure if it's gonna work here, we always go around to so everybody can introduce themselves. At least we know who who's there. Because I know some people are on the phone and some are on the website. So we can go. We can start by round rock Rob on Cevado district manager for board two. So Lewis. Do you want me to announce who's here? Presently? Okay, so everybody knows I just want to know. I just want to make sure everybody know who's part of the meeting sure. So we have myself. We have the community coordinator, Cynthia Baez. We have Gabriel Torres from Urban Health I have Anita Reyes from the Department of Health and mental hygiene. We have a brand new Board number Jennifer, Cowman she's from open arms circles, a senior daycare in our district yourself, the health Chair Luis Marrero. We have Mariel De La Cruz from the New York Control Office. We have Paloma Hernandez, President CEO of urban health plan. We have shattur our new board member Satori, Mccoy, Greg, I, hope I pronounced that correctly, and you have a committee member Stephanie Cordero here, so you have besides yourselves have another one. Two three three board members on here with you do us as of now so the connection. That's okay, you're there! Okay! So let me put this in airplane mode, because when somebody calls me everything goes away. So first of all today is October 6th. We haven't met since technically since March last year, then we went into recess during the summer time and last month we were still early to meet, and finally we fi, you know we have the opportunity to meet, and today what I really want to do. Health is an issue right now that is so important and what's going on in the community with Covid-19 I know, we have Anita in our full boy meeting. She did a pretty good and third presentation about Covid-19 and what the city is doing in terms of Covid-19, but in within the community board too. We have one of the biggest employers of service in health care and I think it was it's very. It's a really great idea to bring urban health plan and since then, the biggest community health center in our district, they can give us an update or let us know what you're doing, how you're doing. If you need anything from the community board, how can we support the work that urban is doing so for that we have the CEO and president of Urban Health plan, Ms Paloma Hernandez that she's gonna be addressing some of the issues? Thank you Paloma for being here. Thank you one. Second, I'm sorry Paloma Mr, chair I, just also want to acknowledge that you joined by first Vice, chair Julia, Cruz who's also on the line. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry Paloma! Oh that's! Okay! So thank you for inviting me. You know these are very difficult times that we're all living through right now, I, don't think any of us ever imagined doing these meetings, like I, said looking at each other through squares for so long. But here we are so urban I can tell you know that urban is a very large provider in planning board two with many sites and many school sites as well, and so we struggled like everybody else did in the very beginning, because our visits really are dependent on in-person trend interactions right, so you never had anything called telehealth, even though we were all kind of prepping up for it, but we never really put it into place and what we did was we found ourselves in our main site as an example or an organization-wise where we had I, don't know it's, let's say: 8,000 visits a week, all of a sudden in March they dropped to 800 visits a week, and so there was like how are we ever going to exist and the government was very reluctant to help pay for or to be willing to pay for telephone encounters. So whatever telehealth you did, you had to do through video and that works, except it doesn't work for our older population, people who don't have smartphones people who have bandwidth issues, all those people and so in between trying to keep the organization afloat. We also had this whole policy thing going on with the state and hoping that we could get paid. If not health centers across the city across the country would have just shut our doors. It was really at that point and all of the focus was on the hospitals as it should have been, but no one was looking at the primary care providers on the ground and trying to figure out how do we keep some semblance of a health care system that wasn't going to be flooding the emergency rooms at that time, back March and April? We overcame that and we got them to. We got the state as part of the emergency orders to actually reimburse for telephone business, which has been very helpful and so I guess I. Guess we started really. We also our staff. We have, let's say roughly a thousand staff members, 270 75 of them kind of like a third were furloughed. A third worked remotely and a third stayed on site and that's kind of how it divided up. Do you want to hear your boss? Excuse me? No, I'm sorry go ahead. Sorry, oh okay, and so we had a workforce plan and then I guess in late March late may early June, we kind of started seeing that this was going to be our new normal and how did we start ramping back up, and so we put the first thing that we really looked at was our physical environment across all of our sites and making sure that they were as safe as could be for patients and for staff. You know the staff as Julia knows, because she works in a health facility is really is a lot. I mean people walk around all day long in PPE, and that's something that we don't. You know you don't think about, but when you have to wear those masks and gowns and face shields and goggles and gloves eight hours a day, it's really something that we should really think about the challenge that people have gained. We had closed down quite a number of services, and then we had to start thinking about how we ramped them back up so assuring one that we had enough. Ppe was really important, assuring that we could segregate our patients. So when patients come in they're screened at the door and if they're symptomatic they're sent to another side at our main site, and so we've been able to really keep our symptomatic patients. Apart from our asymptomatic patients taking temperature at the door screening people at the door, we screen people before their visit, so the night before all of our patients get called to make sure that they don't have any symptoms or no one in their household has symptoms. If they do, then we put them on a telehealth appointment system. So at this point in time, I guess one of the other things we did was we kind of looked at our waiting rooms and our physical capacity and could figure out. We figured out how many people could be in a given space at a given time so through the use of a grid, which kind of tells you more than x, number of people based on what exam rooms based on seating in your waiting room, coupled that with walkie-talkies couples with clickers, where we keep counts of everybody, that's going into our facilities, we've been able to maintain right now. What looks like about 49 of our visits are in person where they were at about eight percent in March or April. They they've actually gone up to about 49 and every week, there's a little bit more. We're also opening more services that require in-person visits and then with the remainder, is still telehealth. So we do a whole lot of telehealth visits, and so the telehealth visits are actually divided up into video visits and telephone visits with the telephone visits taking a little bit of a lead over all the other businesses. Oh one minute, I, don't know right now, and that was my granddaughter hi granddaughter, and so then we started we started bringing in dental, so we always had two dentists who did emergency dental care throughout the crisis. We now are up to I want to say about six dental providers and we are slowly bringing them back. We had to get suction machines for each of the dental operatories, a lot of preparation that has gone into making our facilities really safe. We opened up our physical therapy department, which we had closed up. We opened up Podiatry, which we had also closed up and we opened up our optometry service, which had been closed as well. So those are the four services that we closed down. Everyone was working remotely. We have started to very methodically and deliberately bring more visits in and really, as I said, trying to always balance safety with capacity and making sure that is really maintained in a really thoughtful way. What else could I tell you every day gets a little better I think that there's a lot of trauma and a lot of a lot of anxiety. A lot of stress that people have gone through all of us I really think that when this is said and done, either people are going to be totally nuts and go crazy and have the time of their lives or we're really going to start. Seeing and I think it'll be a combination. Right, I think everybody needs to be around each other. I think everybody needs to hug each other I think people need people right and so I hope that what we see is good is better for our community I hope that we're stronger I think that we've learned a whole lot about ourselves about the people that we serve about the disparities that exist. None of the disparities are very Un unfamiliar to me. I I've lived them all my life yeah, so let me stop there. I can. Let me just also say and I do get you know. All of you know me. You know how emotional I get, but it's because I, the human factor is such a big deal in all of this and humans are resilient and we survive and we move forward right, and so we one of the things that became very evident to us and foundations, would ask me other than health care. What could we give money for and without a thought, food people need food. They really need food every day, and so one of my one of our staff members Jamine Williams, who many of you now know she's out in the street every day and she really teamed up with with Salamanca and has been able to give tens of thousands of pounds of food a day, and you know I'm very thankful to her because that's what we needed, that's what we need, and so we need support. We need people to believe in ourselves and really just be thankful and appreciative of the relationships we have and of the community that we have and I want you all to feel very safe in going into urban. We have done everything possible. We've done some patient satisfaction surveys, and so one of the things that really has intrigued me is like how do people feel going back into the center and by and large people have said that they felt that we reopened in a proper way and in a safe way, and that's really good very few. You know you have two or three that say we went to dance and you have two or three that say we went to flow, but the majority are very comfortable with how we handled our opening and we they also are very thankful for all the telemedicine that we are able to do, and so it's been a hard long time and I think everybody could vouch for that. But I think we'll be stronger for it. I think we'll all be better. Better organizations will be better members of society for this horrendous experience and if anybody has any questions, I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you. Gabrielle Torres is from my staff and is going to be speaking about Medicare Advantage, open enrollment. She runs our health information center, which, which is a storefront right next, to two storefronts away from our main site that focuses just on outreach and navigation and insurance enrollment and when we closed in March, we shut down all of our non-clinical offices, including her office, and she requested not too long ago that we think about reopening the center, because there are a lot of people who need to come in and need to bring papers, and it's just not so easy to do through scanning and through the computer. So in a couple of weeks, we're going to be reopening the health information center and it'll be by appointment and again, with only certain amount of people coming in there. We also opened project hope a couple of weeks ago, so Miguel Calderon, who runs project, hope. Many of you know him is in there twice a week and is helping people with applications and resumes and really they needed to do a lot of the registration for the Ged program and testing in person. So he offered to come in and do that so that office has been open as well, so we're slowly. Starting to reopen everything, our administrative sites, I, will say, are going to be closed through the end of the year. 300 people are working remotely from home and they're doing fine. Many of them have relocated. I have people now in Alabama, Texas, Florida, Puerto, Rico, Pennsylvania Maine and we're able to they're able to work just perfectly. So it's been a big ordeal, but a big learning one as well. So with that, let me stop and see if anybody has any questions. Thank you closed down. I was thought thinking that Urban would have taken over and I noticed that they put a sign for 99 cent store, I, don't think, that's a good place for that. Yeah I! Don't know why I'm hearing myself, we have one health center, that's opening up on southern Boulevard in East Tremont. We were just surveyed today by the health department, but we had never really considered taking over Walgreens nope. It would have been great anyway. Thank you. Maybe when anyone in our store, closed or closed project hope also doing it by appointment or can they walk in as well? No it's by a person. Any other question for Paloma, you know, thank you. You know on behalf of the health committee. I would like to thank you for coming in. You know it's good to see you once in a while, because I know you you've been there in the community board for so long and I know you enjoy coming into to this setting and listen to you know what the community says not only about the community, but also about the urban health plan yep. Thank you thanks for inviting me thanks. So much sure so now, like Paloma was saying it's for some people, especially for our Medicare population, is coming up against the open, enrollment and like Paloma was saying we do provide enrollment of health insurance, for you know, for the people not only for our patient, but for the community in general and I believe it was really good to bring somebody who who's not an Hmo or health insurance that if they come, they will talk about their products or what they can do for the community right here, Gabriel Torres, who is our enrollment coordinator at the urban health plan. She gonna be able to talk more about the Medicare enrollment in general and how we can help and to enroll people or how you know what the people can do to enroll to Medicare advantage. So I just want to bring again Gabriel Torres, Gabriel I know you brought a presentation which we already have on screen and feel free to start talking all right, perfect, hi everyone again. My name is Jackie. So with this presentation it is I left I kept it short and sweet. But if you guys have any questions afterwards, you know just let me know, as you guys know, when it comes to Medicare, it's really on a like specific base by base, so you know, buy a person and buy the situation on how they kind of do with Medicare and just with the plans etc. So, let's get started so again, I'm really just going to talk about the Medicare Open enrollment period, so the open enrollment begins on October 15th and it ends on December 7th of 2020. During these three months, any person who is enrolled into Medicare can select a new Medicare advantage plan or switch and or drop their current Medicaid advantage plan. All new enrollments into a plan will be effective on January, 1st 2021, so individuals who are enrolling into a Medicare advantage plan during their initial enrollment period, basically meaning once they start or once they've recently enrolled into Medicare. Once they select their plan, they have three months to be able to switch their plans or keep it directly to just original Medicare. Sorry, you can switch to the next there you go perfect, so there are exceptions if a person needs to change or drop their plan outside of the open enrollment period. In order to do so, the individual has to have a reason based on the social, Security and Medicare requirements. These are moving outside of the planned service area, losing current insurance coverage a chance to get another coverage. So let's say, if someone moves to another zip code and there's more options of plans they are able to, then you know get into a special enrollment period and switch it and then there's also other. Like special situations that can occur, they really try this. These are just pinpoints, but there's a lot of it really goes in depth. So there's a lot of different type of scenarios and situations that someone can switch their plan prior to the open enrollment period. So the kind of library too, once January first hits an individual once they select a Medicare, managed care plan. They have to stay in that plan until the next open enrollment period, so they will be locked in now to kind of just give some basis. You know when it comes to Medicare advantage plans. These plans is just another way to have Medicare part a and b coverage. So if someone has Medicaid and Medicare, they have full coverage now if they want to pick a Medicare advantage plan, then they're just going to get additional services. Now someone does not qualify for Medicaid. You know they enroll into Medicare, which covers 80 percent of their expenses, and it would be good for them to pick up a Medicare advantage plan, because it would pick up the 20 that the straight Medicare does not pick up. So, as you guys can see here, more information, most Medicare advantage plans also include drug coverage plans, so basically, for the prescriptions. These plans set a limit on what you have to pay out of pocket each year for covered services to help protect you from unexpected costs. Again. This is a case by case it's all based on someone's income when it comes to the out-of-pocket expenses and co-payments. Now there are basically four most common Medicare advantage plans, as you guys can see on the slide. There are health maintenance organizations, so Hmo plans, there's preferred provider organizations, Ppo plans, a private fee for service and special needs. Now how they select a plan for individuals is really based on their needs. What services they need, what specialty doctors do they have and that they need to have coverage if they need. You know home attendance services, so it's really case by case, but these are the most common plans that individuals get enrolled into okay. So that was really brief on when it comes to Medicare advantage plans, but just kind of like a little. You know quick overview now currently right now, as Paloma and even Luis has said. Is that currently right now, our health information place is closed. So we are working remotely. So if there's anyone in the community that needs assistance when it comes to even Medicaid applying for Medicare or even guidance, to try to figure out what plan to select at our office, what we really do is we look at the patients or the clients primary care doctor specialty, you know even certain medications that they might be on, because when it comes down to them, selecting a plan, it's best for them to select the one that's going to give them the most coverage. You know, I find that there are times that our clients jump from different plans, because Medicare advantage plans also have Otc, which is a benefit which actually gives money to individuals enrolled into advantage care plans, and you know they can get over-the-counter stuff, so sometimes they give 140,130. So that is something that really gets a lot of the clients to trying to switch plans rather than realizing hey. If I switch a plan, a primary doctor might not accept the plan and it might hinder me, so we really try to like give our clients as much information as possible so that they can also learn, and then we can help them. You know get them covered in a plan. That's going to give them the best coverage, so I, you know provided our information there, but also who I wanted to provide on Medicare.Gov. They have a very clear and perfect information when it comes to a breakdown, because Medicare has part a part b d, there's so many parts to it that it can be confusing, but there's a lot of resources on there and even at the link, as you guys can see, I did like a little link there. That also shows too, if someone wants to do their own research to find out what Medicare advantage plans are out there in their zip code or in their area. They can look it up and kind of get information and, like I said always, you know with our phone number. We are always here to answer questions to provide guidance. Now, when it comes to selecting a plan, we do have health insurance reps that we built relationships with to be able to you know, do a warm hand-off so directly at the health information place, we can help enroll into Medicare help enroll into Medicaid, but are the advantage care plans that have to be directly through the plan, but we do have certain reps that we work closely with that. We can trust that they're going to make sure that these clients are going to be taken care of you know and again we have clients that might say hey. You know, I want help. First, they go and they speak to the Rep, but the Rep feels hey. Look. Your co-payments are going to be really high. You can't cover certain things. You know these are the individuals that we trust that will communicate this and we'll let them know look. These are your options. This is how much if you wanna, we don't have to enroll you now. If we can enroll, you know you can shop around and see what's best and then return back and then the last slide. So this is actually I got this off of the Medicare website. It's basically just you know quick notes of how to get ready for open enrollment. You know for anyone when it comes to Medicare the Social Security offices out letter about the open, enrollment period and a lot of information. They also have a 2021 Medicare new handbook that also provides information on plans. If a person does not have it, they can actually request it directly onto the Medicare.Gov website and they'll, send it to them and then also too, you know think about Medicare coverage needs. You know review. Basically the prescription plans as well, and then you know we're here to always help. You know to make sure that you pick up a plan. That is, you know directly to you, and that gives you more coverage. Does anyone have any questions? I have a question Gabrielle. You said that by October 15, it's when the open enrollment begins. Do you think the office your office is going to be open by that time or not? You don't know, I'm not sure I can't I, don't want to say yes and I, don't want to say no, but so regardless, if our office is open, the good thing is yeah. They can call us and a lot of the reps, so the rest can do over the phone. So it's up to the client's comfort. You know if they want, if they rather you know, stay separate, they can actually get it through the phone and week three weigh it with them. So we've really found avenues to try to keep that way for right now. But, yes, you know once you open, then it can be more person to person, but for right now, though yeah we can assist them through the phone with that, hopefully and I think the key here. What, which is you know is very important is that this information could be so confusing, especially for our population and it's confusing for even for me. Sometimes it's confusing and the service that you provide. There is just to help them to understand the plans, the options that they have in order for them to make a decision yeah. No, yes, definitely we even have we have a lot of clients that come to us just with the mail. You know, they'll come with us a whole pack of mail and you know we'll open it and we'll read it through them. You know read it through with them and see they sometimes are unsure. You know I know that during this time right now it has been difficult for that. But you know we always try to find different alternatives to try to help them. When it comes to that elf has a question. Well, Gabriel I will put I'll put my email in the chat you know. So if anyone has any questions afterwards, you guys can you know, send me an email or if you have anyone that needs assistance. I'll put my email in the chat and then you guys can contact me. Thank you very much. I have a question: does a person have to select an Hmo select, the managed care? Do you have to? No, they don't have to the reason I'm asking is because the long-term side people don't realize that a lot of people don't talk about long-term, whether it's home care, nursing, home, assisted living. A lot of people. Don't talk about that so yeah now yeah when it comes to the long-term like if someone needs home attendance services and long-term care services to be honest, Medicaid, especially because, in order for someone to get home attendant services, they have to be enrolled into Medicaid right. They do a spend down or they do a full trust. But you know the hard part about. That, though, is that you know it's difficult. You know so most of the time now, with HRA, they're, actually enforcing or basically now they're selecting. So they either have to pick up a Medicaid long-term care or they have to pick up a Medicare long-term care, so they're actually making that a requirement. Now for long-term lawn care services, somebody in an Hmo, sometimes they have to disenroll. So we have to encourage them to disenroll, because a lot of them are not covering long term yeah and yeah. It's hard- and you know again, you know, like we always say we're always here, because sometimes there's different rest, that kind of give out wrong information or whatever it may be. It happens you know so we try to like you, try to fix that and try to make sure that they're at the best coverage so yeah. Thank you, you're welcome any other question or any other comments. No thank you Gabrielle for coming in. Please give us that information anyway, it's going to be part of the over the minutes. Also that your presentation is going to be part of the minute. So people will have your information available all right so moving out in the agenda. It will be their own business. Technically I, don't know if we have any old business since we haven't met since March, but I don't know if anyone has something that I want to bring Mr chair. I just want to acknowledge that you did mention about the last time this committee actually met and that this is the first meeting since March, but I do want to acknowledge that last month we spoke about having the Ohmh, make a presentation about Covid-19 and track and tracing, and at that time it was decided to have them present full board meeting for September right, but technically that was that would have been like a health committee item. So I just want to make sure that we're on record that last month we wanted to capture as many people as possible. I have 15, there's 15 people on now, but at the full board meeting, when Anita gave a presentation, it was 60 people, so I think that was the whole point of trying to you know capture as many people and in those resources that I needed provided so I. Just wanted a point of reference with that. Thank you. Ralph any new business no see the building. No, what is it? 909 back I already started the interviews for the tenants that are going in there. 28 of the apartments are going to folks in the shelters so seniors, 62 and over in the shelters, so I interviewed about 50, 55 and so far I've approved only six. So I'm really yeah. I'm sorry, I'm really tough. When it comes to that, I'm trying not to yeah I'm trying not to bring into the community the people that have and I hate to say it. You know, have a drug history and look like they're still using so there's a series of questions that I asked them. So I'm trying to keep the community you know as best as I can 28 apartments are going to the shelters and the other. The rest are going to just seniors that have put in applications. I have no control over who I'm told to interview I get a list and I interview them. I, don't know who's coming into the building. There was an impression that I was going to put people in front and whatnot I, don't know what the applications say: I don't know where they're coming from I, just I'm interviewing right now. For the you know, the people in the shelters, but I'm hearing that maybe November 1st, we will probably start signing the leases. For that day. We'll see I've heard that before for October I heard it now, I'm hearing it from November. So hopefully let's keep our fingers crossed when we start filling up the building and how many apartments do you have 88, oh wow, 28 is sheltered and 60 is regular seniors. Are you going to have any set aside for people that live in this like seniors that live in this district? I? Don't have control over that, but that is the instructions that were given. Okay, that was the instructions that were given. We were focusing on the Bronx and I wanted it to keep it that way. Yeah! That's part of the yeah, that's part of the Sarah program on the HPD, so any building that's receiving HPD funding has to go through the affordability component, which 50 are supposed to go back, but Sarah program is not 50 percent, because these are seniors so foxy management. If mistake, no correct me if I'm wrong Julia Foxy management is doing the startup. With this and when we met with Foxy, we gave them instructions on this building and the community access building at 985 brookman on our preference to have people from this district. So whatever they're giving to Julia is what you know they're getting, but that was on what was strongly encouraged at the time. Yeah, I'm working with them, because the shelters that I'm getting are only Brooklyn and Queens I haven't seen any from the Bronx and I know. We have shelters in the Bronx, so I'm really going slow with the process of accepting and not accepting so and it's exclusively up to me whether I accept somebody or not. So I'm waiting on the bronze folks, I still haven't seen one yet and when do you see people start moving in I was told July first and I saw August 1st. Then you know now, I'm being told November, 1st okay, so it's ready, so the people are ready to move in. Oh just this is the interview process. This is just the interview process. I've already interviewed between 50 and 55, and I've only accepted six and the shelter people have to be the first ones to go in. Oh well, so you have a way: I can't wait to go, I, don't want to rush I, don't want to rush, and you know bring our community back and I hate to say it that way, but I don't want to do. You know something in a rush and then we're going back to what we used to be, and we don't want that yeah I agree yeah, thank you, Julia you're welcome and for those who don't know it, I'm spending half of my time in a Manhattan facility in Terrace Cornell Cook, which is also under arch care. They fired their director of Social services, so I'm kind of like lending them my license. So I'm there three days a week, Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays. So that's why it's difficult to run back and forth, but hopefully I've interviewed a couple of people. Hopefully, I'll hire one of them and my life will go back to whatever normal is these days, so hopefully, within a month, I'll be back fully at same time, but I'm get Tuesdays and Thursdays. So if anybody needs me, thank you, Julia. Okay, any announcement, Mr, chair, I, think in the chat Jennifer wanted to talk about I guess the services they provide, but that that's up to you yeah, that's from open arms, Jennifer you're, there Jennifer, oh my god. Oh sorry, she's unhappy I have her in the chair next to me. I just wanted to talk about us a little bit next week on. The 12th is actually going to be eight years supposed to be opened and with the pandemic and everything that's happening. All the social dates have actually been suffering right. There's about 388 centers in New, York City alone, and for the mayor's executive order. We have all been shut down, so we don't have in-person services so we're providing telecare and meals to our clients, but because we're such a niche market, we are under managed long-term care plans and they decided that they're not going to pay us for the services that we've been providing. So we have pretty much been servicing the clients at our own costs. We're providing masks, gloves food, we're providing arts and crafts. We're providing essentials, I mean there's clients who are still afraid to come out of the come out of the house, so we're doing food shopping for them, yeah we're doing social services, re-certifications I have clients going for bills, I'm still paying you know, so we were forced to form a coalition and on April 8th, the Department of Health finally issued some guidance which the insurance companies have still come to ignore. So we have come together and what we're probably going to end up doing is showing some of the insurance companies because they don't want to pay us. They don't want to provide the services, they have cut out completely the social day care from the clients benefit, and we, you know just kind of looking for a little bit of support from everybody, because when this pandemic is over, you know this continues: we're not going to exist. The seniors are going to have nowhere to go, and you know it's just been really bad. We lost a lot of clients because their family members aren't able to take care of them. They ended up putting them in nursing homes and they died within two weeks of being in a nursing home lost about 10 clients in a three-month period, which is a lot so I just want to tell you a little bit of our struggles, and you know see, if maybe you guys can give us some kind of support, help us somehow, but we're gonna end up hiring attorneys to start joining insurance companies, because we can't survive on what they're doing to us right now and we're not going to exist. If we're not, you know going to take any drastic measures. Oh well, if I just tell ever because not everyone is familiar with, where you're from I'm from open arms circle, we're a social daycare, we're located on Westchester Avenue in East 164th street, we're under the train with the same block as writing. That's it Mr chair, that's all I have for the announcement right. Thank you, Jennifer I know we have been working with open arms for so long, not only through the community board, but also we have done a lot of collaborative work with urban health plan and over open arms. So, let's see how we can help just keep that conversation going to see how you know how we can do. Oh any other announcement, so there's no announcement. I really want to thank everybody for being here today. Looking forward to meet in person, I, don't know what that's gonna happen, but you know I'm looking for that day. Hopefully maybe next year Ralph. What do you think we don't know your guest who's as good as mine, dude I have no idea, no I know so I don't know if anybody else want to say anything else before we just you know, add joints I just want to congratulate Ralph on being a dad, oh yeah. Thank you. Paloma I appreciate that. Yes, thank you. So much thank you struggle, but for some people it's been good yeah, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. You know so if I've got to be the light bearer to bring good news, so be it it's fine with me yeah all the best for you and that beautiful baby yeah. Thank you. We also like something I'm sorry. We also want to thank all of the new board members who logged on for their first official meeting, looking forward to keep doing so much work always active. Thank you. So much, I'm really excited Luis I can give an update from the health department if that's okay with everyone, so thank you so much Paloma. Thank you to all the partners. The great work that you're doing I think this is the team and we're gonna have to have all hands on deck as we're seeing that in other parts of the city, the numbers are spiking. So we could not, you know, put our hands down. We have to continue. We can't let our guard go so I just wanted to mention to you, because we are tracking these numbers very carefully and we're looking we're doing surveillance, but we're also looking at neighborhoods that people are not getting tested and so right now we are. We are observing our neighborhood in the Bronx and I just want to tell everyone please currently, there's still transmission going on, which means that there are people out there that have the cope with virus. Sometimes they don't have symptoms but they're still able to transmit virus. So it's very important that we all understand that in order for us to know, if we have the virus, we have to get tested right, that's number one, but if you're sick, you should stay home, do not go out. You should wear a mask when you go out when you're in the supermarket of the bodega make sure that you're six feet away from each other, and it's also very important to wash your hands if you're in and out wash your hands. That's very important! That's the way that we're gonna track this virus and make sure the response. The other thing I wanted to mention is that it flew and it being flew. These season is important that everyone gets their flu shot. I have to say that you know this year is more important than ever, because you don't want to get sick right because you don't know if it's coronavirus, so we really want to tell everyone to get out, go and get tested and also get your vaccine. So that's in the Bronx we've seen that we've had almost 5000 people died of coronavirus, right and so I think that, partly because of that people are really helping in terms of complying with the guidelines. So we want to continue doing the same. So thank you to everyone for everything that you're doing that. There's some neighborhood that are not getting tested. Yeah. The bronze do you know what circle yeah so the first one that we saw- and this was back in July- it was Tremont one zero. Four, five eight we saw that people in that neighborhood were not getting tested and the numbers, the percentage of positive, was higher. You know than the average of the city, and then we went to sunset in Brooklyn, and then we came back to the Bronx and we were in 10472 in the Soundview area, and so I know that urban health has Saint Lawrence in that area and we're still you know tracking, but we did have a good turnout. We had over 2000. Our goal was to test 2500 people and we did exceed what we were looking for. So what I want to say is that we want to flood these neighborhoods with information. We flood them with testing sites, and we really want to make sure that everyone understands the importance of getting tested. Okay, so right now we're just looking at data every day, and so my job right now is 24 hours a day, making sure that you know we're checking in that we're talking to the partners to see what they're hearing and so I want to thank the partners because really we've been hearing, you know what messages work, what messages don't work and you know trying to make sure that we have an educational campaign to continue this work and until we get this Covid-19 vaccine, you know it's gonna be hard. We're gonna, probably continue so I just wanted to say. Thank you actually now that you're saying that the of the New York State Department of Health, I, guess also the New Yorker city. They are encouraging people to download this app. The app which I downloaded the app and what's really good about the app is that, besides that it keeps you informed. If you and again you have to be honest and if, by any chance you feel that you're sick you're tested positive and you or you were around people that had the virus, you put that information in the app and it happens that, if everybody's doing it and let's say I pass by Anita and Anita also has the app and she put her information that she was tested positive when I passed by my app could connect with you with her app and send the information to DOH, and they send me back the information say: hey. You were close with somebody who was positive and they kissed me like, like give me a warning, so I can go and test myself. It was I think it's really good. What I'm gonna do. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna put it as part of the agenda of that minute, so everybody can have access to that app and if they wanna download, you can download it because I think it's really good to use it yep and it's a state app and it's called NY Covid-19 alert all right. So I wanted to see it and I mean like they're, using this app like in China right. That's how they're tracking down the viruses. When we talk about pests and trace, you know the word trace, especially in Spanish. It's you're tracing people, but that's not what we're doing we're tracing this virus right, because we want to make sure that we are aware of where this virus lives and we could capture it and not continue to have it. You know replicate or transmit from others. So thank you. Everyone all right! Thank you! Anita! So is anyone else any comment. Anyone add anything else to the meeting. One more and I promise I'll be quiet after that, the seniors for so long. So don't worry, I know I'm the bottom of all of you, the seniors in the community. I know what I went through and I know how it felt like I was in a deserted island and the community totally abandoned us. Not one person in the community came by to see if we needed anything still today, not one. So we look at the folks in Irma Cava. Do we look at those folks and make sure that we're doing something for them make sure that if they need anything, I mean food, I could tell you? I was in St Vincent, sometimes 15, 16 hours a day, I couldn't get to a supermarket. I saw everybody getting food and I was like wow. It would be nice if somebody bought us a couple of boxes of food here so that we can, you know, take it home to our families, not one community group and that hurt so deep, because we were suffering we were totally abandoned. Can we look to see if the folks, at least in Irma Cava the seniors? Let's look for the seniors to see. If they need anything, can we take them anything? Is there anything we could do for them, because I know what it feels like firsthand. I'm really sorry to hear this, but I just want to. Let you know that the health department we do have a facial mask. If that's something that we could give to the seniors. We also have hand sanitizers and I also have a couple of other things. That I could. Probably you know give them if that's something that you know they're interested in so Louis. Just let me know, and I'm happy to connect reach out to Sal at Cepco and just besides Irma carver, we got Mendez. Those are the two senior homes in our district and they're, both operated by Cepco. So we could certainly reach out Cordova houses. Oh yes, I'm sorry in Cordova houses, but we can reach out regarding Arma, Carva and Pio Mendes to Sepco and just see where they, at with things I've been in communication with Sal throughout the pandemic just to touch base. He has not mentioned anything to me as far as a need, except for mask for some of his staff and I hooked him up with Siri from the mayor's office, so Siri dropped off, I think something my either 500 or a thousand masks to style for that. That was the only thing that he brought to my attention, but I could certainly follow back up with him with that. Thank you, Ralph all right. So it's six o'clock. Our meeting is over once again. Thank you everybody for coming in and we look forward to have you again next month is every the first Monday, I'm sorry the first Tuesday of each month at five o'clock. So the meeting is adjourned at six o'clock have a great night and great week. Bye-Bye take care, hi nice, seeing everybody.
