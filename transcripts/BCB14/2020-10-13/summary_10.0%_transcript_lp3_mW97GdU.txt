We met with 17 agencies and now in the process of considering the information that came out of those consultations, working to include them with our agency priorities and comparing them to our district needs for the budget meeting that we'll be holding on October 27th and for updating the district statement.
If you have any questions about things that are going on the street, and you want us that- And, if we do not know which we might not, because it changes so frequently we'll work to find out for you.
I was told that conversation really has not moved forward since we last spoke, but you know, but the request, actually, you know pushed it along, and so hopefully there was movement on that And I did attend a an introductory training for the Youth Council through NYC service And I sent the board a copy of the training , I guess at our next budget consultation and then offline.
I know that the police have a lot of things to keep them busy, but this area between, like the corner, the South, I, think it's the southwest and northwest, but that section of Coney, Island, Avenue, Foster Avenue H, is just a nightmare.
If you have real genuine sincere interest in working on the bylaws, please submit your name to the board office and you know we will consider assignment and finally, on September 30th, a public hearing was held online regarding a special permit application that file assurance to section 73- 621 at and 73- 622 of the zoning resolution of the city of New York has amended to request two special permits to enlarge an existing single- family residence, one for the portion located in a residential R2 zoning district and one of the portion located in a residential, R, 3- 2 zoning district.
Thank, you sean, which means that that the vote, the board, then is voting to approve, and that ends the chairs report and moves us to well.
So should I start off or wait, but nancy we'll have the representatives of elected officials usually give their announcements during the public session after the topical committee reports, I'll defer to ed?
We all know that cover 19 is still a public health crisis We want to be able to work with the community collectively to ensure that we could get the numbers down and keep everyone.
So I just wanted to share those two locations and let everyone know that we're working diligently to receive more PPE to give out to the community, and we did receive a lot from the governor's office as of Friday And, we're trying to get more testing sites and our office is working on domestic violence.
Breast cancer awareness, virtual events , That's all I have for now, but I just want to thank everyone for their time and partnership and look forward to working with everyone.
It is not going to be to the end of October, okay, So, the numbers I'm about to give you could possibly be the final numbers for Brooklyn and some of the tracks in community board, 14.
We are going to arrange for the homeless people and on this occasion a cmw provide the fresh cookie, fresh, cooked lunch and blankets, clothing, Socks, Hygiene kits and free medical care like blood, pressure, blood sugar, and we are trying to get some help from any hospital from any clinic for the flu shots or cover testing, and I'm, going to advertise And I'm going to advertise this event and shelters, especially in Avenue, H, Shelter, And, there's two other shelters.
So much you're welcome community environment No report at this time, But I've been to prospect parkway, but it's being heavily used by people trying to get some fresh air and open space.
The members of the public know this, because we did get some comments during that meeting and an email regarding this CB14 was not being asked to approve the bike lane because it was a plan The response had been positive or not, and in this case, at the meeting, as Joel said it generally was but asking for a letter of support when they were going to do it with or without the support seemed a little bit.
So we're going to post that project up on our website and DOT is asking for community input as to where community members think good stations would be.
But we're going to put some language in there just to help manage the community members expectations in terms of timing.
Thanks for letting me high check the transportation committee port report for a little bit, Yes, it's what they used to do.
With the report so Joel mentioned, there was a joint meeting on Wednesday September 23rd, with the education, libraries and cultural Affairs Committee with the transportation committee.
That was a program introduced by the mayor over the summer and for that actually, sean was able to update us community boards do not have a role in the process.
We decided that the board would try to work with schools on a case- by- case basis to the extent appropriate going forward.
I, just wanted to extend and my co, chair, Carl Henry Cesar, wanted to extend an open invitation for non- board members who wish to join the education, libraries and Cultural Affairs committee, based on the membership.
It, looks like we can welcome up to two non- board members to join our committee.
We have no specific report for anything right now If he wants to add anything to this front, but we are going to continue working with with Sean in the office on the Youth Council front, that we were looking at spearheading with the rest of the committees and, look to follow up a little bit more closely with what's going on with DYCD in terms of Internships Syep, Summer, Youth employment program, The pike, given just where everything is in relation to the pandemic and and then funding acrosss the board because, of course, that's going to be impacted.
Just, announce that you and I and Brian Cunningham are working together to try to set up a public safety committee meeting date in November If you can do not hesitate, to, let me barge in And, then I'll just stall for time, a little bit by reiterating what Steve Cohen said about inviting people public members to the education, libraries and cultural Affairs.
We continue to work, and we continue to hear and prosecute cases to make sure that Brooklyn communities stay safe.
I know our executive director, Jay Nanda, has spoken before the Community board before so we're very excited to be in your district and to be in Midwood, and I'm here tonight.
