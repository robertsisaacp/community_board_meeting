I. Think because there's four items on the agenda we'll get started without much further Ado. The first item is an update on school capital projects for the community board, 14 districts, and for that we have Miss Yvette Knight from the school construction authority to update us Ms Knight.
And I think that I'm sure you appreciate the the budget crisis that we're facing in the city, and We present projects constantly to the mayor's Office of Umb and at this time the ones that I mentioned are the only ones along with some projects in some other communities where they have given us permission to restart.
That project is paused and still on hold when I know that at this moment, projects that are given priority are projects that relate to air conditioning and anything where the ventilation system is compromised, and I am sure that you appreciate the decision around those elements of a school building.
You know people who wanted to go back to work, especially our mentor contractors, to complete those projects, and it so happened that a lot of those ac projects were managed by our mentor.
So they restarted, but as it relates to other kinds of projects again constantly under review, and you know we meet with OMB, but we do have to wait for their approval.
Those are really just air conditioning projects and again, for obvious reasons around the cities, and I think school communities concerns about ventilation.
So were there any other recent completions, including you know, air, conditioning and ventilation, Because I know that's a Steve, I do see it looked like Megan had a second question: I, do not know if you have any, I, think more funding from them.
We look at our attendance policy and things like that, coming up for school reopening.
We know school started on Monday we've been getting mixed reviews some students that can't connect to internet, and It's all different options and things that we've been going over students reaching out to their school on the school running out of their inventory of devices, just trying to figure out those little small issues that turn into big things.
We do not want to penalize the student that has to let his little brother use the device at that time, because he has a class so really emphasizing that to our teachers and our principals and our schools as a whole.
Our business is going to be chaotic this first week or these first few weeks, because the bus drivers got to figure out the routes between, like the students that are doing, the blended learning and the students that's going to school every day and adjust their right accordingly, because we see it as the bus, the school, the bus riding is extension of the school day and making sure we're following the Social Justice Social Distance protocols and all that different items and also we're looking at the grading policy.
They Wanna take their child out of that and go to a blended learning cycle , we're giving the parents the options to choose if we, if they have a positive test at the school, whether that's by a teacher or a student or one of their fellow classmates.
As you may be, aware, there were some articles and local papers regarding some teachers who had concerns in Ps139 regarding the Kova testing and the DOE protocol with that, and so my question for you, is, Have, you seen any guidance from you know your superiors regarding whether or not the testing protocol for what happened that Ts 139 has been updated and if so, what that updated protocol will look like?
There was a letter from the chancellor about protocols for testing, but we were told, and again it's been a series of moving targets and somewhat understandably, because it's a You know, it's an unprecedented situation, but we were told toward the end of the summer that if two people from a school tested positive-- And they were not in the same class that the entire school would get closed down and for at least two weeks that was , that was the last protocol that we were told and then someone you might not find difficult to leave.
Do not have that all that data at my disposal, right, now, but I, know it's every student that walks in the door Every day they're getting a temperature check and things like that.
That's the thing we're going to figure out in these next couple of weeks once we run that through legal, but that's next in the pipeline to make sure every student gets tested.
What testing protocol could look like at the schools, and then we also shed some insight into the forthcoming communication.
I think the number was something like 20, although some of them might still be working through yeah go ahead, The process is that the schools are applying through through the mayor's office and DOT, and then that's being shared with the street activity permit office and there's no approval process for community boards.
If there are parents who think like, I can think of certain schools in the area that you know, there's like dead end streets, nearby?
Or you know, if there's more of a, if there's any sort of role for the community here to get the process rolling, you know really was because of the of the community board in Manhattan taking action, and you know I'd heard from a lot of parents over the summer who you know wanted to promote outdoor learning and Do. You do you know anything about outdoor learning and what and what schools have done around the city or are doing regarding utilizing streets at this point?
A community advocate had advocated for outdoor learning and things like that, just a new creative way, the social distance and also keep the students engaged, but I do not know if that's actually taking place, but I can check in and see.
Know, teaching within the school, and I think the idea of having to provide additional staff to manage something like outdoor learning was just right, like understandably so, going to put him over the edge.
So with that yeah go ahead, may I jump in I Given the many unknowns like not knowing the extent to which it places additional onus on a principal and school leadership that we would just offer to be helpful on a case- by- case basis, whether that's helping a school, that's trying to achieve outdoor learning or play space expansion and helping them navigate, you know, or working with the precinct or navigating other things that are going on in the area or if it's helping a parent group, try to suss out.
Could that be a position where they could consider pushing forward the construction project to fix the yard , so we can achieve outdoor learning or you know, for our students, hi steven with the SCA.
We've been meeting with SCA members, we've been trying to push the project forward to get it in that design phase and we've been put on hold But you know there are things like, as it relates to social distancing and, as I mentioned ventilation, and I send that email So, if that's the case, hang on one second, emily I think I think we can turn to item four on the agenda I guess thank you before you do that it's event with the sva.
It serves more of a transportation and community neighborhood purposes for utilitarian cycling, rather than the sort of necessary Well, not necessarily but recreational purposes that are pretty common within the park and then the fact that the Prospect Park West Bike Lane, is two ways kind of facilitates that type of use.
You kind of have to take the long way around beyond Prospect Park West, there's also Flatbush avenue, where a prospect are where a protected bike lane was installed this year and then Ocean Avenue.
We saw the open streets as very successful in some respects, where a lot of people were out there, biking and walking and able to socially distance themselves.
The the mobility that that was sacrificed with motor vehicles that were not able to kind of use parkside as a cut, through, and I think what this project can do is kind of take some of the best of those two ideas: Creating safe, comfortable places for people walking and biking.
We want to improve the pedestrian safety that comes in a couple, different ways that I'll explain, shortening crossing distances and adding daylighting, which means kind of clearing out cars a little bit to improve the visibility between people, walking and people in cars.
But, looking at the sections, what you can see is currently, as I describe the street you've, got the parking lanes in each direction: travel lanes and they're separated by the painted four foot, buffer, and So. What happens instead of that is that buffer goes away and the parking lanes are narrowed and that extra space is used to create a two- way bike lane alongside the park and the parking lane is moved away from the curb just like on Prospect Park West, to to create protection between the moving vehicles and people on bicycles.
I want to just say that this is a project that we're You know we're hoping to kind of build on the open streets idea and Also the progress that's been made on Prospect park, West and Flatbush.
You know community Board 14 about the routing and with also the parks, Department, and I think they also have concerns about biking with the per inside the parade grounds, and so we can look into those types of changes, but we also have to defer to the Parks Department as far as their witches.
The l, we can look at like what you're suggesting about where sort of near park Circle the two lanes kind of funnels into one lane and kind of make sure that is working.
I mean you, know, I, think it's one of those things where it can just be the kind of situation where it's a give and take, What's the cost of this project.
Do you have any sort of idea on the budgeting, but just right before you know we are a grant funded, project.
I agree that there's a lot of questions that need to get like hammered really specifically, but I just wanted to say that I'm in favor, of having safer streets for cyclists in this area, thanks I actually was biking on parkside a couple of days, ago, so I.
You, know and add more street lights, but I'm 100 on board, and thank you for doing this, and I hope that the project continues around the entire perimeter of the park.
