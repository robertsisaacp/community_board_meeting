Welcome you this evening to a packed agenda with a lot of interesting items and have joined the meeting so we're looking forward to getting started and hopefully answering a lot of questions.
And I think that I'm sure you appreciate the the budget crisis that we're facing in the city, and We present projects constantly to the mayor's office of umb and at this time the ones that I mentioned are the only ones along with some projects in some other communities where they have given us permission to restart.
That project is paused and still on hold when I know that at this moment, projects that are given priority are projects that relate to air conditioning and anything where the ventilation system is compromised, and I am sure that you appreciate the decision around those elements of a school building.
You know people who wanted to go back to work, especially our mentor contractors, to complete those projects, and it so happened that a lot of those ac projects were managed by our mentor.
Those are really just air conditioning projects and again, for obvious reasons around the cities, and I think school communities concerns about ventilation.
I do see it looked like megan had a second question: I, don't know if you have any, I, think more funding from them.
We look at our attendance policy and things like that, coming up for school reopening.
Don't want to penalize the student that has to let his little brother use the device at that time, because he has a class so really emphasizing that to our teachers and our principals and our schools as a whole.
Our business is going to be chaotic this first week or these first few weeks, because the bus drivers got to figure out the routes between, like the students that are doing, the blended learning and the students that's going to school every day and adjust their right accordingly, because we see it as the bus, the school, the bus riding is extension of the school day and making sure we're following the social justice, social distance protocols and all that different items and also we're looking at the grading policy.
Take their child out of that and go to a blended learning cycle, we're giving the parents the options to choose if we, if they have a positive test at the school, whether that's by a teacher or a student or one of their fellow classmates, so I'll pause right.
There were some articles and local papers regarding some teachers who had concerns in ps139 regarding the kova testing and the DOE protocol with that, and so my question for you, is, Have, you seen any guidance from you know your superiors regarding whether or not the testing protocol for what happened that ts 139 has been updated and if so, what that updated protocol will look like yes Some of my colleagues was following up on that positive test from a teacher.
There was a letter from the chancellor about protocols for testing, but we were told, and again it's been a series of moving targets and somewhat understandably, because it's a You know, it's an unprecedented situation, but we were told toward the end of the summer that if two people from a school tested positive and they weren't in the same class that the entire school would get closed down and for at least two weeks that was, that was the last protocol that we were told and then someone you might not find difficult to leave.
Don't have that all that data at my disposal, right, now, but I, know it's every student that walks in the door Every day they're getting a temperature check and things like that.
The thing we're gonna figure out in these next couple of weeks once we run that through legal, but that's next in the pipeline to make sure every student gets tested, but for right now we're just doing like a simple temperature check, and let's do this- go by And you know you may or may not have the answer for that.
What testing protocol could look like at the schools, and then we also shed some insight into the forthcoming communication.
I think the number was something like 20, although some of them might still be working through yeah go ahead, The process is that the schools are applying through through the mayor's office and DOT, and then that's being shared with the street activity permit office and there's no approval process for community boards.
If there are parents who think like, I can think of certain schools in the area that you know, there's like dead end streets, nearby?
You know really was because of the of the community board in Manhattan taking action- And you know I'd heard from a lot of parents over the summer who you know wanted to promote outdoor learning and Do. You do you know anything about outdoor learning and what and what schools have done around the city or are doing regarding utilizing streets at this point?
A community advocate had advocated for outdoor learning and things like that, just a new creative way, the social distance and also keep the students engaged, but I, don't know if that's actually taking place, but I can check in and see And I'm not familiar with the streets and things like that, but I definitely can check with the office of district planning and get more answers, and things like that.
Know, teaching within the school, and I think the idea of having to provide additional staff to manage something like outdoor learning was just like.
So with that yeah go ahead, may I jump in I Given the many unknowns like not knowing the extent to which it places additional onus on a principal and school leadership that we would just offer to be helpful on a case-by-case basis, whether that's helping a school, that's trying to achieve outdoor learning or play space expansion and helping them navigate, you know, or working with the precinct or navigating other things that are going on in the area or if it's helping a parent group, try to suss out.
Could that be a position where they could consider pushing forward the construction project to fix the yard , so we can achieve outdoor learning or you know, for our students.
We've been meeting with sca members, we've been trying to push the project forward to get it in that design phase and we've been put on hold If you've heard my presentation, you know so many things are paused budgetary reasons, but you know there are things like, as it relates to social distancing and, as I mentioned.
It serves more of a transportation and community neighborhood purposes for utilitarian cycling, rather than the sort of necessary Well, not necessarily but recreational purposes that are pretty common within the park and then the fact that the prospect park west bike lane is two ways kind of facilitates that type of use.
But at the same time, you know, I think there was the need to kind of balance the the mobility that that was sacrificed with motor vehicles, that weren't able to kind of use parkside as a cut, through, and I think what this project can do is kind of take some of the best of those two ideas creating safe, comfortable places for people walking and biking, while at the same time maintaining that mobility for people in cars And We want to improve the pedestrian safety that comes in a couple, different ways that I'll explain, shortening crossing distances and adding daylighting, which means kind of clearing out cars.
What you see from the slide is a 15 drop in all crashes, with injuries and a 21 drop in pedestrian injuries, and these are we've been doing these types of bike lanes street redesigns for over a decade, and so this data is new york city data that we've seen in My that is not prospect park.
But, looking at the sections, what you can see is currently, as I describe the street you've, got the parking lanes in each direction: travel lanes and they're separated by the painted four foot, buffer, and So. What happens instead of that is that buffer goes away and the parking lanes are narrowed and that extra space is used to create a two-way bike lane alongside the park and the parking lane is moved away from the curb just like on prospect park west to to create protection between the moving vehicles and people on bicycles.
Protected, two-way bike, lane, as it approaches a park circle to see kind of a different perspective, of that the top drawing is the existing drawing with the two travel lanes in each direction and the island and then below.
I want to just say that this is a project that we're You know we're hoping to kind of build on the open streets idea and Also, the progress that's been made on prospect, park, west and flatbush avenue.
My question is: can there be a cut out so that people can go straight through with their bicycles and get in to you know access the bike.
You know community board 14 about the routing and with also the parks, department, and I think they also have concerns about biking with the per inside the parade grounds, and so we can look into those types of changes, but we also have to defer to the parks department as far as their witches.
That would be most helpful and I just want to ensure that fdny will have input on any pedestrian island to ensure emergency access on a busy street right just to clarify Currently we're proposing the islands as flush flesh painted islands, kind of the same way that prospect park west, the first iteration of That's not part of this project, really, okay, spy relief for me And I'll, find I'll, find our street light count and get it to you.
We can look at like what you're suggesting about where sort of near park circle the two lanes kind of funnels into one lane and kind of make sure that is working, optimally.
Do you have any sort of idea on the budgeting, but just right before you know we are a grant funded, project.
I, don't think gonna meaningfully change park side, but some of that is, like you know, department kind of outside of our scope, got it.
You know and add more street lights, But I'm 100 on board, and thank you for doing this, and I hope that the project continues around the entire perimeter of the park.
