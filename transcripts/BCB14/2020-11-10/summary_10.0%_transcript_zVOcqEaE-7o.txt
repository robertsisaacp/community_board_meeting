At a budget committee meeting last week, there was discussion and agreement that they should simply be reprioritized so that public health and resiliency and recovery, both as a community and economically, would be prioritized over some of the items that we prioritized before, such as building a new police precinct house and a lot of road repairs and stuff like that.
So when we, when we figure out how to prioritize, we take into account budget consultations with the agencies district service experience throughout the year, such as how many complaints we have about certain issues and then also just the number of years that we've had an item on our list and the city has not addressed it.
In the wake of the cook 19 pandemic, we emphasized in the capital budget our need for outdoor space, which is where, because we're 59 community boards in terms of the percentage of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from a park, upgrading parks, adding additional green space and turning new Kirk Plaza into a public asset in the top priority.
School technology is a new need that we identified in consultation with department of Education and to support distance learning, and then public broadband infrastructure also need new need identified by the economic development and then some of our old trustees that have been on this list for a long time, such as a new precinct house, repairing our road bridges, adding a generator to our firehouse, because we are a district one of the few districts left in Brooklyn.
We actually increased the request to baseline the budget for community boards, because we are one of the few city agencies that has not grown since 2016.
This year, then we've also added public health programs and department of sanitation budget restoration, because that was an agency that suffered the most draconian and instantly noticeable cuts of all of the city agencies that that were hit with cuts after the pandemic, housing inspections and because the need to maintain affordable housing should be highly prioritized.
Just a quick question and the first item under expense budget about you know getting additional community board.
So we'll start at this time, ed can I interrupt just to make sure just for clarity, purpose that the public hearing has concluded with a recommendation to submit these budget items, as listed in this priority, order.
So this meeting of community Board 14 is called to order on November 9th at 6:22 pm under the applicable statutes of New York state.
Consequently, except by board members, there will be no public discussion at our regular monthly meeting of matters about which a public hearing or committee meeting has been held.
Persons wishing to speak during the public comment period have pre-registered by contacting the board office.
Additional speakers may email the board office at this time or anytime throughout the meeting.
Your service to our country also wanted to inform the board that we've been working in partnership with the mayor's office to lower the Covid-19 count in our district, particularly in Midwood Flatbush.
Okay, right, now, okay, 1620, Cortelli, Road board members present at the public hearing held on October 21st.
Flatbush development, corporation Flatbush, tenants, Association and Canberra to engage in outreach, assists current community board 14 residents with application, readiness for the HPD required 50 percent local lottery preference, just a moment.
And I think we're going to need a roll call vote before we press.
Can you hear me Gail, Smith and Glenn both have hands up all right, just say just a quick question: If I could roll a recall correctly, the borough president's office was supposed to be having a public hearing.
I think I'm doing this right, but in regards to 1620 cortelli road, I'd like to put in a motion for this property for disapproval, recommendations, and my thinking behind that is essentially.
You know engaging in those recommendations as a as a part of the pathway to approval, and so I am putting forth a motion for disapproval of recommendations for this property.
Yes, and if the recommendations then are met, then is that yes, Barton has his hand up I would second that motion that basically we're essentially voting to deny unless the conditions are met.
You know it sounds like we need a parliamentarian, an office, that's called Parliamentarian.
I mean I, wanted to ask a question for those members of the board or Sean or you Mr Powell who've been on the board for a long time.
Even, though it's a matter of semantics, sometimes semantics are important right, so it just felt weird to say you know approval with such a long list of conditions, but again to be clear.
It is whether the board has more leverage with a conditional motion to approve or more leverage for the conditional, emotion to disapprove and I.
There is an actual form on city planning's website that that includes a recommendation form that to be filled out by community boards on that form.
There is, as you might note, in the language of the conditions, a request for commitment by the applicant to fund and contract with local community-based organizations, housing organizations.
You know, allow the the applicant's representative to us to speak, but first I just want to exhaust input from board.
If there was some indication in the resolutions that that the view of the board was to support the project, but that considering the conditions they would, they were going to deny unless it would just be helpful for me, because at least it would be clear to the commissioners that this was an application that was supported as opposed to opposed in general.
Now, there's emotion on the table to deny unless conditions are met for those who want to vote against that.
If I'm cutting you off a roll call vote which is going to be tricky under these circumstances, but anya will call the names of the board members.
If the motion to deny this application, unless conditions are met, passes or fails, and we will take it from there once we get through the entire roll call vote.
Anyone like to make a motion to approve with the conditions.
I'd like to make the motion that we approve with the listed conditions, indeed in the motion, okay, that we that the board approve with the stated conditions, I guess we're going to have to go through a roll call, vote again, unfortunately, so this guy, so let's get geared up and.
The board's recommendation with regard to this item will be will be to approve with the stated conditions and possibly the addition of another with regard to employment, a local residence at the grocery store and just for clarity.
The consensus of board members attending was to recommend approval of this application.
The public meeting I raised a question of regarding mandatory inclusionary housing, and it was clarified that, since this is a variance that this is not a requirement.
I'm, happy to make the motion that we make the recommendation to include affordable, housing.
I. Think that sure to Sean's point where the applicant is, it sounds like going to actively seek the tax abatement which would incorporate affordable housing into the development.
The motion as I understand it is to to approve this variance, as was the consensus you know of members attending to approve the the application for this variance, but to include Greg I.
It really puts no additional onus on the applicant exactly it's approving their application with extra work for us, but in order to signal support for that application, so the affordable housing is included.
So I'm just curious for the members present at this meeting versus those who attended and voted it out of committee.
We expect going forward that every variants from us or most variances from us, whether in an Mi C zone or not, would then we would expect, or member of presenters their attorneys etcetera, should expect that we will then be overlaying this, because I'm curious why it did not come up at the committee meeting if it's, if it's something that we wish to raise higher on our particular radar.
Think, it's reasonable for us to simply acknowledge the fact that we appreciate the fact that they are considering adding affordable housing to the project and therefore would like to encourage the city to approve the 421a on a separate, point.
Yes, recommendation to approve the application with offering additional support for their 421 arb tax abatement.
You want to raise your hand, vote no.
The recommendation to the board's recommendation will be to approve the next item: special permit, 1215-1217 East 22Nd street.
The recommendation to the full board is to approve this application.
I should mention that combining lots as this applicant wants to do know they are allowed to do this as a right.
You would like to see I should I should have said that the recommendation of the full board is to approve this application.
We've invited a representative from the from DYCD, the Department of Youth and community development, to talk about their workforce, connect programs and what they're going to look like moving forward for our young people.
Conversation tonight, it'll be of great interest to board members and beyond, and then there's going to be another discussion about NYC 5 g infrastructure, but that housing thing is a hot topic.
I also want to thank the board for taking such time and consideration in that 1620 cortelia road, rezoning, matter.
I would like to wish everyone a happy and blessed thanksgiving and finally thank you to district manager, Sean Campbell, the chair, Mr Ed, Powell, Anya and all the members of CB14.
It's open to board members if anybody's interested, just contact, sean or ed, and thank you again for the time.
I just want to let everyone know thank God for all the volunteers that are coming in from Community Board.
