Are last year's budget priorities, since so few of them were addressed by the city in consultation with the budget committee at a budget committee meeting last week there was discussion and agreement that they should simply be reprioritized so that public health and resiliency and recovery, both as a community and economically, would be prioritized over some of the items that we prioritized before, such as building a new police precinct house and a lot of road repairs and stuff like that. So when we, when we figure out how to prioritize, we take into account budget consultations with the agencies district service experience throughout the year, such as how many complaints we have about certain issues and then also just the number of years that we've had an item on our list and the city has not addressed it. So those budget items are up on our website for review. They are also, as per city planning, rules closely tied to our district needs statement. So when we iterate a district need, there should be a budget priority attached to that, and vice versa. If we have a budget, if we've identified a budget priority, it should be tied to the need for the district. So, in the wake of the cook 19 pandemic, we emphasized in the capital budget our need for outdoor space, which is where, because we're 59 community boards in terms of the percentage of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from a park, upgrading parks, adding additional green space and turning new Kirk Plaza into a public asset in the top priority. Because we have some of the most overcrowded schools and the return to schools is contingent upon being able to distance students. We re-emphasized are already identified by the city and the Department of Education need for new school seats. School technology is a new need that we identified in consultation with department of Education and to support distance learning, and then public broadband infrastructure also need new need identified by the economic development and then some of our old trustees that have been on this list for a long time, such as a new precinct house, repairing our road bridges, adding a generator to our firehouse, because we are a district one of the few districts left in Brooklyn, without one repairing trenches in the streets, transit, accessibility, cameras and- and we think that the school construction Authority Canon, should do a better job of building a garbage infrastructure into the school. So that they're not just piling it out on the street, as I'm sure we have all seen. So those are our capital requests for our expense requests. We actually increased the request to baseline the budget for community boards, because we are one of the few city agencies that has not grown since 2016. We have not grown in terms of people, power or our funding, and we were not held harmless from cuts this year, then we've also added public health programs and department of sanitation budget restoration, because that was an agency that suffered the most draconian and instantly noticeable cuts of all of the city agencies that that were hit with cuts after the pandemic, housing inspections and because the need to maintain affordable housing should be highly prioritized. If we're bringing new, affordable housing online, we only have 40 percent of our current residential units, housing units that adequately maintained and then and then we focused a lot on our vulnerable citizens, our street homeless population, youth programming, our seniors, a growing, a growing demographic within our population in the district and then from there. We and then we sort of ratcheted down things that had been higher priorities than past years, but are still important, such as our infrastructure needs with department of environmental protection. We've got a number of flooding, chronic flooding sites, support for our libraries tree trimming from forestry Department of buildings inspectors. We can also use more of those emphasis of pest control and we took three different three different at-bats with Newkirk Plaza. We've asked D.O.T to adopt it into their plaza program, because that just seems to be the most logical thing to do, but we would not say no to New York City transit contracting with a with a community partner because it's arguably part of their domain or just having EDC issue an RFP to enter into a an agreement with a community partner. So those are our priorities. They are city planning, sort of makes us list them in an order, but the fact that they appear on our list at all means that we value them all and it's kind of negligible if something is seventh versus eighth, but they're. Two different agencies, they're just as high within each of those agencies. If that makes sense, so I think we have them closely tied to identified community needs and I do urge everybody to to read our district needs statement. The update will be on the website shortly. Do we have for you registered speakers? No I have anyone, I'm sorry yeah, I'm sorry! I had done the raised hand, but I do not know if it's functioning properly it's up there, gail okay, so first of all well done Sean as usual, just a quick question and the first item under expense budget about you know getting additional community board staff. Should we not ask for the the number of staff that we would like to have just a question? I do not think so gail, because the number it's really about the budget of staff and it because there's so many different titles that we could bring on board and they have different pay scales. It's really not a numeric. Ask it's really a baseline budget! Ask and the problem as board members might recall. We did receive a significant expense budget grant the past couple of years for forty two thousand dollars had that been baselined into the budget. We you know that could be either the technology upgrades. We got or more urgently staff members. So really it's an increase in the baseline budget so that different community boards have the flexibility to do different, hiring versus expense spending with it all right, thanks for the Clarification yep. Okay. Thank you. Has anyone emailed the board office desiring to speak at this public hearing while we've been while we've been? We do not have any pre-registered public members. Okay, then this this hearing concludes at 6:31 and we're exactly one minute into the regular monthly. So we'll start at this time, ed can I interrupt just to make sure just for clarity, purpose that the public hearing has concluded with a recommendation to submit these budget items, as listed in this priority order. Is that can we state that, for the record, absolutely okay? Thank you so stated. Okay, so this meeting of community Board 14 is called to order on November 9th at 6:22 pm under the applicable statutes of New York state, the charter of New, York, City boards, bylaws and Robert's rules of order. The board's policy is to encourage detailed public discussion of matters before the board at our committee meetings and at public hearings. Consequently, except by board members, there will be no public discussion at our regular monthly meeting of matters about which a public hearing or committee meeting has been held. Specific service, delivery, requests or complaints should be brought to the attention of the district managers of the district offices staff by calling the board office during regular business hours or by visiting our website anytime. Contact information is well we'll put contact information in the chat. Other matters of civic interests may be brought before the board during our schedule. Public comment period, which will begin tonight. After all, other of the board's monthly meeting agenda has been concluded. No partisan political appeals or advertising of for-profit enterprises will be heard. Persons wishing to speak during the public comment period have pre-registered by contacting the board office. Additional speakers may email the board office at this time or anytime throughout the meeting. At this time, I will ask the board secretary to call the role we're not going to do roll call for attendance, because we're we'll do it as we've done in the past. Webex meetings, just by listing of members on the participants list and anya, has clarified who's called in, so we should be able to get it that way. Okay sounds good and we do have a quorum sherman. That sounds wonderful, okay, so we'll then I believe minutes have been distributed by a regular mail or email to board members. So at this time we'll I'll accept jail. Smith motion to approve individual motion. Second, the motion: it's been properly. Second, those not in favor of approval. Please indicate your disapproval by raising your hand, I believe we have no hands raised, so the minutes are approved. District manager, Sean Campbell. Thank you Ed. We have a lot on the agenda tonight. So I will be brief, especially since I'm also going to be a little bit like a broken record here. Sanitation, major cuts to the budget really noticeable impacts immediately had what was effectively a 63 percent reduction in service. The mlp, which stands for manual litter patrol, which is the only function that cleans dead-end streets, was completely eliminated. We have 54 dead-end streets, so I mean now what the basket collection that we fought for six years to restore this or eight years to restore to six days. A week is now back down to two days a week and because of some council member funding in some parts of our district is up a little bit more than that, but it's baseline back down to two days a week and we're getting loads of complaints about litter. So we will keep advocating for restoration of those cuts, but there are also a lot of responsibilities that are on private citizens, and that is please keep your sidewalks and yes, 18 inches into the curb. If you do not, if you can't measure 18 inches, give me a call: I'll come over. I have tape measures I'll, do it for you, but you've got to sweep 18 inches into those grips. All of those falling leaves the brooms that go down those streets. I've said this many times, I'm sorry, I know broken record. Those fallen leaves the brooms that go down. Do not have suction they're, not vacuum cleaners, so they have to sometimes when people do not sleep, they have to go around and then we get calls going up. The road went around by leaves. Well, yes, you have to sweep those leaves up. We've got a lot of merchants who are good enough to adopt baskets on commercial corners, but if you go into a place and the basket is overflowing, ask the person with whom your you know, business that you're spending money at if they've adopted that basket and encourage them to do that, because if those baskets are chronically overthrowing overflowing, we might have to pull them. So do your part advocate for the restoration in the meantime. Do your part, remember also your lawn maintenance companies they're supposed to take that lawn, refuse away so get your money's worth make them do it. But having said all of that, to the extent that there are still sanitation complaints, please bring them to our to our attention and we'll do our best to help you out. That's it thanks! Thank you. Sean okay, I have a question question. Oh yes, who was that Joe Smee? Yes, okay, sorry, please did I did I hear correctly that the sweepers cleaners are not calming down the dead ends. No, that's not that's not quite correct. The brooms will still do the dead-end streets, but what's behind like where there's a barrier at the dead end, where there's not a home and there's no curb when tree branches would fall or litter would collect and or you know where there would be illegal drop-offs and that sort of thing we could ask sanitation to attend to that kind of mess with their mlp, and so that's what's missing, we can still ask for some assistance and if they have a spare truck, they can send out to do it, but now we're on we're at the mercy asking for favors, because the city has completely existed, the actual that would have done it. Otherwise, what I'm not clear on Sean is: are they coming down the dead end streets to clean, like they used to do yes or no? Yes, sir? Yes, they are okay. Fine! Thank you! Sean Julia, just one thing, just quick quickly: sean to everyone. The sanitation department is also not doing any leaf collection for composting. They did it two days, two sundays, for the last couple of years: they're not going to do it because I get a lot of leaves. So that's correct. Thank you Joel for reminding me that was on my list and I just skipped over it. Yes, the leaf collection, also completely defunded, and for those of you who are anticipating organics in our district, it's not happening because it's not even happening where it was happening, so organics completely defunded for the foreseeable future. Okay, thank you. Joe Doug, point of order. Do we have to have a vote to adopt the budget recommendations? We only adopted our minutes, but not the budget recommendations. Yeah Joe, that's in the that's in the chairman's report, so I know you're excited, but just be patient for it we'll get there Joe. Okay, any other comments. Okay, the chairs report is going to be quite lengthy, so before we get I go get into that. I just want to acknowledge the presence of any elected officials or public officials or representatives who have joined us tonight, so I, I'm going to rely on this hello, chairman, I, hope I had a little audio glitch there, but we do have council member Farah Lewis with us this evening. I hope I was not speaking over time. Wonderful, councilmember! Lewis! Would you like to address the the board members? Can you hear me? Yes, indeed, of course, good evening? Thank you so much chairman for the opportunity good evening, everyone this is councilmember lewis I represent the 45Th Council district. I'm happy to join you all this evening. I know we had a crazy week last week, so we're back on board to regular schedule. Programming so really quickly. Just wanted to wish all veterans a blessed and happy veterans day. I want to thank you all for your sacrifice and your service to our country also wanted to inform the board that we've been working in partnership with the mayor's office to lower the Covid-19 count in our district, particularly in Midwood Flatbush. In the Flatlands area. We had a few sites that are now closed. They were all mobile sites. The ones that fell in the CB14 area was 1223, Coney, Island Avenue, that was at the Midwood pre-k we're trying to see if they could extend it a little bit more and another site was the micro site at Brooklyn sva at 1260 ocean Avenue. All of those ended as of last week we're trying to push the mayor's office to reopen those sites for another week or two as we seek to lower the count want to wish everyone a happy thanksgiving. If I do not get to speak to you by then our office is closed but open to constituents. If you have any cases or concerns or issues that you would like to bring to our attention or need our assistance, we're at 14, 34, Flatbush avenue right now we're seeing all constituents virtually or by phone. Our number is 718-629-2900. You can call us Monday through Friday, from 10 to 5 and we'll schedule a virtual appointment with you or call you by phone. If you leave a message, if you do not get us and you leave a message, thank you so much to sean for your support and to the chairman and the entire board have a blessed evening. Thank you so much councilmember Lewis do we have any other public officials with us tonight. We have several representatives from different offices, but no other elected officials said okay, well, I, guess in the interest of time, since we might have quite a lengthy meeting, I'm going to ask a representatives of public officials to just speak in the public comment period and we'll start now with the with the budget priorities for fiscal year, 2020 members at a public meeting on October 27th, while the requests from fiscal year 2021 are being carried over. For the most part, there was an agreement to re-prioritize the requests to align with health and economic recovery from the pandemic. That item by we need the board to the recommendation is to submit those items as listed and we need a vote and it can be an abbreviated vote by the board members to approve that recommendation. Thank you Sean. So what those? Let's start with those opposed those opposed, please make it known. By raising your hand, I'm going to unmute the phone callers if anyone would like to state their opposition, no hands went up, okay, so those in paper everybody else can be assumed to be in favor. Well, yes, those are, although the board members obviously are in favor, so that the bunch of requests passes so now to move on just a moment. Please mute your phones anya. Is there a way to mute all phones at this time or mute all microphones, we'll try again! Thank you so and there's some bandwidth issues. So if you have any trouble with your audio, you might want to just put your video down if there's any problems. Okay, right now: okay, 1620 Cortelli, Road board members present at the public hearing held on October 21st, are recommending affordability, add to the number of affordable units 40 AMI and commit to an equivalent distribution of affordable versus market rate studio. One bedroom and two and three bedroom units maintain option one for the originally proposed 21, affordable units and enter a binding agreement to fund and contract with community Board 14's local community-based organizations. Flatbush development, corporation Flatbush, tenants, Association and Canberra to engage in outreach, assists current community board 14 residents with application, readiness for the HPD required 50 percent local lottery preference just a moment all right give the bill so that there is a setback that benefits the cortelia road streetscape and decreases. The visual imposition on neighboring residential units. The renderings presented are not final plans and the applicant must demonstrate an effect and effort. Pardon me to decrease the visual imposition of the building. Incorporating a setback can not be deemed a rationale for an inability to incorporate additional, affordable units. Shadow study expand the shadow study to address incremental shadowing on cortelli road which, in the aftermath of the pandemic, has become a de facto sunlight, sensitive public asset. Given the sidewalk cafes and expanded outdoor use. Given that this project anticipates the installation of solar panels, it is imperative that the shadow study demonstrates that the building will not limit the solar revenue of neighboring buildings conduct a shadow study with all potential setback plans. Expanded environmental studies demonstrate that the site has no environmental concerns related to past dry cleaning use on the property. While it is entirely possible that this would be code mandated, we wish to have the result highly highlighted for a community review commit to exceeding the city's 2020 energy code requirements, advancing resiliency energy waste and waste water management, provide an analysis evidencing that the Initia additional strain on infrastructure, for example, sewers gas lines will not have an impact on the local community. Expand traffic study and support community public transit needs conduct a traffic study that demonstrates a non-disruptive delivery window for the retail components of the building, provide measurements of the impact of 44 vehicles anticipated by the garage design on Cotelli, Road, East, 16Th Street and the residential blocks to the south of East 16Th Street. For example. The study, ingress and egress patterns ensure the provision of bike storage for residents and exterior back bike racks for public use, commit to supporting Community Board 14's efforts to convince MTA to restore the B-22 Bus Route Commit, to support Community Board 14's request to MTA NYCT to conduct a station capacity study at the Cortelli road Brighton line station community amenities commit to a greener streetscape plan and demonstrate an ongoing commitment to ensure maintenance of plantings and street cleanliness along the proposed building line. Community district 14 ranks near the bottom of all 59 community boards in terms of the percentage of residents who live more than a quarter of a mile away from a park. Furthermore, the lieutenant Frederico Narbae's taught lot on cartelli road would serve as an amenity to residents at 1620 cortelli road. Therefore, an additional condition is to underwrite through the New York City Controller's office, a fiduciary account where upfront funding could only be withdrawn by NYC dpr toward maintenance and programming. Support for the Cortelli road hotline demonstrate a long-term commitment to maintain the grocery store in its current scale on site. Next item on my report is a variance and I think we're going to need a roll call vote before we press. I'm sorry, sean yeah, I. Think if there's because this is a the public hearing was already held on this item, there's not an opportunity for public questions, but there is an opportunity. Should any members of the board wish to discuss this 16 20 quartile, you wrote item at this time. Absolutely! Okay, can you hear me Gail, Smith and Glenn both have hands up all right, just say just a quick question: if I could roll a recall correctly, the borough president's office was supposed to be having a public hearing tomorrow. Do we have any specifics on that or confirmation? We can put the link to that public hearing in case anybody wants to speak at that public hearing in the in the chat it is scheduled for tomorrow. That is, that is a true fact. Okay, well I do not want to speak, but I do want to call in and listen to it well. Yeah we'll make we've sent the information to a number of our residents who've inquired about it. So we'll put the information in the link right now all right. Thank you, Glenn Walton. Thank you. I'd just like to point out. One of your earlier comments was about the shadow study because of the the street of all the people in the restaurants being out on the street and I, just like to point out that this is going to take a couple of years to build this building and since Visa announced the probability of a vaccine. We probably won't have that particular problem. Two years from now when there was a request that the that the streetscape not be that this, that the scale of the building be aligned to the street streetscape. So it would still be the reasoning might change, but the request from community members who spoke that evening was to lower that or set back the cortelo roadside and I will say that the I we did get a letter just before the meeting started that so it has not been closely reviewed, but there is the applicant's representative, Richard Lobel from Sheldon Nobel has has reviewed the has reviewed these items and they're showing a willingness to review the conditions. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Both Carl Scissor has his hand up. Call please sure no problem, thank you chairman. Thank you district manager, and so the I think I'm doing this right, but in regards to 1620 cortelli road, I'd like to put in a motion for this property for disapproval, recommendations and my thinking behind that is essentially I- understand that the Community board is making recommendation and that it will make its way through the process right. But if I understand correctly, approval with recommendations would mean okay, the community boards with it, and if the recommendations were met great, if not okay, but it would still move forward, whereas in my opinion, disapproval with recommendations mean there's a stronger emphasis on the applicant. You know engaging in those recommendations as a as a part of the pathway to approval, and so I am putting forth a motion for disapproval of recommendations for this property. Carl, let me be sure, I understand your motion, you know. Are you? Are you moving that the board disapprove this item? Unless those recommendations are met or are you saying disapprove it and I, I'm not sure I'd quite understand clearly sure ed so yeah, so you summarized it correctly, ed, yes, so I am I'm making a motion of disapproving unless the recommendations are met? Yes, and if the recommendations then are met, then is that yes Barton has his hand up I would second that motion that basically we're essentially voting to deny unless the conditions are met. Okay, then board members. You you've heard the motion you've heard. The second Jonathan Judge has raised his hand to speak to the motion, yeah Mr, Chairman and Sean Parris. You could fight, but I do not believe. That's an option to report out I think the only options are approved with conditions or disapprove so I do not know if taking a position contrary to the way that it's meant to be received. Also, semantically approval with conditions is saying: we deny it unless the conditions are met, so it means the exact same thing is what the proposed changes in the language, because, if we're not approving it wholeheartedly, unless those conditions are met, so I'm not sure if there's a meaningful distinction to that language, but certainly we should not submit to golden Burke has his hand up great clarify that I think that's incorrect Jonathan, but Alvin can clarify Chairman Burke Alvin. You have to unmute there. You go my understanding if the chairs report contains a motion to approve, and will you repeat that please alvin asking whether the chairman's report design includes a motion to approve which would take precedence over Alvin I. Do not think that there was a motion on the table, yet the chairman's report was that the committee was that the committee was recommending approval with conditions there is there is a precedent and there is an allowance to disapprove with conditions you're right, it's somewhat semantical or semantic. There might be different sort of symbolism in terms of you know how the community perceives it or how the applicant perceives, which way you're leaning, but it's similar you're, either approving as long as the applicant meets the conditions or disapproving unless the applicant meets the conditions. There's not. So it's not a certain in practical terms, it's not a huge difference. It's just how the board wants to position. The language barden Prasant has a hand up. Please I personally, believe that the Disapprove, slash, deny and less is a better reflection of the certainly the majority of the input. I think that we heard that night and then previous of the you know just listening in general and actual input that we've received and I do believe. That is a stronger statement of what I heard the community have to say. Thank you. Thank you, Bart. As far as the you know, legitimacy- or you know proper nest of the language I, I'm not sure myself. It would require someone with better parliamentary skills than I and John. That might be you. If there is anyone else, any other board member who is knowledgeable about this I would like you to speak at this time. Michael Cedile has his hand up and then Glenn wollen had it put his hand back up. Michael, please Michael Cedillo, Unmute yourself, oh I was still talking about you. Can you hear me now? Yes, wow I, never believe it. When somebody says I was talking about mute during a meeting, but there I just did it. I do not have anything to add Mr, chair, I, can't or I can't help clarify the scenario, but I just want to help I want to understand what happens if we approve with conditions and the conditions are not met, I apologize. This is already set, I'm just having trouble following you know. If we, if then you know our approval, it has to become disapproval, then you know, but again remember what we're doing is making a recommendation. You know we're not making a final decision that we are not empowered to do that, but we are making a recommendation and our recommendation to approve or disapprove. However, the language with conditions and if those conditions are not met, if we, if it was approval with conditions, then of course it you know that would void approval. Okay, thank you. So then, truly it's a matter of semantics. I think so, but you know I follow the lead of the board here on this. You know. If you'd like it, you know if you'd like to approach it from you know from the negative side and say disapprove, you know unless conditions are met or if you want to say approve, you know with conditions I, I'm going to leave that up to the board and I'd like you to decide on that, and this is anya I just want to let the college viewers know that you can also make a comment board. Members that are calling in you are unmuted. If you wish to comment the hands on Glenn, it sounds like the denial with conditions is at least as equal, if not better, based on what was shown at the meeting from the residents am I correct. Are you asking alvin that question well? I do not know that's what sound like what Alvin was saying is. Did anyone else hear clearly, no I think Alvin was asking a procedural question about whether or not there was already a motion on the table before Carl made his motion and that's what I'd like to speak to? Okay, let's hear you. First, it's up to the chairman. Go ahead, Glenn all right! Thank you when you, as the chair, proposed this whole scenario and talked about it and then opened it up for our discussion. Although no one said this is a motion, I believe that is exactly what it was that it was a motion for us to discuss and then vote on. Therefore, it's inappropriate for another motion to be brought before us until that one is addressed, I believe that's the procedure anyway. Thank you. Thank you. Glenn thanks, everybody I. You know it sounds like we need a parliamentarian, an office, that's called Parliamentarian, okay, I'm that's something that I am not sure glenn. So I, you know I, it's not something that I can and you know, rule on or anything so Mr chair, if I may, just Jonathan, Jones I, believe the way that so Henry Caesar had Caesar had worded. It was as an amendment anything coming out of a committee, including the public hearings, which essentially function as regional committees. They report out the recommendation, so that's already considered a motion, as you reported it out. Mr chair that was considered the motion being under consideration and I believe that Caesar's Pardon me excuse me. This is motion was an amendment to it so on background and it sounded like it might have been seconded that it is valid, typically in parliamentary procedure, for consideration for discussion to alter, based on the wording that he proposed. John I do not know about anyone else, but I missed. So much of what you said and it just you know again might be a bandwidth issue. Would you does it do I come properly now, I think so? Yeah you're not cutting out right now. Okay, that sounds good. So I was just saying that, because the motion was reported out from the public hearing, which is a form of committee. Therefore, no, the emotion of the recommendation to be considered is already on the floor, and so I believe that Mr Caesar's motion was a motion to amend and that would be valid to move to amend the recommendation that was proposed. So therefore, it's valid to consider that change notwithstanding whether or not we can recommend a disapproval of the conditions, but in general one can amend a motion. That's on the floor, so I just wanted to clarify that point. Thanks, John Board members who still have a hand up are nicole levinson angulo and Ann Godette, and if anybody, if a board member already spoke, could you put your hand down please, nicole, please hi. Thank you for calling I mean I, wanted to ask a question for those members of the board or Sean or you Mr Powell who've been on the board for a long time. How many times and again anecdotally, when we have submitted these conditions, has had their actions, have those actually become a reality? The reason that I was supportive of Carl's suggestion is because you know we do not approve or disapprove anything. We only make a recommendation and I felt that there were the lists that sean that Sean put together and that chairman Powell Read was so long and so negative that to submit, even though it's a matter of semantics, sometimes semantics are important right, so it just felt weird to say you know approval with such a long list of conditions, but again to be clear. My question is for those of you who have been involved in these matters for a long time when the board presents these kind of conditions. How often are they actually do? They actually become a reality? Well, I'll address that first I guess you know during my time on the board I've seen many of these. You know conditions, and you know, as far as I can recall, most of those that I've seen did in fact become a reality. I mean there are other people, you know who I mean, certainly Chairman, Burke and others have been on the board as long or longer than I and I would like also to hear their opinions or their observations. Alvin. Do you want to speak? To that your hand is up, forgive my voice. That is correct, usually conditions that support stipulation along with conditional approval are met by the applicant. It's a matter of the board being this reasonable as the conditions it's demanding as a matter of the procedure. However, for it as traditional, it is there's no reasons. We'd hear the condition unless it works, but it has worked in the past that the board has made these recommendations in the affirmative condition. This is nicole again I just so. Thank you very much. Mr Burke I just feel then that if to hold the person that is applying for the approval accountable, it just seems much stronger to me to disapprove it and then say you can come back to us if you've met these conditions and then approve it. But thank you for sharing the experience of past conditional recommendations like these speak again and go down. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, okay! Regression is one of leverage. It is whether the board has more leverage with a conditional motion to approve or more leverage for the conditional, emotion to disapprove and I. Leave that to the judgment of the board members Ed, could you call on Greg Alvarez, who I think might be able to offer some clarifying information, absolutely greg? If you can elucidate here, please do so sure. I can't necessarily say that and say for sure I'm an expert on the city procedures, but I was just doing a search to see if I could find something. That's helpful. There is an actual form on city planning's website that that includes a recommendation form that to be filled out by community boards on that form itself. Where you know it gives you the options of what a community board can do, it actually does have a box for disapprove with modifications or conditions, so it does look like we are able to to act in that manner. So I do not know if that's completely helpful, but it does look like it is accounted for in the world process. Thank you. Thank you. So much greg I can also confirm that it's been it's been a it's been a topic of conversation with with applicants representative as well as Richard Bearak at borough hall, so I can confirm that it is an option and thanks a lot greg. Also thanks to Greg and Barton, who assisted with the with the wording of the conditions and should get credit for that. Ann Godette is a board member who's had her hand up for a long time and has not yet spoken, and please speak hello. Can you hear me? Yes, thank you very much for the time. So a few things. If we're going to vote, I may or abstain going back to the original laundry list that was there I believe there were two things that were missing. That were at the time that we were adding conditions and we approved it to leave committee with those conditions. They would include preferential housing for neighborhood CB14 residents, who had lost the ability to remain in the district so that they would be given preference for the affordable housing component. It was one- and the second was spoke to employment from the grocery store and I. Think that's it. Thank you very much and I can speak to the preference. The preference is a that's an HPD requirement that 50 of the local members of the community would be given preference. That's not there's no choice in that. That's an HPD requirement for the affordable housing. There is, as you might note, in the language of the conditions, a request for commitment by the applicant to fund and contract with local community-based organizations, housing organizations we specified Canba and Fdc to to assist with the with the application process. As far as the employment one I saw, I missed that somehow we could certainly tack that on or write that up separately as a as a wish. It could be a wish, rather than a condition at this point since it's not on here. Unless there is a motion to add it. Yeah I too, do not recall that one, but you know it sounds good and ed, even though Richard Lobel is not a board. Member and conversation usually is only amongst board members. If you wish to give the applicant's representative an opportunity to speak, he does have a hand up and seems willing to do so, while you're thinking about whether or not you're going to let him I could I ask all board members who already spoke to please take your hand down, because I'm easily confused I would I would be happy to. You know, allow the the applicant's representative to us to speak, but first I just want to exhaust input from board members. Is there anyone who has not spoken, who would like to speak or someone who has who has something additional to add Anne's hand is still up and Glenn Wollen's hand is still up. Okay and just spoke Glenn. Do you have something to add not gone over? It's just that. I just would like to say that I'm favoring personally approval with the recommendations, because this is the longest list of recommendations. I ever remember. Seeing that's it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Glen Croissant's hand went up okay, and did you did you have something to add and please put your hand down then Barden President thanks. First I would ask that a friendly amendment be made to include Ann's contribution to the letter, because I think it's very worthwhile second of all, I think that certainly it's appropriate to entertain the new motion that Henry put forward, because we did not have the actual letter when we were first discussing this in committee and, second of all, it was a consensus. It was not an actual boat of yeas and nays, so I would vote that everything, sort of or recommend that everything sort of stay as it is now and accept Anne's as a friendly amendment, thanks. Okay, all right so with the applicant's representative like to speak at this time. Thank you, Chair Powell and thank you. Sean Richard Lobel of Sheldon Nobel for the applicant aside from thanking the community board for their extremely thoughtful consideration of the application. I just wanted to just really make one comment with regards to the nature of the vote. I, do not want to insert myself into this discussion with regards to approval or denial with denial unless etc, except to say two things. The first is it's somewhat meaningful to city planning in that, despite the fact that a deny unless indicates support of the actual substantive application, the commissioners in the past have had issues with that and looking at it that way. So again, the community board will do what it does, but I will tell you that, from my standpoint, having fought hard at the City Planning Commission for such applications, it is meaningful to them. You know the difference between a denial unless versus an approval with conditions. Having said that, I would merely say that, to the extent that the CUNY board does do deny, unless, if there was some indication in the resolutions that that the view of the board was to support the project, but that considering the conditions they would, they were going to deny unless it would just be helpful for me, because at least it would be clear to the commissioners that this was an application that was supported as opposed to opposed in general. But again you know words do matter to the commission, but I appreciate you giving me these this one minute and I hope that the vote goes well. Thank you, Mr Lobel, Board members. Is there any additional discussion before we before we go to vote Hi Hindi Benzo hi as a teacher, we're taught to say everything in a positive manner, as opposed to a negative matter, so just I mean and as Mr Lobel has appealed to us, I would say we do it in the positive but say that it's very we we're only agreeing to this with those conditions. I would I would try to do everything positively, as opposed to disapproving upon condition just makes it easier for the people and for the process and billy richling and Carl Henry Cesar have their hands up. There's emotion on the table, though too yeah, okay, so I'll hear from Carl and billy call please so actually I already spoke. I had a question just to confirm what we're voting on for Jonathan's comments earlier, so how about billy go and then after billy go. You know I'll raise my point: okay, billy, hi, yeah, sorry, I, guess what I'm about to say is contingent on whatever we decide in this sort of roundabout discussion about the language but I, just I guess I won't what I'm trying to say is I support the simpler approval with conditions framework, because I want to understand what it is. I'm saying when I put what I'm communicating with my vote. So what so? What needs to happen in really sorry to jump in, but just to get it so that we get to a point of clarity right now, there's emotion on the table to deny unless conditions are met for those who want to vote against that. If that motion passes and that's what it's going to be, if that motion fails, then somebody can make a motion to then approve with those conditions. But right now the motion on the table is to deny unless and Jonathan Judge can jump in if I got that wrong. But I believe that is the process by which we get out of you know if the board wants to move it to the positive, the propositive statement. This motion on the table has to be defeated first before that motion can then be made, and then presumably that would be supported in lieu of this okay. I. Concur with that. Okay, thanks Jonathan, I'm I am catching on so Ed. If you want to, there are no additional hands up. Carl seems to have taken his down and I think that we need to go to a unless Carl jump in. If I'm cutting you off a roll call vote which is going to be tricky under these circumstances, but anya will call the names of the board members Present Hindi bindel is going to keep track of the votes. Hindi will. Let us know if the motion to deny this application unless conditions are met, passes or fails, and we will take it from there once we get through the entire roll call vote, if there's a board member, whose name for some reason does not get called you're just going to have to yourself and shout out loud but ed. If you want to turn it over to anya I'll defer to you to do that. Certainly anya. Please proceed. Thank you, chairman. Okay. Everyone I'm going to do the roll call a little unconventionally, I'm going to go in the order of webex the way that the names are listed. So hindi I hope that works for you. That means you're not going to be exactly alphabetical, so unmute yourself when I call your name and say yes or no billy ridgeling to disapprove with conditions. The wording is to disapprove the application unless conditions are met. So if you, if you say yes, then you disapprove then you're voting to disapprove. If you say no you're voting that motion down okay. So if you want to just say, if you want to, if you want that motion down, you say that okay, correct, okay, billy richling was first on my list, but I have lost billy ridgeling, so I will come back to him and begin with. If I'm near him, I'm saying, can I say: did you did you abstain? I'm sorry! Yes, I am staying. Yes, Hussein you're, unmuted, I'll, move on and come back and oh is that. Are we and okay dead?

No and are there any other board members calling in on the phone that have not voted yet I. Believe that concludes the vote. Chairman, so handy, we'll wait, we'll wait a minute, so the motion is denied motions tonight. Okay, so, since that motion has been denied, I'll entertain a motion, the original or the previous motion. Well, this is for me everyone had which I'm really excited. Okay. Would anyone like to make a motion to approve with the conditions? Yes, I would like to do that. I'd like to make the motion that we approve with the listed conditions, indeed in the motion, okay, that we that the board approve with the stated conditions, I guess we're going to have to go through a roll call vote again, unfortunately, so this guy, so let's get geared up and and I'll go to anya. Okay, everyone we're going to do this. The same way nice job and this time just listen for your name. The First board member is efraim nirenberg you're on YouTube, yes, just before go ahead just before just before the vote begins just to be sure that everyone understands you know what you're voting for or against a vote of.

Yes, thank you, I believe the vote has concluded chairman. Thank you and handy. What is the result? The motion carries. The motion carries so the board's recommendation with regard to this item will be will be to approve with the stated conditions and possibly the addition of another with regard to employment, a local residence at the grocery store and just for clarity. That additional condition was noted already so was part of the vote, and so I believe now as a part of public record and will be added, no ifs, ands or buts. Okay. So everyone I just like to thank everybody. For you know your lively discussion and concerns I mean this is what an active board is supposed to do now, we're going to move on to the next item, which is a variance with regard to 1284, East 19th street BSA, number 2020, z. The consensus of board members attending was to recommend approval of this application. Yeah I, you know. First, let me, let's see if there's any discussion on this before we before we go on. Edson has his hand up ed, please thank you, chair Powell. Just during the me, the public meeting I raised a question of regarding mandatory inclusionary housing, and it was clarified that, since this is a variance that this is not a requirement, I would just like to make a suggestion that, on the recommendation that this with this variance, affordable housing of some sort that this developer considers, that is all okay. Thank you. Is there any additional any further conversation? If any anyone have anything did I did I hear somebody I do not see any hands ed, so I have a question which I guess I kind of missed it the first time around. But how are they able to not have a certain amount of affordable housing included in this building sean? You want to address that. It's not it's not in an MIH zone and Greg Alvarez also hands a hat, has a hand up and may be able to apply his expertise to that question in greater detail. Sorry Greg, if I'm putting you on the spot, but hopefully you can do that. Yeah, no worries yeah again. I would not you know well, I necessarily I mean completely, but I. The my understanding on this, for this particular matter is they're asking for what amounts to what was it the rear, variance right on the application yeah. So basically it's in a different section of the zoning resolution. So with the lat with the last matter, they asked to be to have the mandatory inclusionary housing zone implied to them and therefore that was the basis upon which we could ask for an affordable housing component to it and they're required to to get that zone on this one though the variance is of a different sword. It's just a dimensional variance that they're asking for as opposed to something more substantial. Now that does not mean and I think at Edward's point I think we could certainly make that as a recommendation to for the for the applicant to consider it, but it's not something that comes from the zoning ordinance itself. I! Think that's the that's the difference here. There was a the applicant's representative did note that they were applying for the 421a tax abatement and we could write a letter of support in terms of that application in order for the dwellings to be become affordable housing, if that would be a useful way of going about it. Okay, thanks everyone I, if I may make another point, I just I, just feel that the developer fully well and is well aware, since the pro the what's currently existing on the property itself is a single family, home and they're looking to develop a multi-story unit, multiple units and I think that it's this is something that we should consider as well. Okay, I would are you you know. Is this a motion or are you? Is this a suggestion sure I? I'm happy to make the motion that we make the recommendation to include affordable housing. I will defer to Mr Alvarez with as far as the language of how we would want to state this as far as includable housing, whether it's AMI and so on and so forth. If I could just yeah I think that sure to Sean's point where the applicant is, it sounds like going to actively seek the tax abatement which would incorporate affordable housing into the development I. Think, maybe that's the way to do it to say that we're supportive of it and that we, you know we would. We would want that as part of this development. That would be. You know, a condition that would be part of our recommendation to say that not only that they consider it, but that you know that it should be part of this, that it should be part of this development. That sounds great to me: Mr Alvarez, thank you, yeah, greg, I, you know. I would think that would be the way to go with this as well. Is there any further discussion on this? Okay, I would love to do an abbreviated vote here. If we can so is there I mean I. Think everyone. If you do not understand you, know this motion. If you do not understand you know what we're voting on. Please speak up now. You know you know, while that we're still discussing this okay, so we'll call for the question please Mr chairman who just spoke I, believe that was reframed. Just restate the the motion. Okay, the motion as I understand it is to to approve this variance, as was the consensus you know of members attending to approve the the application for this variance, but to include Greg I. Believe your you know, your suggestion was to include information regarding affordable housing. Yes, I think if we can it as a condition over pupil for them to seek what is it 421b right, the the tax, the tax abatement to allow for affordable housing as part of the project? Okay, is that understood now to support the application to recommend approval of the application with the addition of support for their app application for the tax abatement to to expand the affordability? It really puts no additional onus on the applicant exactly it's approving their application with extra work for us, but in order to signal support for that application, so the affordable housing is included Mike. Do they already ask for the tax abatement and it's my understanding that if somebody wants tax abatement they automatically have to include affordable housing, as a proportion is not that correct, they said that they were applying for it. Joe. Okay, thanks, okay board members, you you've heard the motion or the recommendation from members attending Ann Godette has a hand up and Gadette yeah hi. So I'm just curious for the members present at this meeting versus those who attended and voted it out of committee. Should we expect going forward that every variants from us or most variances from us, whether in an Mi C zone or not, would then we would expect, or member of presenters their attorneys etcetera, should expect that we will then be overlaying this, because I'm curious why it did not come up at the committee meeting if it's, if it's something that we wish to raise higher on our particular radar, you mean the the affordable housing piece. So yes, so this is being in my understanding is that Sean suggested it's and it's not a bad suggestion, but because of the 421a or b tax abatement being sought that was revealed by the presenter we're now of fixing a request. We will support that abatement request pending or predicated upon mandatory inclusionary housing of an undetermined income ban being approved. So I'm just curious. If this should be something going forward, we should include in all committee discussions for variants, whether in or not in a mandatory inclusionary housing zone. That's just a statement. Okay, you know. I do not know that you know that we should just you know, make that a practice or something you know it's our process that you know at public hearings. You know a number of board members attend sometimes more than others, and you know we arrive at a consensus on you know whether something should be disapproved approved or that should be conditional, and the process, then, is to bring it to the full board where it is further discussed, and things like this will come up. You know so I do not know. If that's something that we should. You know that we should just. Let me hear from board members on this. What do you think guys? It does not necessarily pertain to the motion. That's on the table, though this is a policy question about other applications that are not even before Spartanbu versus both have hands up, though okay Barton thanks I, think in this case it's not as if we brought the subject to bear. It was brought up by the applicant saying they were looking for 421a and I. Think it's reasonable for us to simply acknowledge the fact that we appreciate the fact that they are considering adding affordable housing to the project and therefore would like to encourage the city to approve the 421a on a separate point. You know I think Anne's, raising it as a larger issue. I would welcome the discussion. You know in a larger context, maybe as an actual agenda item, what is either official or unofficial stance of CB14 on promoting affordable housing in the neighborhood thanks bye. Thank you. So much next speaker was Glenn Borland. Thank you on one hand, I'm always in favor of affordable housing in any way we can promote it. On the other hand, when we have a committee- and we have somebody in front of us that we can give them an opportunity to respond to whatever it is, we're thinking, I think that's important and to change the nature of what we're doing after they're no longer in the meeting as a procedural issue, I think is questionable. That's it! Thank you. Okay, thank you. Glenn again, you know, as the district manager pointed out this is you know, a procedural matter that you know we can take up. You know when it's appropriate to do so, but right now you know there is this motion, or at least this recommendation. So can we just kind of table that for now and take that up, maybe and- and we have a we- I've- had a conversation with Richard Barrack and we will have another land use meeting, probably early in December, to go over special permit eulerp, and we can talk about housing policy at that at that meeting with Richard and we can bring other experts in. Did you want to do an abbreviated vote on this? Yes, recommendation to approve the application with offering additional support for their 421 arb tax abatement application? Yes, you know those opposed. Please raise your hand or, if you're on the phone you know, if anya can, if you can unmute the mics that people on the phone can vote verbally, barton prasant your hand is up. Is that a name vote? You want to raise your hand vote no. By raising your hand, thank you. Garden put his hand down and there are no hands up. It's looking unanimous, so there's no votes. The recommendation will be to approve Ed. Do you want for abstentions? On this one? Okay, we can I guess you know. According to polymer parliamentary practice, we should. Is there anyone who wishes to abstain and good abstaining? Did we have three abstentions or two sean three? We have Ann Godette. We have florence. Thank you. Yes, okay, also Brian Cunningham, just put in the chat that he's abstaining. Okay, thank you and Gail. Smith has abstained. Is there anyone who wishes to declare himself or herself ineligible to vote on this? If so, please raise your hand right now, when you say ineligible to vote, can you I mean you know? You are not eligible to vote because there might be a conflict of interest. Yes, that would be to vote. That will be me. Okay, Deborah, yeah, Deborah Valentin is eligible. Thank you. I will change the vote. Thank you, okay and sorry to have rested this away from Hindi Bendel, but I was keeping track of it and can tell you that the motion did carry the motion carries. So the recommendation to the board's recommendation will be to approve the next item: special permit, 1215-1217 East 22Nd street. After a quite a lively conversation regarding housing stock and combining lots for single-family homes. You know the recommendation to the full board is to approve this application. I should mention that combining lots as this applicant wants to do know they are allowed to do this as a right. So is there any discussion on this special permit? 1215 1217, East, 22Nd, Street, car land users, you're unmuted? If you would like to see I should I should have said that the recommendation of the full board is to approve this application. Was there someone trying to trying to speak and I interrupted, no I needed a phone user, ed I think they just had some music on it's fine. Okay, ed I, see no hands raised on this application. Okay, abbreviated vote. Is there anyone who wishes to vote no on this, raise your hand? If so, thank you Ed. This is Dwayne Joseph, I'm voting. No sorry I do not know how to raise my hand using my phone. That's all right! Thank you. I got it dwayne anyone else. You could speak or raise your hands. This is Joanne Brown, I'm voting! No. Thank you julian good. Send voting. No! Thank you. Anyone else. We have four. Yes has his hand up on the no vote. Gail Smith also know I'm having problems now, with the raised hand. Thank you. Anyone having problems with the raised hand, function is welcome to seat and just state your vote. Okay, there are no other hands on nose. If you want do you want to call it? Is there? Is there anyone who wishes to abstain on this sean? I'm sorry, I'm having a difficulty. This is Kashif. I'll raise my hand for now. Okay, Kashif is a no and we have Ann Godette and Greg. Alvarez are abstaining, okay, any other abstentions. Okay! Is there anyone who wishes to declare himself or herself ineligible to vote because of a possible conflict of interest? Yes, Deborah Valencia Deborah, Valentine yeah? That would seem to conclude the vote ed if, if we could just state for the record, though just so that it's in the public record, you know this meeting is recorded and we do have members of the public here. There might be other nuances in the application, but the conversation or the tension in this application was the was that the building was going to combine two single-family homes on two lots and it joined them into one single family home. So I did send a memo to all of the board members you should receive. You should have received it today. With your meeting reminder and again, this is another topic we can add to our discussion when we talk about land use policy for the board as a whole, but otherwise I just wanted to get that in there. Otherwise, this that was not a part of the application. What the board has obtained was the typical special permit request for side yard, Rear yard and and floor area ratio that are out of compliance. So sorry, if I just confused matters, but the motion could carry to approve it. Thank you. Thank you, Sean for reminding us and again this will. The application will be. The recommendation will be to approve. Finally, the men's shelter at 21, deurier, Place, Community, Board 14, you know to remind everyone, was not consulted on this location, but we do appreciate that DHS and the black vets for social justice presented at a public hearing held on October 21st and committed to providing real-time contact information to neighbors, ongoing engagement with the king's theater and with the jewish Board of children's and family services, and that they will establish a community advisory board I with this item. This does not require vote as I understand it. So, having reported that does in fact, conclude the chairs very lengthy report. Thank you. Everyone for your patience and all your help so we'll move on now to topical committees and their reports and items starting with community environment. The co-chairs of community environment Committee here I do not know. If there's anything to add to this I. We have not had any kind of meeting and I'm not aware of anything to really contribute at this point. Okay, thank you. Nina's Upgrade, education, libraries and cultural affairs. Sure hi folks, Carl here so update, is we do not have any meeting scheduled for November and Steve and I are thinking about maybe having a meeting in December. That's it for the update. Thank you human services. Thank you. Mr Chair, Hi, Board, Joanne Brown, here Chair, Human, Services, Committee I, do have an announcement, and just a very quick update. First announcement is that the Human Services committee is having a meeting. That meeting is on November 19th. That's a thursday. It's at 6:30, P.M virtual. We have two items on our agenda. The first item is we're going to hear from the mayor's office of immigrant affairs. There is a new outreach and organizing fellow who like to talk to us and we're also going to have a a discussion about the closing of Kingsbrook jewish Medical center's acute care beds. We plan to have a couple of physicians and employees. Talk at that meeting. I think it should be quite lively, I'd like to invite you to come and listen to the discussion about both of those topics and then just a little update about the census. I know: we've all moved on from that, because we've just come off a very interesting election season, but the census ended on October 15th. The total response, including self-response and narfu response, was 59 for kings County as we get closer. Hopefully we can come to some miracle where there is a call that the account was truncated and they will go back and look at the areas that need to be readdressed reopen. The survey that would be really great and I just want to give a respect to the veterans day is on Wednesday. Thank you so much for your service and thanks I'm done. Thank you. Joanne public Safety, Mr, Chair I. Do not warren announces that there's a pub public safety meeting on December, 2nd at 6:30 virtually at the current time. Thank you, transportation. No report at this time, chairman hello. This is Dwayne just an announcement that the Youth Service Committee will be having a meeting on Monday November 23rd. We do have two items on the agenda. We've invited a representative from the from DYCD, the Department of Youth and community development, to talk about their workforce connect programs and what they're going to look like moving forward for our young people. As you all know, our youth conference is heavily dependent on engagement from our young people, applying for whether it be syep or work, learn and grow, or some of the other workforce connect programs. So we're having a representative come and speak to what those programs might look like moving forward. So we encourage you to you know let anyone you know in the community that might be interested in getting an update on this to participate and also the second item, we're going to be continuing our discussion on developing a youth leadership council for CB14 and with that respect, or in that respect we have representatives from the office of the mayor, the Vista office of the mayor, coming in to speak to their Youth Council and what they're doing to help give us some guidance Jonathan you can. Let me know if I'm missing anything sean you can also. Let me know if I'm missing anything I think that covers it drain. Thank you all right. Thank you. All thank you Dwayne. So this brings us to our public session. Oh ed, actually, I'm so sorry at Sean, I'm going to jump in and interrupt before. You go there because I want to fill in a little bit the community environment Committee. Is they actually do have a meeting scheduled on Monday November 30th? It will be a presentation regarding the affordable housing rfq, which is the affordable housing proposed development at 22. What is it 2286 church avenue? That's the church, Avenue Bedford Avenue Lot, and it's going to be a big proposal of 100, affordable housing, I think, especially given our land use and affordable housing. Conversation tonight, it'll be of great interest to board members and beyond, and then there's going to be another discussion about NYC 5 g infrastructure, but that housing thing is a hot topic, so we hope that we'll get a good crowd at that virtually thanks. Thank you, sean okay, if there's nothing more, this brings us to our public comment period. Matters of civic interest and announcement of public events are invited. No partisan political appeals or advertising of for profit enterprises are permitted. The intent of the public comment period is to permit the board and the community a chance to hear diverse perspectives on public issues. Accordingly, speaking time will be assigned first to speakers from different groups than to speakers addressing different issues and, finally, time permitting two additional speakers on a on an issue from a single group. Sean. Do we have any preregistered speakers? I might I might lean on anya to see if there, if there's anybody who signed up on behalf of an organization, otherwise I can call on some of the elected representatives. Sure yes, no one has actually signed up, but I do see some of our regular representatives that are with us. So if you want me to address them, I can or if you want to go ahead, go ahead. You've got the voices all right. Well, this is not in order, but David Nussbaum. Would you like to speak from the department of buildings hi? Can you hear me? Yes, indeed, go ahead? Okay, just very briefly, you know prominent buildings continues our mission. As always, some services are being done remotely and some office hours are reduced, but you know you still can go into to offices to conduct your business as well. One thing I did want to bring up, which is important with regard to, of course, smoke detectors, but carbon monoxide detectors we've had a couple of incidents recently, unfortunately, where there were carbon monoxide incidents, including fatalities, so certainly very important, just to remind people to have working carbon monoxide and smoke detectors in their home or building. That's all I really have right now. Thank you. David next I see eileen Melanie Newman from the borough president. Oh hey there.
