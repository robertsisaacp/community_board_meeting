You know you can't open the office, but the request is to not do that unless it's absolutely necessary and I feel like Anya and I have managed our productivity levels remotely and to the extent that we haven't I'll, be coming into the into the office a couple of days a week and certainly still have to pick up mail I'll keep the board posted through email when we open up full time or even full ish time right now, we're still working with a lot of our bids and other businesses to assist them with information on how they reopen You, know our restaurants and are going to be cafes.
I'm, not gonna, go on and on because everybody on this board knows: I love, community board, 14, I'm gonna turn it back to you with my wishes to everybody for a beautiful wonderful summer, even though strong sends it to me as it happens, it's a son, good job, Thank, You, penny, okay, so we'll move on to topical committee reports, starting with youth services, right no particular report at the moment, mr chair, but there is a conversation which I'll let Brian talk about in the Public Safety Committee report, the he'll give where we're trying to coordinate among the committee chairs a Youth Council discussion, so I'm Looking forward to that conversation then I think we'll be having you know throughout the summer.
The census, Another area that could use some support is in Midwood, looking from Avenue I to Avenue M from Bedford Avenue over to East 22nd Street If we can get the word out in those areas and do a big push, that area is still hovering at 50% At, the Human Services Committee I gave a little shout out to one area , that's doing great up in the northern part of the district, the area of Woodruff, Avenue and cook Avenue some ocean over to the park there at 64.7% You want to be like them, let's get out rally the neighbors and lastly, also in the Ditmas Park area, from Cortelyou Road to foster the streets, abstract milk, Stratford and Spencer At sixty two point, five percent I also attended the meeting of the Brooklyn complete count committee with the borough president Every should believe in Brooklyn.
The second thing that came up during our meeting was a letter that was penned by the borough president requested that the mayor put into effect a executive order, an accent for community board input on that executive order.
I think the borough president was looking at sit participants on civic participation from the community members, so that we have more input into that on the letter we do owe arm a response back onto the bar president's office and whether or not we believe that we want to sign on to that notion.
Don't know that the borough president has described two boards was my understanding that the Public Safety Committee, however, did want to present it to the board for discussion and vote or consensus.
First I'd like to start off by saying that I have tremendous respect for the police, Anyone who's willing to risk their lives for me, and my family gets my vote, but we do know that there are a small number of police officers who probably should not be on the ball on the be working, and this letter to me is not any good.
I read the letter thoroughly and I share I'm equally concerned about exactly how accountability will be accomplished if we're putting the community board in the mix of it, along with the visits in the letter, community board leaders, community council, leader and other elected officials to vet and then have the ability to veto a person who is, you know, being considered for control at a precinct from being in consideration, Does that work such that our board is going to be given the resources to look at personnel files, so that our representatives in that discussion, which could be the board chair, might be the district manager?
Perhaps the borough president's office can provide us with a little more detail about how this would work So. Then we can evaluate the proposed reform, which I think we do need meaningful reform to gain the trust of community of police, to work together and in a way that works for everybody.
We postpone consideration of endorsing limiter until the borough presidents office to give us more details on how this plan would work So. Then we could properly evaluate the factors that go into this to make sure this not only protects the role of the community board in its oversight and its accountability and its day-to-day service delivery role as an independent entity in city government, but also that it's not going to shield those who really do have to be responsible for issues regarding race and police abuse of authority and the excessive force making sure that we don't produce barriers.
That then, have the community blame the community board for things that go wrong because we've decided or didn't side with someone versus sort of leaving that in the correct purview of NYPD and the mayor's office to respond to those concerns, which is their primary responsibility and for us to facilitate those conversations for the community So. Mr chair I would like to make that motion to postpone, with the request of the borough presidents office, would provide us with more details about what this plan would look like if implemented, We have no knowledge whatsoever of other people.
Not send the letter at all, so I do feel, like the timing is really important and I think it's actually a really interesting idea and a great opportunity to have a community court be part of a really important process in a way they haven't been before I appreciate and respect the complexity of those decisions, but I just feel like it would be an opportunity missed and that the details could be worked out later.
We know that the borough presidents office or anybody else that's working on this plan-- can provide us with the details to review in earnest If there is something we need to weigh in on, say, listen if this is included here, we think this does an even better job to accomplish, for the borough president wants to accomplish.
We can invoke the committee of the whole at the call of the board chair in order to accomplish a meeting on this Very specific complaint, so we can have a discussion and a vote on it or really, quite frankly, make whatever decision makes the most sense at that point in time, and that can happen any time after this meeting We can use the committee of the whole in order to consider this much sooner than September jon-jon, which a motion include state that had more clarity from mr chair My motion was to postpone consideration until we got the information from the borough presidents office with more detail and that point it would be up to It's been properly moved and seconded it's there again any or the discussion before we before we vote.
So, yes, I would say let you know table it, go from there and I do agree that we need to table, but I think we also need to come up with a definitive time that we will be moving forward on it, and it should be as soon as possible that we can send our questions and then do another virtual meeting to make some decisions, and you know we're going to have to vote on that motion.
Well mr Smith I think John motion included that we submit our questions to the board office and that would you know, communicate to the board president Then we will be doing that first because it appears as if we were just going to send a letter initially to the ball president.
We did your questions, your comments, your ideas to the board office, Brooklyn, email Then it was draft and bring it out back out to this Public Safety Committee to to do a final justice award.
