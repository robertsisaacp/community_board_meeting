Orson's wishing to speak during the public comment period should call the board office ahead of time to pre- register district manager.
If you'd, like faith, is to, as many of you know, did begin today and our office just to report , my board is: We are not moving back into open, fully very swiftly, we're still waiting for some supplies.
You know you can't open the office, but the request is to not do that unless it's absolutely necessary and I feel like Anya, And I have managed our productivity levels remotely and to the extent that we have not I'll be coming into the into the office a couple of days a week and certainly still have to pick up mail I'd water, some plants, but we I'll keep the board posted through email when we open up full time or even full ish time right now You know afternoons a week, but we will still be continuing most of our work.
I won't go too far down this road because we do not usually do service delivery, but I eat So. We know we have had requests from community members who want to try to address the issue without calling three one, nine one and on our website we have added a letter for FDNY enforcement, but we also have some resources there.
I spoke with somebody, a lieutenant from Brooklyn borough, south today, and there they're going to be providing a lot of materials, posters and flyers, and that sort of thing People can pick them up from the office.
When I'm here Together community oriented, way, but- And, certainly you know, feel free to contact the office or handle it as you see fit within, obviously within reason.
Look around you You know board members of the board, are volunteers in their own communities in their own respect and do the work that you do before you come to the board.
Mr. Chairman, as some folks may know, my colleagues from Albany senators and fulfill their Assemblyman SEM, 5:15 And I had some important work to take care of at Kohlberg Park this week, And it's been restored to the people.
Budget request this year and the one thing that the Alliance was hoping to get community board support on is funding for the Charley's, their Shirley Chisholm's Center, and you know it's never been.
The Human Services Committee I gave a little shout out to one area , that's doing great up in the northern part of the district, the area of Woodruff, Avenue and cook Avenue Some ocean over to the park there at 64.7% You want to be like them, let's get out rally the neighbors and lastly, also in the Ditmas Park area, from Cortelyou Road to foster the streets, abstract, milk, Stratford and Spencer Five percent I also attended the meeting of the Brooklyn complete count committee with the borough.
We were presenting a me Michael fund, the Brooklyn, Public Library presented, and let us know what their continuing efforts some home and remotely they're still working with children, and they have lots of education going out using their budget wisely, and we also heard from the US Census.
Second thing that came up during our meeting was a letter that was penned by the borough president requested that the mayor put into effect a executive order, an accent for community board input on that executive, order.
The, executive order on in short, asked is that the community board have some oversight and input on the selection of priests and command officers and have beatle power.
We do not agree with the commanding officer the spirit of the letter, I think the borough president was looking at sit participants on civic participation from the community members, so that we have more input into that.
The spirit of the letter is that many board members would have some input in the selection of the commanding officer in their presense, which would be the 7th presense for Community Board 14.
Last item that we discussed was how do we infuse greater participation from younger members of our community in our community board, similar to what Jalan arm did with the census, which is essentially having a task force that can examine from the committee chairs how we can listed greater input from younger people on the community.
Do not know that the borough president has described two boards My understanding that the Public Safety Committee, however, did want to present it to the board for discussion and vote or consensus.
But we do know that there are a small number of police officers who probably should not be on the ball on the be working, and this letter to me is not any good Simply setting up a situation like we did in the 70s, with the Board of Education.
First I do want to commend the Borough President Eric Adams, for coming up with innovative ways to address the concern we have about policing about making sure black lives matter, making sure that policing is a just and equitable of community Public Safety for everybody.
And I think it's actually a really interesting idea and a great opportunity to have a community court be part of a really important process in a way they have not been before I appreciate and respect the complexity of those decisions, but I just feel like it would be an opportunity missed and that the details could be worked out.
We know that the borough presidents office or anybody else that's working on this plan-- can provide us with the details to review in earnest.
The committee of the whole at the call of the board chair in order to accomplish a meeting on this very specific complaint, so we can have a discussion and a vote on it or really, quite frankly, make whatever decision makes the most sense at that point in time, and that can happen any time after this meeting.
My motion was to postpone consideration until we got the information from the borough presidents office with more detail and that point it would be up to It's been properly moved and seconded it's there again any or the discussion before we before we vote.
It just seems like we're asking for a more democratic process and the nomination and the selection process of commanding officers who serve our community seems to me pretty squarely within our bounds of the Community, Board and I Would much rather say we approve it now and then work on the details as they come out as I.
Think I can you know reasonably have some input into the into the selection of commanding, at least being one of the cities and democratically, and the democratic process of warning community officer, so I would prefer to table Or I.
Do not even I do not know what the correct Robert's Rules are chair, but what I would like to do is actually vote on the actual motion and move forward with the borough.
Not I, do know very little about the commanding officer role, but I do know that I think they're in charge of setting the culture of the precinct, and that seems to be just as important as being able to implement accountability.
But I do think that we need to meet some of the questions that we want to ask of the borough president, and then we need.
And I do agree that we need to table, You know we're going to have to vote on that motion.
We could email Shaun the district manager's office with questions we have And, then maybe we could say that we will convene a committee of the whole within 72 hours of a response in order to consider the borough president's response.
Think John motion included that we submit our questions to the board office and that would you know, communicate to the board.
It's a Mr., Chair, Mr., Chair I, just like to for the personal privilege, I think we should just do a vocal vote and go down the list of Attendees Board member This is a procedural motion just to wait until we get more information from the borough presidents office in order to act immediately after getting that information.
