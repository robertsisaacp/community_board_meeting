Now, at 5:30, 9:00 p.m. under the applicable statutes, New York State, the charter of New York City, the board's bylaws and Robert's Rules of Order. The board's policy is to encourage detailed public discussion of matters before the board and our committee meetings and let public hearings consequently accept by board members. There will be no public discussion at our regular monthly meetings of matters about which a public hearing or committee meeting has been held. Specific delivery requests or complaints should be brought to the attention of the district office staff by calling the board office during regular business hours or by visiting our website anytime. Contact information is on the back. Well, it's not on the back table, so we'll eliminate that part. Other matters of civic interest may be brought before the board during our scheduled of the comment period, which will begin tonight. After all, other business on the board's monthly meeting agenda has been concluded. No partisan political appeals or advertising of for-profit enterprises will be heard. Orson's wishing to speak during the public comment period should call the board office ahead of time to pre-register district manager. Are there you know any other means by which people can register to speak during the comment period? No, the deadline has passed, but if anybody wants information posted on our website or another announcements made, they can email them to us anything emailed to us before the end of this meeting will be added into the minutes as an addendum. Okay, at this time, I'm gonna ask the board secretary to call the roll. This is the Secretary on, as in the last meetings that we did via WebEx we're not going to do roll call just because it's a little bit unloading have a list of all of the attendees and participants, and we will take attendance Lesley and put it in minutes that makes sense I just mr. chairman, yes, sir, yes, sir Thank You Sean, are you able to watch to do a quick look at the attendees and do a count and tell us if we're 26? Are you able to take a look at that you're able to look at? Yes, we have okay, I got that hand is raised. Ephraim chair recognizes Ephraim, Nuremberg, okay, so we'll move on then to the to the meeting agenda, starting with approval of the minutes have been distributed by email, so I'm going to ask for a motion to the minutes there. A second then properly moved and seconded that for approval of the minutes, those in favor say aye opposing no opposing. Now every no votes the minutes are approved. District manager, Sean Campbell try to be briefly. We had a district service cabinet meeting on Wednesday June 10th and needs from a lot of city agencies that have been working really hard. It was I'm always so impressed and amazed by some of my colleagues and their willingness to work hard and work together. We had great reports from DSN ycm DHS breaking ground if to do hm8 Commission on Human, Rights and bids and elected officials, and it made me feel even sadder that we're not having our annual reception this year, because I would love to be gathered with you. All and I also just always appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge partners, but so since we can't do that, I did I did write a letter to one really outstanding agency through all of us, which has been the Department of Sanitation, and it may be even mentioned this last meeting, but they've gone well beyond the extra mile to take care setting up for and cleaning up after the many food, pantries and testing sites, and because it's quieter in our commercial street there's a lot of illegal drop-offs and they're still working the three. You know three shifts a day, but they've just been outstanding and there's nothing. We that we've asked for that. They haven't said absolutely right and been just great about it. We also, as I mentioned at our last pain together arena at that time was retired, and now she has retired Friday was her last day. You know, and it's difficult for somebody who's been here for so long for us to not have a real, formal way to say goodbye, so hopefully we'll get together later in the year. But in the meantime, if anybody wants to send a card here to the or email to my s, Campbell account something nice I could toss it into a card and mail it off to her. I just wanted to be I wanted to offer that, because some people had asked so I'd be happy to facilitate that communication. If you'd, like faith is to, as many of you know, did begin today and our office just to report, my board is: we are not moving back into open, fully very swiftly, we're still waiting for some supplies. It will just be me and onion, so we will we've been the request right now. Is you know you can't open the office, but the request is to not do that unless it's absolutely necessary and I feel like Anya and I have managed our productivity levels remotely and to the extent that we haven't I'll, be coming into the into the office a couple of days a week and certainly still have to pick up mail and I promised Orion I'd water, some plants, but we I'll keep the board posted through email when we open up full time or even full ish time right now, I'll be here a couple. You know afternoons a week, but we will still be continuing most of our work remotely. Of course, I would yield my board and in any you know, guidance or risk web requests or wishes that you have about that. You know please let us know and we'll certainly take it into consideration and then speak to the Chairman about it, we're still working with a lot of our bids and other businesses to assist them with information on how they reopen. You know our restaurants and are going to be cafes, a lot of them, and so I was on the phone call with D-O-T last Friday to try to get the information sorted out, but D-O-T said that they are going to approve they're, going to err on the side of approving and so and only really respond. If they hadn't approved to it by you know, it will be complaint driven. So let us know what you're seeing out there, and hopefully it's all good enjoyable fun. What has not been enjoyable, fun and I won't go too far down this road because we don't usually do service delivery, but I eat really I feel a mess. If I didn't note that, yes, we have had a lot of firework complaints and we all live here. So we know we have had requests from community members who want to try to address the issue without calling three one, nine one and on our website we have added a letter for FDNY enforcement, but we also have some resources there. If we want to the extent that we as a community can handle this as a public service announcement and public service support, because it is a danger and there have been critical injuries near our community because of fireworks, so we have posters there's a great video that ends with the tagline, keep washing your hands, don't risk losing them and we will be kidding additional materials. I spoke with somebody, a lieutenant from Brooklyn borough south today, and there they're going to be providing a lot of materials, posters and flyers, and that sort of thing and we'll let you know when they can be you pick. People can pick them up from the office when I'm here I'll try to put the word out for that and I'm also happy to drop things off it within the district. So we'll try to get the message out in a more you know we're all in this together community oriented way, but- and certainly you know, feel free to contact the office or handle it as you see fit within obviously within reason. But let us know if we can be helpful and should there be if the city should respond with another tact. For this you know we'll be on top of that and I'll circulate that information as well, so that wasn't, as short as I thought, it was going to be sorry. I am done now, though. Thank you, John, sherry for well. If we've been able to hold our annual reception this year, we would of course, normally dedicate it. The community board 14 conference room, which has aptly been renamed, the Alvin M Burke community room I, can tell you. There have been amazing improvements in here in terms of technology. Sure when I came in showed me some of the new high-tech stuff and I can tell you guys. You're gonna be really impressed. This room had has had a lot of Technology and sound upgrades that will increase the quality of public hearings and commendably committee meetings. You know once we can gather again, I really look forward to the at the annual reception. Excuse me. We do take time to welcome new members appointed the or president Zakia Khan and Michele Brunson. This year's new appointees and we look forward to working with them. I also want to take some members, like some members, actually will be leaving the board greater or more relaxed and next chapters in their lives. Laurie, neidell and Valentino were veteran board members who served the board and the greater community with grace and wisdom. A jamaica Gaskins served three terms as the board member and as our liaison to Kings County Medical Center. Thank you all. Thank you. I also want to announce that I have appointed to new cultures for the education, libraries and cultural affairs committee, Steve, D, Cohen and call Henry, say: SAR have agreed to lead this committee and I thank them for stepping up and I want to express appreciation for the years of service and leadership by florence. Valentina and Kol Smith previously chaired this committee, like that wraps it up culturally chairs report. Well, according to the agenda I'm, looking at, we move on now to a topical committees before we do, though, I know that we have at least one elected official presidential, aide and I just like to give him an opportunity to say a few words Cal. Are you still with it? How are you, sir? Okay, with all the technological upgrades I'm still using my Commodore 64, to communicate so I'm gonna? Do the best I can first again, this is our last before the end of the year, and obviously we usually have our reception I've been going to the reception, I would say, probably for over 25 years, because I think I started when I was four, so I'm gonna miss it this you guys there are some great pictures hanging on the wall of me when I had more hair, and none of it was great look around you'll, find them good old ones. I do want to seriously thank the board members for all their. You know board members of the board, are volunteers in their own communities in their own respect and do the work that you do before you come to the board and I know that I know a lot of what a lot of you do. I, don't know everything that all of you do, but I do want to thank you and, of course, I have to thank Shawn. We communicate I think far more often than she wants to, but several times a week. She is, she knows every corner of the district and every problem that's happening frequently long before any of us do and she's usually honored by the time we start talking about it and I'm very grateful for how she's kept the board was functioning in her in a real way over the last three months, just a real, quick update and then I'll turn it back to you. Mr. chairman, as some folks may know, my colleagues from Albany senators and fulfill their Assemblyman SEM, 5:15 and I had some important work to take care of at Kohlberg Park this week and we did and it's been restored to the people today. We actually have entered phase two, so it's now actually lawfully open. We take the position that it was lawfully open last week because the governor said he leaves it to local government to decide when to open the playgrounds and I, don't see how you get more local than your councilman, so I'm very happy that Kohlberg Park was restored thanks. The chair knows, and members of the board have been around for a while. That Park has seen a lot of days before it's all good days, and my predecessor spent a good number of years putting the money in the parks department to do that, rehab that, in my first few months in the council, I was able to take credit for his work and cut a ribbon and Alvin. Mr. chairman emeritus was there and it was a four million dollar rehab. It is a beautiful park. It's my childhood park. It's the park, I spent thousands of hours as a kid. It's the park that my siblings and I have brought our own kids to and it's restored to. The community, like all of our parks, ought to be- and this just brings us to where we are at phase two I- think people will start noticing. Some of our local restaurants are availing themselves of the outdoor dining I have noticed it already myself on Avenue M, there's a very quick and easy process by which a restaurant that wishes to avail itself of outdoor dining along its frontage. We talked about it at the last meeting. It's a process where you can submit an application to the D-O-T. It's almost an automated process, and only if there is a problem is there a No, so I've seen some of those pop up and I'm really happy because it you know me it may seem a little inconveniences to pedestrians and the like, but it's really important that we get our small businesses back up and running people who work there live in our neighborhoods. It's really good. So this is my pitch if you're out and you see a business a storm and you don't need something but hey, why not? Stop? By buy a cup of coffee buy a donut buy something we have to really do our part to push our local businesses they're suffering immensely their rent didn't go away, their taxes didn't go away and they need our help and we have to do the best. We can, please don't buy online. If you don't have to that's my pitch. Go local! We're here, we're back. The neighborhood is back and we have to build it up. We have great shopping district Oneonta and you could tell your roads, not in my district, but it's in the board didn't miss so many places where you can actually come to my Avenue ma Avenue J I'll do what you can I'm, not gonna, go on and on because everybody on this board knows I love, community board, 14 I love every edge of it been on this board for 18 years. I haven't got going away until you throw me off mr. chairman, I'm gonna turn it back to you, with my wishes to everybody for a beautiful, wonderful summer. God willing, when we meet in September I, would love to be able to see each of you in person. If that's not what the Stars hold for us, then we'll do it this way. But everybody here knows how to find me. If you need me, thank you, Thank You, councilmember God's number. Are there other officials online right now? If so, please identify yourself. Okay, hearing no one I'm, not an elected official but I'm, a representative of an elected official, it's Benny Ringo from the maze, okay, Patti sure, just a low Sangalo and they're listening in and I will write down all the complaints, even though strong sends it to me as it happens, it's a son, good job, Thank, You, penny, okay, so we'll move on to topical committee reports, starting with youth services. Let's go back to youth services. I think we need to get Jonathan judge, unmuted and Dwayne his anon right, no particular report at the moment, mr. chair, but there is a conversation which I'll let Brian talk about in the Public Safety Committee report, the he'll give where we're trying to coordinate among the committee chairs a Youth, Council discussion, so I'm. Looking forward to that conversation, then I think we'll be having you know throughout the summer. The bullet Brian sophomore about that. Otherwise, likewise is everyone saying have a wonderful summer and hopefully we'll be able to see each other when we all get back in the summer angers crossed. Thank you. Thank you. Community environment unmute, your microphone and, if co-chairs are present all right. Thank you who was speaking. That was meanness of gear, and this is Sean now may I chime in real quickly on this one. Of course, I will bring this directly to Donald logins meanness of gear, I, email, but kind of want to even get ahead a little bit, because the I was on a Prospect Park Alliance committee, a Comicon meeting, and there is a request from the parks. You know we are still doing her. You know budget request this year and the one thing that the Alliance was hoping to get community board support on is funding for the Charley's, their Shirley Chisholm's Center, and you know it's never been. Even it's never been more poignant than now to support that, and so I will draft up a letter on behalf of the committee and share it with the chairs, but just wanted to put it before the board before it goes out. That I would hope that the board would want to support the park alliances request for that funding. It's they have most of it, so it's only another 3.5 million dollars. Let me know how Human Services with the co-chairs. Please unmute your mic good evening. Mister co-chair Jo, Ann Brown, here co-chair Human, Services, Committee I do have a rapport good evening. Everyone on June 9th we had a meeting of the Human Services Committee and the CV 14 census, 2020 complete committee task force. It took place on June 9th at 5:30 in the evening via WebEx, and, of course, our mission was to report on our efforts to make Brooklyn count. 100% I just have an update with regards to how our district is doing well with the updated information on the census count overall in the borough, Chains counties response rate is 49. Points worked for forty nine point: five percent. As of last night, slightly up from the last time that I reported to this board and my committee, we still have some troublesome areas with reporting. They got slightly better. So now it's sort of a light orange as opposed to a darker orange again, the area of Church Avenue to the junction and some SlapFish Avenue to Bedford. That area going to the south is at forty four five point: five percent to 50 percent. So if you have partners in that area, we still need to get information out to our neighbors to get them to respond the census. Another area that could use some support is in Midwood, looking from Avenue I to Avenue M from Bedford Avenue over to East 22nd Street. Unless that would be the east part of Midwood and then the west part from Avenue J to Avenue Edna as Nancy the center of Midwood over to Coney on Avenue. So if we can get the word out in those areas and do a big push, that area is still hovering at 50%. At the Human Services Committee I gave a little shout out to one area, that's doing great up in the northern part of the district, the area of Woodruff, Avenue and cook Avenue some ocean over to the park there at 64.7%, so they're beating everyone in the district. If you want to be like them, let's get out rally the neighbors and lastly, also in the Ditmas Park area, from Cortelyou Road to foster the streets, abstract milk, Stratford and Spencer they're also doing great they're at sixty two point, five percent I also attended the meeting of the Brooklyn complete count committee with the borough president. One big takeaway from that meeting was the phone banking efforts of the New York Census. This is not the United States Bureau, but this is the New York City effort and they have a phone banking. Every should believe in Brooklyn. It is. Let me just take a look at this in Brooklyn, it's every Tuesdays between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. it's really easy to sign up to use the application, and you can spend two hours of your time, calling your neighbors reminding them to fill out the census. At our overall meeting at the Hume for this Human Services Committee, we were presenting a me Michael fund, the Brooklyn Public Library presented, and let us know what their continuing efforts some home and remotely they're still working with children, and they have lots of education going out using their budget wisely, and we also heard from the US Census. They just updated us on the timeline which, let me just give you a finder of the timeline. Self-Response is still going into october. 2020 at the end of the month, field offices are starting to open this month. If you have any available space and are willing to host a training, the bureau would much appreciate the space they have lots of lot of newly hired temporary employees, who they're going to send out to do the non-response collection. So that's about it for my report. Thank you so much for your time and please, let me know if you have any questions. Thank You Joanne before we move on Shawn just reminded me that the chair of the Kings County, Democratic, Party, Assemblymember rod, needs to be shot, has just joined us and I'd like to give her every opportunity to address the board. Assemblymember Bush doing speak people, language speak and disappearing, destroying. How are you and the whole board? Oh hey? How are you I just quickly wanted to? First everybody welcome I know this is the last meeting I wish everybody a quick summer as we're trying to figure out how to be opening city, but I've wanted to really touch base on election tomorrow. Just so, you know we're trying to accommodate the train schedule. As you know, the Train starts at five million and our home workers need to be at the full site. So we have been fighting with why not fighting we've been working with the MTA and to allow a 4:00 a.m. start an MTA, so that our poor workers will give them time to open the concepts of success. So we might have a little champs. I know there are a number of people who said that in DC get balanced, so we try to work both issues. I would suggest that if you're looking to go, maybe you want to start at 7:00 in the event that there will be a delay in sending up the pro side. That's very important. I wouldn't want anybody to be waiting outside. As you know, the social distancing bees will be implemented as well when they walk in they'll, give you sanitizer why'd. You have individual pen and you can go in and look for also know that there were a number of easy selection districts that we're moving. Why? Because all the nursing homes, all the senior homes anything from there were eliminated from this election and the reason why is ours, there's a cold? There were some other issues in terms of overcrowding, because we need to implement social distancing, so I would suggest that each and every one of you look to see and then. Lastly, if you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with me at my office of money 9400 what we are doing, a number of mass distribution, then, if your organization, when you're building over your faith-based institution or Emily's institution whatever it is, if you're interested in doing a max distribution event, please contact my office. The governor had sent us thousands of masks and it's to do events with all of you, so maybe 14 yeah I, know well, you would be pleased, but thank you. Everyone, Thank You, mr. chair. Well, mr. president, I should say: go along to see and I will see if I can quickly do some information. Thank you, okay, Thank You Assemblymember. Are there any other elected officials online right now, okay, hearing none, we'll move on with our agenda committee co-chairs please on unmute your mic. This is Glenn. Roland I had my hand up. I have a couple of questions: I might okay! My first question is for Joanne. She said: Brooklyn is doing about 49%. So far, I'd like to know how that compares to the rest of the country. Are we doing reasonably well or not, and also for Rodney's, be shot the masks that are being distributed? What quality masks are those thank you, I'm, muting, now, okay, Joanne Brown. Here. Let me just quickly look up that information on the hard to count hard to count. Map and I'll put the chat. Okay, I'll! Let you know how king cutting is doing versus the United States. If you're, if you're, not speaking, please mute your mic. A lot of background noise, from your hand, is still up. Is that from before you can move to the next. The next item on the agenda: please: okay, I'm having a little trouble with my video, oh here, okay, Public Safety good evening, Thank You mr. chair good evening, members on, as it's been stated earlier, wishing everyone a very happy summer and hope all is well with everyone with all the social distance and that's been taken place. The Public Safety Committee met on Wednesday at 5:30. Lastly, wins at 5:30 and three major items or three takeaways came up. The first was the DA's office made a presentation on some of the services they have been providing throughout on this period of social distancing and provided with, provided us with a number of resources of the numbers, we can call in the event that we need their services, I believe some of that information may have gone out via email, but how could that re-shared? But they made a presentation on Wednesday just about what they've been doing while we've been quarantined. The second thing that came up during our meeting was a letter that was penned by the borough president requested that the mayor put into effect a executive order, an accent for community board input on that executive order. The executive order on in short, asked is that the community board have some oversight and input on the selection of priests and command officers and have beatle power. If we don't agree with the commanding officer the spirit of the letter, I think the borough president was looking at sit participants on civic participation from the community members, so that we have more input into that on the letter we do owe arm a response back onto the bar president's office and whether or not we believe that we want to sign on to that notion. I believe Shaun sent around the letter last week, Thursday to the entire board to read ahead of this meeting. But the spirit of the letter is that many board members would have some input in the selection of the commanding officer in their presense, which would be the 7th presense for community board 14. The last item that we discussed was: how do we infuse greater participation from younger members of our community in our community board, similar to what Jalan arm did with the census, which is essentially having a task force that can examine from the committee chairs how we can listed greater input from younger people on the community boards? We believe that their civic engagement is critical to our public safety and we want to make sure their voices I'm not drowned out and are included in some of the discourse I'm sure there's some way to channel their energy and their ideas. So those are the three things that came up during our public safety meeting on Wednesday. Previously to the question regarding and if I may, as a medical, professional, just clarified less, you are actively working with contagious individuals, contagious individuals, you do not, because in order to be effective and a soft mask prevent the spray that comes out of our mouths, when we talk sneeze et cetera, from going out into the atmosphere and if we are, they asymptomatic, but infectious preventing our potentially infecting other people around us. Thank You Nina on correct me if I'm wrong, but I believed the President's request or award sign on to his letter requires a I. Don't know if that's I don't know that the borough president has described two boards, how they would decide whether or not they're signing on it was my understanding that the Public Safety Committee, however, did want to present it to the board for discussion and vote or consensus I'll defer back to the to the chair on whether it's you know which one of those thank you district manager definitely wanted to make sure the board was aware of it and I'll throw it onto the board for discussion. We did not have enough members of the Public Safety Committee on the call on Wednesday for us to make a determination on how we should respond so definitely wanted to give the board an opportunity to hear about it and provide some discussion of it. Yes, thank you. Mr. chair I would like to comment on this letter. I have read it through quite thoroughly and I have a couple of comments. First, I'd like to start off by saying that I have tremendous respect for the police. Anyone who's willing to risk their lives for me and my family gets my vote, but we do know that there are a small number of police officers who probably should not be on the ball on the be working, and this letter to me is not any good, it has no teeth. It's simply setting up a situation like we did in the 70s with the Board of Education. We would put a bunch of people. This is a similar kind of thing. I would like. Let me interrupt you once more. If you're, not speaking, please, okay, I, think that what he's proposing doesn't really hold anybody accountable. It's just a way of getting people involved who have no expertise in policing? Is it possible to get my picture up, so everyone can see it because I have something I want to display for everybody that Clark came up with some ideas that I think would go much further in terms of making a difference for those overly aggressive police officers or racist police officers to hold them accountable if they act inappropriately so I still don't see my picture up here. Is there any way of doing that? It's there in other people's computers, you're right, my screen? Okay! So, let's see if I can I don't know, is this legible? Can you read this I can't read it all right, I'll, just an outsize it, but this is what II bet. Clark came up with four things: it's called justice and policing Act, which includes increases fairness and transparency and Laura's forcement with the National police misconduct registry, elimination of the cooling-off period, so that if a police officer does something possibly wrong, they have to answer questions right away, not two weeks later, police accountability, Act giving the Justice Department jurisdiction to bring criminal charges, including murder, against officers who kill civilians in the line of duty. If the state fails to do so and finally to stop militarizing law enforcement act, stop states and local law enforcement agencies from accessing the Department of Defense's supplies. Now it's a little more than that, but something along those lines which actually holds bad actors accountable, makes much more sense than putting a bunch of civilians who know nothing about policing in the mix. Okay, I'm done. Thank you very much. Thank you. So I have some thoughts here. First I do want to commend the Borough President Eric Adams, for coming up with innovative ways to address the concern we have about policing about making sure black lives matter, making sure that policing is a just and equitable of community Public Safety for everybody. So I really do appreciate the borough president for coming up with these ideas and then engaging our board in the discussion. I read the letter thoroughly and I share. Some of my colleagues concerns that he expressed mr. Rowland with regard to how this would work and honestly I have some assumptions, but I feel that the language is very vague on how this would work. I'm equally concerned about exactly how accountability will be accomplished if we're putting the community board in the mix of it, along with the visits in the letter, community board leaders, community council, leader and other elected officials to vet and then have the ability to veto a person who is, you know, being considered for control at a precinct from being in consideration and I'm wondering a few things about that? How does that work? Does that work such that our board is going to be given the resources to look at personnel files, so that our representatives in that discussion, which could be the board chair, might be the district manager? We don't really know that hasn't been fleshed out. Will they be well informed so that they could be countable to our board, that they've made good choices based on our policies and values for our community and then being a representative voice that way? How does this also affect the role of the community board? If something were to go right? What we then be held accountable to the public and a personnel action that, quite frankly and I, agree with my colleague? Are we relieved the right people to make that decision to veto someone from consideration when our community board role is advisory on purpose? Our job is to be the overseer to be the ones who are in compliance? Who are there to make sure city government, no matter whose place role is being held accountable, is working with the community to solve problems and whatever the city services that we depend on in an equitable and just fashion, no matter what service it is, but particularly for law enforcement and I worry about the institution of the community board. If we now start having or say and who gets these positions, how does that politicize the board? What is the structure look like for us to be able to make these decisions so that the public, as if anything, more faith in the institution of city, government and law enforcement? That is going to do the right thing by everybody and not a new opportunity to sort of pass the buck from those who should be in charge of doing the right thing and that layered ruffles throughout the chain of command, so I think my recommendation would be. I would like to move to postpone consideration of agreeing to this letter, and so I am making this motion up until whatever point in time. Perhaps the borough president's office can provide us with a little more detail about how this would work. So then we can evaluate the proposed reform, which I think we do need meaningful reform to gain the trust of community of police, to work together and in a way that works for everybody. I do think this is a good thing, but I would move that. We postpone consideration of endorsing limiter until the borough presidents office to give us more details on how this plan would work. So then we could properly evaluate the factors that go into this to make sure this not only protects the role of the community board in its oversight and its accountability and its day-to-day service delivery role as an independent entity in city government, but also that it's not going to shield those who really do have to be responsible for issues regarding race and police abuse of authority and the excessive force making sure that we don't produce barriers. That, then, have the community blame the community board for things that go wrong because we've decided or didn't side with someone versus sort of leaving that in the correct purview of NYPD and the mayor's office to respond to those concerns, which is their primary responsibility and for us to facilitate those conversations for the community. So mr. chair I would like to make that motion to postpone, with the request of the borough presidents office, would provide us with more details about what this plan would look like if implemented. Thank you Jonathan. So motion is on the floor. I think we've all heard what the motion is there any further discussion on this speak. If I made note we're sure we are entering into a position which we have absolutely as Glen had said, we have absolutely no expertise in none other than Edie Powell and myself, who have a very long history. With this, we can't even begin to appreciate the emilion zuv facets that these commanders have to deal with. Nor can we know who is prepared to bring in and who is not prepared to bring in. We have no knowledge whatsoever of other people. This is an enormous task when somebody is in charge of 300 or 400 24 hours a day, cops 24 hours a day, seven days a week with gang units, drug units, narcotics, undercover, it's just so many so many so many issues that we cannot evaluate and we're not prepared to evaluate to have a community input for that is just in it. I can't see it very frankly, so I certainly am in the in the tamp not to approve this or to delay it at the best, at least so, just because I am trying to take notes. Four minutes was that seconding the motion or to shelve it frankly, but I think there's already one ocean on the table, so you couldn't really make another motion. So are you stuck etting the motion because there's still the motion on the table, the motion I believe is to is to shelve it. Is it not mr. chair if I may just clarify yeah? My intention was do to postpone consideration of endorsing the plan until at least we've had a chance to review a more detailed plan from the bar president about this. What this would look like and then at that point we can decide whether or not how to go about considering it with greater details provided to us to then decide if we would want to endorse it. Okay, you heard the motion: is there a second mr. chair, Glenn, Roland I, think this motion was premature. We was trying to have a discussion on this letter and long before the discussion got off the ground. A motion was proposed. It's premature we're not ready to vote on a motion, and this is just because Jonathan knows the rules of order, but this is still incorrect. We should the full discussion. Can you hear me? Okay, yes, and let's see if my baby starts crying, so just regarding Jonathan's motion, but also just as part of the general discussion. A few comments regarding Jonathan's point around timing. Honestly I feel like if you get the details worked out and you revise it and like I agree with you, it doesn't have a lot of teeth, but if we send this in two months, it's totally meaningless and like you might as well, not send the letter at all, so I do feel, like the timing is really important and I think it's actually a really interesting idea and a great opportunity to have a community court be part of a really important process in a way they haven't been before I appreciate and respect the complexity of those decisions, but I just feel like it would be an opportunity missed and that the details could be worked out later. I say that recognizing my gross and experience in community things regarding the comment about the community boards, expertise and our ability to weigh in on something I strongly disagree with that when you're participating in a job interview or a scholarship panel or even voting for an elected official, you don't have to be an expert in that person's ability to do their job. You can evaluate their ability to do the part of their job that affects you or has to do with their relationship with you. So I do think as again respect her. Both of the comments made so far but I think it'd, be. The timing is important. It's an opportunity for us to be involved in something important and I. Do think that you don't have to be like experts and how the police work to weigh in. So. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Is there any additional discussion, okay, Jonathan and Nicole, so that we can be a part of it? So I think it will be also a missed opportunity for all of us, so I suppose, yes, yeah ii of the Johnsons motion, and so we will move on to can I think one last comment please. Mr. chairman yeah, the Nature has simply to do with who was hired as the CEO, but in this case is 17th precinct. What's he why'd the precinct commanders now, if one of the police office does the wrong uses the chokehold and does something inappropriate, there is nothing else for us to do. This letter doesn't give any teeth to dealing with a specific problem. That's my main objection to it. So we may have may not be any good at putting a priest and Commander and I suspect. We would not be very good because we don't know the hundreds of things that you need to know a person commander s. Well, my main objection is: if someone does something wrong, there is no way to hold them accountable. Based on this letter, I'm done. Thank you very much that you know is proposing. So that's a really big consideration: clarification from Borough Hall if we wish to move forward, I personally intend to abstain all right, but the second issue is there is no review, so somebody could come in with an excellent CV and we agree with them by in the event that they take actions or that they don't counsel their police in accordance with respectful police, and you know CPR that we see on the sides of their vehicles. You need to have the ability board and community for Laurel. We need to have the ability to review it and that's what I'd like to. Thank you hi, thanks for what has become a very robust discussion. Definitely also my head attorney. I just wanted to say a couple, quick things, I hear, I think it was Glenn's concerns about this particular proposal, not being the be-all end-all of sort of policing before him, but I, don't think it's mutually exclusive to any of the reforms proposed by Congress member Clark or other folks and I. Don't think that you know itself is a reason to oppose the idea. The second thing I wanted to say is that, while I respect that policing, that of course takes expertise and specialized knowledge, you know Frankie if NYPD was able to operate independently and sort of make leadership and systemic decisions on their own in good faith- and you know with the holistic community concerns in mind, we wouldn't be having this discussion in the first place. Obviously, there's a need from work. Community input, there's a need for building equal relationships and changing those decision-making processes. So the idea that it's sort of impossible for us to know and make an informed decision, I strongly agree with I think it was Nicole's point that you know we vote for elected officials. We as a community work on a wide variety of complex policy and planning issues. All the time and I know the majority of us are not experts quote on all those issues. So it's not clear to me why this would fundamentally different I. Also think when we vote on those issues, you know if there are flaws in them, we're not held legally liable. You know it's the community board votes on a transportation planning or a bike or a bus lane. It doesn't then become if it's not perfectly implemented at first community boards, quote-unquote fault, I, don't think we should shy away from the opportunity to be engaged more deeply in these decision-making processes. I think they're, incredible important. It gets an opportunity for the community and the police department in the precinct to certainly agree with the critique that before have an input in this decision is totally a given. There needs to be some sort of process in place that determines exactly what about an individual officer or candidates. Qualifications and history is given to us what is made public and that is sort of what jumps out to me. He has the most immediate concern, but on the whole, I think the idea, even it's sort of ambiguous or flawed articulation, is fundamentally a good one. Mr. chair I just wanted to clarify the point of my motion because I think it addresses what everybody's talking about, namely that even in just hearing mr. Richland and then and hearing other people talk about the urgency of doing something. That's fine. We can get the details from the road president as soon as they come in. We have the committee of the whole in able to convene the board whatever public meeting notice Department we need to. We want to take action in the next week and a half after receiving details that we can review. So we can say yes to mr. Richland point that there's this is the process for handling, and this is the information will be provided, so we can weigh in on it or being able to say well, you know what just like our public rather are our special permit process, where our guidelines are keeping character of the community and weighing in on math. You know, maybe there's a certain guideline for how we can get involved here. Whatever those details are, we don't have anything really right now to wholeheartedly endorse an executive order that the mayor would have to agree to in order to implement a process that has not been spelled out for us, so the only point in tabeling is handling it until such time, which could be in the next two days. For all. We know that the borough presidents office or anybody else that's working on this plan- can provide us with the details to review in earnest. So then we can make a conscientious decision in the time that we're in now, but then the next week or two if we have to but we'll, have the details, our review, so that way also what if it doesn't go far enough. What? If what? If, whatever we're looking to do in such a process, what if it doesn't go far enough? What if there is something we need to weigh in on, say, listen if this is included here, we think this does an even better job to accomplish for the borough president wants to accomplish. We need to be able to have that conversation and right now, while we endorse the notion of it is I think we all agree that performs are due and that we should be pursuing them. We just don't really know exactly what this would look like and we want to make sure we don't do harm in a different way. We want to make sure we don't do something bad makes another problem pop up because we're in a rush to make things fair for everyone. You know just as unfortunately as well when justice comes, it has to be more resolute and that's something that our community board and the community waters institution is going to do so again. It's just wrap up I'm, not saying that we put this off till September I'm, not saying we don't seize the moment. The motion to table, which is what we're discussing at this point, is simply to say as soon as if our president provides us with more details for us to consider. So we can truly weigh and discuss the merits of the plan in its entirety that we would want the mayor to implement by executive order, but then we'll discuss it, and that means we have a meeting in a week from now. Then, let's have a meeting now so is anything I'm. Just saying and I think a lot of us are feeling that we just need more detail before we can give our endorsements or whatever start approach and has our hand up. Let's stand up now and please go on I'm. Very sorry. Am I recognized yes, so we're now looking to possibly table this until the next meeting, which is the committee of the whole. So then there's less input or you're, safe and being a special media perspective, because the board is in session during July and August is not instead from rather, we had authorized the committee of the whole. So essentially the full board can meet and it can take action which then would have to be formally ratified in September, but for all intents and purposes we would treat it as the action of the board while it was legitimately in session. So this is why we don't have a regular meeting in July in August and if we were to wait till September to consume is level something Boulos point and other people's point that we're not taking advantage of the momentum at the moment to make meaningful change happen. So we don't have to wait till September as a point. We can invoke the committee of the whole at the call of the board chair in order to accomplish a meeting on this. Very specific complaint, so we can have a discussion and a vote on it or really, quite frankly, make whatever decision makes the most sense at that point in time, and that can happen any time after this meeting. It can happen three days from now three weeks from now, once we have more details to operate from, there's really no reason if we really care about this as a board that we wouldn't convene a meeting. In my opinion. Oh that's up to the chair of the board to have the discussion in earnest with more details in front of us so and that's the only caveat and that's the and that's the reason why the proposal is. We can use the committee of the whole in order to consider this much sooner than September jon-jon, which a motion include state that had more clarity from mr. chair. Yes, my motion was to postpone consideration until we got the information from the borough presidents office with more detail, and that point it would be up to I think the discretion of the chair to call a meeting. Once we have that information, so the more detailed plan can be disseminated for consideration. Okay, thank you. John is everyone clear on the motion. I come the motion choked we're? Okay, it's been properly moved and seconded it's there again any or the discussion before we before we vote yeah chair may I be recognized. It's Michael, sideo I, think I, understand where you're coming from I think it presupposes a lot of things, one that we will actually hear more details from the borough president's office and also that we would actually have a say to be fleshing out of those details. This doesn't strike me as all that controversial or controversial enough to warrant more time. It just seems like we're asking for a more democratic process and the nomination and the selection process of commanding officers who serve our community seems to me pretty squarely within our bounds of the community board and something that would be responsive and is appropriately responses at the moment. I would much rather say we approve it now and then work on the details as they come out as I. Don't I, just don't think putting a pause will put enough pressure on the borough president's office to require additional details here. Your point Joe earlier, although I learned dawning in this community work process which I had no idea about before I, think I can you know reasonably have some input into the into the selection of commanding, at least being one of the cities and democratically and the democratic process of warning community officer, so I would prefer to table or I. Don't even I, don't know what the correct Robert's Rules are chair, but what I would like to do is actually vote on the actual motion and move forward with the borough. Presidents. Recommendation on behalf of this certainly have the opportunity to vote. Yay or nay, on the motion- and you know this is a very lively discussion. It's well warranted and much appreciated. However, we do need to kind of wrap it up. So if there is any other discussion, please make it short anybody else. Please yeah, just very quick I do not see this as meaningful change. Anything that does not include some type of teeth in it to hold accountable. Anyone who does the wrong thing is not meaningful change and that's why I am opposed to the letter, so I'm going to move no too big to tabling it, so we can get to actually hopefully voting on whether or not we approve the letter. Thank you say something. Please go on Joe a couple of things. First, I think we're mixing metaphors here. Firstly, in the selection of a let me backtrack, I'm! Sorry, if there is, if there's malfeasance of an officer, there are procedures completely in place for them here in the in Brooklyn, as well as obviously the city as a whole, and it is out of the hands of the commander. It is not in the hands of the commander of the precinct, that's a number one. They have a B, you have you have these so many abortions that manage this and the commander is not I repeat- is not at all involved in that prosecution or even in anything with at all about it. B, when you are selecting the commander, and here in the 7o precinct, we have been extremely soso. Hey I want to be clear that we have apps. The commander has no say in discipline of an officer G the commander, the selection of a commander and I've been involved in large business chains. Where you take, you have several precinct. This may be the premier precinct in the city. It is an extremely busy precinct. It has a large crime problems. It has a large gang problem. It has a large, stolen or zillion things involved. What you do is you don't put a rookie captain in this precinct. You have seen how they have responded in other precincts where they have to go down to CompStat. They have to respond. You have to see how they have managed hundreds of policemen in the past before you put them in a top precinct like ours. There's so much involved with that and yes I agree that we did not get a good, a good format of what we're going to be doing. However, it's extremely difficult and I think that we're missing the point of managing people or prosecuting a bad apple. Those are two different things terrify me Joe, I'm thirty seconds. If you don't mind chair, I apologize I'll just going quickly to Gwen's agreed. This doesn't have the most teeth of any reform. I've seen I've seen much more significant reforms. I would be happy to draft something up with you if your, if you want to offer something with more teeth, I, don't think that, as I think Billy said, preclude us being able to sign onto this. If anything, that might give us momentum as a board to advocate for additional reforms and to Joe appreciate the lesson I, don't I do know very little about the commanding officer role, but I do know that I think they're in charge of setting the culture of the precinct, and that seems to be just as important as being able to implement accountability measures. I'm, not suggesting that me as a board will go, find a rookie who's. Never had a you know a job in law enforcement, putting them in I'm, just saying as a board. We should have some say as to who is setting their culture for the folks who are in charge of protecting and serving our community. Okay, Michael I'm gonna have to wrap cut you off, go on and put it to a vote. I again appreciate everyone's in but and I'm sorry -, I'm, sorry to interrupt because I know we have to move it along, but is there I know? Neil L Smith has been emailing that she's on the line and want has been trying to chime in on this since the beginning of the conversation mark. If there's a way to identify which caller that is an unneutered, let's do that and otherwise, let's be done numbers don't have names associated with it. Both phone calls right now are unmuted. Can you hear me now? I have been trying on muted for quite a while, but I think this was a very robust and necessary dialogue. However, I'm a little bit trouble because I do feel that we do need to discuss this and come up with ways to be more proactive and be more involved, as community leaders, so I am totally against scuttling it, but I do think that we need to meet some of the questions that we want to ask of the borough president, and then we need we need to make decisions, can't just a be cavalier and scuttle this I I'm just totally. You know against that very quick. My thing is the command and he sets the tone for the preset. So therefore I think we should be involved in that. Yes, he doesn't have any preset. So yes, I would say let you know table it go from there. This is Gilligan. If we please and I do agree that we need to table, but I think we also need to come up with a definitive time that we will be moving forward on it, and it should be as soon as possible that we can send our questions and then do another virtual meeting to make some decisions. Okay, I. The fact is that there is a motion on the floor and you know we're going to have to vote on that motion now. There are, of course, as you've heard varying opinions and varying ideas and suggestions, but you know parliamentary practice. We are going to have to deal with the motion that is so. Can you re articulate what the motion is mr. chair, because there things have been different additions and subtractions to it. I'm going to ask Jonathan judge to restate the motion and to vote John I mr. chair, okay, the motion is to postpone consideration until the borough president's office provides us with more details for the plan that he is looking for our endorsement on and then we can consider it at that time that we've received the response from the borough president's office and if I may, if it's acceptable to the chair, maybe to just flesh out the details of that maybe within maybe by end of day Wednesday. We could email Shaun the district manager's office with questions we have and then maybe we could say that we will convene a committee of the whole within 72 hours of a response in order to consider the borough president's response once we receive it. So there's accountability and consideration. Is that point of clarification. Do we? Should we not try to send questions to the borough president? Just instead of just saying to him, please give us more information shouldn't we. Let him know what concerns or questions we have relative to the letter. Well, mr. Smith I think John motion included that we submit our questions to the board office and that would you know, communicate to the board president. You know requesting those things that have been submitted all right. So then we will be doing that first because it appears as if we were just going to send a letter initially to the ball president, just saying we need him to provide more clarity, but from what I'm hearing now is that we will first be getting our questions together prior to responding to the borough president correct. That is my understanding of the motion. All right. Thank you. Okay! So that's to vote. The motion, I believe, has been somewhat amended, so I believe it will fire another set. Is there anyone who would like to second the standing motion properly moved and seconded, although favor, let it be known by saying aye, it sounded like 10, yes, both and said I just made a chit I did not write down names because I could I don't know whose name attaches to it. Unless you are speaking, but there are 10 people who didn't vote, we have a quorum. So that means we need 26 votes. 10 people who didn't vote means they're abstaining, which means that the eyes do not have it when you can't abstained. So the board can either do this. If everybody knows how to use the icon in the bottom of their panelist screen to raise their hand, they could do that or add you're gonna have to proceed with a roll call vote. If you're gonna do that everybody's lower their hand, first Florencia, welven and deborah, you still have hands up. Okay, now, add don't I didn't ask for the eyes or the yes, please. You know how to raise your head. Not nothing like this, but do you know how to raise your head? If you don't say no, it's a mr. chair mr. chair I, just like to for the personal privilege, I think we should just do a vocal vote and go down the list of attendees board member I. Think it'll just be fair and again the point of order that we do not need an absolute majority, because this is not final action for the board. This is a procedural motion just to wait until we get more information from the borough presidents office in order to act immediately after getting that information. So we don't need an absolute majority of the board membership, and so I would like to just demand an individual roll call vote by voice right. You're done. Thank you. That makes sense to me as well. So let's go with the roll call vote. It's a secretary present I'm happy to jump in and play this role for this one time me Joe Jack, the first vote, Joe, yes or no, when your name is called unmute yourself to vote ain't, ref a be yes or no. Yes, abstain, Billy, Richland, I, vote, no against the motion. Brian Cunningham I won't know Deborah Valentin, oh yes, Edson! No and Powell yes, fry in Nuremberg, yes, Florencia, yes, Glenn woolen know Gregory Alvarez, no Howard, Sokol, Howard SoCo. Let's see him in here anymore. I'll go back to him. If he Howard, if you unmute, you can try. Men do so. Otherwise we're moving on to Joanne Brown, no Carl Henry says are ya. Did you guys hear me? No got it. Thank you.

No, you call Lebanon and glue no I, don't know Thank You Nina sub gear. Yes, so, whilst I'm Stan, you thank your votes. All Steve Cohen Emily. Yes, in what kilo I'm a minute, I think so colas has a raises hand again. Okay, we have 13, yes, votes, 10, no votes, one abstention and two people we couldn't hear I mean obviously yes, I'm the phone Jonathan yep, that's 14, yes, votes! Is there another? You do have milk with John. Yes, what Dale no I said yes, I caught I got that you can only say yes once L know, I couldn't make sure you heard me. You have been counted girl. Thank you right now. We have 14, yes, votes, 10, no votes, one abstention. Two people I could not hear Mansoor Hussein and saw oh and Howard three people. We can't hear somebody to decide what this means because of abstention and the three people we couldn't hear. If they were all knows, it would be, a tie, is Howard Shore and who saw Stein, but I. Think Howard is in the video trying to give a thumbs up, but we can't hear you Howard. Okay, we're gonna count that as a yes vote, because that is care about the democratic process, you're, a good citizen that would that would give that would say that would make the yeas have it. Even if all other votes we can't hear and the abstention were to count as no votes did we get a yes. We did your questions, your comments, your ideas to the board office. You can get them to Sean, preferably I, guess by email. Sean. Is that your preferred way of communicating this? Yes, please send it to the info at cd14. Brooklyn email Sonja, both monitor. Well, then, it was draft and bring it out back out to this Public Safety Committee to to do a final justice award. Okay, thank you board members for this lively discussion. This is what it's all about, and much appreciated, we'll move on with the agenda at this time. I do apologize. For one thing, this is Saul Stein I got cut off and been trying to get myself back on. I do vote yes as well: okay, so report from education, libraries and Cultural Affairs I'm. Assuming then that there is because we netted directorship here, no report, that's to the public session sean has we have know we have people who I think are on the call who signed pre-registered for the public session. The first one I, don't know if he's still on is David Nussbaum David. If you're here unmute and it's your turn for three minutes. No longer. You want me to go ahead. David, okay, if David has stepped away we'll go back to you step side. Please don't do anything. Try to speak now. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make them the panelists for a few minutes see if that works.
