I'd just like to thank everybody for for joining the executive committee meeting of community board 14.
You are encouraged to attend any committee meetings beyond the one you serve on and to attend public hearing boards have a quarant requirement for these meetings, so participation is a key responsibility.
Members cannot represent the board at public meetings or events, unless requested to do so by the chair.
We will I'm sure, work on a you know like a community advisory committee and something like that, but I.
Neither are okay, so I guess if there is any board member who is part of the conversation of committee co-chairs over the summer, who's, put any thought into this or still or wants to talk.
We can't pick up a whole lot more in the office, so we'll need a lot of sleeves rolled up on the committees, and so I appreciate that you want to do that, because I also agree that it's that the time is now and it could be invaluable in our in our community.
Let you know, but I would like our bylaws are pretty clear that I don't need board approval to make these personnel action changes, but because there's been some pushback by OMB and by in the past the borough president's office, I, wouldn't mind, having, I think, it'd be useful to have the board support.
So I would like the executive committee to report out on monday to the full board that I've asked for the board support in adding a fifth day to anya schedule and hiring a temp.
But let me know if you need, if you need to get it another way, and we will have that will be our public hearing on monday's meeting.
You know for people to email the board office to volunteer to serve on the bylaws committee, I'll try to go through the notes from when it was done in 2015 to give people a sense of how many meetings it was sort of what the level of commitment would be.
It would be people willing to put that time in Okay, any other discussion, any other business, new business, old, business, I'm, not quite sure where this fits in, but I'll bring it up and if I'm out of out in the wrong place, let me know, but it sort of ties in actually with the community and environment.
You know kind of probably problematic, because the community is looking at the board saying.
Think all of the veteran board members know, but it is also the president of the 70th police precinct, community, council and ed.
