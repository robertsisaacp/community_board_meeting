I'd just like to thank everybody for for joining the executive committee meeting of Community Board 14.
You are encouraged to attend any committee meetings beyond the one you serve on and to attend public hearing boards have a quarant requirement for these meetings, so participation is a key responsibility.
We will I'm sure, work on a you know like a community advisory committee and something like that, but I.
Yes, I agree kind of thing, so we're going to work on a system of sorting them out to find out who's in the comm in the community, who's actually from Canton, Ohio.
The committees formed by October, which is usually when we do, and and thank you to Steve Cohen and Carl Henry Caesar for stepping up mid- year, To co, chair, the education, libraries and Cultural Affairs Committee meeting So. Since there is a discussion there, let's move on to, we spoke over the summer and there was brought support to performing a community board.
Neither are okay, so I guess if there is any board member who is part of the conversation of committee, co- chairs over the summer, who's put any thought into this or still or wants to talk.
You know interest in moving forward with it, because the idea then was like we wanted to kind of hurry up and go and get something going over the summer.
We can't pick up a whole lot more in the office, so we'll need a lot of sleeves rolled up on the committees, and so I appreciate that you want to do that, because I also agree that it's that the time is now and it could be invaluable in our in our community.
Let you know, but I would like our bylaws are pretty clear that I do not need board approval to make these personnel action.
So I would like the executive committee to report out on Monday to the full board that I've asked for the board support in adding a fifth day to anya schedule and hiring a temp once the city of New York.
But let me know if you need, if you need to get it another way, and we will have that, will be our public hearing on Monday's meeting, so I kind of need them back before.
You know for people to email the board office to volunteer to serve on the bylaws Committee I'll, try to go through the notes from when it was done in 2015 to give people a sense of how many meetings it was sort of what the level of commitment would be.
So it would be people willing to put that time in Okay, any other discussion, any other business, new business old, business, I'm, not quite sure where this fits in, But I'll bring it up and if I'm out of out in the wrong place, let me know, but it sort of ties in actually with the community and environment.
You've got crisis and ed I think all of the Veteran board members know, but it is also the president of the 70th police, Precinct, Community, Council and Ed. But the commanding officer of the 7- 0 is not as community oriented as some of his predecessors, and You know.
