I'd just like to thank everybody for for joining the executive committee meeting of community board 14. I encourage all board members to check the community board 14 website for the many resources there, including Covid-19 updates community resources and announcements, job education, and youth resources.
But those concerns they were brought to the attention of Department of Homeless Services. We met with them and the police and the theater, but they're moving forward with it. And you know, so we will hear from the community.
Writing in from canton ohio, because it just sounds like something that they would oppose if they were here in Brooklyn with us. We'll sort out the auto replies, and then the people who've written individually and I'll remind them all that the that the public hearing is in October and that they can actually submit into the public record then, but that's where they are with that But I do encourage people to go ahead and look at it on our website, and you know I want to make sure, though, that the community feels that they're being heard and that we're as supportive of their concerns as possible that you're supportive as their concerns as possible.
Neither are okay, so I guess if there is any board member who is part of the conversation of committee co-chairs over the summer, who's put any thought into this or still or wants to talk about.
Every year we ask the community for community input on the on budget requests and we haven't received I think only one, but one form So. If board members want to go to the website and look right on the front page of the website, there's the forum and if you want to fill one out, if you want to share it with neighbors, if you're working with a group that you know is underfunded or has identified, funding needs Obviously this fiscal year.
Statement and kind of just gives us backup when we're asking agencies to restore funding or add funding or add new programs But let me know if you need, if you need to get it another way, and we will have that will be our public hearing on monday's meeting Thank you sean any other business We'd want to clean up, especially you know, for example, allowing remote voting.
I'll try to go through the notes from when it was done in 2015 to give people a sense of how many meetings it was sort of what the level of commitment would be So. It would be people willing to put that time in okay, any other discussion, any other business, new business, old business I'm, not quite sure where this fits in, but I'll bring it up and if I'm out of out in the wrong place, let me know, but it sort of ties in actually with the community and environment Over the summer there was a in one of the emails we got That was from stefan ringel in the borough president's office.
A lot of this is on our website too, but there are a lot of opportunities to work with parks because they are really understaffed and really overwhelmed, and so there's some cleanup days in prospect park in the parade grounds, but the one that the borough president's office was organizing would be in our community So I apologize for my picture popping up late, but I was listening in on everything glad to be a member of community board 14 I'm, very interested in the youth committee.
