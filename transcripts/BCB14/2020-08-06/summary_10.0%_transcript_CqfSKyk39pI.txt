Today is whether the board wants to endorse a letter written by Brooklyn, borough, President Eric Adams to Mayor Bill De Blasio, which proposes to include community board input in the hiring of commanding officers of the co- terminus.
This really thoughtful response to an idea that the borough president has put forward as a way to really increase community engagement in the in policing and to provide additional oversight at the at the most local of policing levels.
So I want again thanks to the entire board and to sean for reaching out and quite frankly, providing the most thoughtful feedback that we've gotten on this issue, thus far, and we're really pleased with a lot of these questions, because I'm going to be completely frank with you up front I.
But what the intent of this idea and this letter to the mayor and to the commissioner was to create an opportunity or a concept that we can, that we can they're, saying hello, that where we can and get engage community more in police oversight.
It's really a intended to be a beginning of a conversation that a lot of community boards are going to have to have with their precincts and with their, you're right with their with the with the mayor and the commissioner?
Now, primarily, is to just engender support for this idea and then even possibly, given the fact that you've outlined a lot of really important questions that need to be answered and that need to be laid out, potentially identify a local, a local, a pilot project for something like this and, in speaking with the borough president, it sounded like we would be open to sort of you know, pitching a proposal from the community board about how the formation of the panels is created, how the bylaws of the panel are created and pitching that to the mayor and to the commissioner directly.
The borough, president included in his letter, was a make up a formation of panels that would be representative of community boards and of precinct community councils.
What we had envisioned was that the commissioner would would pro would present three qualified candidates based on their existing processes of determining who's qualified to become a precinct commander, and then this committee, this new form, this panel, would be able to interview candidates and provide you know, receive additional background information about the candidates and make a decision about who they wanted to represent their community.
We want to have a conversation with community boards and community members about how we're going to create this sort of panel and bring that to the mayor and the commissioner to encourage them to participate in this in this process, and then so that would be.
I'm happy to answer any questions that I can, but I'm really thankful again for the opportunity to speak about this tonight and especially in my home Community board, and get feedback about this proposal and see if we can get community board 14 support in advancing this in some way, whether that's as a partner, a formal partner in a pilot program proposal or simply as the letter as Ed mentioned earlier.
You know the community had previous to him, being appointed, had reached out to the commissioner and said that we do not want this particular person and as a precinct commander in large part because of his known history, so I would- They- do not have any control over the tenor or any rogue cops.
What do what does that entail and the training What the borough president put in his letter would be the formation of a panel that included representatives from the public safety committees of the relevant community boards and the policing police precinct.
Looking to you, know, push this to the mayor and say: Let's work together to identify a format that works with input from local community boards, so the letters the questions that were put together by CB14 were incredibly helpful for us to think about this and will be incredibly helpful as we're speaking with the mayor about this.
And I'm really happy to hear you talking about in instead of the borough president and the office of the borough, president working out all the details of what that involvement would look like you want to involve community boards and sort of crafting that, and you know, co, I, hope, I'm, not misrepresenting them, but I think that is actually a huge area of concern is the lack of detail.
If I heard you correctly, when you first started, speaking, I think you said that the borough president had actually he had not discussed this with commissioner shea, but he had discussed it with the mayor.
The mayor's just going to reject it, because the plan has no detail And, you know the chances of the mayor really buying into this plan, and I would also say just as a general piece of feedback, because so much of the concern is around this lack of clarity, and I, really like what I'm hearing from you about a panel or inviting a selection of community board members in that might be something really good to add to the letter.
So I have a just a couple things I want to address one I think, given the fact that we're probably well we're like the second most diverse community and community Board in the five boroughs.
This process would do would be to review already identified as qualified candidates, and then you know, provide feedback on what the community thinks that is necessary in a precinct.
She referred to an assault which I did not know until very recently was actually Abner Lima in 1997, who was assaulted in the bathroom of the 70th precinct, which is our precinct, and I, can imagine that, maybe for some of the longer serving board, members, I'm, using my imagination, here, thinking back in time, This concern, Mr, Lynch, that you're hearing around accountability and the Community board's perception, and I really respect that concern, and I.
And I know what the president is proposing is to use Community, Board Rep members that are already on the Mem member, like being members of the public, Safety committee, or whoever the chair would decide to appoint to some other committee.
So I think the thing that I heard same working for the borough president too, but the concern that I've heard a few times is something that I've actually articulated to a few of you There's that sort of step away from it being a board decision where the board holds a public hearing.
In engagement, whether that's a letter or further kind of going further and like being willing to be a Quote Unquote Guinea pig for this idea, Just as a point of clarification, my questions were really directed to the borough president's office.
As far as the board's next steps, I think we will need to review this, and you know when we meet in September, that we should continue this discussion among board members.
So I'd like to move that we endorse the concept and submit a letter in line with what the borough president has been asking of design but say that, where maybe without wholesale, endorsing the exact wording, but something the fact that we want to continue the conversation about a greater role in Community Board and Community Organization Involvement community stakeholder involvement.
It's just that a point of order was brought up, and that is that this whole meeting was predicated on the idea of us deciding whether we wanted to agree with the original borough president's letter and sign on with it or not, and instead of taking that vote.
The board authorized the chair to submit a letter to the borough president and the mayor endorsing the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to police, precinct, commanding officer positions and to continue the conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping that process.
