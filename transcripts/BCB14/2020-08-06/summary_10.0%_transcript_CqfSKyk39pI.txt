President eric adams to mayor bill de Blasio, which proposes to include community board input in the hiring of commanding officers of the co-terminus precinct This matter, was originally raised by community board 14's public safety committee meeting on june 17 2020 by by majority vote Excuse me by majority vote at that meeting, I'm a cb14 resident for all the work that you all do and and for putting together.
I can share information with if anybody wants to phone bank and call people to fill out the census I, but what the intent of this idea and this letter to the mayor and to the commissioner was to create an opportunity or a concept that we can, that we can they're, saying hello, that where we can and get engage community more in police oversight This idea sort of stems from this need to have more local engagement and oversight on policing matters.
Can you know just open it up with that frame and then sort of answer as a accordingly , primarily, is to just engender support for this idea and then even possibly, given the fact that you've outlined a lot of really important questions that need to be answered and that need to be laid out potentially identify a local, a local, a pilot project for something like this and, in speaking with the borough president, it sounded like we would be open to sort of you know, pitching a proposal from the community board about how the formation of the panels is created, how the bylaws of the panel are created and pitching that to the mayor and to the commissioner directly You know.
The borough, president included in his letter, was a make up a formation of panels that would be representative of community boards and of precinct community councils He in his thinking, which he's saying is open to discussion.
What we had envisioned was that the commissioner would would pro would present three qualified candidates based on their existing processes of determining who's qualified to become a precinct commander, and then this committee, this new form this panel, would be able to interview candidates and provide you know, receive additional background information about the candidates and make a decision about who they wanted to represent their community with the understanding that community boards precinct community councils have the most local knowledge of what communities need and what types of what types of policing they want in their communities and identifying the candidate that best aligns with that.
With that vision, The borough president doesn't want to come in here and say: We want to have a conversation with community boards and community members about how we're going to create this sort of panel and bring that to the mayor and the commissioner to encourage them to participate in this in this process, and then so that would be You know whether that's in a full, a full-fledged for every 59 community boards across the city or starts off as a pilot program in select community boards or even just one community board to test it out.
The concern that we have is people who are not familiar with police processes, police commanding police management and all of the various things that go into running a precinct are going to want to make decisions really based on popularity of the candidates Frankly at the last meeting, the kinds of input that people are interested about, saying the command the commander of the precinct has no effect on whether it be whether it be a rogue cop is something that obviously, as you know, is hired by iab or the or the fbi.
Also, just my last thought: I agree with joe dweck as much as I know about the police, which I think is more than most You alluded to a pilot program and a selection of community boards for what the borough president is anticipating to do.
What the borough president put in his letter would be the formation of a panel that included representatives from the public safety committees of the relevant community boards and the policing police precinct community councils, then identifying what I mentioned about a pilot project was that you know we The letter was signed by several n't I, can't remember the number I think about 20, or so the community boards and precinct community councils in Brooklyn.
Looking to you, know, push this to the mayor and say: Let's work together to identify a format that works with input from local community boards, so the letters the questions that were put together by cb14 were incredibly helpful for us to think about this and will be incredibly helpful as we're speaking with the mayor about this What I mentioned about a pilot project, is that if cb14 or another community board wanted to you know, propose this to be a pilot in their particular district, we would be willing to work with those groups to bring it to the mayor and to the commissioner, because obviously this would be a conversation with the with the administration as well to to develop what the final product would look like.
I'm really happy to see the letter, so I just want to thank you for that I know I believe we can give valuable input to this process without being experts on police work and I'm really happy to hear you talking about in instead of the borough president and the office of the borough, president working out all the details of what that involvement would look like you want to involve community boards and sort of crafting that, and you know, co-creating for many of my fellow board, members I hope I'm, not misrepresenting them, but I think that is actually a huge area of concern is the lack of detail.
The mayor's just gonna reject it, because the plan has no detail, and you know the chances of the mayor really buying into this plan and I would also say just as a general piece of feedback, because so much of the concern is around this lack of clarity and I, really like what I'm hearing from you about a panel or inviting a selection of community board members in that might be something really good to add to the letter In short, my question for you is, you said the borough president spoke to the mayor.
That is something that we, the borough president talks a lot about and the way that he became a member of the police department was by was directly to be You, know kind of improve the diversity of the police department If you have neighbors, if you have people that that are looking for what a future would be would be to advocate for them to look into joining the police department and if they have concerns about the police department working to reform that from within, because when you had that it was just my note- was recruitment so and talking to people that may not have historically thought about the police department as a potential career What I've heard so far in is organization that the community board is interested in pursuing this matter further, whether on a trial is on a pilot basis, but at least to continue participating in the process that we're grateful for the opportunity to get into the process.
So I still concur that we need to meet in a different setting with the other community boards that are also interested in this, so that we could really understand where we are going I also want to bring this back to the borough president, the feedback that you all provided- and you know share with him the thoughts that you all had and see if we can impress upon the mayor to potentially convene a conversation, a more in-depth conversation about this, but I could certainly bring that back and report back with respect to what the board does I'll defer to what the board members want to do in terms of next steps in engagement, whether that's a letter or further kind of going further and like being willing to be a quote unquote: Just.
I did post it in the chat, but for those of you who may not be able to read it so I moved up the board authorized the chair to submit a letter to the borough president and the mayor endorsing the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to police precinct, commanding officer positions and to continue the conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping that process to a fully detailed proposal.
