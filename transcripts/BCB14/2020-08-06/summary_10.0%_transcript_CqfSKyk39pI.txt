President eric adams to mayor bill de Blasio, which proposes to include community board input in the hiring of commanding officers of the co-terminus precinct.
This really thoughtful response to an idea that the borough president has put forward as a way to really increase community engagement in the in policing and to provide additional oversight at the at the most local of policing levels.
But what the intent of this idea and this letter to the mayor and to the commissioner was to create an opportunity or a concept that we can, that we can they're, saying hello, that where we can and get engage community more in police oversight.
Now, primarily, is to just engender support for this idea and then even possibly, given the fact that you've outlined a lot of really important questions that need to be answered and that need to be laid out, potentially identify a local, a local, a pilot project for something like this and, in speaking with the borough president, it sounded like we would be open to sort of you know, pitching a proposal from the community board about how the formation of the panels is created, how the bylaws of the panel are created and pitching that to the mayor and to the commissioner directly.
The borough, president included in his letter, was a make up a formation of panels that would be representative of community boards and of precinct community councils.
What we had envisioned was that the commissioner would would pro would present three qualified candidates based on their existing processes of determining who's qualified to become a precinct commander, and then this committee, this new form, this panel, would be able to interview candidates and provide you know, receive additional background information about the candidates and make a decision about who they wanted to represent their community.
With the understanding that community boards precinct community councils have the most local knowledge of what communities need and what types of what types of policing they want in their communities and identifying the candidate that best aligns with that with that vision.
We want to have a conversation with community boards and community members about how we're going to create this sort of panel and bring that to the mayor and the commissioner to encourage them to participate in this in this process, and then so that would be.
The concern that we have is people who are not familiar with police, processes, police commanding police management and all of the various things that go into running a precinct are going to want to make decisions really based on popularity of the candidates.
What the borough president put in his letter would be the formation of a panel that included representatives from the public safety committees of the relevant community boards and the policing police precinct community councils.
Looking to you, know, push this to the mayor and say: Let's work together to identify a format that works with input from local community boards, so the letters the questions that were put together by cb14 were incredibly helpful for us to think about this and will be incredibly helpful as we're speaking with the mayor about this.
And I'm really happy to hear you talking about in instead of the borough president and the office of the borough, president working out all the details of what that involvement would look like you want to involve community boards and sort of crafting that, and you know, co-creating what that might be.
If I heard you correctly, when you first started, speaking, I think you said that the borough president had actually he hadn't discussed this with commissioner shea, but he had discussed it with the mayor.
The mayor's just gonna reject it, because the plan has no detail You know the chances of the mayor really buying into this plan, and I would also say just as a general piece of feedback, because so much of the concern is around this lack of clarity, and I, really like what I'm hearing from you about a panel or inviting a selection of community board members in that might be something really good to add to the letter.
So I have a just a couple things I want to address one I think, given the fact that we're probably well we're like the second most diverse community and community board in the five boroughs.
What goes on What this process would do would be to review already identified as qualified candidates, and then you know, provide feedback on what the community thinks that is necessary in a precinct.
I, don't have a question so much, but I will try to phrase the question if need be, but just wanted to reiterate my support since last time we heard this proposal and thank your office for having some imagination here in terms of how the community works can provide a democratic process into police, proceedings.
You, know jonathan, this concern, mr lynch, that you're hearing around accountability and the community board's perception- There is risk that you would participate in a hiring decision where something bad did.
Think I'm hearing is that the community board doesn't want to be responsible.
So I think the thing that I heard same working for the borough president too, but the concern that I've heard a few times is something that I've actually articulated to a few of you There's that sort of step away from it being a board decision where the board holds a public hearing.
I also want to bring this back to the borough president, the feedback that you all provided, If we can impress upon the mayor to potentially convene a conversation, a more in-depth conversation about this, but I could certainly bring that back and report back with respect to what the board does I'll defer to what the board members want to do in terms of next steps in engagement, whether that's a letter or further kind of going further and like being willing to be a quote, unquote: Just.
So I'd like to move that we endorse the concept and submit a letter in line with what the borough president has been asking of design but say that, where maybe without wholesale, endorsing the exact wording, but something the fact that we want to continue the conversation about a greater role in community board and community organization, involvement.
It's just that a point of order was brought up, and that is that this whole meeting was predicated on the idea of us deciding whether we wanted to agree with the original borough president's letter and sign on with it or not, and instead of taking that vote in our last meeting, we decided to gather more information, which is what we've been doing.
The board authorized the chair to submit a letter to the borough president and the mayor endorsing the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to police, precinct, commanding officer positions and to continue the conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping that process to a fully detailed proposal.
