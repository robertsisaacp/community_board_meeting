Okay, this meeting of Community Board 14, is called to order on December 7th at 6:34 pm under the applicable statutes of New York state, The charter of New York City boards by laws and Roberts rules.
Other matters of civic interest must be brought before the board during our public comment, period, which is which will begin tonight, After all, other business on the board's monthly meeting agenda has been concluded, No, partisan political appeals or advertising of for-profit enterprises will be heard, wishing to speak during the public.
For those of you who want to say things, there's a lot to say things about, Then we also there have been some questions about snowplow for the season and center train for snowplow many weeks prior to this and went through and drove the districts, and it's changed somewhat with some of the outdoor dining in terms of what equipment they're going to use in certain places, But they've got it.
I am mostly in Albany and then, when I'm in Brooklyn, even though board 14 only takes in a small portion of my district I know a number of the people who are board members, And I really just wanted to take an opportunity to say hello to people to obviously wish people a happy holiday, season.
I urge people to stay safe, And I want to let you know that my office has, as do I, believe most of the other elected officials, but my office has masks handsets small bottles of hand.
Let people know that my office for the first, several months after the pandemic started, we were always remote.
Then to 8:19 18 19 street over by Bay Avenue, so and starting over by the Philip Howard Flatbush, Avenue area, So again just stay safe, happy holidays and anyway, ed or the board members that I could be helpful.
Everyone also has a great new year and stays safe and socially distant, as we try to get out of these last, hopefully, four or five months before we start seeing a vaccine and trying to get our city or state or country back on a more normal footing.
Yes, Mr, Assemblyman, Carol, yes, I wanted to know like what plans do you have of helping with the 1620 Cortelli Road project.
There are no public hearings or executive committee meetings to report on this evening, but I do wish to make a few announcements.
Number one, A belated welcome to our new board member Zach Khan Mr Khan has already joined us at committee meetings and public hearings and I really appreciate his willingness to jump right in the true board, 14 spirit.
Even if you're, not a board member, please let us know if you are interested, whether you're, a member or not all meetings of community board 14 are open to the public.
Thirdly, community board 14, has been asked to serve on the former ps9 Psn 90 task force chaired by council member Matthew Eugene and the Brooklyn bubble.
I have asked district, manager, Sean Campbell, to represent the board and to report back to me and relevant committee co-chairs along the way.
And you know, over a period of years, Actually, we've been trying to you: know, bring a bylaws committee into effect to kind of look at the bylaws revise what needs to be revised and so far it's been touch and go, and we've been somewhat unsuccessful at getting that point.
You know, like I, said especially women and people of color for coming forth to participate on this John I.
I'm sure there are a lot of the new board members who don't know that, but I also was wondering if there was one or two of the key complaints that might be the driving force, because Johnny can.
It's a good thing to have diversity on a bylaws committee, but maybe also to clarify the implication and then maybe that will also help jog some ideas from certain members of our board who want to partake in it sure.
Then there was a question at the time at the very beginning of the executive order that allowed us to hold board meetings remotely in a way that's still comported with the open meetings law and whether or not there needed to be questions about voting, You, know, clarity on terms in terms of how we would vote if there is a an election that is a where there's contenders in election.
Hopefully, that is super groovy, but I, do want to say that any board member who wants to be on this bylaws committee, Please email us in the office at the info address, and we can capture some things in the comments, but they don't become part of our records.
Okay, then, Let's move on to the topical committee report, starting with youth services, Any of the chairs available here we're both available.
So I on behalf of myself and my coach here, I know that I want to thank you guys for coming out to this meeting and also for our youth, Services Committee meeting.
We invited speakers from the Department of Youth and community development for New York City, as well as the Vista program.
The mayor's office of Immigrant affairs, we asked the representative from the Department of Youth and community development DYCD to speak to the workforce, connect programs that they offer.
So, With everything going on with the pandemic, We wanted to make sure that we had a better understanding as a committee and as a board and for the community what the path forward look like from DYCD and their programs, so I presented with Sarah marks from DYCD and just to give you some of the highlights of the meeting which is available on the community boards, YouTube page for review.
We were hoping for some direction from them and advice from them on how we could better engage our young people in again forming a youth committee and building out that program.
The hope is that we'll have a youth committee that will be able to have representatives on you, know, sit with each committee of the board to have full engagement with the board, so we're hoping through some direction from Vista, and we're also going to be continuing to reach out to other community partners to just learn how we can better engage our young people and get them involved and correct me if I'm wrong, here, Am, I, correct, Jonathan, I've heard of the committee church on that, but I think that we have a lot of I.
I pass it on to my colleagues like just a reminder like our that the CB 14 news conference, which actually was an started by chair Ed Powell and a few other board, members.
So, Whatever it looks like moving forward, we encourage board members to participate in it, get companies, friends, organization, whatever you can get us to help us move this forward to help our young people find activities that are productive and worthwhile to keep them out of trouble to keep them engaged to get them ready for the workforce to get them ready for college.
Let's continue to do that, so the mic or the platform to my co-chair I, echo everything that Dwayne said, and you know working with as a staff member when I was a staff member Edward's, coach of the Committee and Doris Ortiz, our former district manager.
Of course it's a big thank you to all of you and the community at large and, of course, the district manager staff, which is the linchpin, I, think of actually making sure it happens.
One thing that I want to just highlight in that we will have to meet again and we're going to talk about what the youth conference will look like and depending on what restrictions may still be in place during the pandemic and how that looks.
There is one more thing, though, speaking of Youth Leadership Council, getting people engaged at a young age, the New York City, Civic, Engagement, Commission and I want to thank Michael for reminding us about that in the chat.
I, don't want to take up a lot of time because I know you're already an hour into the meeting.
As, we all know, There are some cars that they're trying to say they put on these paper plates that are being used, they're looking into that, but he did want to warn everybody to please be aware: Don't leave your keys running in the car and going out even for 10 seconds, because somebody jumps in your car gets stolen.
I know the board office has all that information if any of our immigrants in the community should need information for those services.
Second agenda item was regards to the Kingsborough jewish medical Center, acute care bed closure if you're not familiar or did not attend that meeting.
After our meeting, But the governor Cuomo has asked all hospitals to increase beds by 50 to accommodate what we are expecting or what is actually the second wave of Covid-19 patients who will need acute care, I can say from experience and from a report that the beds that we have not stopped admissions at the hospital.
So, you know, let's delineate, what's going on so one Brooklyn health system is carrying out the orders of the New York State Department of Health to go ahead and merge the system and close the acute care beds so that those buildings can be transformed.
The, most up-to-date information that I have is the agency nurses that are working in place of staff nurses that have left, because when we know that we're closing staff, of course, is going to find more stable, jobs.
I just wanted to echo Ed's comments earlier about welcoming non-board members to committees.
Two months ago we did get someone a non-board member to join our committee, which was great I, think we can actually accommodate one more.
Members are expected to remain for the public comment period and because we're meeting remotely all speakers were asked to pre-register via email to the board.
Any member of the public, who was not able to register in that fashion in time, can follow up directly with the board and staff will do their best to include announcements on the CB14 website.
May the year 2021 be a better year for everyone, and I would like to thank community board 14 for their efforts, district manager, Sean, Campbell, chairperson, Ed, Powell, Anya and all members.
Thank you to the district manager for y', all working so hard and all the members of community board 14.
As, we know, We are up to 5 activity rate in Brooklyn and New York city I should say, and we want to do what we can to prevent.
The, with the city's test and trace core library, staff have distributed more than 54,000 mass and reached more than 19,000 brooklynites, with information about essential resources such as pre-testing sites and emergency food, relief, We hope to continue our partnership into 2021 with outreach regarding a safe, vaccine, In, addition, Bpl's business and career center has entered a partnership with the community service society of New York.
This all started after the community board meeting that I attended and I loved.
Our policy is that you know one speaker can not receive additional time from another speaker and that you know we've asked, as I mentioned in my comments, that people sign up by you know to speak by contacting the board office via email.
Think his comments are due this week, I think even tomorrow, and then of course, That's part of the reason why I did announce the city planning public hearings at which I'm encouraging all community members.
Still, You know who are interested to participate in that and any comments, as the chairman mentioned, earlier, comments that we're not able to make it on to the meeting tonight and we do want to encourage people to pre-register, can be sent to the community board made part of our public record.
There's a lot of work to do just joining this meeting and learning so much I actually live in community board.
