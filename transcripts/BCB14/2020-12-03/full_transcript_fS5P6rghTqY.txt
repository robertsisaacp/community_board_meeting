Good evening, everyone tonight we are at the Public Safety committee meeting as the co-chair we are going of the precinct and how they saved the information from Deputy inspector David, Wall commanding officer of the 70th precinct. There is some audio interference. Can you make sure that, if you're calling in on your phone that the microphone on your laptop is muted? Yes, it says it's red, it's muted, how's about now? Is it better? Well, maybe that's the best we can do carry on you know. If that's the best we can do is everyone else can hear spreads. Can everyone here? Okay? So we'll start this one more time. This meeting is starting and the first event that we're going to talk to is Deputy inspector David, Wall commanding officer of the 70th precinct, who will give us a state of precinct and how they safety information, inspect the wall. Oh evening, everybody thanks. Thank you for joining me today, just very quickly we're gonna talk about the crime and the precinct over the last month, some tips they have to do with holiday safety. That's coming up some announcements and then I'll answer any questions that anyone on the board has with me in the program. I think you saw already. We have detective desert here. If you have any questions that pertaining to community affairs or anything of that nature he's here as well, we can work on any issues that come up tonight. Looking at the crime in the last month or the last period, which is November 2nd to November 29th. We actually see an increase in crime this month about 14 percent. When we break down where the crime is coming from, we're actually seeing decreases in two areas. One is robberies: 14 versus 16 cases, but one of the things we have seen and I want to get out. There is Facebook market we're seeing a lot of robberies where people are setting up to sell items on Facebook market I, myself, don't really use Facebook, maybe many people do Facebook marketing seemed to become an area where perpetrators are using that to set up people for robberies, to steal items anywhere from sneakers, which are very popular all the way up to and including cars. So if you or you know someone's selling things on Facebook market, they really need to set up their meet location somewhere, that's public somewhere. That has a lot of cameras. Someone has a lot of obvious cameras to make sure nothing happens. That's a new trend that we're seeing a robbery's occurring face over Facebook marketing. Where you go to sell items, that's one of the big things our grand large scenes are down as well again. One of the things that are increasing is scams and scams of all nature. The most recent one from last week, an individual called up said he was from Social Security Office also said he was from the NYPD, but he was calling from Texas. He was able to get about five thousand dollars by threatening the person that they were going to be arrested in the social security number is involved in drug dealing, some type of crime in another state and that you will be arrested. So it's always something I put out there because it's affecting so many people, normally it used to affect the elderly before these scans. But now it's affecting the very young any age. Honestly from young to elderly, it's affecting everyone everyone's going for this dance, so something always put out there when we get into crimes that have increased something. You got a little public intention. We actually did have three cases of rape, and this month one actually had news attention. That was the young girl who was attacked a medical office, I'm happy to say that arrest was made. In that case, it's very good work by special victims unit. You know Spu the real one: they utilize video camera. They followed this person across Brooklyn to find where he was staying and they made an arrest in that case and he is currently in jail right now. So there's three cases two of the cases have arrests. The third case that does not have arrest is a case of a 16 year old, who has a 25 year old boyfriend, and the Svu is also investigating that case. We have we've seen an increase in burglaries from 14 cases to 11 cases, but nine of those cases are commercial burglaries, so we're seeing a increase in commercial burglaries. It's something I want to get out to the bits. They're gonna have the technology reach out to the bigs about the commercial burglaries. What's happening is the great system, the grape? That's on the sidewalk at least the basement. A lot of businesses are leaving that unsecured and that's become a point of entry from these burglaries. So it's something we want to get across to all the days and very much part of the bid. It's something we definitely want to mention and make sure those things are also secure. I'll make sure your camera systems are operational. It's a lot of ways that we take these perpetrators off the street is by having good systems. One of the things I do mention is the alarm system. Out of the nine commercial burglaries, there was only one with an alarm system that reached out to the police, whether you have an alarm that reaches out to the police or reaches to you directly. It's something that's important to really get that quick notification that someone has illegally entered your business. So that's one thing we did saw that there was only one case out of the nine when our alarm system reached out directly to the we shot the records, that's something we want to start working with different bids to get out to our different business leaders and business owners to better secure their business. Grand larcenies of vehicles, stolen vehicles, we're still seeing an increase. This hasn't been consistent over the year. It's something that has been consistent is the car running with the keys of the mission. Six out of the 11 are cars running with the keys in the ignition. It happens in Flatbush, but that also happens on all the places within the precinct. So that's something I keep commenting on. There's really no reason to even in the cold weather the five minutes, it takes to go into a store, and normally it's going to a store to get something. The car won't be that cold for you to leave the car running with the keys in the ignition makes it very difficult for us to combat that. Also, people have to understand that people are using these stolen cars, especially young people, who are stealing these cars. It's not a sophisticated operation. It's really just young people seeing opportunity they're using these cars in violent crime, shootings and things of that nature. That's not something you want on your conscience that your vehicle always uses using shooting. So if at all possible, you want to be able to secure your car as best as you can and first they need to turn off the car and take the keys. We want to talk about assaults. We had an increase in shootings this month. We've actually had four shootings one. We discussed at our last community council meeting. It was on November 15th at 180 Parkside Avenue at 9:30. In the morning after bill was having a dispute. He was shot multiple times on a Sunday right at 9:30. In the morning we have made an arrest, in that case the perpetrator committed that crime was arrested. Unfortunately, the person did die in that, but at least sometimes we get some closure that we made in the rest, in that case, on November 20th at 8:51 pm. At the intersection of Tate and Flatbush avenue, Mel was walking down to that location. It looks like a car driving by discharged a firearm multiple times striking him to the foot looks like he was not the intended target in that case, but it's just another example of perpetrators using cars and a lot of these paper plates that we definitely are looking at to promote violence. So in case there's another investigation on November 27th at 6:52 p.m. At 25, tennis court we had two males that were shot about six people hanging out in front of the location. Another again a car drives down the street shoots a couple of times strikes. One person in the foot strikes another person in the torso and the left arm. We're gonna have definitely information going out with that car. We gotta get information about that car. That's something we're investigating, but it's definitely something that we press paper plates. We look at. We look just trying to prevent stolen cars because these cars will be used in acts of violence. So it's something that we're looking to. If you have any information on any case that we mentioned, please don't hesitate to call. You can definitely remain anonymous. Nothing about your information. I'll get out now, November 29th, supposedly at 3:20 p.m. On East 29th Street between Forster and Ferrari 16 year old males says he was walking down that street when an unknown male attempted to rob him. There was a scuffle in the scuffle. A firearm went off striking him in his hand from there he went home and then went to a hospital now we are currently investigating this, but we're also investigating the validity of this location. So this entire incident is under investigation as well. Individual was shot, but we're investigating the complete circumstances, as that was the location that we were given, and our investigation hasn't worn that out yet and we're looking at all aspects of that case. I mentioned. Obviously I mentioned a lot of violence here, one of the things we're looking to combat that is, we were able finding a budget some overtime for our extra police officers. So this Friday Saturday and Sunday we're looking to keep that consistent, that on nights, where there may be extra people out on the street, we're looking to increase our presence places where there's going to be accident, violence, so Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we'll typically see extra police officers out there looking to combat crime and any violence that may occur. That's something I've been trying to keep consistent as we get money in the budget to do these things, just some quick holiday tips. My first one is the most important is for, if you're, giving anyone or you're lucky enough yourself to get any happy products instead of having them delivered, they can be delivered to the store where you can go and pick them up securely. You don't have to have these boxes waiting there, while you're at work for hours and then other people from the street can take them and honestly some of your neighbors can also take them. I've seen those cases as well. You can get them delivered to the apple store and pick it up securely from the apple store times like this. You know trying to keep. Sometimes it's good to keep all your items separate. A lot of people use their cell phones and then put every credit card and cash. They have some type of wallet attached to the cell phone. That's not good to put all your eggs in similarly one basket if you simply lose your phone or the depth of your phone. Just remember myself: most cell phones are now easily a thousand dollars, so there could be a point where people want to take them now. You've also lost your credit cards and cash or identifications as well. So it's definitely something you see, as always, because of the holidays, even with Covey, the crime doesn't take a break. Normally, there's a little bit increase of individuals going through cars. Please don't you leave any valuables in your car, that's something you always say. People who leave wallets laptops, things of that nature and a lot of times the doors are not locked when these things are stolen from your car. So please don't leave any bibles in your car if they're, all at all possible. There's some announcements before I get really into questions. Nco boys they'll be having their build. The block meeting at 7:00 pm at 1087 Ocean Avenue, that's December, 9th at 1087 Ocean Avenue at 17. on December 16th, NCO David will be having their meeting at 157 Saint Paul St Paul's place. That's December, 16 7 p.m. At 157, St Paul's place our next community Council Meeting, Precinct, Community Council meeting is just want to remind everybody that it's actually going to be on Monday. That week is the holiday week. It's going to be a December 21st of Monday, another virtual meeting, but just to take down information, it's actually gonna be on a Monday and we consistently. We still have our toy drive and our coat drive. If anyone has any coats or toys they would like to donate to precinct for anyone in this time, especially with this weather, we are accepting toys and cooks with that I'll open it to anyone who asks any questions. If anyone has any questions, you can raise your hand or you can also unmute yourself and see chairman I, don't see any okay. I do see a hand Michael studio. Can you hear me hello? Can you hear me hello, yes, hi inspector wall? How are you nice to meet you? I'm Michael Sedillo, I'm a new member of the Public Safety Committee happy to be here. Thanks for your service, I have a few questions for you one. You mentioned the 14 increase in crime. There are some areas that went down. Do you have I mean I know this is like city wide and I mean. My sense, of course, is that no nothing about public safety, but my sense is like the economic factors from Covid-19 are really contributing to that. Do we have any other data that suggests why there's an increase in crime, particularly in our precedence or city-wide, that you're tracking or following closely okay? That's a very good question not getting into anything political, because I leave that to the leadership of the police department. I'll just say this with the change in the Bell reform. What has happened is we have individuals in this precinct who continually commit crimes and as we arrest them, unfortunately, they're let out quickly they quickly let out there wasn't a period of where we had no courts. No grand juries! No prosecutions were going forward, so, let's just say, with recidivism, we have 15 different recidivists for burglary citizens. They break into homes, commercial establishments they break into cars, so we have 30 out of the 15 we've arrested out of the 30 requested. 15, multiple burglaries this just this year out of the 15 that we arrested for multiple burglaries, only three are currently in jail right now. The rest are out sometimes we're still thinking they're committing other crimes. So what we're seeing is a little bit of a recidivism issue, lending itself to increase in burglaries a lot. So it's something that we have to work with. The court system we're only one part of the criminal justice system and with Covid-19. There was a time where there were no prosecutions going on and there were Covid-19 releases from jail for people who have committed shootings those people released on Covid-19, as people got out and actually did other shootings. So there's a lot to it. Besides the economics with people, we also see an increase in domestic family assaults for first time, families having assaults that could be chalked up to the fact that you have to you know shelter at home for so long and seemingly, what's been a tough time for everyone, and that's something: we've actually seen this year's increasing family assaults so this year, which is mercifully coming to an end, has a lot because a lot of things and I don't want to pinpoint it to just one issue. But it's not is that affecting just this precinct, it's really affecting city. Why all these issues? Thank you for that in the comp stat data that comes out, would we be able to I? Don't think it goes into that granular level of detail, but where could I like look at the data to show that the folks who would have been in jail but because of double form or not, were the repeat offenders? No! Well, we don't dive that deep. The information put out to the public is very simple. You know one thing I'll say about the police department. Sometimes we can use numbers too much and we don't like to use that for the public, because it's sometimes it's too much, but unfortunately, what frustrates me is. You know that I know the names of the people that were arrested multiple times and this year alone. I've seen it over and over again, so it would take a little bit more of a deep dive. Now, if you want to get a little bit more specific in your NCO meeting, you can definitely go over it where it's just you and the police officer, you can talk about the Berkeleys and your precinct and what they're saying the burglars in your sector, what they're seeing that's a good thing for the NCO build a block meeting to go to if you haven't gone to one you haven't gone to one before so it's good to get down to that a little small level in your sector. Thank you. I appreciate that I have a second but I'll pause and see if anybody else does. Thank you for your time. If anyone else has a question, please raise your hand or unmute and speak. Can I ask a question: go ahead: Julia yep! Yes, I'm sorry, I, don't know how to raise the hand. Is you know this program? Something to us. Did you find that there were more burglaries after the pandemic or durian? That's what I mean it actually remain, can be consistent and actually decreased in some levels. Why? Because people were actually staying home a little bit more in the beginning of the year? That's when we had a really big increase and that's actually before coverage, that's more of the that's more of the Bell reform, so judges weren't allowed to pose bail. So if I broke into your house tonight by tomorrow, I'm back out on the street and when Kovitz started a little bit, because there were no court cases when that started consistently happening, sometimes that emboldens, the recidivists which I'm talking about the hardcore receiver. This is going to jail multiple times back and forth, sometimes that that's emboldened in the beginning of this year, where they're being arrested, they're being released very quickly, sometimes released from the precinct instead of at night in jail or anything like that. The hardcore recidivists took that as a chance for them to commit further crimes. So when Covid-19 was full blown, the burglaries went down a little bit because there were more people. There were more people at home before so residential burglaries went down a little bit yes go ahead. I was wondering whether do you find that there is any difference between clients perpetrated as people with disabilities or non-stable. Elderly is something that we track and the things that we look for, although is assaults, that's something we track. Robberies is something that we track it's. It hasn't really increased any more over the consistently over the years past. As far as whether the person is disabled or not, it's not really something that we track a victim as a victim I. Think it's a vapor to us if their disability aided the perpetrator, committing this crime and that's something we'll look at, but you know we treat every victim as the same, so we probably see or a person's disability. A lot of times is the driver of overall crime. Now there are people with disabilities who have been victims of crime. People wheelchairs, who have been robbed of flapper, champion things of that nature, but we don't see overwhelmingly as if individuals disabled in any way that they'll be more likely to be the victim of crime. Now, sometimes domestic situations, that's a little bit different. That goes into a family dynamic, but just in birth and basic street crime. It's not more one over the other. Thank you. Are there any further questions? Hello, oh, go ahead! Joe I already have one go ahead: job I'd like to remark about the Dylan Stewart Memorial on Saturday. It was really a beautiful memorial to Dylan Stewart, who was killed here at 15 years ago. He was doing a regular routine traffic. Stop and the person pulled the gun out and shot him and it got under his vest into his heart and he still pursued that person is now serving life, but his children were there and his wife with the at the memorial, and it was such a moving thing and I wanted to thank you inspect the wall. It was a really beautiful ceremony. Thank you. So much for the comment. Are you any other questions for the inspector? Yes, I? Have one, do you mind, go ahead, Michael thanks also inspector wall since this summer the campus- actually I'm not even sure, if I'm using the right term but the precinct that is on the west side of the parade ground on the north part of it there's like a gate and a police car that looks like it's I, don't know patrolling the area or watching the area. I noticed, that's been there since December. Is there a specific threat or a specific reason why that car is parked there or is there anything we should know about us or the reason? That's there say your location again, one more time you said the west of the yeah West of the yes ground, the precinct west of the parade ground I, run by it most days and as you go like to the north and start to enter prospect park, it kind of like funnels and there are gates there and a car station there, and it's been there since the summer. It wasn't there before so I just didn't know if there's anything that the public should be aware of as to why that the car is parked there or if there's a way, we could open up the gates and make for an easier flow of pedestrians and bikes that are going through that area. Matt. Are you talking about the entry into the park? It's not at the street level, yet it's still in the alleyway just to the west of the tennis courts, but I am yeah talking about that general area, yeah that well that location. If you see there, there's like a police precinct there, you talk about it right there, yeah, that's yeah, I! Think it's like how I'm not sure the makeup. It's like it looks like it's like a half part. Maybe half precinct I, don't know, but there's yeah, that's Rsi Rg unit. They go to things like protests and large events, large-scale events and rapid deployment, so that's their base over there. So any car recently might be part of their deployment or their parking. They pop the car right there, because their whole base is right. There. They have a lot of vehicles now you were talking about recently or during the summer. No, it's been since the summer, and it's not just the car parked there and it's. We don't have to go too far back and forth. It's like there's a not only a squad car but an officer station there looking like maybe guarding the area and that's been since the summer. I don't know if others have noticed this. It's not a big deal by any means, but I'm just curious as to why- and you know, they're there a lot of times we a lot of times. We use officers to protect our own cars because of things that happened like damaged or brake lines being cut, so he might actually be there to just protect the police vehicles that are there. Okay hold up great thanks. Are there any more questions for the inspector hearing? None seeing no one's hand raised at this time, Paul and deputy newsy and other detectives and other police officers who are helping out our community to wish them a happy and healthy holiday and a happy and healthy new year, and that should go as well to all the people who are on board with us this evening. Thank you, inspector. Okay. At this time we're going to move on to the next part of the agenda tonight, and that is to Rick Rodriguez, who is going to deal with violence prevention, intervention coming from Canberra Rick. Are you there good evening, everyone and thank you for the opportunity to share with you what our programs do and how we can provide our services to the communities in which you live and have concern. Let me first just say that Canba has four: has some major program areas in economic development, education and Youth, Development Family, support health, housing and legal services, and we've served 65,000 individuals annually, plus 10,000 youth annually and more than half of our clients that we see are immigrants and refugees and 85 of the families are living in poverty. This is the demographics we have I fall under the family support services and that pertains to the programs I serve in the violence, prevention and intervention services. One of the major programs is the victims assistance program in which we provide assistance for families who are victims of crime who are hurt or injured by filing a New, York state compensation's claim form, and this includes families of any kind of crime who are violently hurt or injured. That may not have the means to pay for medical attention received, or they may have lost time off work as a result of their crime and they're not being compensated or they lost personal items such as prescription glasses, hearing, Aids clothing that you've been torn or damaged as a result of the crime. These things can be reimbursed or compensated for and for families who lost loved ones as a result of crime, either through homicide or gun violence. They may receive up to 6 thousand from the office of victim services to help pay for funeral expenses once all receipts and everything has been submitted and that's our primary job with the victims of crime. We also provide case management support services. We do referrals other programs that the families might have need of, and we do advocate to other programs for services to courts, to make sure that the clients who are in danger can get orders of protection either through criminal court or for family court, and we also provide advice on what clients may want to do. Should they be victims of sexual assault or rape if they wish to report to the police how to go about it. If they do not, we know that they have a right not to if they feel that they are in danger and we explain to them the process of what can happen and the steps to take, and we try to advocate on their behalf. In that program we have a 24 7 hotline 1-800-310-2449, which victims of sexual disorder, rape or family members are concerned can call to get some assistance, advice and referrals of where to go. Our pro we have a program, that's funded by the city council, under the domestic Violence empowerment initiative, and in that program we primarily go out to the community to educate on domestic violence. Family violence warning signs how to stay safe, how to develop safety plans in case they are in danger or living at home in violent situations, and we know that during this pandemic, most victims of abuse and violence are with their partners or with their perpetrator, because they can not go anywhere or be anywhere at that moment, and so they are at home and so we're anticipating any kind of escalation and violence within the home, and we try to provide them with one-on-one services virtually since we are my staff and all are working from home, which is a challenge for us in providing the direct services, but we're there for them to talk virtually via cell phone face time. What have you whatever means? They have? We provide education about dating violence and sexual assault, awareness to college students, with our enough initiatives to the state of New, York's Department of Health, and we have the comprehensive adolescent practice prevention program which provides education and to parents, education about sexual health, risks among teens and the prevention of Aids and HIV Stds and contraceptives, and protect them from any anything that would endanger their sexual behaviors. Our main goal is to prevent them from getting to sexual behaviors, by of them all youth development activities, such as workshops and other activities, to keep them occupied and preventing any kind of situations with involving sexual health behaviors, and we also inform parents of those dangers telling parents about the social media. What is safe when it's not safe, how to protect their child, your children, from communicating with the wrong persons online and how to keep your information private and what the tools they need to be safe, while they're communicating in chat rooms or virtually which can be injured. We know we have some youth that would venture out to meet people, and we try to stress the dangers of doing so to keep them healthy and safe, and we do presentations like this, so that communities are aware of our presence and that we're always available 24 7 in our program and try to help the families in need and through all our other programs. If you come to our doors in our program, we can provide them with referral sources to other camera programs that they would be eligible for. Like Ged programs, we have a work workforce program where we teach clients how to become security guards. We used to have a program to help those who are running day care centers out of their own home, how to process it how to get their own licensing to operate. We work with the refugees in the workforce to get them trained in computer skills to get better jobs. We have English a second language and we have after school programs out of school time, which is now from the beacon, centers and cornerstone projects where youth can hopefully hang out, get together with activities and most of it right now is kind of virtual as well, and we are always open to ideas to Pres to about to do presentation, workshops and that's the gist of what our programs can do. I'm open to the community right, the Emmy I can hear you. Okay, that's good! Thank you as well as your 24 7 number that we will have posted so that everyone should be aware of it, so that there is some contact at this time. Are there any questions for Mr Rodriguez? Does anyone have none? Sorry, but I, don't see any answers right, I, don't see any hands up? Okay, go ahead, who's that this is Michael again, sorry to suck up all the oxygen hi just nice to meet you, I'm Michael Video! Thank you for the presentation. I don't mean this to be a controversial question. I'm actually curious, but are there instances where you would recommend we call the Ca Canva crime victim assistance number over I? I'm 911, probably guess with like if it's a question, probably called 911, but are there specific areas in which you would recommend? We call that number over 911 if it's a dire emergency that because our staff do not go out to crime sites but as a dire emergency. Of course. However, if they need services and the precincts that we mainly work with right now are the seven oh seven eight and we are now working with seven one. They can contact directly for us for services and refer clients or families. We do not go out and invite the families. We won't write letters to their homes because of confidentiality, but we have officers actually call and say: I have a family to refer the needs of services. We welcome them to contact us, so we get an assessment of what they need and how we can work with them and if they need other services which Canada does not have such as family court issues in terms of cut child custody and ears, we try to refer them to the right people, so they can get those needs met and we'll do the case management and follow up with them to make sure that they're getting what they need from other sources sounds like Canberra is a place of services that will be there to be offered to the community as needed and as referred to by Pd and other safety officers, correct. Okay, any other questions. Okay, thank you Rick. It was a pleasure hearing from you, and hopefully you won't have too much business, although I hope that they send the right people to let's leave it out. Well, according to what I just heard earlier, the crime has robberies, have dropped because of pandemic and well that might hurt us a little bit because we're not providing much services. But we know things are happening and we know that families are probably not stepping out to report it, because what can be done and most clients need safety, shelter and housing, which is also limited in referrals as well, but we're going to help what we can we appreciate what you're doing is there any other comments that anyone needs to speak about with regard to public safety? You can raise your hand or speak out seeing none at this time. I just would like to wish everyone again, a happy holidays and happy new year. That's coming up. I do also publicly wish to thank the NCOS of the precinct for doing what they're doing to help keep the safety within our community at this time. There is no further questions. We will call adjourn the meeting at 7:21 p.m. Thank you very much Anya for everything that you do to make this thing all work. Thank you good night, everyone happy holidays.
