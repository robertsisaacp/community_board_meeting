Tonight we are at the Public Safety committee meeting as the co-chair we are going of the precinct and how they saved the information from Deputy inspector David, Wall commanding officer of the 70th precinct.
This meeting is starting and the first event that we're going to talk to is Deputy inspector David, Wall commanding officer of the 70th precinct, who will give us a state of precinct and how they safety, information, inspect the wall.
Thank you for joining me, today, just very quickly we're gonna talk about the crime and the precinct over the last month, some tips they have to do with holiday.
He was able to get about five thousand dollars by threatening the person that they were going to be arrested in the social security number is involved in drug dealing, some type of crime in another state and that you will be arrested.
It's, really just young people seeing opportunity they're using these cars in violent, crime, shootings and things of that nature.
Looks like he was not the intended target in that case, but it's just another example of perpetrators using cars and a lot of these paper plates that we definitely are looking at to promote violence.
We're looking to increase our presence places where there's going to be accident, violence, so Friday, Saturday and Sunday, we'll typically see extra police officers out there looking to combat crime and any violence that may occur.
Anyone has any coats or toys they would like to donate to precinct for anyone in this time, especially with this weather, We are accepting toys and cooks with that I'll open it to anyone who asks any questions.
This just this year out of the 15 that we arrested for multiple burglaries, Only three are currently in jail, right, now, So. What we're seeing is a little bit of a recidivism issue, lending itself to increase in burglaries a lot.
Now, If you want to get a little bit more specific in your NCO meeting, you can definitely go over it where it's just you and the police officer, You can talk about the Berkeleys and your precinct and what they're saying the burglars in your sector.
Because people were actually staying home a little bit more in the beginning of the year.
If I broke into your house tonight by tomorrow, I'm back out on the street and when Kovitz started a little bit, because there were no court cases when that started consistently happening, sometimes that emboldens, the recidivists, which I'm talking about the hardcore receiver.
This, is going to jail multiple times back and forth, sometimes that that's emboldened in the beginning of this year, where they're being arrested, they're being released very quickly, sometimes released from the precinct instead of at night in jail or anything like that.
People wheelchairs, who have been robbed of flapper, champion things of that nature, But we don't see overwhelmingly as if individuals disabled in any way that they'll be more likely to be the victim of crime.
One more time you said the west of the yeah West of the yes ground, the precinct west of the parade ground I, run by it most days and as you go like to the north and start to enter prospect, park, it kind of like funnels and there are gates there and a car station there, And it's been there since the summer.
So I just didn't know if there's anything that the public should be aware of as to why that the car is parked there or if there's a way, we could open up the gates and make for an easier flow of pedestrians and bikes that are going through that area.
If, you see there, there's like a police precinct there, You talk about it right, there.
We use officers to protect our own cars because of things that happened like damaged or brake lines being cut, So he might actually be there to just protect the police vehicles that are there.
None, seeing no one's hand raised at this time, Paul and deputy newsy and other detectives and other police officers who are helping out our community to wish them a happy and healthy holiday and a happy and healthy new year, and that should go as well to all the people who are on board with us.
We know we have some youth that would venture out to meet people, and we try to stress the dangers of doing so to keep them healthy and safe, and we do presentations like this, so that communities are aware of our presence and that we're always available 24 7 in our program and try to help the families in need and through all our other programs.
However, if they need services and the precincts that we mainly work with right now- are the seven oh seven eight.
We won't write letters to their homes because of confidentiality, but we have officers actually call and say: I have a family to refer the needs of services.
I, do also publicly wish to thank the NCOS of the precinct for doing what they're doing to help keep the safety within our community at this time.
