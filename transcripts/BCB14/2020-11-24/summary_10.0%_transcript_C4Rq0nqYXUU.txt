Specifically: We invited the folks from the department for youth and community development that are known as DYCD to discuss their work.
Those programs are things like SYEP, the summer youth employment program, which a lot of people are familiar, with, work, learn and grow, wlg, and a few others.
Let them touch on those we're also joined tonight by members of the Vista program from the mayor's office to discuss youth leadership.
So with that, I would like to invite Sarah marks from the Department of Youth and community development to speak on the workforce, connect, programs, Sarah.
This is your first time working with us, One thing that's important to know about us is that our programs are all operated by network of community-based organizations.
All of the programs that I'm going to talk about today are supervised by our central office and designed by DYCD, but at the same time they are delivered by organizations in your neighborhood that either operate locally or citywide.
Right, because at 18 you are considered an adult, So anyone over 18 also has the opportunity to work with small business services at the workforce, one centers and other programs.
So I'm, but I'm here just to talk about specifically like the youth-oriented programs in the DYCD workforce.
The normal SYEP program involves youth going out to work sites on a daily basis for a period of weeks in the summer, So this year, unfortunately, we weren't able to do that.
We used a program called hats and ladders, which was an educational curriculum and it also included project based learning, so service, learning, community, service, learning about civic engagement and so the projects that people worked on for their for their workplace challenge and for their project-based learning.
And I, asked for a little bit of just like a little bit of highlights from that program, and so the Kojo group told us that you know one of the things that they were the most proud of was that they for their workplace.
And you know, of course, had the unfortunate timing of starting a new program, just as the pandemic was in the same year as a pandemic, and it's called advance and earn and advance and earn.
So the new program that was designed is called advance and earn, and it's for youth ages 16 to 24, and the idea is that it has includes literacy and math skills, help with the high school equivalency, test, preparation and also industry, recognized, training, credentials and certification, and it involves internship placement so right now we're actually recruiting for the next cohort.
Someone is interested in working with a particular provider, It's certainly much easier to go to one who's, not in your area, but the the Brooklyn provider is Obt opportunities for a better tomorrow, and each of the programs has a different focus.
The specifics there's a train in urn, which is an out of school youth program that is local through the organization, NYSARC and they.
But I just want to rECAB a few things so in and specifically in Cv 14, Our major providers are Canba and Kojo the Council of jewish organizations of Flatbush, correct, okay, and you said they provided opportunities for 4,475 youth this past summer or was that this year that was this is the summer bridge.
And, we've, you know been working very closely with the young people in our district since 2008, when we started our first annual youth conference, where we had SYEP as the anchor tenant, If you will of the event.
We've had a lot of nonprofits and businesses come to provide lots of different kinds of job internship volunteer opportunities for the young people of our district and put it all in one place, and so of course, This year, a lot of those plans that people got used to got derailed.
Although, like you said it might go back to normal, come next fiscal year, but I just wanted to get your insights on what are the application deadlines for these programs.
You know a challenging to to really like develop the same level of rapport and what we've seen in our programs not specifically work for us, but just our literacy and our after school programs.
You know, I, think a lot of the times, though our providers are people who are very familiar with the community.
But I work on Youth, Leadership, Council's programming, and.
A little bit about youth, leadership, councils and our office of NYC service and how we can best support your community board with what we offer in our programming.
This is our typical info session, powerpoint deck that we share with interested nonprofits, schools, city, agencies, community gardens, nature, residents, NYPD precincts to talk a little bit about youth leadership.
That's under you, know, do programs under NYC service and me also being a Vista member, I'm, showing that you know community importance and collaboration just that the present and future of our city depends on residents working together across communities and sectors.
You know, is that NYC service partners with city agencies, communities based organizations.
Each ylc ties into a city-wide network working collectively to impact important local or topical issues and amplifying youth voice and civic opportunity like if you see, even in our logo, youth voice, counts.
As, the you know, you, the youth leadership team provide, is definitely support with all these councils.
And, you know us as the well seen ylc team- is young being able to just provide that support, bringing everybody together if it's like through professional development.
Since there's different focuses on projects on like events that they, Maybe the youth want to focus on if there needs more guidance, a little an example, maybe from a different council that we definitely provide that, The mission of Ylc so to ensure equitable access to transformative civic opportunity for all NYC high school youth.
So with youth and adult partnership, I'm just going to start there, because this is really something that we always go back to, because it's really pivotal to even like the success of the the program.
The focus is you know, separating responsibilities and things like that, so youth and adult partnerships, not anything else, and then for our other values, is justice and equity.
So acknowledging there is, you know this gap and that all you should just be involved with it, and the systemic change is that just the power of youth voice and action should transform New York into a more fair and just city.
Our, Youth, Leadership Council network this year consists of over 80 ylc's throughout New York city.
You know the ylc team, You know we can be also considered as a whole site, since we have our own council and which is more into kind of like with our I think believe, like 15 youth.
The process of everyday work being done within the host site or organization or and or around an issue impacting their community and suggesting or influencing change and advocacy, is very straightforward, giving a voice to a cause to raise awareness and influence, others to improve the health and well-being of their community and through these avenues with our guide, additional supports, monthly, professional development workshops and trainings offered for or both of our youth and adult members.
Finding out the interest, skills and talents of your Youth Leadership, Council, youth, members, learning about community assets and needs asking questions, conducting action, research and identifying that significant issue to address investigation leads to preparation.
Youth leadership councils focused on in our previous program year in a program here, follows the school calendar.
We transition into taking action and creating change and by May within our program, Timeline youth leadership councils from all around the city will have the opportunity to present the work and focus that they've developed I'll program, your long in monthly or bi-weekly meetings with their leadership.
It's good to have a plan of or area of focus beforehand, but through our work with youth, adult partnership, it's important to have youth input within establishing that process, of course, but we do find that organizations come wanting to start a youth leadership Council, not knowing how to organize it, and so we can jump in at step.
Tonight: okay, to I, understand you're, working on a school project and have a question and you have a deadline to meet so I can allow you for two minutes.
