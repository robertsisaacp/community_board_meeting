It sounds like there's some ongoing stuff going on in the background yet again, I need to here and Donald, I'm co-chair of the community and Environment Committee.
What the current path forward for activating and revitalizing, this historical site looks like today, but first I wanted to start with some history, so the site has actually contained a school since the late 19th century.
Where was I right, so we believe that the human remains are actually associated with an african slave burial ground that may have been located in the vicinity of the school dating back to the colonial era and at those at that time, in the 2000s, when the human remains were found, they were actually interred at the nearby reformed dutch church of Flatbush and as required by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, because you know sensitivity, archaeological sensitivity was identified at the time.
One is a community engagement plan and an anticipated discoveries protocol, and despite the fact that was required, not much actually happened on the site first for several years until as I mentioned, Unfortunately, in 2016, when the school ended up being demolished due to the fact that the you know landmark had severe deterioration and unsafe conditions on the site and the site has really been fallow.
Actually, it was back in just last year when Councilmember Eugene pushed EDC to advance preparation of these environmental review documents that are needed, including again, the community engagement plan and the unanticipated discoveries, protocol, and so EDC engaged historical perspectives, who is a local women, business, owned enterprise or consultant.
So it was just in October actually that the mayor and council member put out a you know a press release and I and announced the path forward, moving forward with development of the site, and that includes an affordable housing site which HPD will talk more about including a youth-centered and vocational community space in the building as well, and then concurrent to that process.
There will be a community based task force which will work in coordination with HPD and their eventual RFP to redevelop the site to come up with recommendations that are focused on a number of things.
So the task force will, You know, speak to you and come up with recommendations around what the program of the housing site looks like more detail about that community space that I mentioned on and or off-site memorialization, and that can take so many different.
Paths is that a plaque on the outside of the building is that an exhibit within the building that speaks to the history of the site is that some located somewhere else like at nearby institutions, so we'll be working in partnership with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to help inform what that looks like and then.
What is the appropriate path forward to handle that, so this community task force has a lot to take on and to uncover and EDC is working with HPD and, as I mentioned LPC, to advance this work over the next about six to seven months.
It's, a pretty aggressive timeline, one in which you know HPD can speak more about as well, but the council member was I, think very purposeful and asked for expediency.
14 is going to be sitting on the task force and thank you in advance to Sean, who has agreed to sit on the task force and be your rep, and we look forward to working with you all and reporting back out on the process.
Hpd again, we'll speak more to their timeline, but just wanted to share that we, The task force, will run you know, starting in December through probably June of next year, and the task force itself will hold the public workshop as well as do an online community survey that will further feed into the RFP.
Those recommendations that come out of this task force process will eventually go into the future housing development request, proposals that HPD will be releasing and their timeline, as you can see on the right, shows that they're most likely going to be released.
So it's going to be co-chaired by Borough, President, Eric, Adams and then Council member Matthew Eugene, who each you know have expressed strong interest in seeing activation of the site.
This includes to a number of local community-based organizations, some who are more development, focused and housing, focused and others who are more historical and can advise on how we actually do the descendant, outreach and plan for memorialization on the site, as well as other community stakeholders and I, spoke to the timeline.
You, know HPD when we think about affordable housing is considered affordable when a household spends no more than one-third of its rent, sorry, no more than one-third of its income on rent and utilities.
I want to start out with just some information that EDC and HPD make already know, I'm going to say something I plan to say at every single meeting and just to be clear.
So, In terms of the task force, we worked with the council member and the borough president, as co-chairs to first identify key stakeholders that should be invited to join the task force, and it was through that process that we got the list that I believe I'm gonna, get it wrong, because I'm not remembering off the top of my head.
This includes you know, organizations that are focused on providing housing and what housing looks in the neighborhood of Flatbush, but then also organizations that have maybe a broader geographic scope like the Brooklyn historical society, but our subject matter and content experts as it relates to the history of Brooklyn.
Potentially, I'm, not sure if there's a place to post that on your website, but that's an idea so trying to identify ways in which we can you know, share information about the goings-on of the task force as we progress in addition to the public workshop and the community online survey that we'll be doing as well.
I would turn the public workshop question over to HPD, since that, actually is something that very much fits into the HPD procurement process and would be a great thing for them to speak.
Different sites are different, so you know those workshops are not exactly the same, but in this case we anticipate we'd, be asking folks about the desired affordability that they'd like to see the project in terms of what households this particular project would serve.
You know we usually talk about the ground floor space in the building and what kind of uses make sense in terms of both commercial uses and community facility uses based on the needs in the neighborhood, and we talked about talk, of course, about the design of the building and then the amenities that the building can have like open space within the project.
The task force process and the public meeting that we'll have will inform that because we don't know what kind of housing development we're trying to do.
Sixth, in the city, for those it's something like 180 per 1000 units of housing, and so, If h would HPD be able to I mean the idea of bringing new housing in into this community.
On the second question: quickly: that's what we'll do the workshop about and, of course, we'll come up in the task force process, too.
Affordability, because we have different programs that we can do based on what kind of households we're trying to serve and what kind of incomes we're trying to serve so that that's not determined yet, and we would look at the community to really express preferences about that on the zoning I'm going to kick it to either Julian or Catherine.
So, I guess I'm piggybacking a little bit on to some of the things that Sean brought up, but just I go through that neighborhood actually regularly on my way to work, and it's a very high-density hood as is.
I. Think in terms of the school capacity question is, you know, is what maybe you were getting at.
There's a process through the city's environmental quality review procedure that you know this project would have to file a report, a an environmental site assessment that would look into basically whether this, whether the number of units that we're proposing has any burden on the school system.
Potentially, You know that we have to go through that process, hear what the priorities are from the community and then figure out how we fit that on the site, but both are possible.
Yes to the first question, so I think you're talking about like the 50 community preference in our lottery system.
I mean typically the way that process works is where the project is located within that community district.
The other part of the question is just the involvement of Kimber 17 I, think you know we're just trying to involve the neighborhood and because the site sits in a on the border.
The neighborhood does mean you know that it's part of the community Board 7:17 as well.
And I think this is a really unique opportunity that if it's important to other people in the community as well, has there ever been something done where you've gotten support a partnership with a food pantry in order to build an innovative model where we can have part of this green space reserved for community gardening or, If there's a plan, to consider a green roof, Yeah, great questions, and I'm victor, you know bringing that point about food insecurity in the neighborhood.
Let them know that the community board that normally this type of plan would be brought before a committee and over the summer the committee wasn't meeting and we did send it out to board members.
It wasn't just us, You know not wanting to talk over the summer because, as you recall, We actually did have some committee of the whole meeting.
You know once I saw the actual visual of what one of those would look like on top of one of the Flatbush.
You can identify people or want us to you know or put us in contact with people who would come and present for sure.
And I'd like to give her the opportunity to have a slot at the next meeting to actually talk about the garden you know.
