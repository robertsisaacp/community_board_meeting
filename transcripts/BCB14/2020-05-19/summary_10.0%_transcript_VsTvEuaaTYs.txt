Brooklyn borough president's office informed Brooklyn community boards on April 22nd that boards are responsible for meeting the New York City Charter requirement to meet every month in September to June conditions.
There are people with their hands raised point one: the board's bylaws we're meeting virtually on WebEx And I'd like facilitating this meeting, and the board 14 staff for coordinating board, members, elected officials and the community, and all of you who are attending this meeting.
It's been properly moved and seconded to approve the March minutes, all those okay, all those in favor raise your hand or say I, say nay, the minutes, our district manager, Sean, 1000, Onion, Urbina who's been really stalwart through challenging times and I want to acknowledge Anya's work in keeping our website up to date, which is even more than a once a day.
You know we're still handling regular complaints and concerns do be do te sanitation, but if first many requests are new and were just a short time, ago, pretty unimaginable assisting their food, pantries and testing sites.
Just, it's amazing to see the community members who've come to filling gaps and distributed food, especially coke bo WLAN and mass beer, to make sure that there's halal and kosher meals available to families and a lot of our businesses have gotten very creative.
Sorry Office of Management and Budget helped themselves to $4,000 out of our budget and gave us a heads up that in the next fiscal year, they'll be taking 9,000 And we're working to expend the $42,500 that city council provided to us.
It has nothing to do with the fact that she's also retiring, and so we only have a few weeks left working with her Trying to train me on some of the tasks that she's taken on, and it just means that Anya and I are preparing ourselves for a little bit heavier lifting over the summer, because I anticipate that hiring somebody is going to confront some challenges.
Thanks to Jonathan judge like we quickly entered into a contract to get our website updated, and he was quickly able to deliver it so that it can be done in time to pay him and expend those funds.
A second item: the chair support is committee of the whole, the board's practice with respect to meetings and public hearings on issues.
As for the cities and states, social distancing, I'll get that right guidelines and prepare support for the year challenges of meeting in quorum requirements prior to be prior to being able assemble, and that concludes the chairs report, and at this time we move on to our guests.
chairman, it would be if I may answer it would be in a consistent with the current executive order of the governor so far as long as he is permitting under state law for boards and councils and legislators and the like, [Applause ] Thank you so much for your hard work.
We actually went to Albany right before the shutdown to test on the budget, and we did- And you know, there's been some cuts, but the whole focus has been around making sure that our hospitals, our essential workers, the operation of the state city government, are in full effect and just a lot of work.

The food program was incredibly important to fara, to myself, to high into Matthew, to really work, to bring it into our neighborhood, not just for kosher but for halal and to make sure that every kid who needs a meal is able to get their hands on one.
No questions asked go to your school and get a meal, and you know it's trying times if people need that a little extra help and which aren't hard to give them what we can And they're, giving us some extra tools over the last couple of days and weeks to help us get help for people who are who have applied to need to apply who are trying to get answers.

Don't want to deal with the alternate side of the street parking, but they eat sure one the streets to be clean, right, so I see commercial corridors like ours, along nostril, Navi, Flatbush, Avenue, Cortelyou, Road being negatively impacted by some of these cuts, and so we have to also consider what are the long-term ramifications for small businesses along our corridor, such as quartile I.
I know we're going through these health crises, but it's forward thinking community work that allows us to maintain the quality of life as we go.
By going to the department, Consumer Affairs website and getting the information to make an application, but for right, now, as long as restaurants are closed, you know I'm, not sure they really want to do that.
There was a lot of good feedback, young people and work sites and providers.
