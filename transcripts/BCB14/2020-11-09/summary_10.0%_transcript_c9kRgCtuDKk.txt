The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony by community members with respect to a variance file pursuant to section 72- 2 to permit the development of an eight, story, seller, residential building, contrary to zr, two three dash rear yard in an R-7, a zoning district at one two, eight four East 19th street between Avenue I, rather Avenue, L and Avenue blocks.
It's pursuant to 7221 of the zoning resolution, seeking a variance that would allow in an R7A district construction of a seller, an eight- story, residential building that does not provide a required rear yard, as would be required by section 23.
Should the application be granted with respect to the proposed building, it would be a seller and eight story, residential building that would be comparable to existing large, multiple dwellings that are located in the lots immediately to the south and immediately to the north of the subject.
This is a simple single relief that sought this proposed building, as designed, would not provide a required rear yard per section.
If you look at the as of right, drawing if a 30 foot rear yard were provided along the south lot line, it creates this incredibly narrow.
One thing of note is that the existing building, that is on the lot, the one family building, is actually located in what would be the required rear, yard.
It's because of its angular orientation and the shape and the fact that it does not have the full frontage on East 19th street requires this unusual rear lot line situation proposal is seeking to build a building that would be in character with most of this neighborhood, which is primarily developed with residential multi.
If you have the photos in the application packet, you can see that the buildings to the south and the north are very similar to what's proposed large multi- story, residential buildings, and the relief sought is only for this one particular yard.
So you know it would provide what is a side yard that would provide a 30 foot yard in the back of the building side: yard, not a rear yard by zoning, but there'd be 30 feet.
Then there would be an eight foot side yard to the north, which is where the current existing building there has its fire escapes and then the building itself would extend up to the lot line.
There is an easement there that allows for those existing fire escapes we're actually seeking to provide eight feet, which is wider than the easement, and the reason it is eight feet, because the way the zoning district works is that you do not normally need to provide a side.
That would look like on the plan just to see how that how that looks in connection with the the 2D remaining single family home, that's behind that would be behind the building.
Sheet, number Bsa-004 shows the current building footprints and if you look at the site, which is highlighted in red on this lot, which is lot 31, you can see the other buildings on the adjacent lots which are 40 to the south 24 to the north, which are the two large multiple dwellings and then lot 72, which would be to the west, which is the other one.
I'll, take a look at the plan as well, just just to confirm that okay, then one other question with the with the request for the variant: Are there any issues in connection with clearance for windows or anything like that along that lot.
We would not be blocking any windows to the south to the north, where the fire escapes are and those existing buildings.
You know it's right off a commercial area and that block has a on the east side, a big building.
Motion to approve edson just raised his hand just to let you know that who raised us on board member Edward, Jen. I just said a question regarding I'm not familiar with the zoning itself, but I'm just.
That's okay, todd just for the record and so that the public knows the the regular meeting of the board is taking place on Monday, November 9th, which is where the full board will we'll hear this recommendation and vote accordingly.
Now, when we go through the actual numbers, as you know, the zoning district allows a 0.5 far.
When you're, looking at the house from the street on the left side, they have an existing side yard of three foot.
You know like a street view of the current front of that street and how it looks and how that house is.
That's already been set in this particular area, specifically on this block for a house of this size, because I'm looking kind of at the amateur early at the Google, Street, views, and I do not see anything near this size on that block, and this is adding a lot of bulk to this.
If you look at this block, what you're going to see is the house to the right is quite large.
But you know, as a general principle, I find myself kind of hesitant to vote for anything that sort of reduces the number of housing units in our district or anywhere in the city.
As far as discussions of design of the building, I do not know how much more information you would like.
I've expressed that I do not think we should move this for vote at the next board meeting until we get more information about what the precedent is around this, and also just a refresher on what you know that air that specific area and the permitting is there.
I think from applicants in general would be you know, sort of a more thoughtful understanding of what the other examples are in the neighborhood or on the block just so that I think we can have a clearer picture and can look at it and.
You know if anyone is suggesting that this building is out of character or something with the to the block or the rest of the neighborhood area.
