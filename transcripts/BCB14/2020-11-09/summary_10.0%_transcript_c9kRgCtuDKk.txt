The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony by community members with respect to a variance file pursuant to section 72-2 to permit the development of an eight-story, seller, residential building, contrary to zr, two three-rear yard in an R-7, a zoning district at one two, eight four East 19th street between Avenue I, rather avenue, L and Avenue blocks.
Both speakers were asked to also provide addresses by email for the record, but, of course, they're, not being asked to state addresses on this webex hearing forum, members of the public, who are viewing the meeting on YouTube and would like to comment on this issue and email.
It's pursuant to 7221 of the zoning resolution, seeking a variance that would allow in an R7A district construction of a seller, an eight-story residential building that does not provide a required rear yard, as would be required by section 23-47 of the zoning resolution.
This is a simple single relief that sought this proposed building, as designed, would not provide a required rear yard per section.
If you look at the as of right, drawing if a 30 foot rear yard were provided along the south lot line, it creates this incredibly narrow, as of right.
One thing of note is that the existing building, that is on the lot, the one family building, is actually located in what would be the required rear, yard.
It's because of its angular orientation and the shape and the fact that it does not have the full frontage on East 19th street requires this unusual rear lot line situation proposal is seeking to build a building that would be in character with most of this neighborhood, which is primarily developed with residential multi.
If you have the photos in the application packet, you can see that the buildings to the south and the north are very similar to what's proposed large multi-story residential buildings, and the relief sought is only for this one particular yard.
It's coming out all the way to the front you're saying that the proposed building or the existing home well, the existing one I believe, is only in the back.
My question is basically: Is a new house going to be next door to the apartment, building or also further in the back.
So you know it would provide what is a side yard that would provide a 30 foot yard in the back of the building side: yard, not a rear yard by zoning, but there'd be 30 feet.
Then there would be an eight foot side yard to the north, which is where the current existing building there has its fire escapes and then the building itself would extend up to the lot line.
There is an easement there that allows for those existing fire escapes we're actually seeking to provide eight feet, which is wider than the easement, and the reason it is eight feet, because the way the zoning district works is that you do not normally need to provide a side.
That would look like on the plan just to see how that how that looks in connection with the the 2D remaining single family home, that's behind that would be behind the building sure is there.
Sheet, number Bsa-004 shows the current building footprints and if you look at the site, which is highlighted in red on this lot, which is lot 31, you can see the other buildings on the adjacent lots which are 40 to the south 24 to the north, which are the two large multiple dwellings and then lot 72, which would be to the west, which is the other one.
Okay, then one other question with the with the request for the variant: Are there any issues in connection with clearance for windows or anything like that along that lot.
But I'd just like to hear, because I know that you said that the fire escape needs to be cleared on the north side.
We would not be blocking any windows to the south to the north, where the fire escapes are and those existing buildings.
It looks like it is a six plus story building and to the south.
I think it's four, but might be a four plus, but that's a very large building, the one to the south okay and to the rear to the rear.
I was curious if there was anything that you had that in the materials that like give a visual for what the what the building would actually look like on the site, any 3d, visual or anything like that.
I, think that let's find a floor plan here, because I know that block very well.
You know it's right off a commercial area and that block has a on the east side, a big building.
You know what I did not mean motion to approve edson just raised his hand just to let you know that who raised us on board member Edward, Jen I just said a question regarding I'm not familiar with the zoning itself, but I'm just.
So if I am, if what I'm hearing from you is, you know a suggestion, rather than a motion that we said that we recommend approval to the full board.
That's okay, todd just for the record and so that the public knows the the regular meeting of the board is taking place on Monday, November 9th, which is where the full board will we'll hear this recommendation and vote accordingly.
Now, when we go through the actual numbers, as you know, the zoning district allows a 0.5 far.
When you're, looking at the house from the street on the left side, they have an existing side yard of three foot.
They are keeping the rear yard, where it is the one on the right, they're, actually increasing the rear yard, because the current rear yard is only 14 foot and change and they're going to be providing slightly over 20 feet.
Do, you have any pictures of you know like a street view of the current front of that street and how it looks and how that house is.
I think I found the black and white picture of what it looks like well, here, I can give you.
That's already been set in this particular area, specifically on this block for a house of this size, because I'm looking kind of at the amateur early at the Google, Street views.
If you look at this block, what you're going to see is the house to the right is quite large.
He was aware of what this was going to look like on the block.
But, you know, as a general principle, I, find myself kind of hesitant to vote for anything that sort of reduces the number of housing units in our district or anywhere in the city.
You know I'm generally of the opinion that in Brooklyn and elsewhere, in New, York I think the number of units needs to go up and sort of taking it.
Maybe, the applicant has a large family or there's a need or a market for larger homes and currently exists in the area, but I'm wondering what our thought process has been about that in the past, and if someone could address that for me, can we address that.
And I know that, because I've personally done it a number of times in this area, so that there is certainly precedent for, as I said, perhaps not on this exact block, but it has certainly been done in community board 14 in the area in which the special permit is permitted.
As far as discussions of design of the building I do not know how much more information you would like, we already discussed the fact that it was set.
You know in, and you could design like Lira said, a building that stretches across the entire 80 foot width and infill and create a massive building.
And I personally think it's a nice looking building and since none of the neighbors have signed up to oppose it.
I've expressed that I do not think we should move this for vote at the next board meeting until we get more information about what the precedent is around this, and also just a refresher on what you know that air that specific area and the permitting is there.
I do not necessarily think that this is the application you know to have that.
What I'd like to hear I think from applicants in general would be you know, sort of a more thoughtful understanding of what the other examples are in the neighborhood or on the block just so that I think we can have a clearer picture and can look at it and.
You know if anyone is suggesting that this building is out of character or something with the to the block or the rest of the neighborhood area.
I. Do not think you know that this application itself should be held.
But I, think we're going to to the full board to approve this
