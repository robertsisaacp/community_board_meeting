Todd, would you would you just take your last name for me, please sure it's Dale D- a- l- E. I got two first names and two last names, so this is called to order at 605 on November 5th 2020, virtually via Webex. The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony by community members with respect to a variance file pursuant to section 72- 2 to permit the development of an eight- story, seller residential building, contrary to zr, two three dash rear yard in an R-7, a zoning district at one two, eight four East 19th street between Avenue I rather Avenue L and Avenue blocks. This is a BSA calendar number 2020-, 55bz and the applicant's representative is todd. Dale members of the public were asked to pre- register to speak by emailing these community Board 14 office, pre- registered speakers were asked to state their name and whether they live in the district and a representative of an organization or represent an organization. Both speakers were asked to also provide addresses by email for the record, but of course, they're not being asked to state addresses on this webex hearing forum. Members of the public who are viewing the meeting on YouTube and would like to comment on this issue and email info. I n F, o at Cbe14, Brooklyn, DOT com and those emails will be collected for the record. Please include address and organization who belong to an organization in mills. The board who are participating in the webex can use your face or her hand or ask to speak in the comments on the web screen. Please clearly state your name prior to giving testimony repeat that. Please clearly state your name prior to giving testimony at this time, I'm going to turn it over to the applicant's representative, Todd Dale, Todd hi good evening. I'm not sure if you could just confirm it for me. Did committee members receive a copy of the application or not I'm not sure. If I need to share my screen at all the board, the board received the copy of the application great. However, if you share your screen, feel free all right. So we'll start with the presentation and if there's any questions that come up we'll share materials as we need to so. As you stated, this is an application. It's pursuant to 7221 of the zoning resolution, seeking a variance that would allow in an R7A district construction of a seller, an eight- story, residential building that does not provide a required rear yard, as would be required by section 23- 47 of the zoning resolution. This site is in a rank in a regular angled lot. It's located on the West side of East 19th street. It's about 222 feet, north of the intersection with Avenue M. The lot has approximately 41 feet, frontage on the West side of East 19th Street, and then it has a depth of about 142 feet. It's irregular. The total lot area is 7,400 except to me 7,046 square feet. Currently, it's developed with a one- family, one- story, residential building that was constructed, Circa, 1966- 1967. It did have a certificate of occupancy that was issued by the department of building. This proposal would seek to demolish that building in order to make space for this new building. Should the application be granted with respect to the proposed building, it would be a seller and eight story, residential building that would be comparable to existing large, multiple dwellings that are located in the lots immediately to the south and immediately to the north of the subject. Lot: a seller would be storage in utility spaces. The first floor would include three residential units in the entrance lobby and then the upper floors, the second to sixth and seventh and eighth floors would each include four dwelling units per floor. The total would end up being 31 dwelling units and the total floor area would be 26,924 square feet. That is an far of 3.82, which is less than the permitted 4.0 far in this particular zoning. The relief required is actually a simple, as opposed to many variances. This is a simple single relief that sought this proposed building, as designed would not provide a required rear yard per section 2347.. The crux of the issue is that if you look at the lot, it is an angled lot just some background on this lot. It was actually formally a street we're not sure if it was ever fully developed or not, but in 1952 New York City eliminated its use as a street and created a tax lot for it and actually then sold it to a private owner originally in 1960s. But that's why this is runs at an angle using an angle slightly different than other lots that are on the subject block because of its orientation and because there is not a full street frontage, there's a little notch in the front of a lot on east 19th. The best way to describe it. The short of it is that the southernmost lot line is actually considered a rear yard and not a side yard based on the definitions within the zoning resolution, because it's within 45 degrees of being parallel to the street line of East 19Th Street. The result of this is that, because it is considered a rear lot line and not a side lot line, it's required to provide a 30 foot rear yard, as opposed to what would normally be in this district. Either a lot line building or an eight foot side yard you're allowed to either do zero eight feet in this district. The result of that is that, if you look at the as of right, drawing if a 30 foot rear yard were provided along the south lot line, it creates this incredibly narrow as of right building. That, I think, is approximately only see what I can get here. The as of right building would be 12 feet wide, so it would run for the length a lot and it could only be 12 feet wide, which would just be infeasible to construct. One thing of note is that the existing building, that is on the lot, the one family building, is actually located in what would be the required rear yard. It was reviewed and approved by the Department of buildings when it was constructed in the 1960s. It's unclear as to why the department of building did not raise a rear yard objection at that time, but they did not and they allowed the construction of the building this approved, or this proposal does seek to develop in essentially the same spot where this existing building is pursuant to the both district requirements of the r78 district and we're seeking relief for that lot line. We do believe that this does meet the findings for event variants. You know there are very unique conditions affecting this lot, it's because of its angular orientation and the shape and the fact that it does not have the full frontage on East 19th street requires this unusual rear lot line situation proposal is seeking to build a building that would be in character with most of this neighborhood, which is primarily developed with residential multi. Multiple dwelling units, including, as I said, if you have the photos in the application packet, you can see that the buildings to the south and the north are very similar to what's proposed large multi- story, residential buildings and the relief sought is only for this one particular yard. No other relief is sought with respect to the floor area. Any other side yards parking bulk, the singular relief. That's a quick presentation, I'm happy to answer any questions about the design or the lot that the committee might have. Thank you so much. Okay, only board members. If you have a question, please raise your hand. I see Brian Nuremberg's hand literally raised. Thank you please question now. The lot is the house is all in the back of the slot. Am I correct in saying that I'm sorry, I did not quite hear that the house is all the way in the back of the lot. So it's coming out all the way to the front you're saying that the proposed building or the existing home well, the existing one, I believe, is only in the back. Am I correct it's mostly to the back? Yes, let me see it does extend more towards the south. It is more towards the back of the lot than immediately up to the front of the lot you're correct, so it's going from where it is now all the way up to the front East 19Th Street. Am I correct to be like the equivalent to the other houses? That's why you're working? I guess I'm not quite sure, I'm sorry. If I'm not quite hearing your understanding. The way I saw it it's oh, the house is basically behind the apartment building. So my question is basically: is a new house going to be next door to the apartment, building or also further in the back the new, so you're saying the new proposed building correct the new proposed building as designed would hang on a second it would provide just so you know it would provide what is a side yard that would provide a 30 foot yard in the back of the building side yard, not a rear yard by zoning, but there'd be 30 feet there. It would propose to be up to the lock line on the south, which is a little bit farther than where the existing home is. However, the existing multiple dwelling that is on the south has no windows there. So building on the lot line would not interfere and then there would be an eight foot side yard to the north, which is where the current existing building there has its fire escapes and then the building itself would extend up to the lot line. So, yes, the proposed building would be up to the front on the lot line. At a portion of that, as I said, there would be an eight foot side yard to the north, so approximately the lobby entrance is essentially what that is. The notch towards East 19th would be about the fire escapes are existing there, there's actually an easement on record requiring just you know, there's an easement on record that requires a three foot portion along the northern portion. A lot not be developed. There is an easement there that allows for those existing fire escapes we're actually seeking to provide eight feet, which is wider than the easement and the reason it is eight feet, because the way the zoning district works is that you do not normally need to provide a side yard. But if you do, it must be a minimum of eight feet. So that's why eight feet? Okay, thank you very much sure ed. You have Gregory Alvarez, Barton, Prasant and Glenn wollen all had hands up and I do not and Boris noble. Okay, let's talk with greg and ask a question: greg: are you unmuted now? Can you hear me yes, great, okay, great so yeah. Just I think, following up on the last question, then, could you show us actually what the what the site plan looks like just to see what that? What really is a rear yard? What that would look like on the plan just to see how that how that looks in connection with the the 2D remaining single family home, that's behind that would be behind the building sure is there. I can try and share my screen. I do not know if that's a function I have or if you, as the moderator, have the ability to give me that power todd. You do have the ability there's a button right below on the bottom. That says share and you are a presenter, so you can go ahead and share that and also greg. You have those materials emailed to you in your email as well. Unfortunately, my share power is grayed out on my screen. It's not letting me! Let me see if I can resolve that it might be because you're on audio, but one moment I tried to start my video is my video, not working yeah. Your video is not working huh. Okay, let me see what I've got because it says: stop video yeah todd. Unfortunately, you have low bandwidth. According to my error message here: okay, I'm working out of a home office, so maybe my middle room is not working very well. Sorry for that it says yeah due to low bandwidth. Video is not currently available. Only for you so greg next best option might be if it's not too much any inconvenience to pull it up from your email. Sorry, everyone! No, the best thing I can say is in order to get the. If you have the plan set in front of you sheet, number Bsa-004 shows the current building footprints and if you look at the site, which is highlighted in red on this lot, which is lot 31, you can see the other buildings on the adjacent lots which are 40 to the south 24 to the north, which are the two large multiple dwellings and then lot 72, which would be to the west, which is the other one family home. And you can see. I do not have the exact measurement there, but I would estimate that is at least 30 feet so between what is proposed with this building and that existing one family home it would be a minimum of 60 foot space between the proposed building and that existing one family. Okay, that's that I think answers my question. I'll, take a look at the plan as well, just just to confirm that okay, then one other question with the with the request for the variant: are there any issues in connection with clearance for windows or anything like that along that lot line? I imagine not, but I'd just like to hear, because I know that you said that the fire escape needs to be cleared on the north side. Are there any clearance issues on the south side in that regard or have the buildings been designed so that there won't be any windows or anything on those I'm Msu bot line? I would say both the building's been designed, so there's no issues and there would be no issues the building to the south, which is on lot. 40 only has one portion of that building, which is on the shared lot line and that building has no windows on that wall so where our building would be attached or essentially right on the same lot line, we would not be blocking any windows to the south to the north, where the fire escapes are and those existing buildings. There are the windows there and there's the fire escape access, and that would be the eight foot which is the required side yard pursuant to R7A district regulations. Thank you. Thank you. That's all I have for now. Thank you. Okay, can you hear me now coming through at all? Yes, Martin thanks. So as I understand it, what you're saying is even with the variance which you're requesting you're still ending up with an far that would be less of as of right. Is that correct? The proposed far will be 3.82. The R7A district allows for a 4.0, so approximately 0.18, or not approximately exactly 0.18 fa or lower interesting, but it's clearly a soft site, since all there was on the lot was a one- story unit. So remind me again: what are the adjacent lots? How high are they? The adjacent buildings hang on a second they're, both large, multiple dwellings. Let me see if I can get stories on them to the north. It looks like it is a six plus story building and to the south. I think it's four, but might be a four plus, but that's a very large building, the one to the south okay and to the rear to the rear. It's the rear is a very similar one- story. One family building when the original owner purchased these lots from the city in 1960. They built one families on these two lots, so the building that would be to the rear on lot. 72 would be very similar to this particular building constructed around the same time. 1966 1967 and the owner of that lot has chimed in on this or not sean or do we know the neighbors were neighbors were notified within the within the radius. Is that Todd? Can you confirm that, yes, we would just yeah, so when we well, they would not. They would be notified when we're assigned a hearing at the BSA, where we would be required to issue out a mailing to everybody. That's within for this particular application within 400 feet, so they definitely would receive a mailing once the BSA hearing is announced. Now, just you know, administratively at the BSA we had filed the application. We've received the notice of comments, which is the initial review, we're in the process of responding to the noticeable comments and hope to have a submission in shortly. So there is no hearing that is yet been assigned at the BSA, but we're hopeful to get, as I say, get the response comments. In soon a copy will be sent to community Board 14 with any changed materials, and then a hearing date would be assigned. Based on current timing at the BSA, I would estimate a February hearing, but these days everything is in flux. The community board 14 also asks applicants to inform neighbors within a 400 foot radius and in fact we sent you the letter. It was a couple of weeks ago. Maybe anja remembers the date more clearly than I remember anything. So are you saying that so that letter was not distributed? I will tell you, I believe it was. I think I thought it was too, but if you I'm fairly sure it was, I personally did not do that. You know someone in the office did I can get confirmation out to you know. I can't do it now, but I can do it tomorrow and double check and make sure that it was sent out. Yeah, okay, but I built how's this, I'm fairly sure it was. I just do not have any specific proof to give to you right, yeah. I believe it was. I thought we had confirmation too. Maybe anja remembers that, but go ahead. Anya we did receive the proof of mailing with the actual photographs of all the envelopes that did go out on October 28th great. Thank you, wow. Okay, I'm done thanks so much Steve, Cohen hi. I guess my question. I was looking through the materials I see. There's number 13 is photographs which was helpful in terms of seeing what the site looked like. I was curious if there was anything that you had that in the materials that like give a visual for what the what the building would actually look like on the site, any 3d, visual or anything like that yeah. I could answer right now. That's an excellent question. If the BSA needs help or if you're looking for a job, that's one of the things they ask for in the notice of comments it's under preparation, it's one of the things we're going to submit with the response notice of comments we'll provide a streetscape showing it in relation to the adjacent buildings. In addition, the photographs we provided, I believe, were the satellite photographs with the initial application, there's also street level and ground level photographs that will be submitted with response to comments so Community board 14 will receive that once we make that submission, they just have not been officially submitted to the record. Yet the streetscape is still pending. I'm expecting it any day. Just unfortunately, was not ready for this evening, ed, oh and Steve. Also, we have not asked applicants to provide the 3D models on this forum just because the 3d model is expensive, so a 3d model on a 2d platform does not seem to make sense, but I think that your request for rendering- or you know for a rendering was hard Ed Boris Noble is next to speak. Thank you, boris yeah. So can you tell us what the breakdown is of two one bedroom studios, the 31 units hang on a second, I know it's 31 apartments. Let me double check. I think that let's find a floor plan here, because I know that block very well. It's it's. You know it's right off a commercial area and that block has a on the east side, a big building. That's really on ocean avenue, the back of it. So it's a pretty crowded block right. Let me double check and see if I can find a breakdown of the actual units one second, unfortunately, normally if the BSA asks us for drawing units, they do not normally ask about like whether it's one bedroom or two bedrooms, at least not for this particular type of application and there's no parking plant on the bottom. No parking, no parking would be required because it would be because of the particular zoning district. Okay, let me double check here so bedroom, one bedroom units it looks like most of them are they're one bedroom units on the first floor and one bedroom's on the upper floors. Also so one bedroom unit and the general size it looks like they're. Well the bedrooms, it looks like approximately 650 square feet, gross floor area for each of the bedroom one bedroom unit, but I can get confirmation for that, and you know we can include that in our notice of comments response. If there's any okay, all right. Thank you. I do not. I do not see any other hands up. Glenn had a hand up, and now it's down so glenn. Your question was answered. I found the birds of my photo and I could enlarge it so that I could see just how tall the buildings were around it. So, yes, that was my question and it's been answered Ed with this, so there's no other board members with hands up. There were no pre- registered speakers from the public on this application. Okay, well board members: you know what I did not mean. Motion to approve edson just raised his hand just to let you know that who raised us on board member Edward Jen. I just said a question regarding I'm not familiar with the zoning itself, but I'm just I had a question regarding mandatory inclusionary housing and if that was something that was required to work, that would not be for this type of particular project. Mih will normally come into play if you're dealing with a most often with like a rezoning situation, whereas this is a variance. One thing, though, that I would note as far as affordable housing is that you know we're still opening a process, but at this time the property owner is intending to move forward with a 421a application to housing, preservation and development, which would then end up being a certain percentage of affordable housing. That would be, you know, contingent on approval by HPD and then meeting the new program requirements. I will be honest with you. I am not the attorney in our office. You normally works with the ins and outs of the 4208 a program, so I can't give you 100 specifics, but I do know that the program, but I can confidently say as the program would then set forth a certain percentage of units for affordable housing. If it is accepted into the 421- 8, okay, thank you Todd. Are there any other board members who wish to ask a question or speak in any regard? Okay, hearing, none and I've been informed by the district manager that we do not have any commentary from the public So board member. You know the the routine. What's the training motion to approve? First of all, before that motion we have to allow for any discussion. Okay, I'm sorry! Is there any discussion on this by board members? Okay, so if I guess your motion to approve is an order, well, we usually look for a consensus. You know, as opposed to approving emotion, do most of us. You know let's try and arrive at consensus, we huddle, we, we arrived at consistent consensus, but I have not heard any discussion. So if I am, if what I'm hearing from you is, you know a suggestion, rather than a motion that we said that we recommend approval to the full board. Is that what I'm hearing from you if Brian yes, Sir- and I have no problem with that? Okay is there anyone opposed to that see any hands raised, and I and of course no one has verbalized anything, so we will recommend approval to the full board on this. Thank you todd for that presentation and at this time I and move on to our next item. Hey. Thank you have a good evening, I'll work on my internet connection. That's okay, todd just for the record and so that the public knows the the regular meeting of the board is taking place on Monday, November 9th, which is where the full board will we'll hear this recommendation and vote accordingly. Can you confirm for me what your every community board is different, your policy? As far as do we need to make a presentation? Do you want us to make a presentation you do you do not need to make a presentation? It's unlikely that you would be asked to make a presentation, but you're welcome to join in case. There are any any questions but not required. Okay, thank you. So much everyone have a good evening say: stay healthy and safe. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. This hearing is concluded, 6 P.M for the record and the next public hearing. You know we'll give it a minute and then we'll begin at 6:37., okay, this public hearing at 6:37 on pm on Tuesday November, 5th 2020 via Webex. The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony by community members with respect to a special permit filed pursuant to section 73- 622 of the zoning resolution of the city of New York, as amended to request a special permit to allow the enlargement and combination of two single family residences into one single family residence in a residential R2 zoning district. At one two, one: five and one two one: seven East 22Nd Street 2020- 65-dz, the applicant's representative, is Lara J Altman Lira. Are you with us? Now I am. How are you all you're? Well, thank you. Please proceed hi, Leroy, hi Larry nice to see you as I see, and before I go very far into this. I want to point out that I did notify the neighbors as required by your board. I am here this evening representing the Herska family and Mr. Herska is on with us, as is his architect, Jose Ramirez, and he's looking for a special permit to Enlarge, I would say a single family home, but what they're actually looking to do in this one, which is a little unusual and actually very interesting, is they're looking to take two homes and merge them and typically when we do that, what we've done is we've knocked down one house and expanded the other in this case he's maintaining the two existing homes he's linking them in the middle and he's making some other modifications and, if possible, if we could share screen, I would love to go over it on the building with you. Is that possible? Please sure! Yes, do you have the share button at the bottom of your screen? I do not. I was looking for that when you mentioned it to Todd, and I do not have that option. Let me see if I can add that one really quick sorry about that. In any event, why do not we go through the objections, while we're waiting for that, because we do not need the plans to discuss that there are four objections on this application. The first is floor area. The second is open space ratio, the third is side yard and the last is rear yard. Now, when we go through the actual numbers, as you know, the zoning district allows a 0.5 far. Typically, we request a 1.0 in these applications in this particular application. We're actually only requesting a 0.92, so it's quite a bit lower and, of course, as the amount of flow area goes up, the amount of open space goes down. That always happens here. Next is the yard. When you're looking at the house from the street on the left side, they have an existing side yard of three foot. I'm sorry, two foot, eight and they're going to be continuing that two foot eight. So it's not reducing the distance between the houses on the left and our house and on the right side when you're looking at it from the street they're, reducing it just slightly to a permitted side, yard of 11 foot, 10 inches and lastly, in the rear yard. If you look in the existing buildings, the one on the left, they are keeping the rear yard, where it is the one on the right, they're, actually increasing the rear yard, because the current rear yard is only 14 foot and change and they're going to be providing slightly over 20 feet there. So those are the waivers that are requesting and should we have the share button yet because I do not yeah yes, do you see it there, I've assigned you the privileges? No, it's not popping up here. Anya. Can you send us the documents like you did like you should have it? They were all in the same email Glenn. It's the second link right below that same email. You should have them all, have the hard copy here as well. Okay, we can't get the share button to work. We can do it. This way, as you see, these two white portions are the existing buildings as they stand. What we're looking to add is this connection right here. This little addition right here and there's a tiny little addition right here. The front of the building is also being modified. Slightly, the front yard is being reduced, but not within what is a problem. They are required, a 15 foot, front yard and the front yard is going to be quite a bit larger than that. If you look right here, it is going to be for 16 feet and over here it's 15, 5., okay, so this is to give you an idea of the overview, and now I'm going to show you, I think my favorite page of the plans- and I believe you should have that privilege now there, let's see oh perfect now I do oh, I'm so glad you did that. Let me just get into it. Are you sharing my screen right now? We do not see a share, yet, let's see I'm going to hit it again. Okay, can you see my screen? Yes, yeah perfect. Now you all are seeing any of the areas that are hatched are the new portions that we're discussing any of the areas that are white are not I'm going to bring you to my favorite page of the plans, we're going to scroll all the way to the end, and I'm going to show you what a beautiful building this is on the top left. You are looking at the front of the building on the bottom. You are looking at the rear of the building and, of course, on the right side. You are looking at the two sides of the building and you all see it is absolutely beautifully done. If you have any questions, it'd be my absolute pleasure to go through them with you. Okay, any raise your hand, you have glenn woolen and Boris Noble and Nina sabgear with hands up. Okay, please proceed. Okay! No! I'm looking this over and I'll get back to you, because I have a lot of documents to look at. So thank you, okay! Thank you! Morris, oh Nina. Okay, sorry yeah do you have any pictures of you know like a street view of the current front of that street and how it looks and how that house is. I mean I know there are some pretty big houses there, but how does it fit into the rest of the neighborhood? Clearly, let me hit share again and with pleasure. I will into a couple of the buildings. I'm hoping you can see it right now. Can you see these right now, black and white illustrations? Yes, that is a black and white illustration of what it looks like, as you see the building on the right, 1221 East 22Nd street. That was actually a BSA special permit as well. That came through your board a couple of years ago, more than a couple of years ago. I guess at this point and the two other homes on the left are existing. Do you have a picture of what it looks like now actual photographs, the closest I have, let's see to photographs, I'm trying to see. If I can find you any photographs, I can show you the existing photos. I think I found the black and white picture of what it looks like well. Here I can give you. This is what the street actually looks like. This is the site with the two homes on the left. Here is the site. You can see a portion of the home on the left and a portion of the home on the right, and here you get a better view of the home on the right leroy. The bundle on the left is where I used to live in. Oh, that's, the one yeah nice you're missing out on a good neighbor yeah. What can you do? Things are worse. I went back to my original location, I'm better off, so these are the houses across the street. Just to give you a feel, this is picture eight section. Seven. These are the pictures of the houses across the street and I will go back just for your purposes to seeing these are the two houses that are being merged in the center. Of course, the house on the right is the one I told you was previously BSA special permit, and here we go. You can kind of see the two houses to the left that are existing and are not subject to this application are those the photos you were hoping to see. Yes, thank you, oh my pleasure. If I can just jump in there, the this is the the I mean I other than joining these two houses as one are there. Any other modifications that I'm missing here. Well, let me go back to the proposed plans, so I could show you specifically well certainly the facade of the two houses. If you look closely what you'll see there's the merger in the center, which you see very clearly, then on the right side, you will see there is a two- story addition. Do you see that next to the parking spaces, the small two- story? Addition? Okay, then, coming around towards the front of the building the front. The shape is changing slightly and it's being brought out a bit okay, so that the portion on the right side that is going to 15 foot 5, was previously at 16 foot 10. the piece on the left, that's going to 16 foot 9 previously at 19, or, I should say currently at 19. and then, if you keep wrapping around the building, you're going to see that there's a tiny little addition on the left side in the sign yard. You see that yeah, okay and, of course, the addition of a chimney. In addition, one of the houses currently has an attic. They both have two stories. One has an attic. What's going to happen now, I'm going to flip to the attic just to show you there's going to be an attic that spreads across to both buildings. It's not a large attic, but it will spread across to the building on the right. Okay, thank you that answers my question. I think the next sean who was next Dwayne Joseph has his hand up there. Are there were other hands up, but they're all down now Dwayne Joseph has a hand up and Nina has to ask you, okay, I think that's from B4 good evening good evening, good evening, everyone Lira, I just have a question- is there a precedent? That's already been set in this particular area, specifically on this block for a house of this size, because I'm looking kind of at the amateur early at the Google Street views, and I do not see anything near this size on that block, and this is adding a lot of bulk to this. These particular lots. So is there a precedent, or would this be the precedent? Well, actually, if you look at this block, what you're going to see is the house to the right is quite large. That is a special permit. Application that was granted is that a cop was that a combination of two lots was that combining two lives or just an expansion of one, my recollection, is that it was an expansion of one right. So is there any precedent on the block or in the neighboring area, where we have combined two lots into one? I've done it a number of times in the area. I do not have the addresses off the top of my head. I do not believe they're on this particular block. We approved one across the street. I have done this one across the street. Mr Haas had it done, but I do not think that's right here. No across the street on 22Nd street to l and we approved two houses to be combined what you guys did with the BSA. We ended up yeah. They saw the whole planet. You guys have approved one. It was withdrawn at BSA and Dwayne. I can look. I can look through our records on other on other lock combos, that we have that the board has lot combinations, are something I've come in front of your board many times with. I could certainly come up with a list yeah, but as far as on this particular block, I'd have to look more specifically. I will tell you that this is a very unusual one in terms of the fact that we're not actually taking down one of the buildings. He was very careful in designing this home, but when I say he, I should say Jose Ramirez who's. The architect was very aware of what is going on in this block and if you notice, he set back the center of the buildings when he did the merger that was done to keep a very specific look on the block, as opposed to having one solid edifice that came across at the 15 foot mark. He did not do that. He was aware of what this was going to look like on the block and he tried to design accordingly, and you can see that I'm going to scroll back to this, you can see how setback the center is, and it has two front pieces on the right and left almost appearing as two separate buildings. That's why that center is set back. Okay. Thank you, of course, sean shawn, who we have next billy richling and Greg Alvarez both have hands up hi. So forgive me if this is sort of beyond the bounds of what we are considering when we vote on this application, and this may be a question more for actually my fellow board members than for the applicant, but you know as a general principle, I find myself kind of hesitant to vote for anything that sort of reduces the number of housing units in our district or anywhere in the city. I recognize this is an area of single- family homes. It's just one home, but you know I'm generally of the opinion that in Brooklyn and elsewhere in New York, I think the number of units needs to go up and sort of taking it. Two units and combining them into one is not something I feel super excited about. Given the housing pressures in our area. I assume the thought process here is you know. Maybe the applicant has a large family or there's a need or a market for larger homes and currently exists in the area, but I'm wondering what our thought process has been about that in the past, and if someone could address that for me, can we address that yeah? I wanted your board to know that this is actually for the current owner. This is not being built as a flip. This is not being built as a development by a developer. This is somebody doing this for his own family. If I might address this a little bit, this building boom, that's been going on for the past. Almost 10 years now has got the city somewhat overbuilt, which is driving prices down rents down so right now we do not have what I would consider a housing crisis, although that does not change your feelings necessarily about the situation, but there's not really a shortage and there's more buildings going up all the time. That's it I'm done. Thank you, Glenn. Is there anyone else who wanted to question or comment yeah? I would like to kind of weigh in if I could, this is Nina Sabger. Okay, I mean you, know a host. This size does kind of take my breath away, but you know, as I, as I said earlier, the size itself relative to the neighborhood is not really unprecedented. Then I also know that you know a lot of the families are substantial. You know we're not talking about your two point, one kid or whatever the going number is and and many of these families you know are so cramped. You know that you know I mean not that those that house they were in was so tiny, but you know they would be looking at well. We can either expand here and stay where we are or we're going to head upstate. You know just like the Memphian Spring Valley area, where you know some place like that, where we can, you know, get a lot more land and a lot more elbow room. So you know so that's you know something to consider in terms of you know. Returning to the neighborhood, okay Ed, you had Greg Alvarez next in line to speak, go ahead, Greg, yeah, okay, great yeah, just two things I think, just following up on duane's comments, the size of the building. I just also want to confirm as well whether or not there might be pressing as well for the size of the lot. It does look like the lot is a little bit larger than the lot next door, the next door. It looks like it was a 60 foot, width, squat and then here it's an 80 foot lot, so I just want to make sure that there would be pressing in there for that and then related to that. I do not really touched on this already. Can you talk a little bit more about all of the mitigation factors you have taken into account here? I think you mentioned earlier about that. It's sort of set in the middle that might reduce the bulk a little bit and then also on it. The floor area ratio is a little bit lower than you know than the one. So you can just talk about that as well. Just to kind of you know just to kind of fit in with here. With that 622 talks about it was. It was a little hard to hear. I'm sorry, I was so there. It was a question if you can hear me better. It was a question about some of the mitigations and design. There was a setback in the middle to decrease. Bulk, I think, is what gregory saw in the in the in the plans and also asking about the precedent of combining the disparate lot sizes and something that's been done. Many as far as combining lots to get to an 80. It has been done a number of times in the area, and I know that because I've personally done it a number of times in this area, so that there is certainly precedent for, as I said, perhaps not on this exact block, but it has certainly been done in community board 14 in the area in which the special permit is permitted. As far as discussions of design of the building, I do not know how much more information you would like. We already discussed the fact that it was set back. Would you like the architect to discuss it as well? Okay, I'll ask you to at the very end gregory. If you can hear me, Lira is asking if you want the architect to talk about the design, including the setback. Yes, that would be great if you can hear me ramirez the architect. How are you good? Thank you good. So, yes, we spent a lot of time with the owner back and forth, designing the building being respective to the massing, knowing that it is an 80 80, foot lot and time was spent, reducing the bulk of the building you know in, and you could design like Lira said, a building that stretches across the entire 80 foot width and infill and create a massive building. But if you look at the, if you look at the elevations and the renderings, it's the building sets back in the center. We have lower roof height on the side. We change a roof height in the rear. There's a lot of massing studies that were done to try to keep the bulk of the building down. I think it was very successful in that the building does not appear to be as large as it could be so, like I said, we spent a lot of time setting the center back. We even put the windows in the center serve the function of creating kind of like a light connector between the two masses, so that the building does not appear very heavy from the facade, also so that we employed that light window, horizontal fenestration to also lessen the mass of the building. We and if you look around the entire perimeter it goes up and down in and out, pushes back pushes in the roof lines. I think a lot of times was spent successfully reducing the mass of the building. Thank you, Jose greg. If you can hear address your question. Yes, thank you. Okay, Ed, Garden prasant has a hands up and speed. Plotzker would also like to speak Sphee and Barton Plea. Please, and it looks like he's having trouble with his microphone I'll, try to help unmute him while you're working on that. Perhaps we can go on to Barton and come back to Svlaska Pardon prasad. Can you hear me, I'm not sure if you addressed it earlier, I just can't recall, but the history of ownership, of the two lots is the owner owned one bought the other or bought the two simultaneously or, if you just like give me a quick sketch out of that. I do not have an answer to that. Jose by any chance, do you know, did he purchase them both at the same time? For this, I'm not sure, I'm not 100 sure, no! Okay! Thank you. Thank you. It's really with us now, in the meantime, ed we have Glenn. Oh, go ahead. Yeah! Sorry to interrupt. I do see that speedplatzker is unmuted. If you would like to try it again, you are not muted, okay, ed we have Glenn. Wollens has a hand up. Oh thank you. I'm curious. Do we have any of the neighbors signed up to speak? No, pre- registered speakers. Thank you. Okay! Do we have any hands up? No, I'm seeing none! Okay! You want to try one more time just say sv. If you can't get your comment in, you can email the office or give me a call tomorrow, and we will try to make any comments. You have part of the record or get an answer from. You retroactively I'll, be happy to answer any questions I just wanted to add. I spoke with me. I spoke with his question was answered, so we are all good tonight: mutual phone mutual microphone there he's muted now, okay, thank you, since we have no pre- registered speakers or commenters board members, let's huddle and let's try and arrive at consensus here. Is there any discussion? Any comment? Oh this is billy. I just have a quick. I guess quick question to go back to the very first thing about the parameters with which we consider these applications. Am I you know if I vote to prove or deny this. Is it that I, as a community board member, can decide for any set of reasons? I think it's not in the interest of our district to approve this and therefore I can vote no or is it that, on the grounds of the application you know, are there any particular individual considerations based on our own rules that I find problematic, and so it's a narrower framework. Sean can vote. You know based upon either or you know, as a board member, you know you have you have the option to vote your feelings on it, so you know Ed. If I might comment yeah sure what we do today is try to come to a consensus of what we're presenting to the full board and that the full board is when we're going to actually vote. So you can vote any way. You want at the full board meeting and today is just a matter of the consensus as to what we think it's a good idea or not a good idea, and I personally think it's a nice looking building and since none of the neighbors have signed up to oppose it, I see no problem. I agree and bill if I could just add two and as a reminder, because it has not been mentioned, except for when Ed introduced the item. This is a proposal in the special permit, district and billy. I think that you were there a couple years or a year or so ago, when Richard Barack made a presentation to our board about why the special permit district was established, but I'm happy regardless. That does not. You know not meant to sway. You you're welcome to chime in on. However, you feel, but I'm happy to provide those materials as a reminder of the establishment of the special permit district and the fact that this board does have a precedent for approving bigger abodes in the special permit district than elsewhere in the district for sure yeah. I was there and I appreciate that, and I certainly understand the need. I guess I'm just a little concerned about. You know to the extent that this is something that is and continues to be, a trend. The sort of long- term cumulative impact of many of these types of conversions is: I'm just not sure what that means. I feel a little ambivalent about what that pretends for housing in the future, which is fair and but we can also just review the parameters of the special permit district, so the trend within that would be different than the trend outside of it sure. Okay, thank you. Okay. Let me hear some more some more input on this board members. What do you want to do with this? I think we should bring the chances to the board. Well before that happens, efraim. This is Dwayne Joseph. I will say that and I'd like to have it on the record. You know I am concerned that we are creating a bit of a trend, even if it's within the special trip yeah, please Anya did it. Thank you thank you, so I just I just wanted to have it on the record edits. Dwayne again, I just want to have it on the record. I am a bit concerned about this. I know you know I would love to if sean, if you do not mind, sharing re-, sharing the information about the special permit there, or I could be mislabeling that just so we have like at least for myself. I have a refresher of it would be great before the next board meeting, but I just wanted to express that will do. Mr chairman, I would like to make a suggestion very nice. It's very nice that people get pictures and we see models, as I mentioned once before. I personally make my business go check out the project. My own eyes, it'll be a lot easier if people to realize what's happening, they'll see things themselves as opposed to just looking at the plans or a model, just the point of information. Yes, it takes 5- 10 minutes to drive down, but it works. Well, of course, that's a great suggestion, afraid for people who have the the time and the wherewithal to do so at it's a it's a great way to inform yourself about any project, that's going on in our board district. Thank you for that. No problem. So what are we doing guys? I mean if you have reservations, I do not just need to hear your reservations. I need to hear you know your reservations, but what you know, how should we proceed? This is Dwayne again I mean I have my reservations. I've expressed that I do not think we should move this for vote at the next board meeting until we get more information about what the precedent is around this, and also just a refresher on what you know that air that specific area and the permitting is there that's my position: okay Dwayne, this is Glenn. Basically in this particular district, the rule has been to keep the fars at one or below and occasionally they've been pushed, and that's when we've objected. This is below a one far. So it's within the scope of what we've been approving over the years. So I so I have no objection to it. Okay, so I'm hearing objections, I'm hearing, no objection, Barton prasant has a hand up and Greg Alvarez have has a hand up right, Barton, please. This is a theme that I think has risen over the last few years. I I'm not sure that this particular applicant is one in which I would take a do or die stand, but in general, I'm going to side with Dwayne and billy in that. I think this deserves as a concept a significant review. Again, I'm not entirely 100 certain that this is the development in which I would make that stand, but I would certainly argue for a more comprehensive review of the trends and how they're impacting labor how they are having an impact on the neighborhoods and what our responsibility should be to our neighborhoods thanks greg are you? Are you there, I'm here? Okay, so yeah? So I just wanted to point out that, if we're reading directly from the special permit requirement, this is what it says. This is the last sentence, and I think this is the crux of you know. Anytime. We hear these sorts of applications, so it reads as follows: the board shall find- and this is the the BSA but we're recommending to the BSA. So the board shall find that the enlarged building will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the building is located, nor impair the future use or development of the surrounding area. The board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards to minimize adverse effects on the character of the surrounding area, so that that's really what you know, I think our pledges with the board charges and for me, I think you know I do not care what Barton says. I do not necessarily think that this is the application you know to have that stand. I think it's really what I'd like to hear. I think from applicants in general would be you know, sort of a more thoughtful understanding of what the other examples are in the neighborhood or on the block just so that I think we can have a clearer picture and can look at it and say sure: we've done this before it does fit in with the immediate area and that then, of course, you know, we agree that the special permit you know should be should be applied. So I mean, I think, that's what I'd be. Looking for here so I mean, I think from my perspective, I think you know, I think it's something we can recommend, but you know I would just condition it on something that could be provided where again, it would be a more thoughtful review of of those prior precedents, and you know that an applicant will look to that and say of course, look at that one over there look at this one over here, so that that's all I have for that's all. I have to say on this one Mr chairman, the next person to speak is Abe Trev, yeah hi. How are you I just do not understand? The board has previously approved buildings like this and normally when we come to the board, we're trying to expand the buildings and it's usually we're going into a backyard or we're taking away a driveway they're not doing any of this over here. So our job is as of right is: are they entitled to this or are not they entitled to it? Our job is not to say well he's building a much bigger building, and maybe it's sticking out. That's not the case in this case over here anyway, because the they're sitting in the building and it's not going to stick out so just because some of our board members feel uncomfortable because someone is building a palace, that's not out of our concern. Is he entitled to it or is not, or is he not entitled to it? That's our job and then we can bring it up to the main board. We're just here to either make the recommendation and the main board will do it. But for us to set this aside and say: let's come back and discuss it, there's nothing more to discuss over here. We have the plans we looked at. It is the entitled to it. Then we should vote to approve. It looks like snowball would actually like to address the address us on purpose. Forrest noble is next to you. So I hear the bigger picture. You know which is really a city planning issue. I mean if it's really, we have to take it to city planning. If we want to downsize the neighbor, it's really city planning. What I'm actually I'm interested in does the building the current building have any open violations with DOB, because at the end of the day, this landlord this owner is actually going and following the rules they're going through the process, they're going through the to the you know, framework through the you know, the protocol they're not doing it and then coming back to us and saying now approve it to me. That's when I get a bigger. In that case I would say no because that's you know it takes some gall to do that. So in this case, I believe we just base it just on the merits not on the bigger picture, the bigger picture. Really, we should actually go to city planning and say, let's downsize the area, that's a whole different story, so I'm kind of you know. I hear both sides, but at the end of the day, he's fought. The last owner is following the rules of following the protocol and asking for our permission so and does not have to be unanimous. People can vote. No, all right, that's it! Thank you. Thanks thanks to everyone who has who's spoken on this, is there anyone else? There are no new hands up. Okay yeah. As far as the board's responsibility are, this oops possibility the important numbers will we do have a responsibility to make a recommendation based upon you know. If the applicant is you know as being a good person or if they're doing the right thing you the fact that the building has to be in character with the proposed building, it should be in character with the rest of the neighborhood, the rest of the block. You know that's a responsibility of ours and you know if anyone is suggesting that this building is out of character or something with the to the block or the rest of the neighborhood area. That's a valid question, but just to say that, for some reason you do not care for it or because you know of housing issues in the city or something that that's the way to go our real responsibilities as board members who are present here tonight, who are to make a recommendation to the full board on how the board should actually vote on this. I mean we need to arrive at a consensus, something that we can all live with, but you know that it should. We should- and I heard a few comments you know against the basically against the proving you know as it is. I think I heard one person mention approving with some stipulations, but I think I'm hearing more approval than I'm hearing anything else right now. So so you know, let me know if you know my take is correct. If you are not, you know, if that's not how you feel, let me know so that we can kind of hash this out and arrive at a real consensus here. Steve Cohen has a hand up, please yeah, so I think you know the overall policy discussion is interesting. I think billy Dwayne, Barton and Boris made some good points in that regard. So actually what I thought I had was, maybe you know maybe it would be a good topic for the maybe the community, Environment Committee or you know, to have like a special. You know board meeting to have maybe a sort of the policy discussion iron that out, but I agree with some of the other folks who've said and includes you know: Barton sentiment. I do not think you know that this application itself should be held up. You know for that overall discussion. I think you know this is in line with stuff we've approved before so I would I would move to approved. I said the reason why I separated it before exactly for this reason. So people see what the whole block looks like you can't see one house by a picture. You can't see my plans, you want to see a block. You got to see a block, that's the only fair way to do it. People are on the board their responsibility to see what they're doing not just to go by blind, even if you, google it on Google maps. Unless you see the whole block similar to one Libra show this before. Okay. Thank you. So I think I'm you know and Steve I think I you know my feelings are very much the same. As you know what there might be concerns. I do not think this. The concerns are sufficient to you know just have this applicant, you know anything or else that you know is going on here. I mean there's more information that we need to get as a board or as board members or anything like that education we need to get. You know. I do not think it's appropriate for us to kind of hold the oh, this applicant hostage on that. So may I have the floor for a moan, please. I just want to make a short comment. I live on East 23Rd Street, partially backing the property in question. I'm actually backing the previous project that the board approved for a proposed building, that's been built and the families have moved in, and you know I'm almost the only one present that lives literally within yards of the project and I've been I've passed. It I've seen the two buildings that are existing now and overall, I'm living in the neighborhood over 40 years. My family grew up in this neighborhood and they actually live in this neighborhood and bought homes in this neighborhood. The only thing that happened to this neighborhood in the last 40 years, with all these Mr Eisenberg, we lost you there Mr Eisenberg. We can't hear you right now. You have to put your microphone back on here. This microphone is on it's just not functioning. Okay, they've gone their own way, but insofar as the news concerns and I'm very familiar with this neighborhood, I can attest be the resident of the house right behind me that took over two and a half years to build and it turned out to be beautiful, certainly a great deal nicer than the building that was there before, and the same thing will happen here. I can't imagine that the new property and the request that's being made to make the changes to the existing two pieces of property will do anything to make the overall neighborhood nothing much improve back. Thank you, massage! Are there no additional hands? I said well one overtime running once again: let's huddle now, do we have consensus to approve or are we saying approve with any conditions or just what? Let's let let's go? Okay, can I may I make a motion yeah, you know for this we're just trying to arrive at consensus, so please go ahead, say what you like to say. Oh so I was going to. I was going to move that we approve it if it does not have to be done. This motion, then, okay, thank you Nina for anyone who is opposed to approval, suggesting recommending approval to the full board. This is Dwayne. I am. Those members will have the opportunity to add. Just remember that this is a. This is a consensus recommendation to the full board and members who still maintain an opposition to it will have the opportunity to do a voice vote at Monday's meeting and that opposition will become part of the public record at that time. May I tell you something sure album I just want to offer my services to the center. There you saw I'd, be happy to discuss with Wayne Joseph Billy Richland anyone else, who's interested some of the history of the special permanent district and some of the precedents that we have a number of properties within the special permit designated district that for which we have approved a combination of two adjacent bonds, the construction, the single residence combined on. So this is not without a financial precedent, yeah wow! Thank you, I'm just like I'm like flying. Okay, so there's no other discussion here. I think what we're what I'm hearing from at least the majority of board members who are present or who have spoken is a recommendation to approve so correct me if I'm wrong, but but I think we're going to to the full board to approve this okay. Thank you excellent. All right. Thank you board members. Thank you very much for your time. Thank you. Have a good night have a great night everybody thank you lira all right once again, thanks for attending and we'll see you at the board good thanks to those of you.
