So, okay, gail, if you want to just and open the meeting by the public hearing by announcing I'm sorry, can you just email me the script? Oh my gosh, let me see if I can in a text it may be easier all right. Just I just forwarded it. I've not received it as yet, I'm not sure wow Gail did you receive either one yeah. I just received something so you yeah, I just received from you so I'll, go ahead and read this. You will have to forgive me because I can hardly see it. So I have my cell phone up in my face because I can't see without my glasses, all right, so this public hearing is called to order at 6:49 p.m, on Sept on September, 14 2020 via Webex. The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony with respect to Community Board 14's recommendations for the city's fiscal year. 2022 capital and expense budgets. Copies of the board's proposed priorities are enveloped in community Board, 14's district needs statement. Copies for review are available on community Board 14's website. If you would like to comment on the board's priorities, please email info at Cb14Brooklyn.Com. If we receive comments during the hearing, they will be read aloud for the record. Any comments received after the close of the hearing will be attached to Cb 14's official recommendation as an addendum, please state clearly for the record, your name address and organization. Prior to giving testimony. Do we have any registered Adam chair? We do not have registered speakers. I will ask again that everybody and God could you please meet yourself, Lisa Derek, please meet yourself. Thank you that helps with the feedback we had. One recommendation form that was provided by a community resident Martin, Sam Samoylov and we have, in his recommendation, was to install a capital request to install bollards at bus stops. It was. It was inspired by the tragic accident on Ocean Avenue last year, where a young person was fatally hit by a car at the bus. Stop on ocean Avenue. It looks like a sound recommendation. We will consider you know we'll include it in our district needs statements about traffic safety and as a budget request. I'll also add that if anybody has other ideas regarding the district needs statement and related budget requests, these are the ones that are officially being entered into the record this evening, but we're always open to these ideas and suggestions. Thank you. So I guess, if there are not any further speakers, we will conclude the meeting the public hearing meeting at 6 pm for the record. Thank you, gail you're. Welcome. Glad to have you here at last. Is that mask man, it's the Lone Ranger. Well, so we had no public. We had no registered speakers for the public hearing. We had. We had one pre- submitted recommendation. Okay, so we have a few minutes before the before the official meeting, so talk among yourselves right so board members who had to wait for the public hearing to start just thinking now you do not have to wait so long for the meeting to begin in between yeah sure, 6:45, we're ready, 653 actually and right. We can begin the meeting because there we did post on our meeting notice that we would go directly into the into the public meeting. Thank you just pretend that you're hearing a gavel and this meeting of community Board 14 is called to order on September 14th at 6:54 p.m. Under the applicable statutes of New York state, the charter of New York City awards bylaws and Robert's rules of order. The board's policy is to encourage detailed public discussion of matters before the board at our committee meeting and the keyrings. Consequently, except by board members, there will be no public discussion at our regular monthly meetings of matters about which a public hearing or committee meeting has been held. Specific service delivery requires or complaints should be brought to you with the district offices by calling the board office during regular business hours or by visiting our website anytime. Other matters of civic interest may be brought before the board during our scheduled public comment period, which will begin tonight. After all, other businesses of the board's monthly meeting agenda has been concluded. No partisan political appeals or advertising of for- profit enterprises will be heard. Persons wishing to speak during the public comment period were asked to pre- register at this time. I will ask the board secretary well. First of all, I'll ask the board secretary to call the roll and given the clunkiness of the online platforms, we're not doing a verbal. We have a record of everybody who signed on and as we've done in our other remote meetings. We'll do these we'll take attendance that way, but it does mean that all board members have to be pay close attention to the minutes when they're submitted in the following months and make sure that we got you okay, then we do and we do have a quorum. We great thank you sean then we'll proceed to approval of the June minutes. I believe the minutes were emailed out to everyone so motion to approve Gail Smith. Thank you, Gail! Is there a second? Thank you. Okay, I'm not quite sure how we should do this, but let's try those in favor. You can raise your hand or say I Joanne Brown, I those opposed say no. Okay, hearing no vote. The minutes are approved so that moves us to the district manager's report. Thank you, Ed. I know that that we've been joined by Assembly member Bobby Carroll if I'd be happy to yield to the assembly member. If our host can unmute him, please that's Robert Carroll, that high Sean and to see all of you via zoom, hopefully in the not too distant future, but probably I guess distant future, we'll all be able to recongregate, but it's great to see folks coming back together and making sure that the necessary things to keep the quality of life in our neighborhoods going are happening. If there's anything going on at your children's school with our streets or anything else day to day in community Board 14, where I can be helpful because, of course, just because of Covid-19 has changed our lives, it does not mean that all the things that all of you and my office do on a regular basis, just stop and so any way that we can be helpful and assist in these very trying times. My office is always open, and so thank you and if a quick question I'd love to answer it, but I do not want to get in the middle of your meeting. Thank you Sean for allowing me to cut the line. Sean Michael. Can you hear me who is this is Michael Sedillo? Can you hear me? Yes, Michael. We can yes yeah hi. I just would like to ask the assembly member a quick question. Some member carol, thank you for calling wondering if you have a public stance on long- term borrowing credit questions. I do. I think that we should do some short- term borrowing to help cover the city and state's expenses between now and January February of next year. I think the state and the city are going to have to raise some taxes, make some cuts and borrow some money, and then we can reassess depending on who is the president and who runs the House and Senate about whether we will get federal aid and whether we can change course after that fact, but I think the next six months are going to be very trying and it becomes impossible to make our city and state run. I think if we do not do all three, so I think there are some smart tax increases, some smart belt tightening and some smart borrowing that we can do over the next six months, but specifically long- term borrowing for operating expenses. I'm not sure I was clear on that yeah! No, so I mean- and we can talk, I'd love to talk to you Offline, but I think there is real borrowing that we can do for operating expenses. That will get us into basically the end of this fiscal year which ends on March 31st, and I think that can be prudent if it's done in concert with certain tech, with certain cuts and with certain tax increases, I think all of it should be should not go through, should basically go through this fiscal year, because I do hope that we will have a different president and Congress, which may mean we could see real federal assistance, but we're obviously not going to see assistance from this administration or Congress, and we will still be stuck with them, no matter what until basically February 1.. Thank you thank you Assemblyman Carol. So at this point, I'm just going to ask that all my microphones should be silenced or muted, except for the person or persons who are speaking we're hearing a lot of background noise and interference and it's creating a problem we're not able to hear each other. So the chairs Repo, well the district manager's report and then we'll move on yeah, I'm going to procrastinate even longer, because I see that inspector wall is also here and I think that he has something he has to go off to. So. If you would like Ed to allow the inspector to speak, I'm willing to be patient by all means about the music go ahead. Oh goodbye, all right! Good evening, everybody! I just wanted to say good evening and happy Rosh, Hashanah and Yonko core with the major holidays coming up just Wanna bring some things to everyone's attention. We had all of our NCO meetings held in August, those were in person. Those are due to a little bit of this small attendance. That's at the NCO meetings. The new quarter started so we'll be looking at having more meetings throughout the end of the year. One of the things that just ended today really only affects the building owners, not every building owner, but our trespass at the David program has officially ended today. That was a partnership between the building owners and the police department, where the police could come in and show you privately old building. If you felt that there was a criminal issue going on, that program is officially ended. Today we had about 11 buildings still in on that program, and that was from my high of possibly 100 throughout the precinct. So, unfortunately for those 11 buildings and those building owners on our program is ended. Today, our community council meetings will start back up in September, we'll be doing it via via zoom. Obviously, Community Board is doing such a great job. With these meetings we have to piggyback on that, so we'll be conducting our meetings I'll be zoom with Ed's help, starting on September 30th and now we'll try to get that information out to everyone. I know everyone's worried about a lot of the issues of crime and violence. We're working with our partners in community affairs. Our partners in the community itself stop the violence organizations to really sort of put a dent on all this violence and it's something we're going to continue on throughout the end of the year, something that we're going to need help with. This is really a total community issue, but I think we can definitely do it with everyone's help. So those are really some of the things that I really want to get acrosss and again we're going to be getting back into all our meetings. So if anyone has any issues they want to contact. Obviously your community affairs, honestly, you have our regular community council meetings and every quarter we have our four NCO meetings for every sector in the quarter. So there's a lot of different ways to get in touch with us. So again, any issues you have please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you inspector. Just to reiterate what the inspector was saying. The 70th Precinct Community Council will meet on the 30th. The meeting time is 7:30 and you can you can you'll be able to get the link via Community Board, 14. Sean Okey Doke. Thank you inspector. Okay, now, without any further ado, I guess I'll do a district manager's report a couple of things to follow up on from the executive committee meeting last week. Our staffing issue is such that we still do not know. I still have not been told if I can bring on a temp and I'm working on that, but in really good news I was told that they would approve a personal action to bring anya on to five full days a week and after the day she had coming back today. I hope she does not regret agreeing to do that, because I'm going to hurry up and get that paperwork in, and I will keep the board I'm also going to, and I and our bylaws are clear on the responsibility I have for staffing the office and I can hire and increase pay, but I did not want to do. I just wanted to add an extra layer of accountability and transparency to that. So I reported it out to the executive committee. I want to report out to the board that I'm going to execute the personnel action to bring on you on five full days a week. I know that will be approved by OMB and I'm going to request a small percentage increase in the in the hourly in the pay, and I do not know if that will be approved, but I just wanted to put it on record that I'm going to make the recall some of you most of you know. I think I reported this out. I think I'm losing track, but most of you know that there was a request by OMB that we participate in a voluntary layoff program, but we demured. We are not participating in that and in fact we need to actually increase staffing to meet the the demands of the office. So that's the staff update the office update is that there will be a person in the office either anya or myself on tuesdays for sure and then either wednesdays or thursdays. So we are still not going to open the doors to members of the public, so we'll still be doing district service delivery remotely but being in the office a couple days a week allows us to do old- fashioned things like get mail and and faxes, and just will help us sort of keep sort of reorganizing organizations as the meeting schedule picks up and boy as it's about to pick up. I was on budget consultations. Today we had six of them six yeah six agencies from nine to five. They went very well, but it was sobering, not that I did not already know, but it's still sobering to hear directly from human Resource. Administration and Department of Homeless services were the two I led this morning and the needs of the city are great and the and the revenue and funding to meet those needs. Not so much so there's going. Hopefully, there'll be action at the state and federal level to offset the the budget shortfall. Some of Hra is held harmless because the funding comes from federal formula, but Dhs's budget is a lot more DHS and Department of Health and mental hygiene are two budgets that are city levy driven and there's going to be some difficulties meeting those needs. So if so, you know working with your local elected officials who are state representatives- and I know Michael's question to Assembly member Carol- was right along these lines to get the state to make sure that those that assistance is granted and we'll continue to work with agencies as budgets are impacted, but a lot of the complaints that we're getting it. You know, there's an uptick in things like quality, a lot of quality of life, complaints and sanitation, certainly, and so a lot of the sanitation service that is not happening is due to those cuts. We were up to six days a week of basket collection, we're back down to three. We were we had manual litter, Patrol, Mlp and our superintendent was very creative about using that it's cut completely cut collection is still on three different times of the day. So we get a lot of calls about Miss collection when simply the truck just has not been there. Yet people are used to having their garbage collected before two o'clock in the afternoon and now it's on a 4- 12 truck. So I will you know we'll do our best to try to address concerns, and hopefully sometimes it's just. The trucks come in a little bit later, but I remind property owners all the time that you are responsible for the front of your home, the sidewalk in front of your home and 18 inches from the curb into the street, and it's all the more important that we step up to those responsibilities, and I know it's annoying when the city is not providing sort of some baseline service. And then somebody from the city comes at you and says now you have to do more, but we really do we, but I also want to thank sanitation for what they have been doing. That's been extra work with our myriad food pantries and with a few holiday food distributions coming up, they've really done a lot of extra curricular work. Getting those locations collected who D.O.T a lot of quality of life and noise complaints that we've been working with pd on and then one other thing is the street activity permits are still for the most part not being approved so block parties are street festivals, things that we really look forward to gathering at there's a moratorium on them still and yet NYPD has had some events in the district. It did not come through the the precinct, but I did raise my concern to the to the police commissioner and to local elected officials that it feels like, and it looks like a bit of a double standard when I have to tell the residents and the good citizens of community district 14 that they can't have an event and then they go around the corner and there's an event, and so I'm working with SAPO and the electeds. And again I did express my concerns to to the commissioner and they're members on our board, who do really great work at some of our local community base organizations. And I've spoken to a few of you. So you know it's just a concern that if a board member is holding that does not have a permit, I do not have to tell other people yourself, Joe dweck. Thank you. So, let's just all make sure that there's not a double standard and we're all we're all following the same rules, and if we need to work to change those rules, I am so on board, but as the rules stand now, there's still no, there are very few permitted street activities except for food distribution. First, amendment rights and and there'll be some religious on the street religious activities in order to ensure social distancing other things. I know this is getting along I'll talk, really fast things that are still on the to- do list. I'm working on the district needs statement, there's still more budget consultations, we'll be applying for a planning. Fellow when that opens back up working with a group of colleagues on a report on the future of community boards will work on our budget. We talked a little bit about the Youth Council. It's something this board still is interested in doing, and I know I have it to do something on my to- do list to get back to the board on that, and then I have not followed up with the borough hall on the their proposal regarding commanding officers, so I will do that tomorrow because I forgot to do it up until now, but we're trying to hang in there and think- and I appreciate your patience- that that's it I'll stop there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Chad well done well done, but there was more the news report. Well. First of all, I have to ask for a vote vote to approve the recommendations from the public hearing on budget recommendation. So is there? Is there a motion to approve motion to approve motion secondary Second? I heard a car horn. I wonder properly moved and seconded to approve the recommendations from the public hearing on budget recommendations all in favor. We have to go through this again. I apologize all in favor, say aye. I sorry Gail Smith Eye Deborah Valentine, Eye, okay, are there? Are there any no votes on this? Any no vote is there. Anyone who wishes to abstain is there anyone who would like to declare himself or herself ineligible to vote for reason of conflict of interest. The that motion carries for the chest. Joe dweck, a lot of people need to mute their microphone. Absolutely. Thank you. Joe. Please mute your microphone if you're, not speaking, and no one should be speaking at this point except the chair. Thank you on Wednesday September, 9th, an executive committee meeting was convened and the only real item action was a suggestion that the board reviewed the bylaws. However, the executive committee meeting began with the introduction of two new board members who were appointed by the President Eric Adams. They are Zakiyah Khan and Michelle. Bronson Welcome aboard the orientation shared some of the board's resources to assist active members, including the bylaws for the Community Board 14.. The board was reminded to be familiar with the membership section of the bylaws and note that board members are expected to be at all monthly meetings and that all board members serve as private citizens, not as representatives for group or organization. In addition, board members can not represent the board at public meetings or events, unless requested to do so by the chair. Everyone should be Respec should have received a committee preference form via email today, and committee assignments will be finalized before the October board meeting. If you did not receive your committee preference form, please notify the board office, call the board office information to that and include your mailing address. We also discussed upcoming land use items. Community board 14 most frequently holds public hearings for special permit applications with the board of Standards and appeals in the special permit district in the southeast portion of the community district. These are usually for single- family homes that we vet to make sure they comport with precedent in terms of size and open space in the neighborhood. This process helps assure a neighbor's concerns are addressed. However. In October we will hear two less typical applications. One is for a homeless shelter planned at 21 douriet place and the other is for 1620 cortelli road. There was a brief discussion regarding the Youth Council. We spoke over the summer and there was broad support for forming a community board 14 Youth Council and there is still General board support for moving forward with that includes the chairs report and moves us to sorry about that moves us to topical committee reports. Are there any other elected officials who have joined us? I do not see any ed, we do have some representatives and they will speak during the public session and when we'll go through that list, when we get there after the committee reports. Thank you, Sean Ed, I'm sorry to jump. In again there are shaheed Khan, Donald, Loggins and Hindi Bendel all have their hands raised. That may have been a matter of voting or they might have questions that was a matter of voting. Sorry, okay, that's okay! Take your hands down! If you were just raising them to vote and do not have a question Donald loggins. Do you have a question? Do you have a question? No, okay! You can un- raise your hand, okay, all right, thanks, billy richlane. Do you have a question? I do. That was not a voting thing. I was just curious. What what the NYPD events that you mentioned were because I had not seen those around and I'm just curious. There was a flag day for Pakistan independence, Day on Coney, Island Avenue. I can't remember the date, but it was probably August 14th ish. There was also a basketball, a community basketball game at the parade grounds of the parade ground. I caught myself alvin because I know that's a pet peeve. The parade ground like the weekend before labor day that was organized by the chief of community affairs right in front of a bunch of people had been complaining about noise all summer long. So those were those were the two that I objected to and then I think there was there was maybe some participation in a school supply Giveaway and I'm not sure that happened because I raised concerns about that too. Why billy you feel, like you, missed out on the fun yeah? I love flag day. Events thanks, okay, I think I think that's it with questions the other hands, I think, were votes, go ahead, Alvin, I'm sorry Mr Chair, Jonathan Judge. I just have a point of order. Okay on the agenda, it mentioned the report of the committee of the whole and technically the action we took during the committee. The whole has to be ratified now that we're in a proper regular meeting of our session. So I do not think I missed anything. I do not think I had an internet outage. I just wanted to make sure that we at least formally ratify the action taken at the committee. The whole meeting, thank you Jonathan, and I I assume that you're talking are you talking about the entire. I mean everything that took force took place at that executive committee meeting or is there anything specifically? So it would just be that this the recommendation that we approved as a committee of the whole, we would just need to ratify the same thing that was already approved by the Committee of the whole in this board meeting Jonathan, since you made the motion upon which the committee of the whole acted. Would you for the benefit of those who did not attend? Could you reiterate it because you had the language down? Pat okay, let me go and find because I know I had written. I do not think it has to be verbatim- and I think there's enough of us here who, if you do misspeak, we can jump in if you want to just go from memory so yeah. So this is so. This would just be a matter of ratifying saying that we as a full board, continued to agree with what we voted on at that committee of the whole meeting, which consisted of that. We would let the borough president know to be able to communicate on our behalf that we endorse the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to the police precinct commanding officer position and to continue that conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping the process to a fully detailed proposal. So that's what we had voted on back in the committee, the whole: that's what was approved by the Committee of the whole- and this is just a matter of us formally ratifying that decision, which we took action on by writing. That letter. Thank you John and Mr chairman. I just recommend: maybe we could just do a unanimous consent to ratify just to streamline things if there are no emotions of that. Thank you that that's just what I had in mind. So, first of all, is there any discussion regarding that? Okay, hearing none and seeing no hands raised, I'm just going to ask: if there is any objection or is there you know, would anyone like to register a no vote on that any no votes? Joe dweck? I have a no vote. Okay, that's one glenn Walden! I have a no vote. Two. So far do Jonathan. Can I rely on your and your parliamentary expertise. This is not a vote to say whether or not you liked the action. It's a vote as to whether or not the it's ratifying that the action took place. The effect of it is that, though, I think we had a majority of the board present for that committee of the whole. If I remember correctly or was a substantial number, the point of ratification is that the committee of the whole technically could have been less than Quorum in a typical situation, and so since action would be taken and things would move forward based on what was voted on at that committee of the whole meeting that just like any other committee before the board would formally adopt, it would have to be adopted by the full membership at a proper regular meeting in session. So this is just essentially saying this is an opportunity that it could be discussed whether it should be ratified or not, but but so that is a possibility with this particular motion to ratify. But with that said, this is basically just saying that, yes, we continue to concur with what the committee of the whole agreed to when that vote was taken, so it can be, it can be opened up for further discussion and reconsidered it wholesale, but you know that's just up to how everybody feels it's really just saying. Do we ratify what was done back then, as long as we still agree with it? Based on what the committee of the whole did: Joe dweck, Mr Chairman, yes Joe, I thought Nc as committee the whole regarding this item that we had said that we wanted more guidance from the borough president's office on it is. Am I incorrect, as I recall, Joe, you are correct. I recall that as well or the purpose of that letter was not to do further discussion. It was to ask for further elucidation from the borough president's office right, Mr Chair, just so, if I may just to clarify, if that's all right, the letter that was written as a result of the committee of the whole. That's all we're ratifying is that letter is still that action taken to write the letter that that's still okay, with the board that we're formally ratifying the letter that you wrote that you already sent it's more of a technicality, though it could be reviewed wholesale, but it is more about the fact that do we still agree that the letter you sent is still reflective of the will of the board and that's the grand total of it. This is not anything more than what was already done during the committee of the whole. Thank you, John Salstein, just correct me. If I'm wrong that letter of Sean, I believe she sent it out and gave everyone an opportunity to comment on that letter before sending it out absolutely correct. Okay, so is it there? You know so far. We had two no votes. Is there anyone who would like to change their vote? A no vote to a yes vote or a yes vote to a no vote I mean in since that there's been a bit more clarification regarding what we're voting for or against. Okay, then hearing none again. That motion carries so we move on now to topical committee reports, starting with human services hi good evening. Everyone welcome back to the new normal of our virtual board meetings. I hope everyone had a good summer and found some rest. There is no. I have no report for a committee meeting, but I just have a quick update on what's going on in the district. With regards to our sense of census response today is we have 16 days left into the end of the survey and as of today, which is the 14th, the U.S response, so you have something to base on Kings. County's response is 65.8 percent kings, counties response or Brooklyn's response is 56.5 percent. All of these numbers in include the narfu or the non- response. Follow- up. We have some tracks that are responding really well as previously spoken to about the Woodruff crook area over just west of Ocean Avenue they're at one point: six percent tempo yeah compared to last ten years ago, where 63, so they are like really doing great job, also south of church Avenue, Ninth, East, 19Th, Street to Buckingham they're, also at 70.6 percent and compared to 10 years ago they were at 63.8 percent. We do have an area that is in trouble. This is track 794. This is Flatbush avenue to Bedford Avenue, going to the East Church Avenue to Beverly going to the south. They are still only at 48.8 percent and in 2010 they were at least at 50 percent. So if you have any connection to people that live in that area, it's an immigrant area, we need trusted messengers just to go out. We have 16 days to do this. Let's try to at least get that area up at 50. We want to make sure that demographic is represented, so the next time I see you, the census will be over we'll have a lot of people to thank in the district for the work that they did to get us to this point, and it's not over 16 days. We can get a lot done nice to see you all thanks! Thank you, Joanne Youth services. This is Dwayne Jonathan you still there. Yes, yeah yep, I'm here sorry, I just wait for a Sec, no problem, nothing to report. On our end, there was some discussion over the summer about the Youth Council, and I have to apologize to my co- chair and to the district manager. There was supposed to be some follow- up on my end. Unfortunately, the summer got in the way, work and a few other things, but we have reached out to a few local organizations to help us with the planning and organizing of the Youth Council. It was my task to follow up with those organizations, see you and put together a meeting, and I apologize to the board for not doing that, but I will make sure I get on that so that we have something to report on in October. I also like to you know quickly. That was me with the group just now, because I live on Woodruff Avenue and I'm very proud of the fact that you know not only what your favorite about community or 14 is pretty blue on the census hard to count map. It's amazing. I do not know if you have anything else to add Jonathan, I'm sorry I just kind of jumped in there. No, I nothing else to add, except that we're looking forward to continue finding innovative ways to serve young people and make sure that they get the resources and opportunities they need in the middle of a pandemic which, hopefully will be concluded sooner than we think. So, that's all I got to say looking forward to getting back into the swing of things with everybody. I will add one thing for those of you that are on Facebook and Jonathan. You may have seen this I've kind of tried to kept our youth council page active with information from the Department of Youth services right now, they're running a series with young people to get their voices out and to be heard and listened to. I would encourage all of you to you know, join those meetings. If you can, if you have any young people in your life that could benefit from hearing from other young people about what they feel and think about. What's going on and how they're looking to engage more in our communities, please encourage them to participate. You can find the information either on the DYCD site directly. I have been posting it on the Youth Council facebook site for people to be able to access okay. Thank you guys public safety, either of the public safety co- chairs with us tonight, Alex. Can you unmute Brian Cunningham he's on the attendees list good evening good evening? Everyone nothing to report this month, looking forward to hopefully having a meeting next month in water report. Welcome back from the summer. Thank you, Brian community environment, as far as I know, there's nothing to report, but I'm hoping that we will get active with the park and the other program that we spoke about at our last meeting regarding cleanup and getting people involved in that excellent. Thank you. Nina education, libraries and community affairs and cultural affairs. Pardon me. Let me repeat that education, libraries and cultural affairs Carl can you unmute yourself. I see. Oh there he is hi, Carl yep, hey! What's up folks, so you guys can hear me right. Yes, excellent, awesome, cool! So, on behalf of myself and Steve, you know it's good to be back and we hope that everyone remained safe and sound and you were able to enjoy the summer in some form or another. So basically, the update is just that there is a joint committee meeting with transportation for next Wednesday, starting at 6:30 it's going to be online and for the education, libraries and cultural affairs, the two items on the agenda for our side. It's an update on school projects and reopening updates with a representative from school construction authority and then the other part is a committee discussion on a proposal to permit street use by schools for outdoor distancing, and so that's the update from the education, libraries and cultural Affairs committee thanks so much Carl transportation, hi everybody Joel here, as call just announced we're going to have a joint meeting next week. So that's the report, I'm going to add to Joel's report because one of the one of the items on the agenda for the transportation committee meeting that night is a planned bike lane on Parkside Avenue- and I know our board gets excited, sometimes in one way and sometimes in another, about bike lanes. So that's the specifically transportation for that meeting. Okay. That concludes the topical committee reports and moves us now to the public session Sean. I think you mentioned that there were several yeah I'll name, the first three to help our host make sure they get unmuted on time and to move us along, hopefully, but Lisa Derek from the Office of Assembly member be shot. I think Lisa is still with us. I wanted to make an announcement and then, after Lisa will be Abigail banks from New York City, Emergency management, David Nussbaum from DOB and nancy lulu from the Da's office, starting with Lisa Derrick hi there good evening. Everyone can you hear me? Yes, okay, hi everyone good to see all your faces. I hope that you really enjoyed the summer got out and enjoyed the beautiful summer that we have. I just wanted to make one brief announcement. Many of you may have heard already, because we have shared this through the assembly. Member bishop has shared this through her communications, but this is regarding the Ps 152 ps, 315 playground that we were able to get open on labor day to allow families and children in the community to go out and enjoy the Good Outdoors before school starts and before the winter arrives. It's a beautiful playground. It was very well put together with ideas, design, ideas from the students themselves, contributions from members in the community, families in the community and trust with public land who spearheaded the project and, of course, Susanna Lascaris, who was very integral in getting the the garden community garden, which is also part of this community playground. If you have not had an opportunity yet to go and see it, I urge all of you to go and just take a look walk around. It has a track. It has so many different areas for children to explore seating areas for adults to sit in shaded areas while their children play so please do take full advantage of it before the summer is over the school. The playground is to be used by the students during school session when school is and that's from 8 A.M. It opens 8 A.M and it closes at dusk every day. So when school is over, it's open to the community on the weekends it's open to the community same hours every day, eight A.M to dusk, but please do get out and enjoy it. That is all that I wanted to report again happy to see you all and I hope you enjoy the rest of your week. I thank you. Thank you so much and the next speaker is my colleague and I'll- just kind of leave it at that, because I do not want to mix apples with oranges here. But Abigail banks is with the Office of New York City Emergency management. Abby. Could you unmute Abigail banks? I can not locate her unless she is calling in okay, yeah Ed. I think yeah.

That wic is very important for all pregnant women, breastfeeding women and infants and children and mothers, babies who are born to mothers who were on week. Those babies are less likely to experience cognitive and developmental delays, so it's very important to continue referring the children and friends and pregnant women to wake. Thank you so much.

We are part of Parkway Tenants Association, I'm trying to get more information on the ongoing investigations of the gun, violence that occurred along Ocean Avenue the week of like August 14th through the 19th. I apologize. If this is not the right form to pose this question, it's not a terrible form to pose the question in, but it would be a matter of service delivery, and for that you would work directly with me and the staff during business hours. I'd be happy to facilitate that communication with the 7- 0 police precinct, and I would encourage you to take part in their build- a- block and and Community Council meetings, so circle back to me tomorrow during business hours and we'll proceed accordingly. Sure I would love to the only reason why I'm here is because I went to the build block, build the block meeting and they did not discuss the investigations. It was very disconcerting.
