If you want to just and open the meeting by the public hearing by announcing I'm sorry, can you just email me the script?
The purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony with respect to Community Board 14's recommendations for the city's fiscal, year.
Right, so board members who had to wait for the public hearing to start just thinking now.
You just pretend that you're hearing a gavel and this meeting of community Board 14 is called to order on September 14th at 6:54 p.m. Under, the applicable statutes of New York state, the charter of New York City, awards, bylaws and Robert's.
Consequently, except by board members, there will be no public discussion at our regular monthly meetings of matters about which a public hearing or committee meeting has been held.
Specific service delivery requires or complaints should be brought to you with the district offices by calling the board office during regular business hours or by visiting our website.
If, there's anything going on at your children's school with our streets or anything else day to day in community Board 14, where I can be helpful.
Do a district manager's report a couple of things to follow up on from the executive committee meeting last week.
I want to report out to the board that I'm going to execute the personnel action to bring on you on five full days.
We are still not going to open the doors to members of the public, so we'll still be doing district service delivery remotely but being in the office.
Some of Hra is held harmless because the funding comes from federal formula, but Dhs's budget is a lot more DHS and Department of Health and mental hygiene are two budgets that are city levy, driven If so, you know working with your local elected officials who are state representatives, And I, know Michael's question to Assembly member Carol- was right along these lines to get the state to make sure That those that assistance is granted and we'll continue to work with agencies, as budgets are impacted, but a lot of the complaints that we're getting it.
Getting those locations collected who D.O.T a lot of quality of life and noise, complaints that we've been working with pd on and then one other thing is the street activity permits are still for the most part not being approved so block parties are street festivals, Things that we really look forward to gathering at there's a moratorium on them still and Yet NYPD has had some events in the district.
It did not come through the the precinct, but I did raise my concern to the to the police, commissioner, and to local elected officials that it feels like, and it looks like a bit of a double standard when I have to tell the residents and the good citizens of community district 14 that they can't have an event And, there's an event, And, so I'm working with SAPO and the electeds.
Thank you on Wednesday September, 9th, an executive committee meeting was convened and the only real item action was a suggestion that the board reviewed the bylaws.
The executive committee meeting began with the introduction of two new board members who were appointed by the President Eric Adams.
We spoke over the summer and there was broad support for forming a community board 14 Youth Council, and there is still General board support for moving forward with that includes the chairs report and moves us to sorry about that.
The parade ground like the weekend before labor day that was organized by the chief of community affairs right in front of a bunch of people, had been complaining about noise all summer long.
This would just be a matter of ratifying saying that we as a full board, continued to agree with what we voted on at that committee of the whole meeting, which consisted of that.
The point of ratification is that the committee of the whole technically could have been less than Quorum in a typical situation, and so since action would be taken and things would move forward based on what was voted on at that committee of the whole meeting that just like any other committee before the board would formally adopt, it would have to be adopted by the full membership at a proper regular meeting in session.
I have no report for a committee meeting, but I just have a quick update on what's going on in the district.
It was my task to follow up with those organizations, see you and put together a meeting, and I apologize to the board for not doing that, but I will make sure I get on that, so that we have something to report on in October.
The update is just that there is a joint committee meeting with transportation for next Wednesday, starting at 6:30 It's going to be online and for the education, libraries and cultural affairs.
Thanks So much Carl transportation, hi That's the report, I'm going to add to Joel's report because one of the one of the items on the agenda for the transportation committee meeting that night is a planned bike lane on Parkside, Avenue, And I know our board gets excited, sometimes in one way, and sometimes in another, about bike lanes.
If I'm the correct meeting This is my first ever Community Board.
