Festivals, It didn't come through the the precinct, but I did raise my concern to the to the police, commissioner, and to local elected officials that it feels like, and it looks like a bit of a double standard when I have to tell the residents and the good citizens of community district 14 that they can't have an event And, so I'm working with SAPO and the electeds.

It would just be that this, the recommendation that we approved as a committee of the whole, we would just need to ratify the same thing that was already approved by the committee of the whole in this board meeting jonathan.
This would just be a matter of ratifying saying that we as a full board, continued to agree with what we voted on at that committee of the whole meeting, which consisted of that.
We, would let the borough president know to be able to communicate on our behalf that we endorse the general concept of involving community stakeholders in a review of candidates being considered for appointment to the police precinct commanding officer position and to continue that conversation with interested community boards and stakeholders in shaping the process to a fully detailed proposal.
The point of ratification is that the committee of the whole technically could have been less than quorum in a typical situation, and so since action would be taken and things would move forward based on what was voted on at that committee of the whole meeting that just like any other committee before the board would formally adopt, it would have to be adopted by the full membership at a proper regular meeting in session.

Unfortunately, the summer got in the way, work and a few other things, but we have reached out to a few local organizations to help us with the planning and organizing of the youth council.- It was my task to follow up with those organizations, see you and put together a meeting, and I apologize to the board for not doing that, but I will make sure I get on that, so that we have something to report on in October.
If I'm the correct meeting This is my first ever community board.
