Pursuant to the sections 621 and 73- 622 of the zoning resolution of the city of New York, as amended to request two special permits to enlarge an existing single- family residence, one for the portion located in a residential R2 zoning district and one for the portion located in a residential, R3- 2 zoning district.
Please understand they are looking for a special permit for a home enlargement for their home at 2328, Olean, Street, What I'm going to do here Is I'm going to hold this up for you, and what you're going to see is a very unusual lot and one portion of it, which is a long olean street, is in an R2 zoning district.
We can only request a 10 enlargement floor, area, a 10 increase on the lot coverage and a 10 decrease in the amount of open, space.
Although the base floor area is also 0.5 in that district, what we're able to do is we're able to add 20 under a sloping roof between 5 and 8 feet in height, which brings us to a total permitted.
We are requesting a total of 0.63 in this district and once again we're impacting the open space and the lot coverage because, as the building gets bigger.
There's two sets of waivers we're requesting a special permit under 73,621 for the R2 and 73,622 for the R2, because in the 73,622 special permit, which is what you typically see in your board, is only permitted in the R2 zoning district, because the lot is split.
