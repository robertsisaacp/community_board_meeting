A bunch of people had to download webex in order to get on. So that's what this seems like the delay is so Anya. If you wanted to I, guess start recording, I'm just going to start the meeting with an update from the complete count. Committee. Great, we are live and I have the Moya fellow as well. She called in so I'll be moving people over to panelists, so you can see them as we go so go ahead. We're live okay, hi. Everyone welcome to the community board. 14 Human Services committee today is November 19th and we are getting started with this meeting at 6:35. I want to remind everyone that this meeting is being live, streamed to YouTube and will be recorded in perpetuity, so keep it clean I want to just mention the co-chair here. Bazaruhi is here. You can say, hi give a wave. We have two agenda items, hi everyone hi. How are you thank you, I want to remind everyone to mute their phones until we get to a point where you can chime in you can, if you're, a colon user, please use star six to mute yourself or star six to unmute yourself, and if you are an attendee and don't have the ability to unmute yourself just raise your hand and Anya will get you all set up so that you can participate in the meeting. Okay great. So we have two agenda items tonight we have some people on the call that have have to be other places, so I think we're going to move the agenda items around a little bit. We're going to talk about the Kingsbrook Jewish medical center, closure of acute care beds first and then we'll move on to the presentation from the mayor's office of Immigrant affairs. This committee encapsulates both also the community board 14 census, 2020 Complete Count Committee task force, so I just wanted to start since I. Am the ad hoc chair of that committee I wanted to talk to you about how we left everything with the committee in the middle of October and where we are so just a moment about that so kings county? The final enumeration with the Norfolk Count was 59 in comparison to 2010, where Kings County's count was 57.2, so we came up in the middle of a pandemic by 1.8, I'm going to say that's pretty good, not great for Brooklyn, but at least all of the effort that we put in, we were able to at least manage an increase from 2010. There was some news today about the data that the census collected. So I'm just going to read this. The Census Bureau officially has concluded that they can not produce. The state population totals required to reallocate seats to the House of representatives until after inauguration day. They say that this is because of data processing anomalies, so it looks like the incoming administration might be analyzing the recommendations for the reallocation of seats to the House of Representatives. There's been some talk about redoing, the entire census. You know there are some articles, there's one article out by NPR that goes into detail about the challenges of doing that. There is a possibility by federal law that they can do a mid-century census that would be in 2025, but they can not reapportion the house of Rep Representative seats for that purpose. So we'll keep that in mind. There are I. This committee will stay active at least until the data is delivered. There are a million people to thank and I, don't want to miss anyone, but I'm just going to name off a couple of names: the people that fully supported this committee of Course Shelley Worrell, who was our federal, the Census, Bureau Federal connection. She was the caribbean representative and she came and she did all of the in-servicing for us and supported us for all of our non-profit roundtables. So we thank her, of course, the Human Services Committee, where this was encapsulated into. We thank all of those members all of our district Cbo's, which are participated in our non-profit roundtable, including Canba Copo Kojo. They also did a tremendous job in bringing in getting out the getting at the census and if you look at our district, which basically is goes down the center of Brooklyn, it's all blue. So that's pretty great, of course, Kathleen Daniels from the New York City Census, Amy Michael's from the Brooklyn public library. No, if I'm forgetting you, I'm sorry, of course, the board office and district manager Sean Campbell. We still have work to do, but this is just the beginning of the thanks letter. Okay, so let me I just want to see who we have on the call. We have a couple of representatives from New York docs. We have a few representatives who are employees or contract employees from Kingsborough jewish Medical center I see that Eden Dillard is on the call from she's communications from Kingsborough. Medical center I see Alicia Goodrich. So what I'd like to do is open up this part of the agenda item. We have a lot to talk about so I, don't want. You know I, don't want the individual presentations to go too far, so we're going to kind of if you're from the public or from an organization- and you have something to add we're going to keep it at like three minutes like we do with the public comment period, so I'll open it up and then I'm going to bring it to the New York docs and then bring it back around to some of the other participants that are here so for the purposes of this meeting, full disclosure I am staff at Kingsborough, Jewish Medical center I am a registered dietitian at on the acute care side and the hospital side. So if I were to offer any opinion about the closure of acute care beds, that is my opinion. That is not the opinion of the community board 14 or of this committee. So I just wanted to put that out there all the facts that I have are basically facts that are readily available, so I just wanted to open up the conversation about the closure of the acute care beds by talking about who kingsborough well. First of all, let's talk about a little bit of history in Brooklyn and the availability of hospital beds, and we have some of the members of New York docs on the line, and they can get a little bit more into the public health aspect of this. But since 2003 four acute care hospitals have closed in Brooklyn, so we have Caledonian Victory, Memorial, Saint, Mary's and Lich Long Island College hospital since 2003. So that's a tremendous amount of beds that will serve the community of Brooklyn and then in retrospect, looking at the current situation of Covid-19. those beds were attritions because at times they were left empty and most certainly in this period of a pandemic, they would not be empty in comparison to Manhattan has six beds per 1000 residents. Brooklyn has just shy of two somewhere between 1.8 and 2.2 beds per 1000 residents, and it's always been a concern of community boards and the like that. Perhaps Brooklyn is underserved for their acute care needs. So to talk a little bit about Kingsbrook I feel like I am well served to talk about that. Mostly we serve older adults. They are West. Indian and caribbean descent for the most part, many are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. They have multiple comorbidities, they have diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and, as we know that they were very, these populations were very hard hit during the pandemic. So what was the pos? What was how did king's brook contribute during the pandemic, so I will say that at the height of the pandemic we had 200 acute care beds, working serving brooklynites serving patients who had Covid-19. We normally have about 163 beds for medical and surgical purposes. Those were expanded to an additional 41 during the pandemic by co-opting the physical and medical rehabilitation floor. Those residents were converted to medical duties, and so we were able to accommodate an additional 41 sick people for about a total of 200 beds that were working actively, so those are 200 beds that did not have to rely on kings, county or downstate, who were overwhelmed in and of them in and of themselves. So you can understand how the staff from boots on the grounds feels like the closure of these beds during the pandemic is poorly timed and the people that are supporting the delay of the closure are asking that we wait until we. There is a state of more stable public health before the final decisions are made and from what it seems. You know we are definitely reaching second surge, whether or not it is as costly to human life in terms of death remains to be seen, but we certainly do need every single resource that we have in Brooklyn to care for central brooklynites and all of those that are very vulnerable and at risk. So that's where I am opening up. It's a discussion, I'd like to invite Jenny or Lee or Betty, who are from New York docs to basically join us for the discussion about why this is a public health emergency. Essentially, so whoever would like to start I welcome you to join in I can start, but Lee Betty feel free to jump in at any point and elaborate on what I'm going to talk about. Basically, I want to start with the fact that I was working in Manhattan as a resident at the height of Covid-19 in spring, so I was treating patients with coved 12 hours a day and I was also hearing all these stories from my fellow residents who were seeing how overwhelmed a lot of the hospitals in the outer boroughs, mainly in Queens, were- and we have to realize, I- think that when we're in the midst of a public health emergency, as we are right now- that a hospital contained an array of services not just limited to the beds, but also the staff, the bundle of medications, equipment and all of the invisible infrastructure that comes with the hospital that can not be easily replaced by something like an alternate care site. And we saw this play out in spring in that the alternate care sites really were under utilized because they didn't have the staff and because they just weren't equipped to handle the severe illnesses that patients hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease tend to experience. So when I as part of New York docs heard about the closure of Kingsbrook, no matter how you know way back when this was planned to happen. This is a terrible timing and it shouldn't be happening right now. That's a simple I think, a very indisputable fact- and there are you- know mountains of evidence that demonstrate that the long-term consequences of having a hospital close bear out as increased 30-day mortality, increased pressure in the surrounding hospitals right so just because there's the possibility of transferring patients or for patients to transfer care to other hospitals in the neighborhood does not mean that those hospitals aren't squeezed most of the time and I was just reading a paper that looks at over 3,000 incidences of hospital closure and the ramifications it had and the impact is clear that there is a decrease in the quality of care and an increase in the mortality rate of patients hospitalized. So I guess I'll stop there for now, but I'm happy to speak further on how important it is to keep Kingsborough open at this critical juncture. I can go next. I also took care of patients in the spring I volunteered up in Montefiore in the Bronx and I. Think one of the main things and I also I work in in Brooklyn and send I have patients of mine that are cared for at Kingsborough, and so one of the main, takeaways, I, think and I. Think. There's no reason to expect that this won't happen during a second wave, which is that hospitals will shut down to visitors and to family members, and so I think anyone that worked in the hospital during the first wave. One of the most lasting memories are how isolated and alone patients were when they were feeling really sick and the difficulty of both caring for patients and also being their connection to their families in their outside world. That really fell to the providers and the the general staff at hospitals, and so it's like doubly egregious to say we're going to close these beds in the middle of the rising second wave in New York City. But it also denies it denies the patients from the community a connection to caregivers from that same community and there's really there's no replacing feeling that kind of taken care of it's one of the things my patients from the east Flatbush community talk about when they talk about going to Kingsborough and it's one of the reasons why they request to go there, and so I just want emphasize that there is something that is lost among not just from all the logistical hurdles and the fact that you know tent hospitals are unable to care for really sick patients and have these long checklists of requirements before they're allowed to accept patients and are staffed by visiting. You know, visiting providers that have really no sense of what's going on and then I would also add that one last thing, which is that the you know the plan from one Brooklyn health to have the same number of beds that were at the maximum point during the spring wave available at Interfaith and Brookdale, which is what their current Covid-19 surge plan is. It doesn't really make a lot of sense because you know if there's if the emergency room is full at Kingsborough Jewish of patients in need. You know Covid-19 patients in need of care being able to adequately transfer them directly from the emergency room to Med. Surg Covid-19 beds at other facilities feels much easier said than done, and so it just feels like a recipe for a full emergency room and a bunch of shuttered beds. Upstairs that doesn't make sense. I just want to echo that the patient, the patients that we see they are repeat patients. They are people that are from the community that when they need help, they come back to the same hospital and so to Lee's point to be in a hospital in central Brooklyn that they know, and they know the nurses, and they know the staff would make a very big difference in their care if they were there during the second search Betty. If you wanted to add it's up to you. Thank you just briefly: I'm a primary care physician, I trained, I'm from Flatbush I trained, Sydney, downstate rotated at Kingsborough and I just wanted to add that in the spring, I was working at the city health department, focusing on this issue of maintaining and creating capacity to treat patients with carbon 19 and one of the central principles of responding to a disaster like this is that we need to ensure that all patients have access to the standard of care before we move on to rationing care, and so this plan that we're you know that we're going to be okay because we're going to have surge beds surge capacity. That is not the standard of care. So you know at this time when we're discussing how can we fight the disparities that we're seeing in and who gets Covid-19 and who dies from Covid-19 to turn around and deny people in east Flatbush the standard of care and to say you know, they're going to have these surge beds instead, they're going to jump right into rationing care when people elsewhere in New, York City have access to the standard of care. I think is really unethical, so I completely agree with everything that Joanne Jenny and Ben I just wanted to add. Thank you so much. Thank you. Betty. We have Julie Keith, also on the call she is a nurse on our ventilator unit. Julie. If you wanted to say a few words sure thanks. Can you hear me perfect? Okay, so thank you. All I just wanted to make sure people know and understood that during the last surge we were really at Kingsborough completely overwhelmed, and this is true at Kingsborough. This is true at all the area. Hospitals, it's a little bit. You know the tragedies happened, unnecessary tragedies happen because there were not enough beds. There was not enough resources. We did not have enough to offer people in the face of overwhelming need, and this has deeply affected everyone who tried to meet that need. If the plan for transforming kingsbrook goes forward as planned, we will not be open as a hospital for the second wave and we will not be able to admit Covid-19 patients. There will be fewer beds available to the community. The executives of one Brooklyn health are saying that, even though we're going to lose beds, there will be enough beds available, but I just want to make clear. We did not have enough beds last time. You know, then the numbers that people may be working off are incomplete. I. Think the public health community recognizes that the real lived experience of trying to care for people during the last wave was that there was not enough. There was not enough beds, there was not enough anything, and so when the executives say they'll be enough, will be less that doesn't hold up. We please consider supporting a hold on this plan so that we can at least maintain the amount of beds we had before, which weren't even enough, because it just is setting us up for more tragedy to have less beds available to the community, because we did not have enough last time, regardless of what the numbers might say, the data is incomplete. The lived experience was that we need all the beds we have right now and more so I urge people to do what you can to put a hold on this plan right now. Thank you thanks. So much Julie and she really brings up a good point about. You know the staff at cancer medical center had this lived experience right so now we are better caregivers. We can meet the second third in a better way and to take that experience and to remove it from the equation is just unfathomable to the staff I see that we have Victor Jordan on the call Victor I just wanted to invite you to say a few words if you felt like you wanted to I and hi to the attendees. Now I'm from Committee Board 17 and we are closer to to king structure than in some respects and hey, I'm sorry, Victor we're losing you on the call yeah Joanna. If we wanted to wait a moment for Victor I, see that Glenn Woolen has a hand up. Oh okay, go ahead! Gwen! Thank you! My name is Glenn Mullen, I'm a cert team chief. That's a community emergency response team and I must say that I am very distressed about the loss of these beds. Not just excuse me for Covid-19, but over a long term, there's all sorts of disasters and emergencies that can happen in the city, and this is really a problem. The question I have is: does anyone know why or can speak to why this is happening at this time? I can give you some insight and I think there are others on the call that can also. There was a plan in which to- and this is happening all over New York City to convert beds that are historically are left unused in some respects. It's about I, don't know somewhere, 30 40 a hospital might have beds that are not used and then, in the same respects, what's called safety net hospitals which Kingsborough is which mainly accepts patients that have Medicare or Medicaid, and so in a matter to save those dollars and take the care outside of the hospital and put the care into a more ambulatory setting more outpatient. Setting many hospitals, including Mount cyanide, Beth Israel, are converting to this model, so Kingsbrook will be Kingsbrook once the acute care beds are closed. The space the hospital space will be converted to ambulatory care and outpatient care of, what's going to be known as a medical village, the other buildings which in which we're historically administrative, will be converted to affordable housing. We hope that it's going to be a 100, affordable housing. We don't quite have a schedule of what that what the numbers are going to look like for AMI percentage just yet there are some predictions, so I can't really speak to that. So vital Brooklyn, which is a 700 million dollar infusion of cash to central Brooklyn, to improve the health of central brooklynites, will be funding that grant money will be funding the conversion of Kingsbrook, so one Brooklyn health is a merger between interfaith medical, Center, kingsborough, Jewish, Medical, Center and Brookdale will remain the acute care center because it's a level one trauma center. So it has the most value, and this was in the original plan. Interfaith was to provide most of the psychiatric services and will continue to operate their acute care beds and then Kingsborough, which, in conjunction with the nursing home, would become this medical village where people would live on the campus and then receive services. So while that plan has a lot of value, what we're really talking about, though, is the value of that plan right now, and it just doesn't seem like we can get one Brooklyn health administration or the unions or the elected officials to understand that there is a level of flexibility and plasticity that has to exist in this time of the pandemic right. So while the plan is, it is what it is, the public health docs can talk about again and have talked about the long-term ramifications of closing any beds in central Brooklyn, because we've already lost four hospitals. The real concept is about. What's going on right now, so hopefully that answers your question and I see that we have two call-in users. I just want to make sure that some of the attending physicians that were invited to this meeting are not waiting on those calls. So if you're, if you are in attending or if you just want to, let us know who you are, you can star six to unmute yourself and say hi, let us know who you are and then you know star six to re-mute yourself, I unmuted call in user five. If you want to identify yourself, you're, unmuted, okay, so we have one unidentified color and Virginia better told on the line: okay, all righty, so I wanna! So far. Thank you! Everyone I see. We have two other people that may would like to take an opportunity to speak to the group here before we move on to our next agenda item. We have Alicia Goodrich, who is the representative from Diana Richardson's office, and we also have inner Dillon, who is the director of communications from Kingsborough Jewish Medical Center. So if either of you would like to speak to the committee, please do go ahead. Hi! Thank you! So much Joanne. This is Enid from Kingsbrook and thank you so much to the group. It's very important everything that you all are putting forth. I've worked for Kingsbook for 18 years. My mother worked there for 30. and I've worked there since I was 14 years. Old I do understand wholeheartedly the concerns and what a brilliant hospital kingsbook really is. I've dedicated most of my life to working there and I think that a lot of the concerns for the frontline staff, as you guys, are very critical and the first wave of Covid-19 at the height of pandemic in the spring, the three Obh Systems they had about 540,520 I think it was Covid-19 cases, a total of which 119 were in patients at Kingsborough. So at this point to ensure that Obh will have enough bed capacity for a second wave again, just reiterating that the system's plan is to have more than 540 beds available throughout the system and the planning and not to at all, divert from your concerns. They are critical concerns, but this just so. You know that the system is working collectively, because we are no longer a single entity as Kingsbrook. The ideology is that they will be working as sister organizations working with the quality teams, infectious control teams, medicine nursing. To make sure that this plan that has been put forth is not taken lightly. The administration has talked ad nauseam about this understanding that there is a severe concern and understanding too what the impact of the first wave had on staff. They understand very clearly. It was a quite traumatic experience, I mean not just to Kingsborough for many of the hospitals across the systems in New, York, City and nationally, but that the quality team, the medicine team infectious control, are all working very diligently on this and very considerately, taking all of your concern into consideration as they do this, as they monitor the Covid-19 intakes daily at the system level, and just so that you know when that first wave of Covid-19 happened. The transformation with for Kingsborough was to have already taken place. There was no way, however, with what we were seeing and what administration was seeing that they could have went through with. It was just such a devastating time that we had to push back on the transformation and we are hoping that we will not see the amount, the numbers in terms of surge, although we are seeing an uptick now, but just wanting to ensure you all, then that you are being heard that your concerns are being heard and that, in the midst of that, the teams at Kingsborough across the systems in quality, infectious control and medicine are working very diligently to consider all of those aspects across the board. So we thank you guys very much for your perspectives and your very critical comments, because they do make a huge difference. Thank you. So much Enid, thank you, for you know reassuring the group here that the administration of one Brooklyn health is working diligently to address our concerns and to you know, to basically be monitoring things on a daily basis and and I will absolutely support and say that when this transformation was supposed to have taken place on June 30th and was postponed because we had just come out of the first surge. So at that point one Brooklyn health administration was very flexible to make sure that the community needs were met at that at the tail end and during you know, the first search I just wanted to ask Ms Goodridge, who is the chief of staff for assembly member Diana Richardson if she had any words from the assembly member good evening. Everyone. Thank you Joanne, thank you to the committee members and all that that's already spoken, and I'm definitely taking this back to the member as well to have so much input as we keep going through this process of understanding. What changes will happen at the hospital and for Obh overall is very important to the member as well as the other electives, and everyone is paying attention everyone ears to the ground and we're making sure that Ob 18 Kingsborough, which is being held accountable for every step. There's an open line of communication I want to be sure you know just let everyone know that all community boards stakeholders we hear you, we understand what is going on and just like Enid said. We have to relate, allow the experts to pay attention and understand the severity of what is going on either end so I, just overall I just wanted to be sure that you knew that our office is listening and here and just trying to make sure that things are handled properly. Thank you so much Miss Goodrich, and we really the committee really appreciates hearing that the assembly member is open to our our feedback and comments and concerns. We have maybe about five minutes for the committee to ask questions and then we need to move on to our second agenda item. So if you have any brief comments or questions for any of the people that were that spoke here today, please let me know: Dillard has her hand raised. Oh yeah, of course, that was before I'm sorry. Okay, anybody on the committee have a question or concern doing it. Sean could you just repeat the number of beds and what acute they're all acute beds or what that what they include, what the closure includes. So there was 163 licensed acute care beds on August 13th for about 40 of those beds were closed. That was what we call three or I'm sorry burger, two or the medical surgical unit on the second floor, and so now we have, you know 120 beds that are operating, so that is the estimate of what's actually functioning right now and then we have our rehabilitation floor, which is doing acute, inpatient acute rehabilitation, but that is the floor. That was converted during the first surge to operate for Covid-19 patients or medical patients, and then we have psychiatric beds. Those will stay open, so rehabilitation will remain and say and psych adult psych will remain, but the 121 beds that are currently active will close by December 1st, I'm sorry December 31st, unless there is a a change of plan, I hope that answers your question. Anybody else we have about like two minutes all right. Well, I just want to thank everyone that came to participate for this part of this committee's agenda. I think this is a really valuable conversation and the Cont. The conversation will continue and I want to thank all the representatives from New York docs for coming out. We really appreciate all of your wisdom, especially you know how you're addressing these issues every day. Thank you very much to Ms Dillard from Kingsbrook and thank you very much. Miss Goodridge from the assembly member's office, so I think at this point we're going to move on to our second agenda item and that is going to be a presentation from Atiyah Kazi and she is from the mayor's office of Immigrant affairs. So I'd like to welcome her to a mute herself and begin her presentation. Thank you and thank you for being so patient for being our number two agenda item, thanks, of course, no problem honestly, just hearing that you know such an essential part of this community, like is like at risk of shutting down, is honestly. It's very scary. Can I also have access to share my screen? Yes, give me one moment, and just let me know just so: I can continue with timing of this meeting. How long is your presentation, Miss Cathy? It should take 15 minutes. That's perfect, excellent! Thank you! So much! Okay, you are the presenter now! Okay, thank you. So much so I just wanted to say thank you for inviting me here today on behalf of the mayor's office of Immigrant affairs. Personally, we have been trying to do a lot more outreach during the pandemic to make sure that the immigrant community is able to access the resources that are available to them because of the pandemic, and everything that's going on since immigrants are one of the hardest hit, is the hardest hit community? So far, immigrants are on the front line of the pandemic and fish and they do come. They are 58 of all essential workers in New, York City, so that includes nurses, cooks, home Health, Aids, janitors, laundry and dry cleaning workers, which means that immigrants are more likely to die from the virus as well and in terms of Covid-19 guidance. You we obviously want to encourage everyone to stay home if you're, sick and just seeing how the second search is basically up to us. We want to make sure that everyone is safe, only going out for essential medical care and errands staying six feet away from each other, wearing a mask wearing gloves, if necessary, and for real-time text updates about Covid-19. You can text Covid-19 to 692-692 and for text and Spanish you can do Covid-19 esp to 692 and you can get a free test at any of the New York City Health and hospitals locations, and you can use this website to find the closest testing site near you. The New York City has a test and trace program where whoever is test, whoever tests positive or is exposed, is known to be exposed to clover. 19 will get a call from a contact tracer. Who will ask about how that pers? How you're feeling? How, if you need any guidance or services and ask who you've been in contact with just to know how far the virus has spread? The concept contact tracers will not ask about your social security number, your credit card information or other private information. If someone does ask for that information, they are just posing as a contact tracer, and you should hang up immediately. The city provides hotel accommodations for anybody who can not who can not isolate properly in within their own homes. They will be picked up from their homes after they test positive, and they can stay in that hotel for up to 14 days, where all accommodations will be taken. Care of anybody who that's positive will also receive a take care package from the city that has masks gloves hand, sanitizer and other essential information for whoever has tested positive as well. New, York, City, Health and hospitals also provides care to all New Yorkers, no matter your immigration status or insurance status, which means that if you do not have insurance and can not pay for your health care, health and hospitals will still see you, which is a big problem that we've seen people being scared to not to come home with big hospital bills. So this is for everyone to know that health and hospitals will see you no matter what and the city has launched this new program called NYC care where you can enroll to have enrolled to have this NYC insurance card, basically where, as long as you're living in New York for more than six months, you probably you, don't qualify for any other health insurance. You can't afford any other kind of health insurance. You will be covered by New York City, and this is especially important for our undocumented community. The city also has its municipal. I D card, where you can, where anybody in New York, no matter your immigration status, can apply for an I d card, which is based, which is an accepted form of I d anywhere in New York City and has its own perks and benefits as well. Right now, most I d NYC centers are closed because of them pandemic, but there is one location in each borough that is currently open and accepting new applications. If you need to renew your I d NYC, you can just do that online. The city has also launched its action NYC hotline, which is a free hotline that offers free, safe immigration, legal help in a network of trusted, community organizations and schools. You can call 1-800-354-0-365 or call 311 and say action NYC, any time between Monday to Friday, 9 A.M to 6 p.m, for whatever immigration concerns you have, the city is also providing burial assistance, as we've seen a surge of deaths because of the pandemic, and you can apply to get this assistance, which would wage between seventeen hundred and thirty four hundred dollars, and you can apply within 120 days of an individual step. So three months within the three months that someone passes away, you can apply for this assistance, and this is also regardless of immigration status and social security is not required. The city also has NYC wealth, which is a mental health call. Tax chat number service where that can provide crisis, counseling peer support, short-term counseling and also just connection to ongoing mental health and substance misuse services. So anything you need help with. If you need it, if you ever need anyone to just talk to in the midst of everything, that's happening, you can just call or text this number. The city also has the tenant helpline because of the pandemic. Many people are out of work and they may might have they might be having issues with their landlords and paying rent. You can call one and say a tenant helpline to get support for whatever tenant issues you're facing as of right. Now there is an eviction moratorium until January that says that nobody in New York city can be evicted before January as of right now it has not been renewed, but if you are a tenant that feels like you're at risk of being evicted know that you're safe until January, and even after that, even after January there are, there is a long process that a landlord would have to go through to actually evict. You so know that that someone is always available to help you with whatever situation you're going through the city also obviously has has public benefits that anybody that most can apply for and access HRA is the way to actually get into all of those benefits and see what you can and can not apply for, such as the one shot deal. It's an emergency assistance grant that can prevent eviction or utility disconnection, so yeah there's also cash assistant assistance that can be added to your public benefit. If someone is added to your budget and me and you meet an unexpected need, snap is to help people put food on the table and even though undocumented New Yorkers are uneligible for these specific programs and benefits. If you do, if your family is mixed status, as in someone in your family has, it is undocumented and some are not are documented, then you are still eligible to apply for these and throughout the pandemic, the city has also opened up meal hubs in the closest in your closest schools, to ensure that people have access to food whenever they need, or at specific times of day. You can also text food to 877 to find out more about where you can get free meals from and besides, that the city has the get food program, which is basically meals, being delivered to you from local restaurants and for up to two weeks at a time these meals are will be delivered to your door every three days for, however long you, however long you need it and, of course, free of service to anybody. That's that needs it, and you do not need to be documented for these as well. There's also a job opportunity for Tlc drivers to actually help deliver this food, and all you need to do- is sign up at Nyc.Gov delivery, Tlc and you can help deliver food to people who need it and get paid at the same time. You also have we also have small business services, and the city is beginning to reopen these webinars to help businesses actually to help businesses get back on their feet. Something that actually isn't in this presentation is the city has this program where, where you can, where a designer can help you plan out what kind of outdoor seating your restaurant can have in the amount of space that it has outside of it and I will put the link to that in the chat as well and last but not least, we have the we speak. Nyc online classes and we speak is, is an english class for all New Yorkers. It started off as a video series and now it's actually a weekly class that runs that is available different times of day seven days a week for New Yorkers to take advantage of to help improve their English and you can. You can volunteer to teach one of these classes at the Nyc.Gov. We speak NYC and you can also sign up for these classes at that same link, and these are all of the services that I spoke about today and I. This is my information and other General Moya information that anybody can take advantage of. We have a hotline as well that if you don't particularly remember which resource you need or need more help with a specific issue, you can call our Moya Hotline, which is two one 212-788-7654, and someone will get back to you as soon as they can and of course, thank you for having me here today and if you have any questions you can. Let me know thank you so very much for such an informative presentation and also you know, directing it towards the current public health situation that we have going on. I personally did not know that there was assistance for in interning your loved ones and I appreciate knowing about this information now and I'm sure the rest of the committee does as well I'd like to open up the floor to the committee members. If there is any questions for the representative, we have several hands up. I will just read off the names we have now in order: Nina Sabgear, Glenn, Mullen, Dwayne, Joseph and Ann Godette. So I'm just going to go from the top of my list, which is going to be and got that go ahead and you were muted. I'm sorry can you hear me yeah you're all set go ahead. Great! Thank you very much Joanne, so yeah, going dovetailing to your the internment issue is that for local internment, only somebody who dies here can it be buried in Puerto Rico? Is there assistance, for that is the specific question from what I know specifically about it? It's for burial in New, York, City, okay, so there's no offset for elsewhere. All right! Thank you, and the second thing is with the you mentioned, the SBS for small business services, so for restaurants, with the new guidance for their barriers in anticipation of snow season and department of Sanitation plowing and such there are certain things that are available to be requested, but in terms of process, how would somebody be able to actually get direct answers instead of going from 311 to D-O-T and then back to 311 and so on? Should they reach out directly to your office or what would you suggest to them with these barriers? So, for that, I would suggest to call our hotline if it is like a minority or owned business. Specifically, you can call or any anybody honestly can call our hotline for to be connected to the person with the right answers. I would say, since I don't work specifically in that department, I can't say, but the program that I was speaking about earlier. That can help help design what your restaurants, outdoor seating looks like. They can also help in preparing for snow season as well. So can you please reinforce remind us, your hotline number, please. That would be helpful. Thank you so much yes. So the hotline number is two one, two, seven, eight, seven, six, five! Four! Thank you very much. Thank you. Ann the next hand, I see up in my list is Nina. Okay, yeah I just had a question regarding patient individuals who are uninsured and not eligible, for you know, say the exchange and other forms of insurance, particularly I'm looking at immigrants who may be undocumented. Are they able to get some form of assistance that are limited to going to say kings, County and the other HHC hospitals, or are they able to get assistance that will allow them to go to other places as well? I'm thinking specifically because it I work at Kingsbrook. I'm a clinician and I just recently saw a young woman who was almost afraid to tell me that the reason she wasn't insured is because of her immigration status and she needs care yeah as of right now the health and hospitals does see justifications regardless of immigration status and NYC care. I want to give you the right information, so I'm going to check again. Nyc care is also specific to the health and hospitals locations across the city. At this time, the city has only partnered with these public hospitals, so the NYC care only works there. So at this time for other private hospitals like like Kingsborough or Maimonides or any other hospital, we don't have, we don't I guess serve at those locations yet, okay. Thank you. The next hand that I see up is from Shelley World feel free to go ahead and ask your question: Shelly. If you have one okay and I just want to double check that the hand for Inner Dilla, Enid Dillard is, is an artifact from earlier or if you do have a question for this presenter artifact from earlier. Sorry, no, that's no problem, I, don't see any other hands from the committee or the public. That's attending I just want to make sure okay well again, Ms Kazi! Thank you so much. This is so very informative. Yes, go ahead! Sorry, it's Dwayne. I actually had my hand raised. I, didn't see your hand. I can't see you in my list Dwayne. Please go ahead thanks! Joanne thanks for posting this Tia. Thank you very much for your presentation. I actually just had two quick questions. If I may one for our residents who have challenges with their immigration status, what is Moya's plan right now or what activities are you guys doing to kind of reinsure them around going to get checked for Covid-19 at these sites that they don't need to be concerned about ice? I know in the immigrant community: that's a big concern. Family members who are who have a challenge with the immigration status right now and are concerned, are going to you know some of these public hospitals because they're concerned around ice and then the second question I had was specific to the business reopening I know you're, not in that particular department, as you mentioned, to Ann. But what work are you guys doing around again? Our residents that are that have challenges around the immigration status, to reassure them that you know going back to work is safe for them and what their rights are. As far as you know, being able to you know, let an employer know, for instance, that they're uncomfortable with like certain situations, you know because I feel like there are situations now where they may be getting pressured to do a bit more than they would normally do because of the public health crisis yeah. Those are very important questions as of right now we are doing a lot of in-person outreach about ice and how to how to protect yourself when comes to ice, knocking on your door or being in your neighborhood or your community. Last month we did see a few. We did see a few ice raids here in Brooklyn, particularly sunset park in red hook and one other neighborhood as well. So we are trying to increase the amount of information that we are putting out to the to the community to make sure that everyone knows what their rights are when it comes to ice being near them, in particular, to your question about perhaps like undocumented New Yorkers, who might be afraid to go back to work because of the pandemic, but I feel like they're being forced to return. I would recommend to call our hotline as well that we would be able to either help in cases case by case I. Think also something that we should all remember, or it continues to remind others as well, is that New York City is a sanctuary city. So anytime ice is here, they're, not here with the permission of like the NYPD or the mayor or any anyone like that, and we know that, like the mayor has already said that he will not cooperate with ice when they come to ask for information of particular individuals. That's something that we really need to keep in mind, and we do have like a whole know. Your rights presentation as well that we can present or I can even bring our flat our our handouts for people to know like what numbers to call what to do basically like a cheat sheet for when when and if ice ever comes nearby. This is what you need to do. If anybody is interested in those I can definitely drop those off to whoever, wherever because this is something that's extremely important, and at this time we are, we were particularly afraid that ice rage would increase because of the election. So I do want everyone to be mindful of that as well, especially because inauguration day has not come yet, and you know in this time within the these next two months, you know anything is possible. We do you know as much as New York City is a sanctuary city there. You know things can still happen and we want everyone to be mindful of anything that does happen, and even if you yourself are not an undocumented immigrant or a person of color anything can happen to anybody. It could be. Maybe it's not you, but maybe it's your friends or your family or any of your loved ones, your co-workers. It can be anybody, so you know as long as you know the information you can always pass it on to someone else. Thank you very much for that. I have one last question from Shelley Warrell. Thank you. Joanne. A question. I have two different points that I wanted to just make. First and foremost, I wanted to thank you and Community board 14 for your support of census. 2020, you all were one of I would say from my personal and professional experience, one of my most outstanding partners, and it was such a pleasure and an honor and a gift to be able to work so closely with my hometown here in Flatbush. So thank you Joanne. Thank you. Sean Dwayne everyone who advocated on behalf of our neighborhood and our community board, so really, and please keep me informed as things progress I would be happy to just continue to support behind the scenes. If I can I'm no longer with the bureau but I still love to be in the know, and the second piece is I also just wanted to lend organizational support to any initiatives you have related to Kingsborough. As you know, through my work with caribbean and little Caribbean NYC, we have a deep reach into the caribbean community and, as you duly noted, that hospital has a heavy caribbean population not only in terms of staffing, but in terms of patience. My that's my grandmother, my aunts, my father, probably has been seen at the Keith Brooke, so I wanted to make sure that I lend my support to all of your efforts on that front as well. We thank you so very much Shelley also and I said it beginning for really mentoring us and guiding us through the process of creating a very strong network within community world 14. To answer the census. To really you know, for back of the lack of a better word attack, getting a complete count within the community, our district, 14 and and the staff of Kingsbrook Jewish medical Center. Really thanks, you and Cara being a little caribbean for lending a hand in just getting the word out on how important these hospital beds are during this time of the pandemic, and we really appreciate that so all right so sorry to cut you off John, but we do have pretty deep engagement in that community, particularly in Brooklyn, so happy to make sure that everyone is in the know, and you know that and also their support as well yeah. We really look forward to working with you in the coming weeks. Thank you very much, so it is 7:45. I think this is a good time to say thank you to the committee members and the representatives of the elected officials, our partners at New, York, Docs, Ms, Dillard from Kingsborough jewish medical center and members of the public that attended this com. This committee meeting, we will not have another meeting this year. Hopefully, in lucky 2021 we will have another meeting early on and we will be able to speak of other things that relate to human services. Thank you, Sam. So much and Baza do you have anything that you want to add as co-chair of this committee. Thank you so much.
