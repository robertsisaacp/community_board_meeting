We're going to talk about the Kingsbrook Jewish medical center, closure of acute care beds, first.
There are a million people to thank and I, don't want to miss anyone, but I'm, just going to name off a couple of names: the people that fully supported this committee of Course Shelley Worrell, who was our federal, the Census, Bureau Federal connection.
So, that's pretty great, of course, Kathleen Daniels from the New York City Census, Amy Michael's from the Brooklyn public library.
I just wanted to open up the conversation about the closure of the acute care beds by talking about who kingsborough well.
Let's talk about a little bit of history in Brooklyn and the availability of hospital beds, and we have some of the members of New York docs on the line, and they can get a little bit more into the public health aspect of this.
Brooklyn has just shy of two somewhere between 1.8 and 2.2 beds per 1000 residents, and it's always been a concern of community boards and the like, that.
What was how did king's brook contribute during the pandemic, so I will say that at the height of the pandemic we had 200 acute care, beds, working serving brooklynites serving patients who had Covid-19.
You can understand how the staff from boots on the grounds feels like the closure of these beds during the pandemic is poorly timed and the people that are supporting the delay of the closure are asking that we wait until we.
It's a discussion, I'd like to invite Jenny or Lee or Betty, who are from New York docs to basically join us for the discussion about why this is a public health, emergency.
Basically, I want to start with the fact that I was working in Manhattan as a resident at the height of Covid-19 in spring, so I was treating patients with coved 12 hours.
I, think that when we're in the midst of a public health emergency, as we are right, now, that a hospital contained an array of services not just limited to the beds, but also the staff, the bundle of medications, equipment and all of the invisible infrastructure that comes with the hospital that can not be easily replaced by something like an alternate care.
And so it's like doubly egregious to say we're going to close these beds in the middle of the rising second wave in New York City.
So I just want emphasize that there is something that is lost among not just from all the logistical hurdles and the fact that you know tent hospitals are unable to care for really sick patients and have these long checklists of requirements before they're allowed to accept patients and are staffed by visiting.
Then I would also add that one last thing, which is that the you know the plan from one Brooklyn health to have the same number of beds that were at the maximum point during the spring wave available at Interfaith and Brookdale, which is what their current Covid-19 surge plan.
You know Covid-19 patients in need of care being able to adequately transfer them directly from the emergency room to Med. Surg Covid-19 beds at other facilities feels much easier said than done, and so it just feels like a recipe for a full emergency room and a bunch of shuttered beds.
They are people that are from the community that when they need help, they come back to the same hospital and so to Lee's point to be in a hospital in central Brooklyn that they know, and they know the nurses, and they know the staff would make a very big difference.
How can we fight the disparities that we're seeing in and who gets Covid-19 and who dies from Covid-19 to turn around and deny people in east Flatbush the standard of care and to say you, know, they're, going to have these surge beds.
They're, going to jump right into rationing care when people elsewhere in New, York City have access to the standard of care.
All I just wanted to make sure people know and understood that during the last surge we were really at Kingsborough completely overwhelmed, and this is true at Kingsborough.
The public health community recognizes that the real lived experience of trying to care for people during the last wave was that there was not enough.
While the plan is, it is what it is, the public health docs, can talk about again and have talked about the long-term ramifications of closing any beds in central Brooklyn, because we've already lost four hospitals.
It was a quite traumatic experience, I mean not just to Kingsborough for many of the hospitals across the systems in New, York, City and nationally, but that the quality team, the medicine team.
So at that point, one Brooklyn health administration was very flexible to make sure that the community needs were met at that at the tail end and during you know.
The conversation will continue and I want to thank all the representatives from New York docs for coming out.
They are 58 of all essential workers in New, York City, so that includes nurses, cooks, home Health, Aids, janitors, laundry and dry cleaning workers, which means that immigrants are more likely to die from the virus as well and in terms of Covid-19 guidance.
You can get a free test at any of the New York City Health and hospitals locations, and you can use this website to find the closest testing site near you.
New, York, City, Health and hospitals also provides care to all New Yorkers, no matter your immigration status or insurance status, which means that if you do not have insurance and can not pay for your health, care, health and hospitals will still see you, which is a big problem that we've seen people being scared to not to come home with big hospital bills.
This is for everyone to know that health and hospitals will see you no matter what and the city has launched this new program called NYC care where you can enroll to have enrolled to have this NYC insurance, card, basically where, as long as you're living in New York for more than six months, you probably you, don't qualify for any other health.
Thank you so very much for such an informative presentation and also you know, directing it towards the current public health situation that we have going.
Nyc care is also specific to the health and hospitals locations across the city.
This time, the city, has only partnered with these public hospitals, so the NYC care only works.
Our residents that are that have challenges around the immigration status, to reassure them that you know going back to work is safe for them and what their rights are.
We are trying to increase the amount of information that we are putting out to the to the community to make sure that everyone knows what their rights are when it comes to ice being near them, in particular, to your question about perhaps like undocumented New Yorkers, who might be afraid to go back to work because of the pandemic, but I feel like they're being forced to return.
First and foremost, I wanted to thank you and Community board 14 for your support of census.
I think this is a good time to say thank you to the committee members and the representatives of the elected officials, our partners at New, York, Docs, Ms, Dillard from Kingsborough jewish medical center and members of the public that attended this com.
