Members of the public were asked to pre- register by to speak by becoming the pre- requested speakers or aspect of name whether they live in the district and their organization.

Part of the mayor's turning the tide plan, which we announced back in 2017, was what was basically to sort of for the first time, come up with an actual framework on how to create a shelter system that would be both beneficial for communities and for also for our clients and really rethinking the way that we've done it and that and that, and that plan had four pillars, and the first, of course, was prevention.
We had really seen a lot of improvement in that regard and then, of course, we were, you know, had a whole section regarding street homelessness and We wanted to phase out more than 200 shelter sites that did not meet our standards, including closing down more than seven percent of Giuliani Europe cluster programs.
We at the same time, we wanted to announce an opening, 90, new shelters and thus far we've announced 74 74- 21 durian place is one of those with solid providers established non- profits that are running those sites that are going to provide excellent care for clients who are in these sites and as well as be good community partners, because it does not matter how well a shelter does its job if it does not have a good relationship with the folks around it part of also the work that we're doing is really trying to advance an early in advance whenever we can, and so previously, under the previous administration, the shelter would open up and the night before folks would come in, and it was terrible.
Do a fantastic job It's a pleasure for me to hand this over to Jelani, and let him talk a little bit more about the work that they're going to do and their vision for this specific site and then, of course, we're happy to answer any questions that folks may have so Jalani.
But we did raise questions and maybe we'll hear more about them about just regarding the location of this site, adjacent to the theater and basically on the theater's loading dock, and we made sure that there was communication between the theater and DHS and the applicant as well as and bridget.
We talked about some concerns regarding crime in the area and the number of times 9- 1- 1 is summoned to this very specific block and not only the concern from the community point of view, but whether or not this was optimal for the 200 men who will be living temporarily at the at the shelter.
What was the reason why you may have become late, because there's different reasons why people are late We just want to document it so that we know so that we can build a supportive service plan to help the individual.
The developer is responsible for creating the building, creating all the you know, making sure that it's appropriate, so we communicate with DOB about this stuff, but I can certainly find out more about it.
You know how much disruption will there be in the immediate area of the building as a developer is working on it inside and outside?
We will be good neighbors, as we've already been with construction, but it's something that I'd like for you to give to independently assess, as well as you know, liaising with your neighbor in the jewish world, because I think that we all have some improvement, that we can do, especially with another neighbor and 200 men who are trying to get together and get on their feet and everything that we're doing to everything that we can do to support you.
So, we're not foreign to that, and so you know, I, look forward to continue working with you all and all of the institutions , that's in the area, so we can collaborate and be of service This way, I mean, as I said, I.
Acrosss the city, And I've, never not seen a situation where geek, where black vets has gone into a community and to a site and not fully impressed the elected officials and local community board in terms of the work that they're doing and actually act.
If there's some support, that's necessary immediately, so that we can respond to so not only will we be doing outside perimeter checks and are engaging with the Community board and our and our collaborative partners in the neighborhood, but also we do have a 24-hour operations number so that we can respond to immediately to any issues, and I just like to correct one thing : They saved with the city with DHS and the city of New York in it in the income savings program that our DHS has for our all clients in the shelter system.
That's, a DOB issue in terms of when it comes to building construction, so the community board will jump in on that nature, with DOB that there'll be permanent coordination and in street opening coordination.
I. Do not think the department of Homeless Services is asking us for anything, because they are moving forward with this plan, but I suspect the board might want to get a letter out to DHS sort of memorializing, some of the some of the commitments that were made, and especially the Community Advisory Board, and we'll get that right, look forward to seeing that letter.
Purpose of this hearing is to hear public testimony by community members to a uniform land use review, or you like euler review application to the Department of city planning submitted by 1600 to 1620 realty corporation.
The application is for a zoning map amendment for an R6A, a c 2- 4 to a r 7d, slash 2 c 2- 4 district and a text amendment to map a mandatory, inclusionary housing area with the project.

We we've been in this location in this community for like 26 years since 1995, and for the years you know we have Throughout the years we get offers from developers, they wanna, they wanna, develop the site and, , that's beneficial to the community, which is a larger supermarket, that we even currently have and have affordable, housing.
It's rental apartments,, that's very much in the community, and you know in Brooklyn, And, I, believe, even and now even more important to do such a project because a lot a lot of developers like abandoning you know, plans to do any investments in Brooklyn and in New, York City, all together, but we are sticking it out and we're staying there We want to invest in the community.
He explored as of right options here and his goals were, among other things, to keep the supermarket here and to potentially create some affordable housing, and in order to do that, there's already an r7a district to the to the south of the site.
The zoning map and the R7A district already encompasses a tiny corner of the site, but in truth, in order to make a mixed- use development here work, particularly in light of the fact that supermarket is a low- margin.
This is really seen as important here, because when we looked at the R7A zoning before much of it created and docked and becoming doctrine after the 2009 Flatbush resolution was a mandatory, inclusionary, housing district, and so this basically carries with it a requirement that 25 to 30 of the units will be affordable.
This is an area which can use additional residential units to relieve rent pressures generally and specifically, for the ability to do affordability.
We have a long list of other of community members and I'm sure that even board members who are leaning one way or another would want to hear from.
And, then the reason, and so the reason I asked that is to tie into the third one where I'm If I heard you correctly that as part of the zoning regulations right that mandates the percentage of units that have to be devoted to various levels of AMI- And So, you know we're in the time of Covid-19 and no one knows how long the impact will be, and so The concern I do not know if it's a concern, but The question I have is if we find a situation where, after the building has been completed, and it turns out that you know the developer and the building are having a hard time filling up.
This extent that there's some modification going forward by HPD that would be likely to be governed by their office, but as far as coming off those amis, it's not something that the owner would be able to necessarily engage, and I would note that you know typically I could not get any audio on my computer.
Zoning, let's be clear, affordable housing is welcome in community board.
It was very specifically rezoned at that time, from an r6 to an R6A, with an overall increase in allowable residential, far to simply erase all that work and consideration to gain approval for the massive up zone is unnecessary and wrong and nothing is stopping the owner from developing a 40:50 or 100, affordable housing development under the existing zoning.
We're huge supporters of the local grocery and laundry and cleaners, but a new store at this location would not justify the up zoning In addition, there's some serious environmental concerns that have been inadequately addressed by the application in the hazardous waste section, the location served as a dry cleaner since 1934, and only stopped on- site, processing.
A phase, two environmental site assessment will in fact be required to remove those e- designations before a building can be constructed thanks, Max. So I think that addresses some of the environmental concerns.
The issue is whether or not it's part of a well- considered plan and a well- considered plan is basically defined in the case law, as one which is has concerns of the community and looked at the concerns of the larger area, as well as the city and seen whether or not this proposal addresses those or whether or not it's just for this one site.
What we would hold here is that the affordable housing that's created on the site, the opportunity to add not just commercial to the site, but mandatory commercial make sure that stays a grocery store.
What we would say is this: The r78 of the rear allows for a 95 foot height limit if it's worth it to the community to have a building which potentially is seven feet taller in exchange for 22 additional, affordable units in the community and the ability to keep a grocery store.
But it's important to note the following, because I heard what Sean said and obviously you know we just rent burdens and such, but what's the difference between these units and market rate units And, it's not just what price they come out to market at, because oftentimes in communities.
Many of Cb14's remaining rent stabilized housing units are in this area, roughly between the blocks of East 16th and the Community Board's eastern border between dorchester and church avenue.
I mention this, because I am concerned that the addition of more expensive housing will increase displacement pressures in the neighborhood, as well as the potential for the displacement of long- time, businesses that serve the community.
Can't do the affordable housing unless you build far in excess of what's already allowed there I mean that is just not credible, and if the developer owner wants to make that assertion, he should have to lay out the financials to establish that, because the impact on our neighborhood is going to be.
I would start with Jennifer's comments with regards to street parking, so the project right now proposes 44 spaces below ground and a couple of things that are important to note, to the extent that there was an as of right building, you know there would be you know there would be fewer units there would be.
Unless you pre approve projects which require affordable, units, to wit, the R7A, which was created, did two things: It codified a lot of the existing buildings to the rear and south and southeast of this property at their existing six and seven foot stories.
The other thing I'd say is again and reflecting some prior comments with regards to light and air and the sky There is an additional 10 to 15 feet that is created by this project, but like to say that we're robbing sky and air because there's a one- story building right now is completely blind to the fact that there are as of right options here and with regards to food.
They do not do those, but we've noted that concern and also use some of the development in the area as leverage to try to push the point that the Community board has made since it was demolished.
The return of the B-22 bus and I'm sure developers would want to be on board with us trying to expand or return some of the mass transit that's been in the community, and the next speaker is Timothy.
This, is the building that lies pretty much directly behind this new development, I'm in an awkward position, because I'm, an architect myself And so is my wife work on affordable housing, projects, acrosss, the city And I'll, be honest to say that some of them are a lot larger than this project.
That does not seem to be much and for people who are into you know, get more affordable, housing, 25.
So I do not think that the market rents are going to make this attractive to anybody in the neighborhood and just as the architect spoke previously and mentioned that you know, There's a give and take between the community and what the developers want.
The project, architects and speak to this- has waste management facilities on site, and you know, as would be typical in a modern apartment building, but I also think you're, probably a little bit more advanced than the city is with regards to broadband and internet access.
First, I do have a question, and so, since the mandate for having affordable units is written in the zoning regulations, there was a community board.
There was a community member who had mentioned in other areas of the city.
You know, there's been higher thresholds for the percentage of units that are affordable, and so currently it looks like it could be.
Is it possible for the developer and the architect to discuss, and then let us know if they can raise that percentage of affordable units, or is this it?
We work on a lot of 100, affordable projects, probably in the last two years, maybe more 100, affordable than regular and- You know the in districts where council members have requested 50, affordability.
We did not talk about this tonight, but assuring that for the affordable housing, it's community board, 14 residents who get preference in the lottery.
As an ongoing food supply, which was mentioned earlier by another board member- that local people do support this key food, and this would allow them to expand the space, offer some affordability or offer some off street parking, but to continue on as a supermarket, recognizing that supermarkets do not have much profit margin in them.
Okay, I'm going to ask the district manager to address that community boards are advisory.
