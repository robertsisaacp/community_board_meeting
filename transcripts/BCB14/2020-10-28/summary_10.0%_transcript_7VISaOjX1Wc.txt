Every year we have a budget committee meeting in advance of our public hearing, and this is to review the budget priorities that we will be requesting of city agencies.
You know our priority, so we're going to start with a capital budget and then go into the expense items for no reason other than That's how it's laid out by OMB and last year.
The reason why that was a high priority last year is because it's been on our on our budget request list for something like three decades There was actually some movement by NYPD to begin.
Study and OMB has not funded that yet, but I think we should maintain it in the budget, especially since you know it is something that NYPD is recognized as a need, but lower their priority.
We know it's not coming this year and that there might be more urgent requests more closely related to more immediate needs, And then there was some other capital requests to maintain And I'm, going to move those expense to maintain the precinct building so that good working order and anya.
But, the department of Environmental protection actually requested support for the development of their wastewater, tools, they're working with some institutions of higher Education University of Michigan, being one of them This is going they're going to monitor sewage in response to the health crisis, because they would be able to inform data as to where there are spikes where there are concerns and and then working with those institutions of higher learning, as well as with Department of Health and mental hygiene, to ensure that their data match what DOH needs to measure.
So I thought that was interesting and if they're looking for support on the development of that seems to fall into our you know the mission of ensuring public health and and economic recovery.
I do not know if we'd necessarily need to put it in a budget because they have the budget, for it would just be directing those resources to our to our community, because our ratios are not as good as the ratios elsewhere or something like that does that make sense sounds good exactly because that means there may be more cameras trying to catch Us, speeding and so forth.
I think it was a few years ago, sean our planning fellow, did a study and found that speeding was actually not an major issue in our in our community board.
Think one of the things that came out surprising to all of us was that speeding was not an actual major issue as it related to like I do not know.
As far as wanting to get more wanting to help Steve find out where all the traffic cameras are right on And, it is an issue And Well, okay, we'll pursue that for sure, I'm, going to move on to capital budget The first thing I want to say: Oh gosh, there's two first things: I want to say: I'll start with I'll start with sanitation, because I mentioned it already before the cuts to sanitation were the most obvious and detrimental, at least in the short term, and at least in terms of you know what we were able.
You can just ask anya how you know how that's affecting the workload in the office, and I think that's about it, but that is that is every single day.
I just want to put that really high up on our list of priorities, because you know their baseline was decimated and they have, and when I spoke to Joe Scala at Bk14, one of my heroes in city government, he was like look.
I, think that if we do not, I and a number of my colleagues have talked about the fact that they've put support for community boards high up in their expense budget for years, and we kind of stick it down there.
We, have new platforms for our budget consultations with OMB data, keeping I'm now a privacy officer in the city of New York, which means I'm just not supposed to share anybody's contact information.
A small office for the sort of So I was looking to hire a temp, but the city is not supporting a temp pool, right, now, and so the possibility is there All the time like every time , I'm working extra late And I think it's really important to highlight, like all of I'm, going to quote unquote extracurricular activities that CB14 does that are modeled by other community boards, youth, conference, The, nonprofit, roundtable and all of the you know, additional work that it puts on the district manager and the Community board staff They're, pivotal to really creating community, and if you look at the results in our district for the census, we are.
And, I 100 say that is because we have allocated our financial resources for two in a row to bring in specialists, to train our nonprofits to be the very best that they can be So. I just think it's really important to cite those issues in the in the budget requests and to just talk about how effective we are They're mentioned in their CBO round.
I think that in the in the days of Covid-19 are our ability to maintain service, and you know the work that any did on the website on a daily basis to update that on a daily basis.
It just is difficult to put a lot of work in that you just do not know if it's going to work, but anyway, we'll figure it out there any list out that you can hire, it may be a clerk or a community associate.
You know kind of sewed into the letter when they asked us for support that they had made a commitment that they were going to maintain the bike lanes.
Hey, Sean, I, think lowering it makes sense: okay, given the low demand and that issue Next year or the year after we talked about new Kirk Plaza and that we're going to ask DOT, MTA and EDC to all you know, take a look at this request, especially again a need for outdoor space.
I think the an increase in inspectors is not an outlandish request in that it should actually be pretty high up there, because I do consider it a sort of public health and safety issue.
Here's another thing: that, like just blows, my mind, Department of parks and recreation, has one exterminator for the borough of Brooklyn and did I mention rats , Contractors sidewalks pruning tree branch, response, Oh, Tree, plantings, park enforcement personnel and exterminators, and I'm going to try to bunch that into not so many requests, but get it all to parks.
You know some remote and some on-site service provision, but I But I'd, like for us to talk a lot about seniors.
We, are in a our population, seems to have gone down since 2010 a little bit, but our the percentage of our population that our seniors over the age of 65 has actually increased from 9.8 in 2010 to 14.5 in 2018, and that ranks us 12 out of 59 community boards in the city which surprised me, and then here's also something to consider and be concerned about the poverty rate among seniors, who are 65 and over is 26.4 percent.
Because I think it's just not okay for the city to ask us whether we're going to prioritize police over senior citizens or children over housing-Nothing is more important than the other.
