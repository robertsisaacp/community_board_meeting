Well, while Anya is doing that, let me take a moment to acknowledge her, because this is our first meeting without our training wheels. We do not have Mark Moss running this meeting this evening. We've got community board 14 in the capable hands of anya hoyer running this meeting this evening, you're here and so give her your patience and support. Annie is the best she's just happy right on. Thank you guys. All right, we are live and I will be posting the link for the budget document so take it away. Ed. Thank you, anya and welcome everybody to this budget committee. Meeting of Community Board 14. we're getting started at 6:33. P.M is quite limited. Thank goodness. I have the opportunity, the pleasure and the opportunity to turn the meeting over at this point to our illustrious district manager, Sean Campbell wow, that was nice thanks ed. So every year we have a budget committee meeting in advance of our public hearing, and this is to review the budget priorities that we will be requesting of city agencies. You know in the FY 22 fiscal budget this year, for reasons we all know is a very different year for previous years. The budget that we're talking about right now has about a nine billion dollar shortfall. Agencies have been cut drastically. Community boards have not been held harmless from those cuts for the first time, ap ever and so, and in the in this good recovery period. That includes an economic recovery period. I think that I've tried to frame the budget requests in such a way as to prioritize those concerns and those necessities. I've also pointed out when I could that had this community board been granted some of the priorities, some of the requests that we had made in previous years, some of the impacts Okovid would not have been so harsh and that these are not requests for fancy things. These are requests that benefit our community and sustain our community and make our community resilient in difficult times, and so so with that in mind, anya, if you could go ahead and put up the preliminary budget register from Fy21, because it's still what we worked off of and while that's going up on the screen, these requests come from. The previous year's documents are the consultations that I've spoken about at recent board meetings and the like with. I think we have oh gosh. I can't remember now something like 20 different city agencies and then our own district needs as recognized as service delivery and input from community members. So without further ado, you know our priority, so we're going to start with a capital budget and then go into the expense items for no reason other than that's how it's laid out by OMB and last year. Our first budget request was to renovate or upgrade the existing precinct house. The reason why that was a high priority last year is because it's been on our on our budget request list for something like three decades and there was actually some movement by NYPD to begin. The process of you know it's recognized as a need by NYPD, so there was some effort put into to begin the process of reviewing the possibilities for the precinct house, and they did. You might remember, they completed a scoping study in 2018, where they spent a million dollars to determine whether or not they could turn they could rip down the current building and build a new one there. They figured out that they actually could do that, but that it would not solve the the parking and traffic situation. Nor would it help to relocate the precinct in a place that had more rationale, which is something that we could have told them for ten dollars instead of a million, but then so now, so the recommendation was for OMB to conduct a site. Study and OMB has not funded that yet, but I think we should maintain it in the budget, especially since you know it is something that NYPD is recognized as a need but lower their priority. Since we know it's not coming this year and that there might be more urgent requests more closely related to more immediate needs, and then there was some other capital requests to maintain and I'm going to move those expense to maintain the precinct building so that good working order and anya. I'm sorry. I can't I do not know. If that's I'm somebody's trying to text me, I can't find my phone. I also can't look at the phone and speak at the same time, but the the presentation is not up on the screen. I do not know if that's a so we might be having technical difficulties holds a reminder severely. Rent overburden means the family is paying more than 50 of their income on their rent. 35 to 37 of our residents. Do that and it's even higher in our families that live in poverty have a higher percentage of living, severely rent overburdened, which I guess makes economic sense. So we will have a conversation fairly soon with with HPD and EDC about the development of the lot on Bedford, Avenue, Bedford and church, which is going to be a 100, affordable, housing development and it was announced in tandem with Councilmember eugene a couple of weeks ago, but yeah. So that's what I'm going to change that to the new, oh and then one last. This is one last new request and then, if there's something that you feel we need, that is a capital improvement that I have not mentioned it out. But the department of Environmental protection actually requested support for the development of their wastewater tools, they're working with some institutions of higher Education University of Michigan, being one of them nyu being another and they're developing a molecular mono monitoring technologies, and this is going they're going to monitor sewage in response to the health crisis, because they would be able to inform data as to where there are spikes where there are concerns and and then working with those institutions of higher learning, as well as with Department of Health and mental hygiene, to ensure that their data match what DOH needs to measure. So I thought that was interesting and if they're looking for support on the development of that seems to fall into our you know the mission of ensuring public health and and economic recovery. So I think we should put that in there to support the request. Let's offer capital just a question sean on the issue of cameras. Do we have anything for like red, light cameras or like speeding cameras? Anything like that? No do we want to add that into the list with D.O.T I mean they have such a. They have such a pattern for how they're installing them, you know, schools first and all of that, but but if you have, should we specify locations, that's what they'll tell us to do. Frankly. I just do not know like where I know where some are, but you know I'm going to say Steve Cohen with like a list. I know when I see the cars going, the other direction and the lights flash, then I know where they are but yeah other than that I mean. Maybe there's a maybe there's a formula by which we could say you know is our: is our camera installation to to you know offending vehicles ratio equip you know similar to that across the borough or have we noticed that offending vehicles, the number of offending vehicles have dropped, since the installation of cameras would suggest that they they're working? I could try to get that information and then- and then maybe you know in some other. I do not know if we'd necessarily need to put it in a budget because they have the budget, for it would just be directing those resources to our to our community, because our ratios are not as good as the ratios elsewhere or something like that does that make sense sounds good exactly because that means there may be more cameras trying to catch Us, speeding and so forth. So I just I just want to point this is Dwayne. I just want to point out our own traffic study done by. I think it was a few years ago, sean our planning fellow, did a study and found that speeding was actually not an major issue in our in our community board district. So our only study is, I think that was that was just sort of human boss observation on the base. I think that was just what was observed on certain corners, where they were looking, I'm not sure. Well, that was the assessment around the speed bumps and whether or not they were necessary and what the actual speed study yeah. So that was the one around like what were the actual causes or reasons top required top reasons for crashes or traffic incidents in the district, and I think one of the things that came out surprising to all of us was that speeding was not an actual major issue as it related to like vehicle- involved incidents in the district, so Joanne I'll take them I'll. Take another look at that because I think that was not. I do not know, if that I can't remember the methodology and the scope of that observation and, and then you know that was followed a couple years later by us having one of the highest death rates in the city when Coney Island Avenue became a corridor of great concern. So it's funny it's interesting. How fluid this is, I'm just bringing it up, as a point of our own study may have may shoot us in the behind there. As far as wanting to get more wanting to help Steve find out where all the traffic cameras are right on it's been since cove, because you know a lot of streets are not as trap become actually much more aggressive in this speeding and it is an issue and they've been an increase in people getting hit and killed as a result, so benign, yeah. Well, okay, we'll pursue that for sure, I'm going to move on to capital budget and there's even more items here than there are on the other, and I know we're already an hour in so I'll- try to speak quickly and I can skip a couple things if you know you do not need the whole background on it. But the first thing I want to say: oh gosh, there's two first things I want to say I'll start with I'll start with sanitation, because I mentioned it already before the cuts to sanitation were the most obvious and detrimental, at least in the short term, and at least in terms of you know what we were able to. You know, complaints that we get and what we're all able to see on the on the street. So I'm going to give you some numbers that the the New Commissioner Grayson, who was just brilliant. He was so he's the only commissioner to come to a budget consultation this year. But this is what happened. Everybody's budget got cut, but nobody got cut so severely in their day- to- day service operations as sanitation. They took a 63, effective cut and service frequency. They reduced the baseline litter basket. Remember we used to fight every year for more Litter basket collection. We finally got up to six days a week, we're back down to two yeah three in some places they totally eliminated holiday, Litter battle, Protection and Sunday Litter basket collection they eliminated. Remember. I talked about rats, they eliminated a litter basket service associated with rat mitigation. They eliminated dedicated, syringe litter patrol. They totally eliminated. What's called Mlp, that's manual, litter patrol, that's just when you know picking up when people do an illegal dump job. Underneath our you know our road bridges. We get a lot of those, especially down south, that's who goes and pick you know, cleans those up, they've reduced a lot cleaning by 30 percent. You can just ask anya how you know how that's affecting the workload in the office, and I think that's about it, but that is that is every single day. You know I've got people noticing that there's more litter on the street and asking for more litter baskets. No, it's not going to help. We do not have anybody picking them up, so a restoration of the sanitation budget to me is when you, when you look at what sanitation's symbol is it's like? It's like a medical staff. You know so this they were originally formed as a public health agency, the dirtier we get the less healthy. We are the less we want to go out and take our walks and the more rats that we have, and so I want to. I just want to put that really high up on our list of priorities, because you know their baseline was decimated and they have, and when I spoke to Joe Scala at Bk14, one of my heroes in city government, he was like look. I have the trucks I can send out every single Monday. He knows that his trucks are coming back full without having finished their routes, every Monday, since the cuts, and so just give him four more trucks. Give him give him. You know eight more guys and sorry they are all guys right now, but but they you know they do not have it. So that's just silly and sort of like if you can't, if you can't deal with what we know is happening, how are we going to be better prepared to deal with what we do not know what's coming well, so you've got me convinced that this should be number one or two okay, good. The other first thing I wanted to talk about is us, and I get to my notes, so you know. I think that if we do not, I and a number of my colleagues have talked about the fact that they've put support for community boards high up in their expense budget for years, and we kind of stick it down there around number eight. So I'm skipping ahead. It's down on number eight on the list, if you're following along, but look we so we had a peg reduction. They took nine thousand dollars out of our budget from last from the previous fiscal year. 9,000 this fiscal year we're the only city agency to have not expanded, and I mean the city- wide we're the only city agency to have not expanded. Since 2016. there's been no significant change in our budget, there's been minor increases. I think we went from 233 when I started to 260 something now and but there's been a substantial offloading of responsibilities. We no longer get centralized administrative support for our timekeeping. We no longer get centralized administrative support for our budgeting. We have had to be trained in the fms system in the passport system. There's a new safo system. There's a new district needs platform that I've complained about. For a few years now, that is always a lot of work. We have new platforms for our budget consultations with OMB data, keeping I'm now a privacy officer in the city of New York, which means I'm just not supposed to share anybody's contact information, so the training for that and the extra reporting I have to do for that and all the while, our service requests have not diminished they've gone up as well. What do we have like 3,000, something on our in our database? We continue to get audited. We just got a new, a new memo from the controller's office that we're going to be audited to ensure that we are following the open meetings law. So you know, and then we get tons and tons of trainings that we did not used to have to do, and I welcome the trainings I think they're fine. They, some of them are even informative. Most of them feel a little bit silly for an office of two like now. You know we have to finish our sexual harassment, training about our fourth sexual harassment training. So it's just a lot more with no more support. So I wanted to make that case. I feel we're I'm working with colleagues to talk about. You know ensuring that communities know better the utility of their community boards and use us turn to us more often. So I wanted to move that request up Glenn. What is the possibility of hiring back a third person in the office? Well, I mean we have the budget to do it. The problem is that I do not know how to on- ramp a new person when we're not working together in the office. You know the training and the and supervision and what it means a small office for the sort of I do not know the environment or the you know the way people get along without being together because they're union positions- I just I just worry a little bit about that. So I was looking to hire a temp, but the city is not supporting a temp pool right now, and so the possibility is there and I struggle with it all the time like every time, I'm working extra late and I'm feeling panicked that I worked all day and still feel like. I do not want to put it down until it gets. You know that kind of sort of thing. The panic I feel when I ask any to do like the 19th thing, and it's not even 12 noon yet so it's possible it just it. Just is not easy. Hey Joanne Brown here, and I think it's really important to highlight, like all of I'm, going to quote unquote extracurricular activities that CB14 does that are modeled by other community boards, youth conference, the nonprofit roundtable and all of the you know additional work that it puts on the district manager and the Community board staff and those things are pivotal: they're pivotal to really creating community, and if you look at the results in our district for the census, we are. We have really done very well given you know- and I 100 say that is because we have allocated our financial resources for two in a row to bring in specialists, to train our nonprofits to be the very best that they can be yeah. So I just think it's really important to cite those issues in the in the budget requests and to just talk about how effective we are yeah. I think I think yeah they're mentioned in their CBO round table. I think and I'll make sure I'll make sure that that's articulated thanks for that yeah. No, I'm looking at it too. I thought another point of conversation with. My colleagues is also just additional resources to enable that you know the Public Engagement Commission, which was charter mandated. They were supposed to be assisting community boards with technical support and perhaps planning fault you know planners for each board. So I do not think that's gotten very far, but we'll continue that test that and I am going to go ahead. I think that in the in the days of Covid-19 are our ability to maintain service, and you know the work that any did on the website on a daily basis to update that on a daily basis. We know that was heavily utilized, so so I'm going to go ahead and ratchet that up to you know put that up in the top three good. We can move on. Can I jump in here, okay great and got it so question for you about not on boarding somebody? Are you you're, probably not going to be able to capture the 9,000 times two losses, but will you likely eclipse that person, even though it really is difficult to bring somebody in remotely? So? Would you then lose that capacity in these budgetary in this budgetary climate? So I just throw that out as a consideration that you do not want to lose that because it could was not really taken yeah, just a thought. You can do a budget modification to turn that money into something else or to you know, hire a planner if we have not hired a staff member because I have not. You know that so yeah I do not like you can ask anya. I do not like giving any money back to the city, especially when we're turning around and asking for additional funding. The problem is that you know the funding we need is really for personnel and the in the funding that they gave us. I forgot to mention this: the 42,000 in the past two years. Actually it sounds like a gift, but it was kind of a burden to be able to spend that on something that was not personnel and did not look. We were just going to get a pony and you know and other boards. You know we all most of you. I think, know the story of the board that actually bought a car with their 42 and they could legally. That was not illegal. It just was a little bit unseemly, but but so that kind of was the way we asked the Ask last year was we asked them to just baseline that into our budget and let us decide whether that should be odps or Ps, but yeah, and I that's point well taken. I do not wanna, we do not wanna sit around and not use it, and maybe we could hire somebody like a consultant or you know for or like I said, a planning, fellow or somebody for a special project. So there's that, can you hire someone on a consultant type line? You know provisional so that you can six months later, they're, not in the union. You know if they work out, they work out. If not, I looked into that a little bit, but I do not, but I do not know the final answer I mean the problem that was the flag that was raised is that we do not need somebody really high level like a consultant high level to talk about policy changes or that sort of thing. What we really need is administrative assistance, so we're looking for data entry and that sort of thing and and website updates and yeah. So that does not understand what it is: descriptions very tight. Okay, one minute sean they do not have. Does the city still have the college AIDS, because that can probably help you to alleviate. You know having you have a college age come in, and so I do not know what the city, how you get it through the city, but there you know there are ways for us to reach out. But again, then it's like training somebody, who's, temporary and then, and then they can't be alone in the office and we're only working one person at a time in the office right now and having that person work remotely, then there's a lack of supervision, so it just is it could work. It just is difficult to put a lot of work in that you just do not know if it's going to work, but anyway, we'll figure it out there any list out that you can hire, it may be a clerk or a community associate. That would then be a union, a union staff yeah. But why are you against union? I'm not against unions. Please believe me when I tell you that okay, but I do not, but I need to be able to ensure that the person the probation period for that employee needs to be. We need to use that to ensure that the employee is working out before we make them permanent. Well, with union employees they're, usually a probation of a year. So you know okay, I do not see you know. What's the issue with that all right I'll get back to work on it, so I sort of wonder how can I jump back in? I wonder how a probationary period of the year for a the transition in a category from temporary, to or like an adjunct in some way to a full full- time, fully or now being vested position would respond to a reduction of monies in the future. Just as an oh, by the way, you can't do it, I mean yeah, and actually we would hire somebody on a part- time basis for now maybe bring them up to full time in the future, because there's some really good points in there. But in any case I faith total faith in you. Thank you we'll see. Thank you all right, so we're we kind of skipped around and I'm just going to quickly go through some of these things. You know. Expanding street outreach for homeless is something I just want to maintain as a high priority. It's something that we continue to need and we see and we hear concerns and complaints and we work very closely with breaking ground, but it takes something like 250 encounters for a street homeless person to accept services. So we need somebody to talk to somebody once a day and our calls about that have escalated for sure. I'm going from the wrong notes. I kind of wanted to bunch these all together, so expanding the street outreach and increasing homeless prevention programs. I'm concerned that you know, as many people are, that people will that eviction proceedings may escalate in the near future, and so maintaining services for people who are at risk will be a priority again. It fits into our mission, looking back, yeah, so homeless, Outreach additional home security programs then and to HPD a request to maintain at the housing stock that exists. Now I mean when the mayor talks about adding new, affordable units. I think they usually talk about a net number. Sorry, I do not mean that they talk about a gross number. They talk about what they've added and there's not a lot of talk about. What's falling away, you know what no longer is available or and there's no mention of some of the affordable housing that exists is substandard housing. So I mentioned that we have a very high rent overburdened population. We also have one of the highest rent unit, overcrowding, statistics in the city and then get this according to HPD Vi. This is measured by the number of HPD violations and, along the lines of most serious, less serious, moderately serious violations measuring along those lines. Only 40 percent of the units in our district are considered adequately maintained, so it might be affordable, but it's not adequate, and so I think you know HPD inspectors and the ability of HPD to move in and correct violations is a as a budget priority that I think is screaming out in this district. So that's kind of the housing I'm moving, I'm going to try to move through on theme, so we get all of the issues that are related to one theme done at a time any questions or concerns about that. Okay, yeah now I'd just like to say that I think these are really important that unless something changes in the state, when people will be allowed to be evicted, come January 1st, it's really important that these agencies ramp up as much as they can yeah. We do not want to solve problems by creating problems. Okay and then, of course, I mean there's no mention of this, but but, as we all know, we're going to be hosting a shelter, 200 men, General population, shelter. I guess in two years that they're building now under a place, so our DOT requests, our traffic and parking studies move this down as it's not mission related and D.O.T has decreased public input and everything that they're installing in the in the district. They come to us with plans instead of proposals now, but I do want to ensure that some of the programs that they're not even asking us about that are you know sometimes buying programs but but could sometimes benefit from community input. But I want to just make sure that those installations are that there's a maintenance budget for them. So, for instance, when they put the pedestrian islands, I we're having a double of a time trying to get anybody to maintain the pedestrian islands on Coney, Island, Avenue and Avenue M. The weeds are up higher than the cars, but nobody's responsible for weed whacking. Those weeds D.O.T had entered into an agreement with parks to do it, but parks no longer has the capacity to do it. So nobody does it. The bike. Lane maintenance is something that we, you know kind of sewed into the letter when they asked us for support that they had made a commitment that they were going to maintain the bike lanes and then I'm having a really hard time getting DOT to repair anybody who's in the neighborhood around Beverly and East 16Th Street, and wants to go check out the East 16th street dead end. You may be surprised at the condition of the walls at the end of that the wall is like it's like, or it's like falling apart, there's graffiti all over it and it's literally falling down and D.O.T said. Oh we're not sure. If that's our responsibility, well, whose responsibility? Would it be? Of course it's the responsibility, so you know just getting them. They put the new toys in, but they're not taking care of the toys they have. So that's going to stay in the in the budget request but kind of move down, because it's not a public health or economic recovery request HPD. I already talked about DEP. We would like for them to pay attention to the same five or six flooding locations that we've been bringing to their attention for the past five or six or seven or eight years. We want to maintain that request. The I'm going quickly now. So stop me if I'm going too fast or there's something you want to chime in on NYPD Crossing guards, I'm going to actually move that down. But that's because there are not as many students going to school and that we've been told that the crossing guards we do have that they actually we have our total allotment filled. So I could maintain it so that we could have even more but NYPD was having trouble filling those they people were not applying for the jobs they could not fill the slots that they had and I'm also not sure if they're changing and this kind of goes to Hindi's question earlier. I think Crossing guards is one of those things they're taking out of the NYPD budget and putting it either into DOT traffic or maybe even the DOE budget. So I'm not even sure where that sits and who we're asking hey Sean, I think lowering it makes sense: okay, given the low demand and that issue yeah all right, cool and then and then we'll ratchet it back up when we need it again. Next year or the year after we talked about new Kirk Plaza and that we're going to ask DOT, MTA and EDC to all you know, take a look at this request, especially again a need for outdoor space. The issues that we're seeing on newcreek plaza- and many of you see this with your own two eyes- have just have just been exacerbated since Covid-19 I mean complaints about homeless populations, concerns about crime there and just sort of like just the general maintenance and sanitation. That's all been exacerbated since Covid-19, and these are the very issues that Tot DOT boasts that their plaza programs mitigate. So we'll maintain that and remember the mayor said that he would do this for us two years ago. Sean question on that. Why are we framing it as expand public programming? I it just seems like a. I do not know a strange articulation to me based on what we're asking for yeah me too. It must have been some language that was being bandied about last year, but I'll drop it and just say: expand public space for community use, yeah, something I think maybe expanding public programming was sort of the DOT, the plaza language. I feel like I copied that from somebody that does not yeah. This is duane, I'm sorry yeah! We were trying to see if somehow we could get D.O.T to designate it at a plaza. If I'm not mistaken, yeah, because there was confusion about you, know, there's always a confusion about who owns what space and who's responsible for what. So. I think that, if I remember correctly, that's what the language was from yeah- that's probably it but Steve the other thing and everybody this is for everybody. The other thing is that Hillel plaza, you know which we had, I confess, having some resistance toward, but now that Plaza is functioning their public programming at that Plaza now includes a safe street for restaurants, a homework hub. It's also been like a food distribution site. I've actually expressed concern that they're doubling up on so many activities that how are they doing all of these things and maintaining distancing? But if you know, there's that many programs in one closet sort of demonstrates that we would be able to program up another one before you move on one quick thing that I did not hear in the DHS, the department of homeless services and that's food pantry. Is that something that we're, including in the budgeting this year or not at this time we can, but that would not actually be a DHS request. I mean that went through a number of different agencies. I think it was a task force and OEM and DOE, but I will figure out how to how to aim it and request for food pantry. That's great Sean. Thank you very much. Oh no good point for department of buildings. I also want to request additional. What do you call it inspectors? You know as because we have more sites. Those sites are going. You know we have sites that were stalled and now going back online. We want to expedite those product projects so that they do not maintain construction sites. We also want to, as DOB should, because they're inspecting more to ensure that they're being Covid-19 compliant. I think the an increase in inspectors is not an outlandish request in that it should actually be pretty high up there, because I do consider it a sort of public health and safety issue DYCD. We were talking offline a little bit before we got started officially with Dwayne about you know, there's so many programs. We focus a lot on Syep because of our the youth conference, but there are a lot of programs. Dycd is just a funding agency. They do not provide any direct programming, they provide grants to our community based organizations, so we need the cbo's to go for the funding in order to want them to increase the funding, but we can do that and for sure this is a. This is a recovery item both when they say youth and community development. First of all, youth goes up to the early 20s and community development is all of us, so continued funding to expand and provide bridge funding for programs that had to stall during it was one of the sentences. I wanted to slip into what we already asked for anything on that, because I know this is a this board holds this near and dear so I'll pause. I it's Jonathan. I think that that's the best we could hope for right now. We really do not know what the lay of the land is going to be, and we do not know if there will be the ability to really predict what kind of job openings there might be for summer next year. So but at least, if we put it in there, hopefully enough boards do that, and the city won't forget about it and we'll keep the funding there. Should things really be in a good place for you know Syep next year so and I'm fine with that that addition that you want to make okay, that's great and they did talk a little bit at the budget consultation about you know about shifting into more remote programming. You know they were able to do that with even within budget constraints, because there were some. There were savings from things that were not happening, that you know. They then shifted over department of parks and recreation. We talked about this a little bit with capital, but in terms of what they do outside of parks. You know on our streets on our very tree- lined Leafy Big Branchy streets, where, when there are bad storms and trees topple over, they pull up entire sidewalks. The Department of parks and recreation has done a. I do not know if I should put the onus on them, I'm going to say they've done a terrible job, maintaining their contractors. I do not know if it's because of them or they're kind, there's something wrong where they've had so many contracting issues, I mean you might remember, the dog run got delayed because the contractor left and they had to rebit it out. The top lot got delayed because they had to rebid it out. They they said in the in the aftermath of the storm. This past fall. They had two contractors leave in the middle of picking up tree branches. We had sanitation, doing the works, you know their work, their job plus picking up tree branches where they could there's right now. No sidewalks contract does not exist. There is not one. So if your sidewalk erupts because of tree roots, you now can leave it like that indefinitely or you can have it fixed and then sue this not sue the city. Well, it is doing the city then file a claim with the comptroller's office. That's what parks is telling you to do that. They're, like just you know, fix it and sue us. So you know this is a huge problem and it's obviously you know it's obviously to me it's still tied into public safety, public health. So I want to keep this on the on the request, move it up from 11th and now sean if somebody trips over the broken side more because of the tree roots, who do they sue well as long as the homeowner has called it into 3-, 1- 1 and it's in the system is pending, then the city becomes responsible for it. Okay, thank you. The comptroller did a report about the. I think this was falling limbs. I think in the early days of Scott Stringer as comptroller, there was a falling limbs report I'll try to I'll try to find it and send it out to all of you and what it cost the city when tree branches fall down- and you know and then there's we've even had the tragedy of it costing people their lives. So there's that there's a I see a need as we're sending more people into the parks for longer periods of time. We also need an increase in the park enforcement patrol so that everything is not called the police call. The police call the police pep did a really good job. Trying mitigating a situation that we had over in the parade grounds this summer and I think for more support for an expansion of their personnel would be very useful and then finally, here's another thing that, like just blows my mind, Department of parks and recreation, has one exterminator for the borough of Brooklyn and did I mention rats, there's a lot of rats, so you know increasing that. Also, I think that's it. Contractors sidewalks pruning tree branch response, oh Tree, plantings, park enforcement personnel and exterminators, and I'm going to try to bunch that into not so many requests but get it all to parks. So can I jump in on contractors please? So regarding contractors who are full in the mwbe categories, they tend to be awarded on a bottom line bid. So if the task is not Prop, I mean there are repercussions if the job is not completed, they're not allowed to bid going forward or they're, not viewed with favor and likely to win the award, but nonetheless on a bottom line bid. There can be real and I think that's possibly why we're seeing some of these jobs that are scoped and awarded but abandoned midway, just as a point yeah. No, that that's good insight, but you know another thing that the public sector can do when it can't engage. The private sector is to fund the public sector. To do it. I mean forestry used to be its own unit and they did not. They did not used to vet that out. They used to just do it it's so that might be they might have to just rethink how it gets done and hire their own personnel, which is these are not the budget days for that, but but they certainly are not gaining efficiency right, which is, which is why we send things out to the private sector so fail, DSS and DHS. I thought I covered this up above, but it's still on my list. You know just additional supporting funding for mental health support both with the with the street outreach teams and, generally speaking, because we've all heard and perhaps know that social distancing and health, anxiety and school anxiety and working from home with people in your house, all together in a room anxiety, has certainly created mental health tensions and so support for our fellow man and fellow woman will may be maintained in our requests. I'm getting rid of a request for additional patrol cars for NYPD. They say they do not need them. They are up to par. We will add food pantry. We will do a lot to support senior services because Covid-19 this will. This will also be in ratcheted up on our list to be a higher priority. Senior services Covid-19 certainly underscored the difficulty in servicing isolated seniors. The whole point of a senior center is to offer seniors an opportunity to not be isolated and they were all shut down, continue to be shut down, outreach to homebound the senior center is pivoted to a food delivery program and they actually have a new RFP out. For that. I think we should support that and and support their their, even though they it's a volunteer program. It still takes some staff to run the volunteer visiting program for seniors and then sort of I was thinking along the same lines as we talked about with libraries. Is you know whether or not there could be some funding for seniors senior centers to begin to reimagine, whether or not they could be open, depending on the health crisis and depending on the vulnerability of the people they do serve whether there is a model which you could do sort of like a like? The schools are doing. You know some remote and some on- site service provision, but I but I'd like for us to talk a lot about seniors. We are in a our population, seems to have gone down since 2010 a little bit, but our the percentage of our population that our seniors over the age of 65 has actually increased from 9.8 in 2010 to 14.5 in 2018, and that ranks us 12 out of 59 community boards in the city which surprised me, and then here's also something to consider and be concerned about the poverty rate among seniors, who are 65 and over is 26.4 percent, so it's higher than our overall poverty rate and it ranks as 23rd overall, which I do not know, that's not as bad as I thought it would be. Okay, anybody want to say anything about seniors, we're thumbs up on seniors right, good, because I'm about to be one okay, fdny one thing fd Y asked us to support was an ex expansion or continuation of their detector installation. This is a program that that's funded through the next fiscal year because they had to stop it and this past. In the current fiscal year, so so they've got it moving forward, but they do not know that it will be renewed in the current budget situation, but since 70 of fatalities in residential fires are in homes, that did not have a detector. It's an extremely valuable program. I mean obviously on its face. So here comes the language again Steve Activation of city- owned sites. We talked it was in our previous budget request to activate the church in bedford location, which now, as we mentioned, HPD has announced with EDC and the council member that's going to turn into an affordable housing development. At one point, I'm told that we're considering a park, but it's going to be housing and then we'll try to get the East 15th street MTA site activated. That might not even be a budget request. That might just be a like a lease agreement that they have up by Kew gardens, and you know like up by East, 18Th Street and the Brighton line station at church, yeah and then sanitation. I have on my list next we're getting there everybody children's services. We I'm going to change the wording on that a little bit I mean. I think that the concerns the concerns there are really dire. The reported suspected abuse cases dropped by something like 50 during Covid-19 times, because there were no mandated reporters coming in contact with vulnerable children. Obviously there was no almost no school, so reports of suspected abuse by educators dropped 81 percent. So what acs says that they're concerned about? Is this sort of pent up demand and a concern that case load is going to increase in ways that they are? They need to be prepared for so we're going to make a request and bring it up higher than 19th for continued funding. To maintain, I forget what the numbers are. I should have wrote them down written them down on my notes. I'll have to go back through, but there was a case load mat a case load number that we'll ask them to maintain. This came from our consultation with them, so at their request and due to obvious need, so we already talked about Difta Newkirk, plaza, sanitation, EDC. You know we talked about their broadband, increasing broadband and their sean, since you mentioned that the percentage of seniors is going up. If that seems to be an ongoing trend, then maybe number 20, where you're asking for a new senior center might be moved up a little bit. Okay, well, yeah! I think I was. I was going to keep them together. What I was talking about with services and programs and new centers, I'm going to keep all of the difta requests more together. That's just sort of how I'm going to organize it differently, because this these lists are really funny. The way the city makes us do it we're we still maintain very stubbornly this habit of. When I put it into the district needs statement, I do not prioritize it. I just kind of make everything like I have several number ones. Our number one priority with police. Is this our number one priority with parks? Is that and our number one priority with aging? Is that because I think it's just not okay for the city to ask us whether we're going to prioritize police over senior citizens or children over housing- or I mean these are all intertwined things. Nothing is more important than the other. They all work. You know in tandem with one another, so so the way it's going. The way I hope to print it out next year is to keep all of the agencies together. So you know dif to Diff to Diftus School D-, O-, t-, d-, o-, t D- O- T, so it won't be as crazy. Next year sounds good to me. Okay, so it'll be a new type of mapping right, so you'll have arrows unpicking the snarls. I wanted to jump in mainly because when we were talking about the the MTA and their longer term capital with accessibility, their pro funding program that was approved for church Avenue Bq station on the back side of that lot on the cayton side, there's that exit has an opportunity there for a little bit of green spacing if they'll manage and oversee it, it's a fairly broad area that could be used. You know put some bushes in there and some you know allocate somebody go sweep it water, some plants and put them in pots, but it's a vacant area that could have to get somebody in the community to adopt it in, because MTA won't even shovel more than three feet away from the I mean really that's their that's their rule. They have a three- foot rule, so they only maintain things that are within three feet of their station house entrance the entrance not even the whole facility, but it's a good idea to bring to even to Kew gardens attention if they want to expand what they do over there or something like that or find a community group that wants to do it. So it's probably an oded holzieger's report. I just do not remember if that's a spot that he identified or not. Thank you yeah. Thank you. We're on the last two of things already written down, and we already talked about libraries so I'll you know skip on to canine waste. You know we'll keep trying. So that's all that was in ours from last year and the things that I'm adding are one thing I do not know if Dwayne is still here because he might have, he said he might have to leave early, but we were talking about you know this. Small business services has a workforce office and a business solution center and they do wmbe certification, and I think that we have not asked for this before, but in my consultation with them and then in a follow- up meeting I did with them that was organized by officer Michael Joseph in the 7- 0. They were talking a lot about these programs and they seem really critical to you know economic and job loss recovery. So I'd like to add that in this year and bring it up pretty high, then try to get yeah rats. So dpr we'll ask more for some exterminator funding for parks, exterminator funding for MTA so that they do more abatement along their tracks. They tend to do it only when we ask for it and report problems, and then I know they have a regular schedule, but more please fdny detector installs! Oh and for the Department of Health and mental hygiene, we'll add on a request for contact, tracing support and other data collection and prevention plans to address ongoing recovery and response to the Covid-19 pandemic. That's it! Thank you! Sean yeah yeah! I, if I think we could all give you a virtual standing ovation on that, you were fantastic. Thank you all board, members for being so active, being participating so well, there's a reason why board 14 is regarded among many as one of the more effective community boards in the city of New York, and it's because of you. So thank you. Everyone if there are if there is no additional business, let me just say to follow up. I will so I'm going to re- list these out, get them in order as discussed, and then I will provide it to the board in advance of our no November 9th public hearing, because the public hearing is when we bring this into the public to ratify and then send to the city, as is so that will be my to do to get back to you on all of this. Thank you, sean any additional comments or questions before we wrap it up yeah. So I have not seen yet the letter regarding the conditions under which the board suggested approval for the 1600 to 1620. Is there because I think their public hearing for the borough office immediately follows our meeting? Is not it a matter of days. I agreed to put the conditions into writing and remember. I want the board members to remember that this is a recommendation that you are all making to yourselves at our regular board meeting. So it's not you know it's not set in stone yet, and just so. You all know this that you know we continue to get petitions into the office so but yeah, so the conditions will be in writing. That will also be sent to the board prior to the November 9th meaning, because I think, because there's so many of them, it would only be fair that you all have a chance to take a look at them before you're voting on them at the meeting so and I'll be in touch with Richard Barrack, as we write them that it's not the borough hall. Won't find there will be no surprises for borough hall. I guess what I'm asking is. Would it be helpful to you if there are certain items that we brought forward that we spoke on, that we should submit to you for inclusion quickly? If there's anything, you want to email to make sure that I've got it you're welcome to do that, but we have the meeting recorded and anya captured the chat, and so I think I think we've got it, but if there's something you want to make sure of yes by all means feel free to send an email and remember that if somehow still it gets missed, there's an opportunity to add conditions at the regular meeting of the board before it's all ratified. Okay, anyone else, okay, a hearing, no one. I just want to mention that I'm going to put in for a salary increase for all the board members and and we're going to wrap up this meeting at 8:24 P.M on October 27th. Thank you all for participating thanks, everybody anything you forgot to mention tonight. Thank you good night, everyone, I'm good night. You.
