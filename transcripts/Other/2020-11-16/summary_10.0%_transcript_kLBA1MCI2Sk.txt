Medical transportation, quick question: Please have we have they received a lot of support from us in the past, for this particular one, If I'm, not mistaken Julie, is that every two years, three every three years, So I, know since I've been on the board.
Double park, all right, because I know that the Black Car Inc means that they're on the road constantly.
Once we get the notice that we have to go back, in-person meetings, you know we need to see how we can arrange something with your company to get a at least a member of your company into the at least the committee meetings, because, As a former member, Oh a new member.
Rob, I'm, sorry, Reverend, John, now I think he wanted to make a motion, but it's only him and Barbara that are actual members, so.
I, Let I agree with what Reverend John do because he was there, so it carries unanimously from what I see, but Julie you'll have to make yourself available for the next board meeting all right.
Everybody knows what the open restaurant is.
Right, that they're having the restaurants open on the sidewalks, the street.
Okay, so Millie's corner is the only one that I know that, because they have a bus, stop right in front of their main entrance.
Also, Those are the only two that I know that that reached out to me regarding the open, permits, but I just want to hear from the 41st precinct.
Unfortunately, like I, said that evening, When we went there by the time I got there, it was pouring rain.
You know why the committee can do whatever they need to do with that, all right that we can maybe reach out to SLA and try and give the sergeant a helping hand and getting them back down here to hit.
So I'm, just waiting to hear back from her chief of staff, because I know they told me that it is escalating all the way up to her, because I had to reach out to one of her liaison to Us Emily Vasquez.
I know that sergeant Guglielmo said he had conversations already with the owners of club.
I mean these guys are underneath that they're going to be open by like November, but from my understanding they presented their kid.
As far as that's concerned, but like I said, I mean I've reached out to even the SLA guys that night.
If need be, I will call Senator Sepulveda and ask him if he can set up a meeting for all of us, meaning Ralph myself, Reverend, John and Sergeant Guglielmo, and whoever else wants to be in it and see.
I, have no problem because as a restaurant, then it's a restaurant, but if they open it up as gentlemen's club, then I believe that the community and the community board needs to mobilize itself to our two state elected officials, to move on them to get SLA.
We do it that way, but we need to let the SLA fight know that we do not want a gentleman's club there if they want to open up as a restaurant.
I'm happy to hear from sergeant Googs that you know we got a couple of months.
They did put a lot of money into the place, but at the end of the day, it's still a gentleman's club and it attracts a certain clientele and Ralph and Bobby said it's near two schools, not one but two.
You know, I, Don't want to take money out of people's pockets, but it's near school.
You know, I, don't want to be involved with anything like that.
It's, just a matter of now when they open, because if all the new letters are going to state everything that happened from last year because they've been closed since then, I'll definitely follow up with Bialji and Virgos and Congressman Torres.
Yes, I would like to say that at this point this case is beyond the the franchise committee, So it has to be taken by the full executive vote because it is an upfront on the on the community board too, all right.
What, and so Cola is saying that there's no permits allowed so I just want to make sure everyone's on board with that, because we always support the precinct.
I would love to support their event, but I feel like giving them a sound permit for them to have an event on Simpson Street between 163 and Fox. It's, going to give out the wrong information that we're picking who to give permits to, and that's the problem that we had with the Halloween Day parade, also because if we would have pushed it as an issue, would have put you guys into a catch 22 of why them and not us, you know, and.
You, know, I, Ralph I, don't I personally as much as I like Casita, Maria.
I, know, listen, I'm supporting and whatever the 41 41st person wants to do with this.
I know from where the community Board stand and with everything that's going on.
And in this climate, like the May I, Don't know if you guys read the paper today, but the mayor basically stated that the ball drop on new year's eve is going to be virtual.
I mean they're, already saying the ball drop, which is you know, December, 31st and right.
You know, that's why we were going to pull back to school.
You know I, It's not fair to other people in this community that want to do the same.
And, we're telling, and that means they have to close down the street anyway, if they were to get the sound for me, and you know I'm against that.
You know, I drove there like two days, ago.
Yeah, you're right, Ralph won't be sleeping anymore, but I, don't know if I'm sleeping or going or whatever, if you're still on the air.
I mean it's just you know, I feel.
