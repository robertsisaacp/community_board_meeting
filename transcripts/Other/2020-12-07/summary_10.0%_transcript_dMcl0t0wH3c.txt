If you guys know that place, which is a very good restaurant I, used to go there a lot, but it's been closed.
So Ian and I had been talking for a while doing a project together and so like called him up and asked him if he wanted to open a restaurant.
When we looked at it, looked like a really nice way to break up the space, so you could have people come in with their families and go into the back dining area, and you can still have the bar seating up front and have two separate areas for people and then because it is so big with the 1200 square.
So, and we just worked that into the plan, because we do plan on applying for one when it does become available, I think they had one for 22 seats or something like that, but it seems like the whole sidewalk cafe thing and open streets and whatnot is like changing as we speak.
I, don't know you can correct me, but I think they actually.
Well, there's going to be a lot of construction where, when you're I think it was for outdoor space, because it was right when the construction was about to start.
Okay, all right, Any other questions from the committee I think looks like everyone's muted.
If they did want to have an outdoor seating, They would have to come back right and go through the process all over again, so they would be notified prior to that meeting happening.
Oh, like there are going to be restaurants that have outdoor seating in February and enclosed you're.
If we do go with the sidewalk cafe how the sidewalk cafe would be set up, which is 22 seats, but we don't have any plans right now to go into the street with one of those enclosed areas.
And I just want to make sure that we're hearing from the community, if it's represented, I, think ty is watching that all right, If any of the attendees.
If any of the attendees, want to comment, You know I think we have to have a motion on the table.
So, if any of the three attendees want to comment or ask a question directly to the applicant or to the committee, either use the raise your hand, function, okay or put in the comments section that you wanna comment.
Is your bar program going to be since we're a licensing, You know, committee, choose your coverage, I mean it'll, be pretty traditional.
It opened so very cognizant of working with neighbors and making sure that everybody is happy and that we're not stepping on anyone's toes, We definitely don't want to have a rowdy loud.
And I worked really closely with the first Street Block Association, because East village, they had a lot of concerns about noise and crowds, and things like that.
Else, I also thought the open streets were ending on fifth avenue.
So, how that affects sidewalk cafes, how that's going to affect different streets, Okay, I think so nothing else from the community.
All right just so I know when we like log on who who's supposed to be here.
