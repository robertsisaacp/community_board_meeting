It looks like we're 13, but Mike just got here so we're up Quorum. Now members hi, Mike, hello, hey, okay! Well, then, if we're at quorum and it's 6:37, then I think we should start I, don't want to take everybody's time. I think you know we have one applicant and we should respect everyone's time, and so we should start I'm Rachel Freeman, I'm the chair of the permits and licenses committee, and we do only have one applicant I, don't I! Actually, I didn't even look. If we had the minutes from the last meeting to be honest, I don't think we do so I think we'll just jump into the applicant's presentation and I think. Is it Ryan or Ian, which one of you both of us I? Guess: okay, have at it go ahead! Oh presentation, so yeah just tell us a little bit about your, so we so the we're putting a restaurant in the in 285 Nevins. It used to be freaks mill if you guys know that place, which is a very good restaurant I used to go there a lot, but it's been closed. It was closed for about a year in August, I, think and I had looked into the space back in January and it wasn't available and then and June. It became available again so Ian and I had been talking for a while doing a project together and so like called him up and asked him if he wanted to open a restaurant. So that's how that started and we're in the process of doing it. Now, turning over the space, there's, not you know too much. That needs to be done with it, structurally, it's more like cosmetic and making it something new and making it something fresh and we're like. Let's say halfway there now, we've been working on it for solidly for about two months now: October and November, and we're just getting it ready to prepare food and serve people and all that stuff. I think the idea for this space is we're really looking to sorry. I got a little bit of all right here, so we're looking to do a neighborhood establishment so that the place is fairly large. It's about 1200 square feet upstairs and it's divided almost into two rooms. So while you could see through the entire space up front, is the bar area that has mostly seats for two and then in the back are where the larger tables are and where the kitchen is. So when we looked at it, looked like a really nice way to break up the space, so you could have people come in with their families and go into the back dining area, and you can still have the bar seating up front and have two separate areas for people and then because it is so big with the 1200 square feet. It really lends itself to a neighborhood restaurant, which I think in that area. You have some smaller places up on third and then you have like the larger scenic kind of places like Pig Beach, but it seems like there isn't too much of a larger place, moderately priced, which would be a good neighborhood restaurant. So that's really kind of the space that we're hoping to fill with it. I did look through the application and everything looked pretty straightforward to me. There was some mention of the sidewalk cafe, but apparently you can't apply for that. At present, no, not yet they had a sidewalk cafe before they had a license for it of the old owners. So, and we just worked that into the plan, because we do plan on applying for one when it does become available, I think they had one for 22 seats or something like that, but it seems like the whole sidewalk cafe thing and open streets and whatnot is like changing as we speak. So when that becomes available, we'll apply for it, but we're not currently applying for it at the moment. I think ty I, don't know you can correct me, but I think they actually we they did come to us for something and then I don't think it actually materialized, because I think they closed before that happened. They came for some kind of they came again and I. Don't remember what it was for. Yeah I, don't recall specifically, but I do think. I have a yeah like a vague recollection of them right and I thought it was it might have been for, because I remember, we were saying to them. Well, there's going to be a lot of construction where, when you're I think it was for outdoor space, because it was right when the construction was about to start- and we said, are you sure that you want to do that, whereas it looks like you're going to be mostly enclosed for the at least what your? What you've, the pictures that you've shown show and now those are current pictures. Those are is that what it looks like now, or is that no that that's pretty what's on there now is when we took over the space. Okay I mean structurally, it's the same. It's more core! That's changed! Okay, but like even is basically the same. The floor plan that you have shows the only real change that there is, which is an extension on the bar of maybe like four seats, but other than that it's going to be basically the same setup as the restaurant. That was there previously. Okay, all right, any other questions from the committee I think looks like everyone's muted there's, no better, for you am I, correct to say: there's no backyard usage, there's no backyard in this right! There's no backyard is owned by the same landlords, but they use it as like a I. Don't know: they've got cars back there and also Turkey yeah, and you and in the store, is the restaurant front, the corner property, the coin yeah, the corner property, okay right on the corner and second street yep. Now you said that the previous owner had a sidewalk cafe permit or they did not I thought he did. But did you ever see tables outside? No, not when I went I mainly went at night. I went for Brunch a couple times, but it was in cooler, weather, so I never personally saw tables outside no I was only asking because it looks like Nevis is kind of I. Don't know if it's enough room to have I think we were I, think it was in process. I think that they I think they applied I think they came to us for something and then I think they closed. So there was something that was happening and then it just didn't yeah because they might have applied for like to be on the Sackett side. I think that's what their plan was. The side is very large and it's really kind of like, even though the front is on Nevins and the entrance is kind of right at the corner, I mean the focal point is really that second, that expands, how it's packaged. Oh so in the chat, someone say that one of the panelists one of the saying that she lives opposite and there was never an outdoor seating area, so it never it just never came about yeah I think it was going to I. Definitely remember seeing something and I don't have the file that they from when that happened, but, okay, but just to let the person who's on the planet, who's on the zoom call. No. If they did want to have an outdoor seating, they would have to come back right and go through the process all over again, so they would be notified prior to that meeting happening right. Well, Leroy. We all have sidewalk seating. Now all right I mean everybody else. I, certainly don't have you know. I have seating in my parking spaces out front right now. I'm sure they'll be able to have the same so agree. When are you anticipating, opening we're thinking, hopefully sometime in February, okay, oh yeah, so you definitely will have outdoor CD, maybe February like coved outdoor seating, you mean well, no, you could have it outdoors and close it oh, like there are going to be restaurants that have outdoor seating in February and enclosed you're. Talking about the special yeah they're going to extend it right now. Yes, okay, because our governor is planning on shutting down indoor dining next week. He said to it could be tomorrow. So right, so that's its own thing, that's outside of Purview Rebecca. Did you want to see you unmuted at the same time? Did you want to see something? Oh yeah, do you have any proposed plans for how you want to make that outdoor covered seating? Look if you're having heaters anything like that? No, we haven't actually thought about the seating yet not too much. Well, we yeah! We don't! We have. You have plans on the floor plan. There's plans if we do go with the sidewalk cafe how the sidewalk cafe would be set up, which is 22 seats, but we don't have any plans right now to go into the street with one of those enclosed areas, if so as far as heaters- and everything goes right now- we're not seeing that as part of what we're going for, because we're probably not gonna, be going into outdoor seating until the spring. So right now, that's really not something that we anticipate doing so. Whatever goes out there, when we do a sidewalk cafe would be a traditional sidewalk cafe with chairs and tables and not a big enclosure, or anything like that. I will happily make a motion, but there are three attendees and I just want to make sure that we're hearing from the community, if it's represented right I, think ty is watching that all right, if any of the attendees. If any of the attendees want to comment, you know I think we have to have a motion on the table. First right, Rachel or no, the community is allowed to speak if they yeah before we would do emotions. So if any of the three attendees want to comment or ask a question directly to the applicant or to the committee, either use the raise your hand, function, okay or put in the comments section that you wanna comment so yeah, one of them that's saying she's concerned about noise. She sent in a question where's the question: oh yeah, we do have that in the email. Give me one second, okay! In the meantime, let's talk about noise. I think there was some mention of open doors or windows and just background it's actually. There were previously french doors that opened up on both sides of the restaurant, we're actually in the process of removing those this week and we're putting in just windows that can't open. So there won't be any physical way to open up the inside of the restaurant to the outside, except for the front door. So any noise inside of the restaurant, which will be normal restaurant level noise, will be kept inside without any leakage out onto the side. Ian hi, I'm Mike I own, a bar on porch street. You certainly want cross breeze right now for Covid-19. If you're going to open in February you're going to want to cross breeze, even if it's a kitchen door and a front door, we have two doors: there's one on the side of the building, one at the front, so they'll both be able to be open, but there's no, but the actual doors that they were there before they opened to the street. They weren't I can't tell if they weren't installed right, but there there's a lot of like space and they're not insulated properly, so they don't actually on the side of the building yeah on the side. Building on the front they actually they lock, but they don't actually close properly, which is not great for the health department because outside creatures can get in. So we decided to get rid of them and insulate it and do that with the doors cool I have a question about your bar program. What is your bar program going to be since we're a licensing? You know, committee, choose your coverage, I mean it'll, be pretty traditional I mean it's a restaurant, so it's going to be. You know a few cocktails full bar wine here. Our hopefully, our gm that we're looking at is a guy that I used to work with and he's been training as it's only a so. Hopefully the wine program would want to keep it approachable, not too expensive. You know a lot of bottles 50 and under the neighborhood, and just like kind of a casual kind of power program. Okay, I see the concern is that after the so the your hours are that the you're close at 11. and the concern is where you're located that while people are waiting well for the transportation, that there'll be noise, and can you put some kind of notice to be kind to your neighbors? Okay, we can definitely do that. We can also regulate it ourselves. You know just ask people to but definitely put a sign up. You know please be respectful to our neighbors. You know. Apparently this was a problem in the past. I can't say this I don't know. Yeah I just want to ask about the outdoor seating I imagine most of it is going to be along Sackett Street. What is what do you think you're going to do? I know you're going to have to come back, but if most of your seating is on second street, that may allay the concern of the resident, who probably lives across the street on Nevids across from right across from Sackett right across from where the seating would it's going to be 22 seats only so it won't be too many seats directly across the street as a but I. Don't think, there's a ton of residential directly across from where the outdoor seating would be. But it would be I'm sorry that was my dog. It would only be 22 seats and it wouldn't run all night, so I mean usually about an hour before closing time around 10 o'clock or something is when the last seats would go out there, so even on the weekends where we may be open until midnight or something like that, we won't be seating outside until midnight. We definitely want to maintain good relations with the neighbors Ryan actually has a restaurant on Atlantic Avenue. That's been there for what seven years now yeah seven years, Ryan yeah, and before that we both worked at buttermilk channel over on court street. Since it opened so very cognizant of working with neighbors and making sure that everybody is happy and that we're not stepping on anyone's toes, we definitely don't want to have a rowdy loud restaurant. We just want to have a nice gathering place for people. You guys literally answered my next question because that was gonna be my next question was what is your background and you know where do you have any? You know history with working in these in this kind of industry, yeah we've and we've been in that neighborhood for a while, like I, have I own french Louie on Atlantic in Smith and, like Ian said I was the opening executive chef at buttermilk. Channel Ian was my opening chef to cuisine. He was also my opening chef to Cuisine at French Louis, so we've done a few projects together, and this is just another step in that direction. So the restaurant is going to share that tone that neighborhood restaurant, like buttermilk channel like French Louie, it's not going to be a loud, crazy place. You know a neighborhood spot that embraces the neighborhood and hopefully the neighborhood kind of embraces us. Oh I also I was the executive chef of a restaurant in the east village on first street I didn't own it, but I was the only person there. Most of the time the owner was never actually present and I worked really closely with the first Street Block Association, because East village, they had a lot of concerns about noise and crowds, and things like that so with the first street, Block Association I had a very good relationship with them and they actually ended up becoming regular customers but listened to their concerns and we had a regular dialogue. So it wasn't just the community board meeting. Since there was a block association. It was an ongoing dialogue between the restaurant and between the residents to make sure that everybody was in a happy place. So a lot of experience with working with neighbors and you know for I, know: I, don't know how many people are actually listening right now, but for any residents and neighbors that are there. We would like to keep that dialogue too. So if there's anybody who wants to stop in and talk to us directly at any time, please the door is always open to you and do you have a proposed name yet? Yes, okay, the name's gonna be Victor. Okay, I saw that on the other thing, I wasn't sure if that was from something else or not: okay, Glenn! Yes, if there's nothing further, I don't see any problem here. Wait. Let me just check the chat. I saw something pop up. Someone said one of the person who was concerned about the noise said: she's, that's great I used to live at Run, Rockwell and know Laura from then and have dined at both your restaurants. So now some important information right and then another huge fan of buttermilk, Channel and French Louis, so excited about the prospect of bringing your new restaurant to Gowanus, so good feedback, so I think the community is behind you now. So without further ado, my motion is to approve the application as presented. Okay, do we have a second I'll? Second, I'm sorry Mike I, you might you, okay, I, missed I, wasn't looking okay seconded by Mike any discussion on the motion? Okay, hearing, none I! Guess all in favor, if you, if you're, not in favor, put it in the chat. Okay, hearing, none the any abstentions, put that in the chat. Okay and the motion passes. Congratulations! Thank you. Thanks everybody nice to meet you all nice to meet you looking forward to it, see everybody in person one day, yep grab a beer yeah right! Okay! Thank you all right! Thanks! Everybody, okay, you've, gotta! Congratulations in the test! Perfect! All right! I! Don't think that we have any other business as far as I know so. I think oh yeah I just wanted to say that mend wasn't able to have anyone here to focus on liquor, lights and stuff tonight. So I'm not sure if that's going to happen in the future just depends on scheduling, but that's why this is the only thing on our agenda tonight. Had we discussed the possibility of hearing from? Was it the nightlife agency, or that is oh, the? Oh, do you mean the mayor's office of Nightlife yeah Mike has a pretty good relationship with their office as far as I know, I, don't I feel like he has had a conversation with them. Let me find out, and I can act on that Glenn yeah I thought there was some mention that might be part of our agenda in the near future. I think you're, right, I, just don't know off-hand right. That would that could be nice anything else from anyone. Shop, local everybody here go buy something from a local shop. Local everybody here go come from a local shop. Can I ask a question? Yes, of course, yep. Yes, can I ask a question: yes go ahead. Yes, please go ahead. Have we had any problems from any of our bar owners concerning the changes that have occurred with the governor's directives on the spike in the clover 19. Pauline I can tell you we haven't heard from any of our owners. I can tell you we haven't heard from anybody. Does that answer your question Pauline? Does that answer your question? Pauline? Yes, it does I'm curious because there are so many problems concerning the cold weather with people on especially fifth avenue with some days they can open some days. They can't open on their makeshift installations in the street, and the question is when the weather gets worse. Are those installations going to be a permanent fixture on Fifth Avenue and how will we have snow removal because I know they attempted it and it was a very difficult position with so many different sizes in those construction, especially on Fifth Avenue. I'm pretty sure that falls outside of our I can tell you they really haven't made a decision on how that's going to actually work right. They were saying that they were going to ask the restaurant tours to keep their areas clean, but that has not been official yet so officially they haven't made a decision on how snow is going to be removed. I think everybody's, praying and hoping. We don't have a lot of snow this year. To be quite honest with you, sorry Pauline, I, muted, you just because the echo seems to be coming from you, I'm gonna unmute you. If you want to just add anything else, I also thought the open streets were ending on fifth avenue. On December 19th, the open streets were ending on fifth avenue on December 19th. It made it perfect. It's ended in on Vanderbilt Avenue, but I don't think it's ended on Fifth Avenue. Well, listen to everybody they're in conversations right now to extend everything. It was supposed to end in November, then December and now they're in conversations to extend it indefinitely so right now, everything's up in the air they're taking this day by day week by week. So you know something could be said today and then next week it changes or and I know. Some of you. Restaurant owners know that it changes from week to week. So unfortunately, that's the way things are right now and I do know. There are certain restaurant groups that have approached the city to make this in a year-round thing so and they're in conversations about that as well. So how that affects sidewalk cafes, how that's going to affect different streets? No one really knows they're, taking this day by day. So unfortunately, there's really no answer to you. No definitive answer to your question Pauline other than they're in conversations, and we just have to wait and see right, just don't make yourself an autonomous zone, then you'll be, and then you won't have the Scapo come down upon you right twice. Okay, I think so nothing else from the community either right, I, think I can't check, but I think we heard from our new members last month. Right wait. It would be members for just Tai. If you can I know we have Michaela and Rebecca is that are those the only two new members that we have I think so yeah there might be one more I'm sorry. The list on the website isn't up to date and I'm right Mike's working on getting me an updated one right now. So, okay, all right just so I know when we like log on who who's supposed to be here. Let me in all right, okay! Well, do you have a motion to adjourn Glenn's waving his hand, I think! That's it all right! Thank you thanks. Everyone have a good night have a good night. Thank you see you on Wednesday yep.
