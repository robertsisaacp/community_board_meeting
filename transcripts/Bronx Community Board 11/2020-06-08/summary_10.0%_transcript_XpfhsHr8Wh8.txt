Does everybody remember that or have any comments about that Yeah right, basically we're talking about playgrounds more than the park itself, and it had to do with capital improvement in the East Chester projects, in other words, I, think they've they're in the process of trying to accumulate some money to redo that playground in basketball court and basically, what they wanted to know was what are the options and what they could put in there?
My you know other neighbors that seniors that need help with different things, so that was taking me away from the Parks Department project, but the same token, that's why I wanted to make sure that we get a meeting in so I can get the strategies from everybody how we're going to move forward, and if we can I can pick up, someone in the car I can eat.
Have some personal issues too, where you know walking distances might create a problem for me right and the best thing is I mean if we get a parts department, vehicle, everybody's gotten alerts or something thunderstorm.
That's a great point, so you know, perhaps the committee can decide when we'd like to do that and not to put us on the spot, but I know she has a good working relationship with the park Bronx park.
I met with her a week and a half ago, oh okay, because I had been trying they're considered essential personnel, so they do have to go in at some point telling me that husband was yelling at her because she's one of the few people that's actually going into the office.
The suppliers would have an to take this around wreath for one I'm sure she's not gonna, having a problem with two, and you know what I'm saying so we have no first of all, nobody, we never have those full nine people at the meeting.
I understand it, but when I'm saying is, if you have eight people mmm, okay, those vans are big enough to put four people in each one of them to have them socially distant from one another, because they think they're like three or four rows of seats number one outside of the driver's seat, so I mean you put four people on one four people in the other.
I mean it seems like because if the van holds a dozen people put four or five people in there shouldn't be a big deal coordinating on a certain day in time and then we're gonna go to I, guess: East Chester Gardens is the name of the park right.
You know we're supposed to open up New York, City phase, two I think on Monday right so phase, one I'm, sorry phase.
So yes, I, think that you know we can see what kind of luck we get my virus see where she's at see how receptive she is right now in response to environment that we're in and then we'll take it from there we'll get that ball rolling.
Go you know any day anytime, but I mean some people might have to go back to work and stuff like that.
Try and solicit from don't say: you know if my compliment would be just obviously we want to go during the light hours right and maybe when it's too hot in the day, so maybe either a morning or you know like a later afternoon, all depends and then maybe honor you know maybe on Saturday I think might be best.
I know the parks has done a pretty good job with you know, trying to mitigate as many trees as possible, but on the Technical, Working Group monthly meetings that we have.
I know it's a tremendous endeavor, not saying we'd want to spend a hundred thousand dollars to try to save that tree.
I, don't think it's a good use of taxpayer money, but I just want everybody to realize that you know again, it's it has to it has to come down, and you know that area there's been a lot of work right.
You can't find out, he does business with the city, you know what I'm saying I mean I, don't know what these people get, but I mean if you got it rolled five hundred or something like that, if he says he's gonna, do it on the arm, just as a sign of good faith.
Can we see if they're even going to be willing to change it, because if you remember, we had this whole conversation a few meetings ago surrounding loreto parque and the way that the way that the redesign of the park was and how somebody on our committee I forget what was pointed out, the bass that, when people are hitting the baseballs, are gonna, go into oncoming traffic and is there anybody that seems that and they were like?
It wasn't only to the actual committee itself and I mean that's what the people wanted know that we're gonna waste all that space, because just didn't get into office.
The parks committee came up with an idea because of this tree, everybody doesn't wanted to come down if they were to hire a you know a civil engineer to review, and you know he saw he saw a possibility with DD C consider another opinion.
Remember so let me just so I know we did a site visit you and me Joe and George Dolch and other people, and my recollection of it was so parks that basically they left it up to us if we want to save the tree or not, and that was at the time that was the decision.
Do you want us to try to save this one decision now and I was like yes do you can to save that tree I, don't recall what kind of restitution they were offering at all yeah I mean they.
Right, who knows one I, don't I, don't I, know I mean Durant, call you or George mulch we just the last time we spoke and George and I have communicated yes about it, but Joanna hasn't spoken with me directly about it.
So Dom's, I guess gonna get the ball rolling on iris she'll, send an email out to Joanna and see if we even have a shot at this okay, but let me know whether you can get her or not all right, yeah keep trying all right so now moving forward.
I need I, need a break every now and then I, don't know you mean if I second, that so you have the list of participants on the right here.
The idea of surveying parks and I think it's a great idea and I just wanted to ask a question.
How are you going about sort of you know, making those suggestions or evaluating those things well under the impression that it's the East Chester housing, the area over there by East, Chester houses and Pat Charles, will eventually go to the people over there show them what is available to put in and I guess we would ask for their input as to what they would want to put there.
Yes, okay, so in this space, that's available the basketball court to be refurbished and what else you're gonna put in with the basketball court well more than likely be left up to the residents of East Chester, you know housing.
Do we actually had to say of what we would like, because when Jimmy funded ours we had no say in anything they, but then what they wanted to put in my question, I mean I.
I mean I happen to agree with the fact that the community should have to say what they want in their area, because they know very well what they can utilize and what they can't so I'm just agreement.
It is yesterday, I, know I just want to interject and say that when I was going around taking the pictures, some of the people of the neighborhood that happen to be utilizing stuff, it was saying they would.
Okay, so then real wait until so then, but I'm just saying: I want to make sure to be just get off this phone and the meeting.
