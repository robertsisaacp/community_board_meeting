It is 6:00 as June 20 29 2020 is 403 p.m. this is a meeting of the community development budget priorities committee of community or 11 in the Bronx, so again, Andrea Siegel, the chair of the committee, could not be with us today, but we do have a quorum. We do have Daisy, Rodriguez and Lisa Soto, so I don't know. If either of you would want to take over the meeting, we're gonna jointly run the meeting yep. Neither one of us is vice-chair no co-chair co-chair. Whatever terminology is so. This meeting is essentially being convened at the request of the board to discuss some concerns about the NYPD budget. So we are essentially going to turn the floor over to anybody who wishes to voice their concerns and we'll go ahead and make note of them and forward them forward any concerns to the appropriate parties and if they see, is there anything you want to add to that Jeremy. We just send you our notes and then you can forward it to the appropriate individuals to have you at City Hall. Then we will afford you our notes in the novel send those to the appropriate folks at City Hall. Yes, of course great. So so that being said, you are, you know, opening it opening it to the public right now. Anybody has any concerns that they want to address. Regarding the NYPD budget hi everyone, this is Natalie, so I have called this meeting, because I felt back at the. You know that the demands that are being made right now by organizations dedicated to correcting the systemic injustice issues that are happening to black Americans right now, I wanted to show our support. I mean my support. I know that CB 11, it's very NYPD friendly, as is evident by the priorities listed on on our budget priorities from the city, and so I just wanted to make it clear that you know that I wasn't disagreement and that we would give an opportunity to other people to also speak to the issue, as this has come to the forefront within the past month, and you know, there's other other issues in our district, such as you know, the lack of quality schools, especially for middle schools and high schools, when we have 25% of our population being less than 18 years of age. That I think that we can say that we want those to be our priorities. You know, I would like those to be our priorities and not necessarily asking for more patrol for more policemen to be part of our community and so I. Just you know, I just wanted to bring this up and and and let my my thoughts on the issues be heard. This is David Levitt I'd like to lend my voice as well, and also make notes of the protests that are ongoing and the students at at City Hall and near the municipal building, where people are protesting in favor of cutting the NYPD budget and reallocating funds so that everything is not considered to be a criminal matter. The people need help. There are social workers or other guidance that people might need when there's response that that that the city is looking at these issues more to how to help people rather than to just put them in jail, which is not working, Natalie and David. Think oh I'm, sorry go ahead, III know so. Daisy, Lisa and I had a cut talked earlier today and another was talked about where exactly our budget priorities so I pasted the link for FY 2020 2021 of the 20 20 or 20 we should be. We should be going into FY 2022. So you know what I was gonna paste: the link for FY 2020, but that's most likely outdated. So let me go back. While you keep conversing, let me find 2021 I mean I, apologize, Natalie and David. Thank you. So much for your comments and Natalie for bringing up this conversation, I think, although we s we, we may have wish to share a good working relationship with NYPD and in this specific district. That does not mean that we do have issues I, think it's unfortunate that we didn't have this conversation earlier in the month when these things started coming up. I think these conversations should be on going beyond just today and I want to lend my support that we we continue those conversations, whether that is with this committee or as a community organization as a community board. We should be having these discussions with the nonprofit's that are in our areas and really trying to get a sense of what's really happening and where the failures are, because we do see a lot of the successes, but we really need to talk about the failures as well. So please know that I would love to work with you guys to see how we can do that going forward. Low okay, Creek yeah I am with all the crime, that's going on I'm kind of nervous about taking funding away from the police, while recognizing that there's a lot of inequities in our district, whereas a lot of like you mentioning the schools, absolutely nothing to do for the the youth, the youth that needs to have help, but taking money away from the police. When there is such high crime now I'm hesitant about that, there must be other places. They could take money to give us what we need. I may say something here: I mean one thing that I think that it's not necessary, and it's actually one of the things that it's on our budget priorities is adding more officers to our schools. Our schools don't need officers, our school needs guidance, counselor's our school needs classrooms. It's like one of the line in our budget is: let's ask for more police officers to what was it for the mobile classrooms or whatever they're called the trailer classrooms where we should be asking is for those not to exist for schools not to be overcrowded, and our students not to be in this temporary setups that that that is definitely an opportunity where the NYPD budget doesn't need to be increased right and where those funds would be allocated to two places where we would be. We foster our youth and we are investing in in what makes our youth thrive and our communities better, and not necessarily policing these these situations where they they don't need to be well. I am a guidance. Counselor I worked in the city, schools for 25 years and guidance counselors have a million of them, that's great, but there it goes only goes so far. It only goes so far and the police that are in the schools are safety officers and they special training, they're, really not policemen per se and having actual policemen and their their safety officers who are experienced with the schools and they're part of mi PD, but they're safety officers and sometimes, unfortunately, guidance counselor, isn't nothing. I am one. You know it has been enough because sometimes there's no calming down sometimes is violence and, speaking to a kid who's violent right now you know the guidance counselor yeah. You could do that, but I'm telling you I've what I've seen you need some type of authority there that can help. This is something this is Chris hi, guys it's about the police in school. This is my experience being at the board and often being called about the kids being rowdy and in heaven fights right outside Columbus high school that now it has four high schools within which is crazy. I, don't know that system light works, but, among other things, my sister she's, a math teacher over there, and only last year about five or six times they had lock downs or semi downs. I'm talking about kids that have come in with guns inside the school, with knives with screwdrivers, there have been people that have been almost killed. Don't forget, high school accepts also students that have come out of the Rikers Island. Therefore they probably have been info for for violence or for whatever. So take it easy and take it slowly about not having any any police officers in in schools. Of course, a small little kid ain't gonna do nothing, but don't forget also slowly, the kid brought a gun once upon a time it was along in the news Chris in my school that I worked in an elementary school kid brought in a butcher knife, because he was angry about something and he was planning to stay I'm, one of the other kids. Fortunately, one of the other kids saw it and we were able to get the safety officer involved. The car degree had a single burger. He was over seven every hero, but he had a butcher knife right think about plow high school students that some of them were left back. Some of them are already 19 or 20, but already our computer dogs in gangs and gangs, and also media I've, had the experience that I have gone to leaving high school a long time ago to split between appealing death or beaming, guys and bloods, because it happens that the aliens are wearing red and black due to the flag, and the other gangs for the blast is OK within our collars and besides started and I've been over there smoother. This is just my experience so to take this to bear the police officers out of the schools- it's very early- god forbid. God forbid something about robbing. Somebody comes with a garland, there's gonna, be somebody. That's gonna start it in certain way. Otherwise, believe me, but I'll have bloodbath. I mean that's how this conversation is going with the whole define the police movement. There are systemic issues that these communities are facing, and this is the result of that and I think it's trying to look look at how funding streams or how areas in the city are being provided, support or lack of support in order to try to look at a child holistically, for example, I, don't think just adding more police officers is an answer and I think that's what this conversation is about. I think correct me. If I'm wrong, though, isn't a conversation about getting rid of your officers, not adding right, I. Think you're right that these pointed wrong point is that our community, our priority, that's correct priorities deciding for additional officers- and you know becoming- was made that you know that maybe we shouldn't be pull. You know pulling these officers from schools but, as they see stated, I think what is being highlighted here is that these are systemic issues right and it's a matter of priorities right and if the priority is given to giving more officers and policing this kid, these kids are just looking at what the overall issues are that may be going at home that are requesting. You know by putting these kids in the position where their education is not the first priority, that's what we should be looking at. That's those are the systems that we should be putting in place to be able to make our communities better, not necessarily put the money into the officers. It's what I'm trying to say: yeah, okay, I'm, sorry, you're right, you start off by talking about our budget priorities. What's basically getting rid of that request from our budget, which, which is can easily be done, I mean I. How is that done? Jeremy did we vote on this, so we should historically, though, it's only it before Andrea, who is Silvio and me sitting down and doing this well. Dr. Patel was chair at some point and to anybody who wants to make suggestions, recommendations, I can I'll talk to Andrea about this. Is the proposal? I? Don't I, don't see it's not. It should be a big deal and the second I'm, not a member of the committee but I- do have some experience, that the board is run and and and so I'd like to make a recommendation that if this is a formal committee meeting of the budget priorities committee, then perhaps a motion could be made. That would lead to a committee vote, maybe not today, but over a period of time. That would also lead to a full board vote so that these issues can be brought forward and people can take a stand and be counted, and so that people can be accountable for the positions that they take good. That was a recommendation to the to the committee yeah and then, maybe also maybe after the meeting we could schedule scheduled meeting to go over them in detail yeah. This committee I've only I, joined this committee in this year, so in September, I guess fiscal year, I joined in September and honestly didn't really have a full understanding of how this committee work, I kind of still don't from from the from the little bit that I have experience so far is that this committee is required to attend I think there are three budget hearings with the city that take place during the hours of 9:00 to 5:00 and or so yeah I was not able to attend and neither was Daisy able to attend any of those meetings and that's it. This committee has not had a meeting so night of Daisy I really have been understanding what took place at these hearings or how they did it was created, which I think is a concern and I'm glad this came up because I think part of part of this. What we should be recommending and proposing is that there that there is some transparency to this process, because a document being created between the two people, the chair of a committee and the community board manager and submitted to the city as priorities. On behalf of the entire community board, does it really make a lot of sense? Yeah share them with the board. Just so you're aware we have three other attendees. It looks like two members of the public and then one board member fraeno is asking if he can speak and then I think we should also give time for the other attendees, not just Fran Oh, to speak to that's, okay, I! Think! That's! Fine! Okay! Do you agree? Yeah, that's fine! I! Just don't want to lose the conversation regarding the transparency of how budget decisions are made. There needs to be a better leadership, efficacy and how we can get people to really participate in that conversation because I know, that's been a real struggle for the past couple of years and trying to get members to be a part of that yeah and maybe Natalie, wants me to Al about joining the committee and yeah, but I think another committee meeting would be great. Let me let me unmute Fran, oh also on mentioning the potential of maybe having mandatory leadership, participate in this particular committee because of the delicacy and the urgency of the subject matter. So that could be further discussed or bylaws I'm, not sure, but I feel like this committee in particular, should have a mandatory member of either the chair or the vice-chair like I. Think it's a critical, it's a critical. It's a critical committee that I feel like is not taking is not given this serious attention that it deserves. Okay, ma'am, you Fran, okay, now yeah hi I tried to join, but I was having issues so I joined a little later, so I might have missed something in between, but I'm trying to understand. When we talk about deep funding the police department. In what way are we defunding? Are we defining specific programs or what we intend to defund? Because let me tell you something, as we know and I think I heard, Joanne Rubino say: crime has already sorry to spike on the wrong direction and unfortunately, people have been shot plus other things. So if that's intent, I'm letting you know I will vote against a defunding of a police department. If we taken away funds for the security of the whole community of New, York City, not just community board 11. Thank you for a know. What we're speaking to who I we haven't really gotten into nor do I think I. Think that kind of goes a little bit beyond our scope, but of this committee. I did you know it's definitely a conversation that can and should be had, but in terms of like overall, the funding of the police department. But in terms of like what we're talking about in this committee, we're talking specifically about what we're recommending as a community board and what our community board priorities are and how we can look at those and see where it might make sense to to perhaps not allocate funding towards these four different things for and the one instance that we instance that we are speaking to that not only raised is one of the priorities that requests more police officers in schools and and that perhaps that request either should be amended or or removed. I mean that's: that's the discussion point that we're on that we're on at this moment. I can really not that specific budget priority request just bear with me. Can I address something called join Rubino, since she really is involved with the education part, so for something I'm, sorry, but Joanne you've been involved. You've been involved in the educational system for quite a bit of a number of years. Here. How do you think the parents will react to any movement of taken or the security that these kids have when go to school? If we lower the number of cups they're, not really cops, they really say safety officers, correct yeah, the parents feel. Has there been anything communicated with the parents we jumping or are we assuming? We should really feel about the parents who have kids in school. I know my kids are adults. Sorry I feel for the parents that everyday worried about the kids and going to school not coming home and forget about their life, but let's say that coming home healthy. Well, if a parent, if a child gets injured, all I know is if a child get injured. As a result of another child becoming violent, and we don't have the right stuff in place- and it's not just social work, there has to be control. - there has to be. You know. The safety officers have a great role. They have a great role and they're gentle. You know it's. Sometimes they have there they're there because they have authority, and sometimes it comes a situation. Sometimes just regular educational staff is not enough. I'm telling you from almost 30 years of experience in the public and private schools, I wasn't trying to pick you age up. Why do you think I was just that's? Okay, it's no secret, I'm and I appreciate. Thank you. Can everybody see my screen? Yes yeah? So you can see. This is an expense request. Item number six assign additional school safety officers. All schools at portable classrooms need additional school safety officers I think. Originally, there was a concern with because everybody from earth portable classrooms. Yes, yes, is any not is anybody not okay, so and I? Think the concern was the safety of the children moving in and out to the school yard for the between the the portables I. Don't know if that's still a concern, I think you know one of the things that should be done with this is speaking to like principals and other school people at schools. Well, yeah what I I see in both PS 97 and PS 108 they're getting rid of the portables because they're building these giant you know building, we don't know if it's okay to wait or if it's just gonna handle the rest of K through five but I, don't think they'll be portables and at least those two schools ya know the idea the goal is to get rid of those yeah suggests we should have involved with BPA's from different schools. Donnelly is 183 all yet. The parent has the PTAs presidents of PTAs, and then parents come now B. This one comes with his budget so come here. Maybe the educational committee should be involved, then I agree so Daisy or Lisa. Do you want to turn any answer questions over to the other member? So that? Well one other. You know there are two other members of the public. Oh you hear me to them too. Of course. Okay, so I'm gonna start with Amy hi Amy me hi. Is there anything you'd like to say to the committee? So I am actually a teacher in district 11 I work at the 144 campus on Gunter and I've, been teaching for about 12 years, so I'm doing in teaching and listening to you guys, I think that there's a lot of different things that need to be kind of addressed. One is I think that there needs to be a lot of clarification in general about what defunding the police means. I think that that phrase has really kind of taken off and has a very negative connotation. No one is saying stripped them of everything. It's that right now, New York, City education is facing tremendous budget cuts and we spend the most per pupil in this country and yet we're only 22nd in terms of our state's or so. We have all of this money that we're losing that's already not enough because of the cost of educating and living in New York. So I think. There's definitely some clarification with that in terms of the school safety offers. The officer is no disrespect to anyone, but those officers are not well trained. They don't deescalate most situations and in recent years they've had to be pulled back because there have been so many like allegations against them. So the school safety officers at my building have made it very clear that they will no longer touch children, because so, if a child is truly really violent, they will not do anything about it. They don't de-escalate situations because they're not counselors and social workers very often you're right. Their authority will get a younger child to back down, but for a high schooler they're, not necessarily the whole point about children being bringing in guns sort of searching students at every entrance. Once that play is in motion, you're not gonna, stop a child who wants to pull a gun and engage in that activity and engage in that type of you know. Massacre the conversation you're bringing up sounds like the school resource officers that suburban schools have, who respectfully have been super ineffective in stopping any type of school shootings. There's not been very many that have been prevented by a school Safety Officer, so I don't understand how we think that our safety officers, who don't have weapons and who are not trained police officers, are going to stop something like that. If school resource officers elsewhere, do that one of the things I think I do think it's very very valid that we should engage parents in these conversations because they, their voices are generally not heard enough. But I, don't think that we've acknowledged that we as a district, the executive superintendent of the Bronx, is from district 11 and I. Think that she's the voice that you should most listen to. In this conversation from an education perspective and knowing her very well because she's very engaged with our school before she became the super executive superintendent, she is all about equity and access for our students and I. Don't think she would agree at all that more officers are gonna help. This situation, New York, is getting rid of the single Shepherds program, which is going to take away guidance counselors at every level of the schools. So a lot of the issues that we're discussing that become issues for our older students, especially if they had the social and emotional. Like help me, they were younger, probably one escalate to these type of things. So I just think that we need to kind of be more strategic. Why are we waiting till it becomes a student bringing a gun to school? Let's help that child not get to that place and to do that we need counselors and we need more social workers in a school because, again, once a child brings a gun to school, there's no stopping adolescent every child is searched. I understand the point of the portable schools are further out and they they might need different types of supervision. Then something needs to be done for that on top of the fact that they just need to go away because kids are being taught in trailers, but that's a whole separate funding issue. So I just think that, like we really kind of need to be more strategic in the conversation we're having because a lot of it is just it's, it's not well informed and I really do it's really upsetting to hear that you want to bring more officers into our school. It's like we shouldn't have more officers than we have paraprofessionals. That just seems silly to me like that, is so contradictory to why I became an educator and it's just I, don't know it's very frustrating, but I digress. I want to say is that a lot of what's happened? I 110 percent agree what not happening, but I. Think one of the things that we're not addressing is crime is increasing partially, because people are tired of the way that the system has failed black and brown people, so I think if we can and I'm not saying that young people who shoot at each other for no reason other than the fact that they're angry with each other are the same thing as like what's happening now. Violence is violence is violence, but so much of the uptick in violence right now is because of what's happening in this country, we're going through a worldwide pandemic. It is unprecedented. People are protesting and being ignored and it is unprecedented. The police officers are still responding with force and that's who they're protesting. It is like a perfect storm of all of these things happening and I. Don't see how we think putting a band-aid on a bullet wound, which is what we've been trying to do for years with the police force, is going to help that at all, when we're still not fixing the fundamental problem of these people. Why are there so many young black and brown men on the street at night, because they don't have jobs because they can't get them because they didn't graduate from high school because somewhere along the line, this hasn't failed them. So if we can keep them from going to write coming back out to our schools, maybe we wouldn't have that issue in the long run. Sorry I've spoken for a very long time so unless somebody wants to appreciate I appreciate everything that you're saying and breaking it down and as a member of the public, this is exactly what this type of forum is for. We need to hear more from people in the public having this kind of different perspective, because it is informative to what we should be doing and what we should be asking for. So thank you, I mean just keep going through the next. We have two more people in the public. Just keep going Daisy Oh. Can you hear me yeah I, think that's fine I got Rafaela alone. That's out! Oh, can you hear us Rafael hi, we'll try coming back to maybe so I will go to Jeanette. I can't read her last name you're. Not, though, what can you hear me yeah? So you can hear him? Yes, I mainly just joined on actually community board. Eleven is my mother's district and mother lives on Wallace between Burke and AD avenues. I was mainly joining just to hear about. You know the the police, the NYPD budget, sorry I, apologize, I, joined late, so I didn't hear you know the specifics about what's happening with the budget or the for the community board. Eleven, so I'll, just mute myself and I'll keep listening, but I do plan on joining more of these meetings, and hopefully when it was an in-person meeting, hopefully later on this year, I can be there in person. I wouldn't count on that one. But thank you so I I can try going back to Raphael, but I'm not sure that's working to do should I go, give a an overview again of budget priorities and what those are, what those main that help be helpful for anyone actually yeah I, think a lot of budget items or can you easily sort the budget items that have to do with NYPD I can't easily sort, but I can so I can I can just start explaining. So the community board, as most people know, is an advisory board. It has little to no authority, but we do the best we can, and so in terms of the budget we make requests. We make recommendations, there are two types of budget requests there, a capital request and their expense request. Capital requests are when you get into the up rain upper ranges of millions of dollars. After exactly I forget exactly what the threshold is to differentiate the -, whereas expense tends to be more personnel items like you can see here. Item 6 additional school safety officers. I can tell you what so you know. So, even though we definitely you know the the budget priorities chair, whoever that is whether it's been Andrea dr., sell or Silvio. We definitely you know that it goes up and down in terms of trying to get. We do try to get participation from the general board. It would be nice. You get a member of each committee to provide some type of input. I can tell you, though, that I think our budget priority requests are way too many. So you can see here, expense. We have nine expense requests which even that's a lot I think we should focus on a handful and really work on those hard and I can tell you, even though nine is still seemingly a lot. It's much less than what largely what Andrea I did last year was just kind of cut. It out, cut the priorities out the ones that so probably prior budget priorities. Chair wanted to make a left turn lane on Tom Parkway that we got rid of that time. Hey Jeremy, yeah, I'm, sorry, I appreciate breaking it all down, because but I just want to be cognizant of everyone's time and I just want to focus on what nypd's raised so yeah. So this is. This looks like the document that you guys might have provided to the planning committee right. There's another document that the planning committee has made public like the New York City, Planning Board right and in that one they have it broken down whatever there there I think they call it community profile outlook along those line and in one of their pages right like there are statements, I, don't know where they get those statements from where it's like it says. These are the priorities from the board right in in the statement from be x11 and I'll not say you can put the document up on page wait, not page for section for just page eight, it says the three most pressing issues facing this Community Board are, and the first issue listed is police community relations, and that's one of the reasons why it was a red flag to me right and so that you know I just wanted to point that out that I don't know how this document is created, but I do think it's something that we need to. You know that I would like some clarity on for for the future right, as we continue to have these conversations, yeah yeah, so so a lot of our a lot of our profile is empty compared to other boards, because I just don't have the interest from board members. So there's definitely changes that can be made. So you can look, you can see the screen still right. Item number two. So this is this is this is a lot of these requests are from god knows how long ten years ago, because I've been dissing manager going on ten years ten years longer. This is this is many ways just the continuation of what's been there. So this is a document. That's created every year, it's just so it is recreated. It is recreated every year and, like he said, largely what Andrea and I did last year was just cut stuff out that we just that nobody liked. For example, there was something about school, on Tuesday, increased school lunches for kids, mayor's officer. He took care of it and it's like me, I think it's like providing breakfast or something something the mayor's office did say: okay! Well, this doesn't mean to be a priority anymore right. So, instead of creating a fresh document every year, we should work with this. You take last year's document and then you either cut it down or amend it morning. Yeah, that's what we do every year so like like, if, like so councilmember, Joe and I, is no longer in office. Let's reach out to the councilmember, see if they're supportive to change it to their name, yeah it. This is what we should play with. What's here, we should get rid of stuff like that. I recommend we knock it down to maybe five per capital v, / expense that may sound extreme, but you to get any of these to happen. We had Pelham Parkway the reconstruction of Pelham Parkway, which is happening now. It's been a it's been a request from the board, since at least the 80s approximately. So you know it's it's. It's probably a much larger task in minutes. So again, I just want to focus on what what other priorities so we're looking at one right right. This is the school just full safety officer, one dead, number two, so school safety you want to take notes was number six, an expense. So you can see here the tracking codes at the very end of it says II, that's the that tells you it's an expense. It would say see if it was capital and lobster again there's a difference in you know: expenses not as much money as see number two is just some police officers for the four nine, no expense with NYPD from what I can tell and again I can tell you I have an inkling why some of these were relevant, maybe yeah and I think that this was yeah. This is number six was pertaining just of portables number. Two I can tell you the flake. Nine precinct doesn't tend to be staffed, as well as some of the other precincts. It's considered a vacation spot in some ways right or wrong and I her tree. That is necessarily so that's. That's probably the reason for that. One of the reasons I mean I can tell you many members of report. They've always yeah they've, always felt this way from what I'm reading here from what I'm reading here it says the explanation. The desire for additional uniformed officers is for creating public events for children such as sports and video game tournaments, as well as creating expanding the bike patrol unit yeah. These efforts continue and expands. So this was so originally originally I. Don't know what the original language was for the assigning officers, but this video game tournament stuff happened when we had officer Walton as the commander of the Ford nine precinct. So that's I, don't remember how long ago is that maybe 2015, maybe I, could look if it really matters so I know for a fact. City budget is gonna, be either adopted today or tomorrow tonight or tomorrow early, you think, they're voting on tomorrow. They might they're voting tomorrow. They might have in handshake tonight yeah, so even with whatever we come back with decisions already being made. That's one to this document needs a complete rental and there needs to be more participation by board members on this particular committee, because this back and forth and not being clear, this can't keep going on and this documents available online as you can see right, but there's a lot of stuff, that's available online. If it's not proactively, bought before board members, particularly committee chairs, you may have items on here that are related to their committee. It doesn't, it doesn't serve us any good, it being it just hanging out online I'm, going to tell you what some board members are gonna say board members. They have been part of this committee like hey, we send this stuff out, we don't get a response or any feedback, so I I understand do not happen this year. Whatever happens in the past, we clearly have a lot of new board members that want to participate in the process. This is definitely one of them fun by all means. I recommend you reschedule another meeting to go over these things in detail so another you wanna do that today or if you want to do it after today, but something I mean because the point there's nothing. We can do right now right about what is being submitted for this year. What we can definitely overhaul the process in which this document is created for next year. So perhaps we should either assign I, don't know what makes most sense either assign this committee to to meet again to really talk about the entire process or have some type of like ad hoc committee or task force to rehaul this process. Data I'm, looking for your input here like is this something that would have to be bought into the bylaws or is it something that we can just vote on? It's not something that really needs bylaw changes. In my opinion, the the this. This kind of work is one of the original functions of community boards. That goes back at least 15 years, and it's it's enshrined in city charter, about the the responsibilities of community boards to put together these priorities and I've been on the board for thirty years and and back in the day we used to hold hearings on these issues and we used to vote on the final, a submission to the city, and it was a lengthy process as that began in the fall boys. We would there would be meetings that would be held, September, October November, and then there would be a vote and it would go to the city. So, like you said it, it is a process and there's no reason not to start it over the summer. I agree, I think that I would be willing and these down, if you'd be willing to kind of like, since you don't have a process right now like let's just develop our process of how we want to do this, something similar along the lines of what David is saying and that into that we have it kind of just. You know, hammered out and ready to go in September. This is you know. This is the new process for community and budget priorities going forward for the year I? Don't if you have to have the entire board vote on that process or whatever the next step is, but I would be willing to work during the summer to to just get this process going to develop a process so just to clarify there is a process with or without us, in terms of that, Lisa and days and I discussed briefly earlier in terms of and I think Lisa brought up briefly during this meeting, so so the board- and this isn't kind of what Dave is referring to you- the board used to meet at night. This is when they would actually meet with this at night, depending upon the agency with various agencies. Well, there's PD DLT. They basically refuse to do that anymore. It's done in group session with all 12 boards and stirring the day that doesn't stop us from meeting individually with the borough commissioner of VOT, Navarre Lopez or the captain, the 4/9 precinct. Any of those I can tell you, when agency its proactive about reaching to a hook to us and has reached out to me recently I. Just don't remember what we're looking at in terms of dates, but I can definitely inform. We send a Z, I, think I'm, pretty sure, I'm, pretty positive, informed me Andrea about the parks committee to the Parks Department they reached out to us, but we can reach out. We should have individual meetings with heads of agencies and then whether you can attend the group one it's another story, but that yeah one I all have to get back to you on dates for that probably September, well, I'm also I'm I'm envisioning, and this is just my opinion. Obviously Dave and Andrea, as members of the committee would have to weigh in but I'm envisioning like this should be something that not a discussion that not only takes place between our committee and agency heads but also takes place with the chairs of each committee within community board 11 and when that's probably gonna require this. Probably it's probably going to require maybe having to their own discussions and I know. You know we're having our own discussions of different things that that we're interested in and we want to see, moving forward, be put as a priority. Thank you that I think that's where kind of our connection is getting a little bit lost and that's what I mean when I want to refine our process and how this document is created by gathering input from all the different committees, because there you know, while talking to the agencies, are good it. You know we're also community board. We have committees for a reason and they're working on different projects that, as a member of the budget priorities committee, I may not be aware of I, don't know what education is working on and what what they might want to include right. So I think the loop needs to be closed in involving everybody and in a process to get this document in better in better shape. I really don't want to find ourselves having this topic of conversation, which is which is really important to the community to be had less than a couple of hours before budget adoption. Exactly like this should not be happening, but remembers. A lot of the onus is going to be on on you, I mean it's gonna require you reaching out individually to board members, because and that's why we were mentioning earlier, you know. Maybe this is something where we need leadership to also be taking part in those meetings. So do you want me to go up to Capitol for NYPD, see if there's anything up there so I looked, we looked at the two NYPD expense items: there's police officers, more community type events, and then I mean this is not NYPD, this parks thing and then school safety I think that's the only two I saw. Do you want me to go up through Capitol? These are expensive. If you can, if you find something quickly, yes, but I'm, interested in knowing what what Natalie might be thinking now and her thoughts on this yeah I'll scroll up, she wants to talk, maybe well. First, like I, want to say thank you to actually having the meeting like you said it sucks that we've having it today and you know, June 10, which would been the the perfect time to really have and be a little bit more productive about it, but nonetheless, I still think this was a productive conversation, move forward and pushing the community board to be. You know more experiment and that's a new member I mean this was my first year and so sort of I'm learning on the fly. I, don't know what didn't fully understand, what the procedures were and and how things work and I think you know going forward this. This will make it a better process in in terms of really being you know, some people say we don't have. It doesn't really matter what we think and I disagree with that. You know they take mine and take our opinions in in how they create the budget, but I think that we need to be active and proactive in whatever documents are being put out right, because this document, that is on the web right now saying this, is what CB 11 stands for. You know: I have an issue as a CB 11 bore member, with this document being out when I had no no say on it at all, and so I guess. You know I think I, think what you, ladies, are proposing moving forward, I think makes sense to me in terms of stop machine this process for the fall in which not only should we involve I think in another sense. We also need to think about how do we engage the public right, and so yes, we should engage ourselves and and all of our community members, but I also think that at some point we should give an opportunity for the public to have a say and be able to voice their thoughts as well glad you mention that so I think one we were able to hopefully pursue with the motion to develop a process for the budget, but also to Amy's point from the public about bringing in other voices like the superintendent I'm really interested in trying to pursue that kind of an outcome as well. So maybe in the fall we can set something up where we can. You know, with more time and more on planning that we could get more versed, voices to come in and and really talk about this holistically as well, so I scroll through capital, there's nothing for NYPD, specific, okay! Well, thanks for doing that, Jeremy all right! So we're coming up on five o'clock, so I think we should wrap this meeting with two two motions and I think the first motion I'll pass or the motion that the budget and priorities committee work over the summer to develop a process or for recalling this budget priorities document to involve not only committee member committee committee heads, but also the public and agency heads so Lisa, who is voting on this, the committee? So if Lisa and Daisy okay, so please that makes a motion it does Daisy. Second, it is he yeah here I. Second, it okay open for discussion. All in favor, aye sections are objections. This is why we need more members on the committee. Yeah and yeah I mean look, Natalie should consider talking to Al and joining I mean that's that's the real way this stuff gets done, that we include that a member of leadership either the chair or vice chair, the required- be a member of this committee I. Second, that I'm not discussing the motion because I'm, not a member of the committee but I, did want to let you know that the chair of the board is ex officio member of every committee of the board, which they can attend your meetings and but they can't vote. So you should just keep okay. So maybe what do you think? Shall we make it a requirement that the vice chair be part of meeting then David come on? That would require bylaw change when it well, not necessarily I mean you could you could it's? You could Al could appoint the the first vice chair to in order to satisfy the the the committee's motion, but then again there's an issue of whether or not the motion would have to go up to the full board to be adopted. The fool the the chair of the board has the has the authority to appoint anybody to two committees. So one way to do it is to just ask out, or or or like David said, he's ex officio, and you just want him in there for his input. He doesn't have to be an official member of the I mean he can't vote be a member of the committee anyway. Well it's a lord option. Whoever I mean you just want their input right. You don't necessarily need them on the committee right I think it would be helpful to have the leadership yeah I agree. I think they need to be I. Think somebody on leadership needs to take an active role. Exactly we have Fran Oh Fran is on the executive board done so you wanted somebody actually a member of the committee. Okay, correct! Well, if, if he were a member of the committee, would that satisfy? Or would you still want another officer? It's anybody from leadership. Yes, let's be clear, there's a difference between leadership and there's a difference between the executive board, but you mean the executive board right, I'm, fine, with the executive board, Lisa yeah I! Think that's fine, so, okay, so I'll rephrase I'll rephrase my motion that we read the motion. The motion should be that the chair shall appoint a member of the executive committee to be a working active member of the budget and priorities committee- hey Daisy, you second, that okay, so you're both in favor right! Oh, you know all right, so any their business or business new business motion, but I really want to propose that the community bowl board hold a town hall. This coming September to continue this conversation as well yeah. We we are required to have a public hearing at some source, so I mean we did have on so I. Don't think you really need to make a motion for that. Okay, up to you, I mean you're. The key thing is, as a member of the committee, you just help make sure it happens. That's all sounds good, great, great, there's any other business before the board. I will make a motion to adjourn I, guess I'm. Second, in that to meetings any at 5:03 p.m. thank you everybody for attending. Thank you, Amy and the other member of the public they left. Thank you. I'm. Shutting down the meeting.
