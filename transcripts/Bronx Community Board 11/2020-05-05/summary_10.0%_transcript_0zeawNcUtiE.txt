So maybe we can do a 30 minute moment of silence, joe all right, I'd like to ask everybody if we could please have a 30-second moment of silence for our fallen first responders and those that are dealing with the with the covid 19 pandemic.
Okay, so anybody any board members have questions that and start, let's start with the computer people and then I'll mute everybody else.
Unfortunately again, unless somebody has a better idea, I don't know a better way, so I'm used to phone people again.
I mean I'm you to everybody for those of you using a computer, please mute yourself or I'll just start going through and start muting everybody who's using a computer as well right all right again, I'm going to share the agenda again, try to okay, so we have, I believe we have dr salcedo.
Yes from the union community health center she's, the director of wellness and health promotion there and she's going to talk about health care fears, social determinants of health and behavioral health and questions are for board members.
Getting them engaged as much as we can through social media, our website and through our providers, because it is a lot going on and we know that our patients are suffering either suffering from griefs and deaths from family members and friends, and we are promoting our health behavior services to our community, and we know that our patients and our communities suffering from social determinants of health that we all know that health is just not only about you, know: health care and medicine.
We've come up with resources that you guys have all shared with us available for the community and we're having our doctors talk about these things to our patients, because these are the things that our patients are really talking about, that they don't have participant, has joined the meeting 30 seconds doctor 30 seconds perfect.
That you know is all the bronx that we want to make sure that our vulnerable population is really still stays at home.
Yes, unfortunately, testing has not been expanded as they said, there are more testing sites, as you know, opening up in the city, but the new york city department of health really has limited us in terms of testings for our patients.
Probably everybody's, also wondering about antibody testings, which means that you know have you been exposed.
So we really want to know how good these tests are they covered before we start promoting it to our community, so we're actively trying to figure all this information out as we speak, and are you getting any word on how fast they will start opening up the test to the public in general?
Oh somebody, I'm sorry, jeremy, honestly, oh al had a question al doctor: are they using any of those experimental drugs like the hybrid or other drugs that are being touted as being helpful in this situation?
Right now, as you heard, maybe on the news yesterday revamp smear, the antiviral by gilead he's showing it's still everything still in the works, we're trying to figure out if we're trying to figure out participant has left the meeting this these drugs are working and really what's also important is that we want to tell our patients.
We know that the hospital emergency numbers are low, so we want to make sure we tell our the community itself that all doctors are still here, we're doing telemedicine telephonic.
I know everybody's really scared to, but we want to make sure that our community is not suffering from their chronic diseases and worsening their diabetes and hypertension suffering from strokes and heart attacks at home.
Sorry I had to mute everybody if there's somebody, if there's a boy calling us a cell phone, that has a question: can you maybe dr sausado can hang out now in the fortnite just for a little bit longer text message me: chris call us my phone number.
I just want everyone to know that, although my office is physically closed, we are taking phone calls, we're taking messages, emails, we're working, I'm out there every day, helping and assisting in any which way I can for those of you that don't have my phone number, it's 718, 931, 1721 I'll, put it up on the chat as well as my email to stay in touch with you just wanted to give all of you a quick update and first, I think we should acknowledge, or I should acknowledge, the sacrifices of our first responders health care workers and all of our essential workers that are on the front line.
I don't know how we can say thank you, but when we get through this, we'll have to think of a special way that we can show our appreciation to each and every one of those that won the front line for us.
We have some great supermarkets out there that have taken some extraordinary precautions by putting up glass shields and supplying all of the ppe that is needed to their employees, but I think it would be a priority to have those workers tested so that we know they're safe to be serving us, and it's for the protection of those employees as well.
But what was more upsetting to add insult to injury is when I found out that only one percent of those loans made it to the borough of the bronx, so we're going to be coming together as a delegation to make sure that this administration and the city recognizes the importance and the needs and the assessments that have to be made in the borough of the bronx.
66 of that very limited funding went to manhattan and only one percent made its way to the bronx is disgusting, unexcusable and unforgivable, and I know that some of you that are on this chat group with us are small business owners.
I know that pharah's for my office is on as well, and she has I'm sure some updates to share with you we're doing food giveaways, we're doing limited giveaways of ppe and hand sanitizer the why the need is so wide and so great, but I'm out there and the only thing that I can share with each and every one of you is I'm available.
I want to thank the community board for what you're doing and for the trying times that we all have together we're gonna get out of we're in this together and we're gonna get out of it together.
You know, edit, you bring up a great point and you know typically when we think of the landlord center relationship, and we want to make sure that our tenants are not forced out into the street, not evicted for non-payment rent due to these unique circumstances that will be on their control, that we should have safety nets in place for them.
I would be more willing to understand and work with it, but when the banks everybody's in a moratorium, what you should all be aware is: nobody can be brought to housing court right now and be evicted for the next 90 days in the states stepped in the city.
You know everybody talks about what they're doing is wrong, and yet I don't see a consolidated effort by our elected officials to stop this coronavirus says: hit the bronx harder than any other borough per capita.
The delegation on the city council for the brother bronx is coming together to push back, and I know that we're working with our elected officials up in albany also to make sure that we get what we're entitled to we're, not asking for anything more than a fair share.
We had a delegation meeting with our electeds in washington as a city council, and we broke up our agenda based on your needs and the assessments of the borough we're coming together and it's you're right, city, state and federal must work together.
So I was just because badass is mostly made up in two and three family homes, so I was just wondering if there was any relief on that front berna that I put together a change.org petition asking for the suspension of real estate taxes, water and sewer charges that are coming up also in july, their quarterly as well and for our small businesses, sales, tax and income tax.
You know to help give everyone the opportunity to kind of figure out this new world that we're going to be in to assess what we can do and that would have given us the cash flexibility thus far.
I want you all to know that if you don't pay your real estate taxes, it's 18 interest, compounded, if you don't pay your water and sewer it's 18 interest, compounded, that money adds up quickly, you'll be out of your home and technically it's a default of your mortgage.
So we're trying to figure all this out now at the city council, working with our colleagues in albany on how to come up with a creative way to make sure that especially our small property owners.
Yes yeah, I just want to interrupt just a quick interruption and there's so many resources for tenants and, as we know, for small property owners like I have attended also and just one tenant.
So I think the bronx needs to balance that out, because it's just not all about tenants and there are some good landlords in air just like myself and other ones.
If I outline all the places I've seen do it, you know you know what is if you guys come across something please let us know, because I definitely want to take a look at that, because it's not right for everybody and we will definitely look into this.
I'm just let everybody on the call know, I'm praying for you guys your families to everyone to stay safe.
Just with that being said, and as you know, I don't have to you know just re, you know regurgitate the issues, but we know everybody's in a different situation and you know there's some people out there that are having a very difficult time coping and you spoke a little bit a while ago about you know.
I mean it's locked down, you know it's like being in a social estate, it's very scary, you know, and if people are starting to think that you know that way.
You know when we say we're gonna, close down parks, you know open, you know we're gonna, close down roadways and make them walkable paths like why just not open up a park you enforce it so there's quite a bit going on the city council now is also looking at opening up some of the larger parks understating that social distancing and making sure that we do testing and to make certain that if we see the numbers increase on the spread that we automatically start phasing and shutting down again, so it's going to be it's new.
No one can answer that question, we're hopeful that they will be, but could you imagine that in september, if our schools are closed for what period of time and what that means to all about families out there and the quality of education that our children are getting, I mean we've got real issues here, 100 right and absolutely health and safety are first and foremost, but the next thing right, obviously, is our income and how we keep the economy going and how we keep our families and how we keep our kids even in school right.
It's tremendous cuts are going to be made and we have to be more mindful of how we spend money and I've been pushing us in good times that we needed reserves and we shouldn't be spending money like we're drunk and sailors.
The question is this: basically, you answer it, but I just wanted to know already.
It's going to require city, state and federal to come together to assess the needs and make sure that we don't cut services that are important, but also make sure that we spend every dollar as if it was our own money and that's how we should be looking at this budget.
We can have a longer conversation about it if you'd like, but I you know, but it's it was something that I couldn't vote for on issues of just generally speaking on cover 19.
You can get all the information from caitlyn, but this is going to be so that we can we're going to have different folks talk about some of the issues that are facing, people that are employed right now and some of the solutions that are being proposed, as well as some assistance, and hopefully the state will get its act together.
We all know we have all heard about the fact that there just was no way that they could handle as much new influx as they've got of people that are unemployed, so we're working with the state to kind of get them to do it more quickly, but we're gonna have that on may 5th, which weirdly enough is next week just this time, I'm not sure how for the rest of you, it flows, but for me time just flows.
We want to make sure that we provide the service, so we have to get that fixed and we got it fixed and we are also working to expand testing capability.
Most of these sites are driving only and we want to make sure that we can provide some for folks who do not have access to a car and so are working to expand testing capacity.
If we do not have broad-based testing any reopening that we do whatever we call, it is not really going to prove possible if we can't do contact tracing, which means testing individuals testing very widely, not just people who have symptoms, not just people who are potentially hospitalized, but everyone hopefully, and then figure out who they have been in contact with, which is what places like taiwan and south korea did.
So we got to make sure that we do it right and so on testing we want to expand testing capacity and in places like the bronx, we definitely to make sure that we do that before we before we come back.
It is one of the things that- and we had this conversation in person before I know that there's many members in the there's many folks in the in the community board that disagree with me on this, and I you know I will respectfully continue the stance that I had when I spoke in front of you.
Okay, so just a reminder that if the principal elected is in the meeting like the center here council member joe and I and I believe, there's family member fernandez is here we're not going to hear from the reps.
We want to make sure that we, yes, that we, like.
That's the that's my the question, I'm saying is because it's from major corporations, I work for a major corporation and I feel sometimes they don't want to even make this type of decision, for whatever reason be, profit gonna be whatever, but you know in a situation like that, you know it's best, that your employees are healthy before they even come back to work.
Not that I know of I think that, but it's, but you know what I do know that the senior centers in my district have tried to really keep in contact with the folks who they serve on a regular basis to make sure that they can provide food if necessary that they can provide some other services, so I'll, actually I'll actually check in with them.
I had thought about, for example, the tablets that we're getting to the children in schools right to make sure that, particularly for those folks who do not have computers at home, so there's a way for them to do long, distance learning, but I had not necessarily considered it for seniors.
The first thing I wanted to just bring up because we were talking about antibody testing- is that I work for two of the major healthcare corporations here in in new york, so we started to do antibody testing in a couple of sites across the city.
I know a lot of people are concerned that they want this test to be available, and I just want to put it out there that we're working on it.
A lot of researches is being conducted, and just like you mentioned before, we are actively taking information, of course from other countries overseas, but because we don't know the the immunity of the people that may have already contracted covid and if you can get reinfected or not.
This is something that we are just still conducting as part of research before we have it open and available to the public and then the second thing I wanted to also ask you if you knew a little bit more about this, like fmla that's happening, so there are people and who are essential.
So we have this high turnaround time because we may have people who are essential healthcare workers who are working with covet to treat the patients and we need to be able to allow people to be home if they have covet not continue to spread it while trying to save lives of other people that also have code.
So do you have any information or any updates as to giving people a longer leave to be able to be home if you actually have covert instead of asking people well, you may have covet, but you don't have symptoms come to work.
My question is you know that there's a lot of people that are out of work right now and we do have a moratorium on eviction cases, but my clients are really concerned because they don't know what's going to happen once the moratorium is lifted and everything kind of gets back to flowing yeah.
I just want to make sure what the things that we should be setting up for, but as soon as the 90 days are over, I can completely evict somebody because they haven't paid the rent for three months like these are conversations already.
So I want to make sure that we get back to legislating so that we can have a thoughtful conversation with the governor and with the assembly about how to do something about canceling, rent and doing it in a way that helps tenants who currently do not have the ability and no or will they have the ability in three months to pay for their for their three months, because if they can't pay today, they're not gonna be able to pay three months in a month and a half, because that's ultimately with the 90 days, is going to be up in about 45 days.
I can't ask a small business owner pay for this, even though I know you got no revenue, I don't care like we have to be thoughtful about it, so I agree with you, but if we do, but if we don't, if we don't act aggressively the impact that that's going to have on the entire on the entire endeavor, I mean we're having issues with homelessness right now imagine in six months, if we do not, if we do not proactively deal with the fact that people are not going to be able to pay their rent because they haven't had income for two months, how are we going to be?
We could have a longer conversation about that, but the last point I wanted to make was that we'll get through this together because we're resilient bastards, the bronx is a brazilian group of folk, but let's make sure that as we get through it, we at the other end do not go back to the way things were because then this is gonna happen again.
Thank you for allowing me to be with you I'll remain for a little bit longer, but I know caitlin is going to be here for the rest of the way.
Any concern ask request whatever that we're getting we're really trying to address it immediately and right away, and I could say it's been busier, like the phones and emails and everything are buzzing, but that makes me happy because at least the community knows that you know help can be sought here and mainly we're seeing issues of food insecurity and unemployment.
I am getting a shipment of hand sanitizers so about a hundred gallon bottles that I'm going to try to map out to give out to right now essential businesses, whatever is open senior centers, to make sure that they have at least some sign of sanitation in their entrance, but also I want to be able to share it with community association.
So if you know or can utilize the bottle of sanitate sanitizer, please let me know hopefully I'll get that in the next week or two much like to what the senator said, we are trying to fight on the state to try to save us.
In my communication with the attorney general's office, I requested to do a teletown hall with her, so we're going to get that in the works, and hopefully you know with enough participants.
I plan also a few town halls coming up: one with the department of education and really just trying to get the dates down, because as much as I'm invited on these little zooms trying to set up my own sometimes could be time consuming, but thankful to say that you know me and the staff are doing well we're happy to hear from everyone.
Let us know, oh and regarding the canceling rent to hazel's question and point, I did introduce a bill to address that specific problem about hurting the small landlords that rely on the rent to pay these utility bills.
That's introduced and the language is being worked out a little bit and I hope that we can, you know, consider it if and when we start session again remotely or not, but that bill would also call for a freeze on utility utilities like water and sewer and gas, and all that, in addition to those, I can't pay rent so just trying to tweak out some language to make sure it's.
Please help out your landlord, but if you can't understandable and if you know you need help advocating for that, I'd be happy to do so as to why you need to be protected from your landlord if they are like the ones that the senator mentioned that are trying to this time.
Like jeremy said this is marielle de la cruz and I'm having a hard time with my damn computer with the new york city comptroller's office.
I know I had been in communications with folks in cec 11 a long time ago about another school, but I just want to make sure that people continue to communicate with me on those things, one of the things that we have done just an fyi for the small business owners and community board 11 is that we've been having webinars about different resources that exist private and public when for small businesses, both loans and grants.
So if folks need that information jeremy, I will put that in the chat, and I know that you have shared it shared it with different individuals.
So again, I will include that link jeremy with you, and I know you shared that as well the small business link and also, I would like to say thank you, jeremy anytime.
Their staff has been incredibly helpful to me and I know to their constituents a lot of folks have been working, 24, 7 and because you can't see them, that's not necessarily always assumed.
Lastly, what I want to say is that the controller has released a lot of statements and letters regarding the way can move a little differently, so we've asked for there to be a better look at senior housing and how it's been disinfected or not at all, especially the 202.
I will also include my cell phone number that everybody should have, but the more that I know about what's going on in your community, the better, I am able to assist you, so these meetings should not be the first time I hear of things and I am home and would love to speak to some of you all.
There will be an information update, so I just wanted to put it out there, because I know there are a lot of people within the community and parents etc that are looking forward to that update.
I'm happy to join all you folks and again just want to thank cb 11's leadership for setting up a virtual meeting.
I also want to thank council member joan I for mentioning the disadvantages that our small businesses are facing at this time with the legislation that has been coming from the federal government.
I know that particularly cb11 has had a lot of issues with their postal services, so I just want to give a quick update on that, particularly at the allerton and esplanade post offices.
I just want to thank assemblymember fernandez's staff, who did flag that those two offices to those two post offices to our office- let's see- oh sorry, I don't mean to take too much time, jeremy, but also for just cd11.
Let me know at the end of this meeting how long you want it to be held.
I know it and I want to thank everything that has been said and done, but there have been days that people in the 104 69 area code or zip code have not gotten their mail for two days at a time, then you'll get one piece of mail, then another two days.
This is unacceptable and I mean yes, I know that there's a shortage of staff, but just today, no mail in this area and what is being done to address that right, and so it's in moments like these, where we hear from the community that we can reach out to our congressional liaison and find out exactly about that zip code.
Yes, I'm also having problem with the mail, and I know my mail comes from parchester, I'm in 104.62, and I have gotten mail of things that I had already paid like a good month ago and then I'm just getting the stuff in the mail, the statement in the mail a month later for weeks after I was told that things were mailed weeks.
Thank god they will throw it away right, and that is absolutely unacceptable, and I just also want to give the context that we fully recognize that this is a bronx, a bronx-based issue yeah, it's part of our district, we're not seeing this come up and work very closely with our congressional liaison and the bronx postmaster to ensure that everyone's getting their mail and that we're flagging everything that you folks are seeing on the ground.
I can put it in again if folks didn't see it, along with my contact information, senator rivera covered the budget pieces and all what's going on in albany, so I'll just go straight to the district office, we're all working remotely, as everyone else seems to be we're all we all remain accessible by email and by telephone.
Gov I'll put my email in the chat again and I'm happy to add you to our email list answers if any questions we're going to move on to state senator bailey's office.
If you'd like to know any more information about things that senator bailey has been doing in the community, you can provide your email address and I'll add you to the mailing list.
So did somebody want to make the motion seconded any board member?
I know you emailed me a treasurer's report like right before the meeting.
If anybody wants specifically march, I think april is going to be good enough.
There are at least two businesses in our district that have been violated for price gouging and we'll send him those emails because he wants to know einstein hospital.
First, I don't know what's happening after july or after july 1st, at the moment, mail theft, somebody a community resident put in notified me, I think yeah me and alex she sent an email.
I please, if you have any questions, please speak to me after the meeting, so we you know so this mean doesn't go to 11 o'clock committee reports, I think, is that david levitt is you're the chair of that committee.
Oh I want to you know, vote against this.
I think hazel wanted me to just say whatever needs to be said.
I second that I think maybe we should you know.
