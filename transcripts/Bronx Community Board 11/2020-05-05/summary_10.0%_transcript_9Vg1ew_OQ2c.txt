And so it is 604 p.m. this is the community board 11 Public Safety Committee meeting of April 22nd 2020 I'm, going to yeah I.
I know we hear the governor speak the president, the governor, the mayor, but this is a really local, and this is this: opens it up for our community to listen in to what's going on locally, so I just want to start off by thanking the essential employees, the FDNY and the NYPD.
We really appreciate you, especially during times like this, when it's a national emergency, so we appreciate you and that's all I have I think we're good to get started with the agenda.
Radio, we're saying I have general talking point of exactly just providing an overview currently of where we're at as the department in terms of overall call volume response times and medical leave.
We can forward that to the rest of the members, Theresa you're, good, more local statistics if elected, and they did get your email about it for children, education, I, think yeah.
I know there was that major alarm fire a couple weeks back on Kruger, which we provided and started providing the information.
Every day we've been sharing, with de we've, been sharing with not-for-profit organizations with all the community boards for those that know firing life safety, education right now, physically, as at a hall where, traditionally, our firefighters had established outreach campaigns where they've worked with different community-based organizations, schools, senior, centers, NYCHA faziz, anything community-based, ultimately, to provide fire and life safety instruction.
The pass along one thing to note in the blocks were hopeful, making a connection right now or cutting a deal with Bronx men, because apparently, with certain do-e sites or students, they don't have the tech as of yet, and some of the curriculum has been being aired in community television, they're, going to start airing the FDNY in between curriculum and in between and they're, going to start entering the FDNY lesson to all bronc through the Bronx Network we have a 45-minute adult presentation which provides general residential fire safety, which is on the current website.
I will share it information with the board, since I forgot to do that up until this point I don't know if you recall that fire by chance, whatever you can give us whatever you can give us as appreciated if I can get that real, quick yeah fire was that 25 28 Kruger Avenue there's a three alarm fire and the Red Cross provided assistance.
It looks like due to a cooking toaster up done if they have any questions on that or anything now so far, let's hold on well from the committee Public Safety Committee members.
Do you have any questions so far because I think you're you can you yourself were waiting for the public until the end, so we know he gave us good information.
Thank you, yeah no question and then I did ask I did so.
If you need to question anything so then, with that being a set, that being said, I think we're done with the FDNY right.
One of things I just wanted to get into it's on the agenda is our staffing levels to give you a little bit of a baseline this one time precinct has approximately a hundred and fifty full duty officers, basically officers that are that can go out.
So obviously, you know we kind of looked limited in our capacity, but a couple of the things that we were able to do is we cancelled and suspend the whole training, well unnecessary training for the offices.
Just a couple of things that we're doing here from the NYPD level regarding the corona outbreak will seeing a large amount large increase uptick in 311 and not on one calls as it regarding social distancing, and you know, people calling on different commercial businesses as far as people, not amazed executive orders, so we're being proactive.
Another question is: what's the crime looking like for the last month or so I'll just give you a little synopsis, starting with the whole year before and I'm proof.
They checking the padlocks to make sure everything is locked up and if they see anything suspicious, you know there are questions on these individuals who are out there at this point.
What else can I say so I think as far as crime generally the city and the Bronx has seen a decrease in crime, except for property crimes like I said geo laser up, not just in the 49 but in the Bronx as well as burglaries and it's a citywide does anyone have any questions is about the crime or anything else going on going on, so anyone saw the Public Safety Committee didn't we have shooting at Kruger recently yeah a few on Kruger?
I think we're good there Jeremy do you want to just go over some quick stats for, since the hospitals we invited the hospitals to join, but they could enjoin so Jeremy if you want to give us just a quick briefing, yeah, obviously I'm, not sessional, but let me share my screen real quick.
Every day it's been dropping down to like two percent increase in terms of the those infected and you can get this I can get all this information is public if you know where to find me for stats by community board, I hope to get that I would not move your breath, but with the city one other thing: I, don't know with the city.
I, don't think we ever heard back from so I unless there's anything else, any other committee member Jeremy, thank you that was good.
I'll try I'll reach out to them, but I have, after once, I got the press once I got the statement from them, I emailed the contact, and he was very good about responding to me right away and they said they're going on P currently I keep hearing too much feedback, so they were gonna PPE, currently they're stocked enough.
How make you I know how many total I gotta keep everybody want to know currently how many, how many patients are positive, not just fatalities right, because the list that came out by the state was technologies.
Basically when they test positive, no I, don't know if you saw in my email that the somebody was making an argument from the from the nursing home trade association or something like that they were criticizing the state for their policy of taking having nursing homes taking in hospital patients, I think and then I think the governor was kind of caught off guard by a question related to that.
That's just something else to be aware of: I'll follow up Veronica with your questions, all right: Thank, You, Jeremy, I appreciate it: okay, the other committee member I, muted, every toss names on the phone I, just I'm you there any Molony any other I know you just joined us late, but we have the FDNY.
If they'd like to drop off or not we'll continue normal business, we don't want to take any more of their time and before I everybody to for those who are using computer.
Are we trying to talk at once, I'm going to mute, everybody plus there's anybody, it's able to unmute themselves and has a question there's a question in the chat Jeremy if you want to read it.
Okay, I do have a I do have another own old business and it was an answer to a question that Tony had asked in a leadership with regards to the emergency rooms.
Okay, if I just respond to that now, yeah I won't know any question: is that something related to the FDNY, because I do I want to try to get them out of here?
Yes, okay, I'm gonna yeah go ahead.
You know for the community because some people do not have access to mass they're going to look into that.
But the one thing I did ask because I know that Karina says she's in the she's in the trenches right now and she's keeping herself distanced from everybody, because she doesn't want to infect anybody.
I know we got a question about homelessness.
Has the question mute everybody, because it's just too much feedback right now.
Let me meet everybody and then I'll unmute you hi Joanne, okay, I had heard a couple of weeks ago.
She has to add to that, if I can find, if she's still in the meeting, yes yeah be mute, everybody cuz, there's feedback all right.
Thank you all right, so I'm yeah, hey the committee I just had muted everybody should meet you all unless I'm, probably participation, I'm gonna we're going to turn our back over the committee for old business new business.
