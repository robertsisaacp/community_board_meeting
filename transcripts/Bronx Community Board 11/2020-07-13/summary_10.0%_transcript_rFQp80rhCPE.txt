I know that CB 11, it's very NYPD friendly, as is evident by the priorities listed on our budget priorities from the city, and so I just wanted to make it clear that you know that I wasn't disagreement and that we would give an opportunity to other people to also speak to the issue, as this has come to the forefront within the past month, and you know, there's other issues in our district, such as you know, the lack of quality schools, especially for middle schools and high schools.
This is David Levitt I'd like to lend my voice as well, and also make notes of the protests that are ongoing and the students at City Hall and near the municipal building, where people are protesting in favor of cutting the NYPD budget and reallocating funds so that everything is not considered to be a criminal matter.
That does not mean that we do have issues I, think it's unfortunate that we didn't have this conversation earlier in the month when these things started coming up.
I think these conversations should be on going beyond just today and I want to lend my support that we continue those conversations, whether that is with this committee or as a community organization as a community board.
Low, okay, Creek yeah I am with all the crime, that's going on I'm kind of nervous about taking funding away from the police, while recognizing that there's a lot of inequities in our district, whereas a lot of like you mentioning the schools, absolutely nothing to do for the youth, the youth that needs to have help, but taking money away from the police.
I may say something here: I mean one thing that I think that it's not necessary and it's actually one of the things that it's on our budget priorities is adding more officers to our schools.
It's like one of the line in our budget is, let's ask for more police officers to what was it for the mobile classrooms or whatever they're called the trailer classrooms where we should be asking is for those not to exist for schools not to be overcrowded and our students not to be in this temporary setups.
Think you're right that these pointed wrong point is that our community, our priority, that's correct priorities deciding for additional officers- and you know becoming- was made that you know that maybe we shouldn't be pull.
You know pulling these officers from schools but, as they see stated, I think what is being highlighted here is that these are systemic issues right and it's a matter of priorities right and if the priority is given to giving more officers and policing this kid, these kids are just looking at what the overall issues are that may be going at home that are requesting.
It's what I'm trying to say: yeah, okay, I'm, sorry, you're right, you start off by talking about our budget priorities.
It should be a big deal and the second I'm, not a member of the committee but I- do have some experience that the board is run and so I'd like to make a recommendation that if this is a formal committee meeting of the budget priorities committee, then perhaps a motion could be made.
This committee I've only I, joined this committee in this year, so in September, I guess fiscal year, I joined in September and honestly didn't really have a full understanding of how this committee work, I kind of still don't from the from the little bit that I have experience so far is that this committee is required to attend I think there are three budget hearings with the city that take place during the hours of 9:00 to 5:00 and or so yeah I was not able to attend and neither was Daisy able to attend any of those meetings and that's it.
What we should be recommending and proposing is that there that there is some transparency to this process, because a document being created between the two people, the chair of a committee and the community board manager and submitted to the city as priorities on behalf of the entire community board.
It looks like two members of the public and then one board member fraeno is asking if he can speak and then I think we should also give time for the other attendees, not just Fran Oh, to speak to that's, okay, I!
There needs to be a better leadership efficacy and how we can get people to really participate in that conversation because I know, that's been a real struggle for the past couple of years and trying to get members to be a part of that yeah and maybe Natalie, wants me to Al about joining the committee and yeah, but I think another committee meeting would be great.
Because let me tell you something, as we know and I think I heard, Joanne Rubino say: crime has already sorry to spike on the wrong direction and unfortunately, people have been shot plus other things.
But in terms of like what we're talking about in this committee, we're talking specifically about what we're recommending as a community board and what our community board priorities are and how we can look at those and see where it might make sense to perhaps not allocate funding towards these four different things for and the one instance that we instance that we are speaking to that not only raised is one of the priorities that requests more police officers in schools and that perhaps that request either should be amended or removed.
So I am actually a teacher in district 11 I work at the 144 campus on Gunter and I've, been teaching for about 12 years, so I'm doing in teaching and listening to you guys, I think that there's a lot of different things that need to be kind of addressed.
There's not been very many that have been prevented by a school Safety Officer, so I don't understand how we think that our safety officers, who don't have weapons and who are not trained police officers, are going to stop something like that.
So I just think that, like we really kind of need to be more strategic in the conversation we're having because a lot of it is just it's not well informed and I really do it's really upsetting to hear that you want to bring more officers into our school.
But thank you so I can try going back to Raphael, but I'm not sure that's working to do should I go, give a an overview again of budget priorities and what those are, what those main that help be helpful for anyone actually yeah I, think a lot of budget items or can you easily sort the budget items that have to do with NYPD I can't easily sort, but I can so I can I can just start explaining.
There's another document that the planning committee has made public like the New York City, Planning Board right and in that one they have it broken down whatever there I think they call it community profile outlook along those line and in one of their pages right like there are statements, I, don't know where they get those statements from where it's like it says.
These are the priorities from the board right in the statement from be x11 and I'll, not say you can put the document up on page wait, not page for section for just page eight, it says the three most pressing issues facing this Community Board are, and the first issue listed is police community relations, and that's one of the reasons why it was a red flag to me right and so that you know I just wanted to point that out that I don't know how this document is created, but I do think it's something that we need to.
You know that I would like some clarity on for the future right, as we continue to have these conversations yeah.
It would say see if it was capital and lobster again there's a difference in you know: expenses not as much money as see number two is just some police officers for the four nine, no expense with NYPD from what I can tell and again I can tell you I have an inkling why some of these were relevant, maybe yeah and I think that this was yeah.
This is you know this is the new process for community and budget priorities going forward for the year I?
Thank you that I think that's where kind of our connection is getting a little bit lost and that's what I mean when I want to refine our process and how this document is created by gathering input from all the different committees, because there you know, while talking to the agencies, are good it.
We have committees for a reason and they're working on different projects that, as a member of the budget priorities committee, I may not be aware of I, don't know what education is working on and what they might want to include right.
A lot of the onus is going to be on you, I mean it's gonna, require you reaching out individually to board members, because and that's why we were mentioning earlier, you know.
So do you want me to go up to Capitol for NYPD, see if there's anything up there so I looked, we looked at the two NYPD expense items: there's police officers, more community type events, and then I mean this is not NYPD.
These are expensive if you can, if you find something quickly, yes, but I'm interested in knowing what Natalie might be thinking now and her thoughts on this yeah I'll scroll up, she wants to talk.
Maybe well first like I want to say thank you to actually having the meeting like you said it sucks that we've having it today and you know June 10, which would been the perfect time to really have and be a little bit more productive about it, but nonetheless, I still think this was a productive conversation, move forward and pushing the community board to be.
You know they take mine and take our opinions in how they create the budget, but I think that we need to be active and proactive in whatever documents are being put out right, because this document, that is on the web right now saying this, is what CB 11 stands for.
This stuff gets done that we include that a member of leadership either the chair or vice chair, the required- be a member of this committee I second, that I'm not discussing the motion because I'm, not a member of the committee but I did want to let you know that the chair of the board is ex officio member of every committee of the board, which they can attend your meetings and but they can't vote.
You don't necessarily need them on the committee right I think it would be helpful to have the leadership.
Oh you know all right, so any their business or business new business motion, but I really want to propose that the community bowl board hold a town hall.
