Thank you, hello, folks, so I'm gonna stand kind of over here, which means that I can kind of look around everybody and still look at all the board members good evening.
Thank you so much for rubbing that in it is being in the majority, is both exhausting and exhilarating, but mostly currently exhausting since we're in the middle of a budget battle, and so I will be giving you kind of an update of some of the things that are happening, and then it opened myself to any questions.
That means, if you are, if you're eligible, you can save money for applying for property tax exemptions, and you can come directly to this event in my office to speak to the Department of Finance representatives, you can ask questions to understand your notice of property value your market and assessed values, how to appeal your assessment, etc.
I know that obviously, this Community Board is one of the ones that has the most homeowners in it in the Bronx, so I want to make sure that you know that is available to you in my office.
In my office on Tuesdays appointments are required, but if you are an apartment, dweller like I, don't know if I need this.
Related matters develop a response from our conference, and then we have a process in a couple of weeks called the one House budget, which is when the Senate will present its version of the budget as we as we go towards passing a budget on time on April 1st there is, we can have a conversation as long about this as you as you would like.
So that is the main thing that I am focused on and I will briefly speak on this, although I'm sure that there were questions about it on issues of bail, reform and I know that there are questions about it and I will be here to answer any questions that you might have also have a colleague from the Bronx defenders.
But after dozens and dozens of credible accusations that he had all sorts of things that he was alleged to have done, he spent 20 minutes in front of a judge and because he was a millionaire, he got to go home and chill until the court date that just happened a few weeks ago, as opposed to that somebody who was a constituent of mine, kalief, Browder, a 16 year old boy who was arrested for allegedly stealing a backpack spent three years in Rikers Island, two of them in solitary confinement until the charges were dropped committed suicide later on from the PTSD that he got from being in Rikers Island from being accused of a crime that he did not commit and a crime that he didn't want to plead to.
Yes, sir okay, but that needs to be tweaked really good, because if you have somebody, like you, said the gentleman you were talking about no prior convictions, you know clean as a whistle I understand the fact that he should be let go.
But if you got somebody you know with 38 or 40 arrests prior to that, okay, that should be in the judges hands as to whether or not they should be a bail, and you know what it should be set at couple of things.
That is a legitimate concern and we need to actually what we're having the conversation right now during the budget about how we give them the resources necessary, so that they can put the staff on in hand so that they can provide for the law to be observed.
Currently, so in many, so I've I would say that the thing that we need to underline- and we need to remember, is that there are literally thousands of people who have been able to go back home at the end of the day and not have to stay overnight or for a month or for a year or for two years have been able to keep their jobs, have been able to keep access to their children, have been able to go back to the shelter that they live.
So I would say that, while certainly if they're legitimate concerns I want to hear them when somebody says tweak I'm like cool, tell me how tell me what needs to be done.
So maybe we can have the community board, send her a letter and tell her to get in touch with your office, and you know, and I will tell you that our that just the district attorney has been sitting down with one of the main sponsors of the bill, senator Jamal Bailey, and they have been having conversations about by the way there has been some.
That's not accurate, so I would say that there are conversations that are ongoing and if there is something that is put in front of me as I try to do with every piece of legislation, I will take it into consideration and I will look at what is there, but much like the speaker of the of the assembly who has taken the position that he needs more information to see how this is working.
Look, there's a lot that the senator said: I don't need to repeat it, but what I can share with you is that I have been a public defender for 20 years in the South Bronx and we represent tens of thousands of people every year and what I can tell you from my 20 years as a public defender is just how incredibly necessary this bail.
The court process is gonna work I, you know, I get the benefit of the presumption of innocence, just like everybody else, and to go to court and never come back out to be put in a jail cell, separated from your children, from your parents, from your siblings, from your loved ones, not be able to return to work, not be able to take parents to their health care appointments.
The other thing I want to stand up here and tell you is that, even though it has only been a really short period of time, bail reform is actually working and I hear the concern I mean if I could just finish this one point: I hear it's up to the board.
Maybe we can do something better, because actually studies show that incarcerated people who are struggling exacerbates all of those underlying issues and really does make it more likely that we're going to see them back in the criminal legal system you just put, sir, is that on just somebody to click it, please don't touch the buttons unless it's red, just let me know so on person- is innocent to go out without bail.
Is it based on an article in the New York Post or at some point, do we have to actually let our criminal legal system work right?
So the question is: if somebody comes through one time on a first offense, let's say right, the question is even if in our hearts in our guts, we think I think that person is guilty.
My number is three four: seven, six, four, six, four five text me an email address, and/or phone number and I can send you the Flyers regarding that one way onto another note, starting April 4th at the allerton library we're going to have a poetry workshop for four weeks, starting April 4th.
Unless there's questions we'll move on to our next guest speaker gallery sessions figure it's Vinnie, Marie Lyon regarding the PS 108 annex I did speak at last month's community board meeting regarding this issue.
We really need the community's support to carry us to 8th grade, like I said: there's no quality middle school for our students, currently in the neighborhood and I'm just here to get advice, feedback, support, suggestions and how to make this happen.
So I spoke to the principal of the school today and he said he has a meeting with the school construction authority next week and at some after that, he's going to touch base with me, because he I suggested that we have a meeting a larger meeting, definitely at least with stakeholders, because they're you know there was some discussion with the NYPD want to make sure I was on the same page.
We couldn't hold an official meeting because it wasn't enough people, the education community, I, know the quorum.
What the combined hear public hearing on the shelter a fortunate they were not enough people there I wish there more people will show up at these meetings and I want to take my last few minutes and talk to senator Gustavo in reference to his statement, senator Gustavo and Natalia Fernandez, or taking a position that they not going to amend justice reform or bill reform.
So if we understand here and praised this, you know I when I've rather praised some of the people and some of the kids that go and get five A's, not five jail or five summonses or criminal things.
That's right, Efrain, gonzales, homeless, shelter, hello, everyone I'm me friend, Gonzalez I, work at Einstein, monster, Fuhrer and I actually live in community board 10.
Having and I want people in Community Board 11 to understand that both of these community boards really are cohesive in a lot of ways.
A lot of homeowners in community for 10 more in community board 11, but we do share the same councilmember most of the time, and so I am against that I'm against people coming out of Riker's to go to a homeless shelter when there was no screening process about what you're gonna see this doctor you're gonna do this there they're talking about substance, abuse clinic in the homeless, shelter and right away that sent up a red flag because then I believe that Oasis will get them approved for a methadone program.
Lastly, I'm gonna close I was made aware at that meeting from councilman Marc Jonah, and it offended me that there were people attacking members of community board 11 and 10 and I want everyone to know.
It is unacceptable for anyone to attack any member of a community board because they have an issue the way we fight those issues is we come together and so I just want you to know that?
We can't accept anybody going in there and attacking the people that change things in our community.
The second one is that in your community, when they speak about putting people out on bail, I'll give you a live story.
If we had the information at that point or video, the person with the gun would have been arrested, the judge would have had something this guy is still out he's in your neighborhood, okay, violent felon, violent drug-dealing lives in your community, so think twice.
I said at that time be careful with the zoning that you change it to, because you don't know, what's gonna happen afterwards.
If I can answer that, the mayor said that community board 11 homeless people have been placed elsewhere.
Okay, however, and he said he's going to replace them with people from the Bronx now the homeless provider, who, by the way, has a corrective action plan because they can't account for their time.
Okay has said that they will take him from the community board, the Bronx and the city all right.
Scarsdale, where my mother lives, I came to the Bronx and I'm, not getting the support that I should get as a minority and I think that you should look at the people that have been open, till 4:00 a.m. like the pool hall.
The next two announcements I have are for the board members I know: Community Board 11 has done a pretty good job at submitting their reappointment applications, but if there are board members that have not sent that into our office, yet please do so the deadline for that was February 7th.
That's all I have thank you very much just here where, if you didn't know couple board members reach out to me last week or if not the week before about the renewal application, which I did not receive from the borough president's office until yesterday, so they have, they never received the initial reappointment.
You know for people with incomes, less limits of 66,000 come to the office.
Drumming master Thank, You Jerry before I get into the report there was I was the chair of the Land Use Committee and many people are not on a community board when Blondell Commons was a Uhler that had nothing to do with anything else.
You want to put a door in you know that'll last 5, 10 years, I got 30 seconds, left, ok and the what the I think the best part of the whole thing is anybody 11 or all that can vote.
Thank you: council, member Kings office, robber, press parking, calendars, bike, smart official guide to cycling in New, York, City, pamphlets and on March 12th, councilman King will be holding his state of the district state of the district me.
As you all know, the a Clark has been making her rounds to Precinct Council meetings, as well as community boards to talk about three components of the criminal justice reform, bill discovery and speedy trials.
It's imperative that if you did not initiate a phone call and you had just passed it to the elderly people, especially they should question any phone call like that comes in to them, try to reach out for the individual.
I know we have folks from the New York Public Library here in Allerton, I'm I just met Manny tonight, I want to stress over and over again the importance of getting counted.
We can discuss a day that I can come, maybe once a week once a month, something like that to make it work, there's not much discussion.
First thing up: I need a motion to approve the January 2020 full Board minutes a second by 8:00.
It open for discussion, all those in favor against abstentions, motion approved, I, didn't next issue I'm going to mention in everybody's folder jacket.
But you know we have bylaws and we're not we're not we're not doing anything on the bylaws, because, hopefully you people will come around to us and a tenure means okay.
So obviously, you know there's a big scare thing going on and maybe rightfully so, because we're told to expect the worst just remind dissing my endure, if you haven't heard all right already, it's still flu season and if you haven't got your flu shot, it's highly recommended, so you don't come with down with the flu and people think you have the virus and avoid you like the plague, but also you know they don't want to tie up doctors.
Although some people got their impression, the Bronx da is not necessarily in favor of bail reform, I've heard, so we had a meeting at senator Bailey's office, al-kamil or 10:00 keyboard 7qe before 12:00 about that homeless, shelter I mentioned parliamentary procedures.
There are two other types of shelters, other than homeless shelters, as eventually you'll get to Hazel motion to request stats from the city, because they're the city's great about publishing stats for each community board and how many are in the shelter system, whether they originate from waters, place or Jacobi, Medical Center, and not really $5.99, rhinelander Avenue or something is another story, but I am pushing and with the housing committee's help we're pushing for stats on people outside of this city that come originate from outside to see that come into the shelter system, because I was told it could be up to a thousand people, which is a pretty big number, so be curious to see where those people come and what are the stats onto my domestic violence?
Shelter in a district I want to know how many are in the Bronx or how many are on Staten.
So unless there's anything else for your committee will move on to housing, hazel Mira I'm happy to say that we actually had a floor and we were discussing the shelter and we came up with emotion only because we're not if this goes through we're not exactly sure where these men are going to be coming from.
I. Just have a question about, and the one on Bronx Tale Avenue between pairs of NS is the whole street going to be closed, and you know it's only partial.
Is there going to be against board members workers in the office?
So if anyone has a complaint against the board, whether its individual members committee, the staff- this is what this is for- is to try to handle things in-house versus things going directly bp's office.
So if anybody needs or wants to know where that is on our websites under the forms and guidelines section, we can always email it to you too.
