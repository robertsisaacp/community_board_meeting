Little reminders and also let the applicant know how the meeting is going to run.
So, let's start tonight, the the first up, the only application we have for our review is an application by tower 49, and this is for a renewal of a certification for an open-air cafe, and I think we have the applicants here with us.
I will open up for questions by members of the committee, so I'm gonna ask you to use the raise hand function.
I believe russell, if you remember, if you could chime in there's one along this west wall here for sure and there's one on the north plaza as well, I would have to go back and actually let me you know what, if I can go back to the old plant set from three years ago, that actually had those in it one.
You know the pops regulations, and the signage in particular are very specific, so I'm not sure if they would even allow that type of language, but we can ask city planning well yeah.
So, basically what we have done in the past with cafes that are located within pops, mostly in midtown, is you know, reaching an agreement with the applicant where basically, they would elect to add signage that would be approved, or that would be.
That would not raise any objections from the department of city planning, okay, but that would basically specify that you know the tables are open to the public and that purchasing is not required.
You know any potential users that certainly yeah some something like the card on the table would be something that appears on the plan.
So it really shouldn't you know, be a problem then for city planning, so yeah certainly russell.
I think the last time when we went to city planning three years ago, I don't know it was clayton that brought it up again, but the last cafe put a sign on the stanchion table.
It doesn't look like the tables and chairs are socially distanced, and so I don't think this plan will stand for our reopening of manhattan.
So I don't know that it's really incumbent on us right now to ask the applicant to redesign the cafe.
We want to support you in this open-air cafe, and so I just would like the applicant to keep in mind that things are going to change and it will benefit this.
Thank you and I think that the committee agrees, and you know probably the full award that you know.
There's gonna be tremendous changes and- and we want these operators to be successful and to be compliant and to keep everybody safe, yeah absolutely, and I think we should add some language to that effect in the resolution.
Button pushed okay, so seeing non working, I'm going to open up the floor to members of the public.
Do we have any questions or comments by members of the public and you would also use the raised hand button yeah.
I have no doubt that they will adapt their plans appropriately as far as social distancing once there's guidance about how open-air cafes are required to, and I don't have any doubt that they'll do that in an appropriate way, and I think that they're agreeing to commit to the additional signages also is also very promising.
I think this is what's going to revive our city and I'm very excited that this applicant has come at this time.
Does anybody have an objection to this proposal all right, so seeing none I'll make a motion to approve with added languages which is discussed about signage and keeping in mind that social distancing will be necessary, pulling on the the city agency and the council to quickly come up with the new roles so that those businesses can operate while providing all the necessary safety to patrons pedestrians, employees and second losers, all right, first vote of the evening dave david calis.
As you know, new members are almost ever appointed directly to the land use committee and therefore we don't have any new members per se, but dave achilles, who has been on the board for a number of years, has joined our committee.
So the second part of our meeting is really a discussion item with a bit of action that I believe we should take, and I think that you know it's you've been through the exercise before most of the other committees did the same exercise.
We are, we are in still in the middle of this health crisis that has a tremendous ramifications and impacts in so many areas, and you know it would be a little foolish to imagine that we're going to pass a resolution that will, you know, address all the issues or you know point to what would be the right direction.
So the first item that I would like to to discuss with you guys is, you know, passing a resolution calling on the mayor to basically open up these panels and appoint community board members and certainly to involve us and the reason why I think it's really important that we are involved is that cb5 is, you know, we're the business district.
I think it should be a resolution, but you know I'm certainly opening open to hearing your your thoughts on content and form of this request and advocacy.
I've been watching him every day and he talked about how he wanted clergy and block associations to join in with him on how to plan the reopening and what we're going through, but he did not mention community boards.
I agree evan yeah, so I'm actually not surprised that this administration kind of skewed community board interest, and I think it's really.
It's upsetting, I think, for our given our position within the city to be excluded from that process, and I would urge us to put the strongest possible resolution that we could and bring it to the full board, as has been said, and then also to make sure that we have a suggestion for what the right mechanism for touching base with us would be, and the only question I have to the group is: should we include some of our objectives or key concerns in that resolution, or should we try to do that after we are able to hopefully establish that communication yeah good point?
I agree with the idea of doing this as a resolution and and putting some content in there specifically about what community board engagement would look like.
That was spelled out by the mayor, and I think the response by the board, president herself and her staff and other community board chairs was actually very supportive, and I don't know if you want to speak further on that vicky now you're on mute.
I said yes, I'm so glad I did since you all agree and the thought the deputy borough president said we will get all the other boards and in fact I think they wanted to go even beyond manhattan.
You know it's hand raised sorry mike, yes, I agree it should be a resolution as supporting everything that you and vicki and the borough president outlined, but I just think that it's an it's just a symptom of the overall disrespect to community boys that we don't really have any power, and so I think we should have a separate resolution.
I don't think it has to be together with this one, but that community boards should have some type of veto power through you, euler or through department city department of city planning or dob, or something to cause them to respect the community boards yeah I mean this is something that we have lamented and complained about for pretty much as long as I have been on the board, it is becoming more acute and more critical now, but you would be comfortable with leaving this out of this resolution or not making it a main ask, but really focusing on getting ourselves to the you know a seat at the table.
Okay, dave, hey kelly's, yes, both clayton and mike, make very good points, and I've been getting a lot of email from the neighbors recently about how they've got a feeling they've been deserted by the city government they're, not getting any feedback from council members or the mayor or anybody.
Okay, so I think there's a couple of things that could happen with this resolution.
I don't know exactly what it is, but I do think there has to be an action plan with the resolution.
That's really, you know a whole layer of land use and planning that we basically need to our sleeves and start working on so then.
I think it is an 18 day planning, study, yeah sure you know we found that as a community board and it's always been there, but we have to find the money which is tricky to do that or we do it ourselves and we can be.
I see that ryan has his hand up ryan go ahead, and then I want to you, know sort of like summarize and come up with.
Whoever the next mayor will be the next president of the next city, council, members and so forth, and so thinking about a time horizon that would allow us to get those recommendations into the bloodstream of the policy discussion in the meat of when these people will be selected.
The resolution will call for community board engagement and we're going to be a little selfish, but we're going to say that you know really: cb5 must have a seat at the table and a formal, ongoing mechanism for input to be provided to various city agencies.
I would maybe go even as far as saying criminal, and I think that, if there's one thing we can say now is that we have to call on the city and not only this administration, but also send the message for the next administration that the city must plan, and then you know what this planning should look like.
I, of course I totally agree- and I all I would add, if we're talking about a 10-year plan, do we want to include a reference to the incredible lack of planning immediately evident in the mayor's new budget that is being proposed because and of course it's a huge rabbit hole because there's so it opens up every single possible element of life in the city and if we want to be tailored and focused on what's appropriate for our committee, I think the most relevant data point from the proposed budget is that he is proposing to cut 40 percent of the capital budget for affordable housing and, at a time that phase one of reopening does include non-essential construction.
So, yes, if we can get some language in there about putting hospitalization back in and especially targeting the homeless people yeah julie, I want to call on you, because I know that bex is working on that issue.
You know, continue to work together and formulate you know what kind of requests we would like to make, and this is something that, at the next bex committee meeting, you guys can discuss sure fantastic.
Thank you, okay, so on the need, the city needs to plan resolution.
I know this is a short-term issue, but yeah I mean the thought is really you know planning for a post covered resilient new york city yeah.
Do we want to insert ourselves into insert the idea of this into that process, somehow number one and then number two you know in terms of, and I'm sure we would be thinking about this.
What things will be important, because you know if, for example, you think that what nyc or plan yc is not particularly planning document per se, you know really, I think, giving some specificity to whom we want to do what would be important there, but I do think there's a lot about existing processes that we should strongly consider how we can both draft off of and shape yeah.
Oh yeah, we're planning and it's you know the scary part.
Okay, so basically, if everybody is okay, we would draft another resolution in which we would call on the city to do a more thorough job to plan and have a 10-year plan that could be specifically geared towards addressing the grave urban issues that we're going to be faced with due to kovic 19., and I don't know that we need to be specific on what the plan should consist of, but I think that in the coming month we're gonna have to do a lot of work.
Thinking about what we believe should be our priorities, so I want to make sure that you guys are on board with going this route all right.
Thank you, okay, so I will open up the floor to members of the public.
Thank you for the reminder, though, so a resolution calling the city for a strong and thorough plan pointing out to the failures of the past.
You will mention the hospital closures, vacancy residential vacancy rates in our district and, more specifically, around midtown and billionaires row, and with a an explanation that we're going to get to work and we will come up with what we believe is a strong plan for resilience for cb5.
I think that we may want to you know, appoint ourselves, the you know, cb5 ten-year plan task force and you know get organized and go to work so that you know maybe next month we can.
I think that the violence certainly has has a direct impact on on our businesses, and you know we don't really have a business committee as the other community boards may have, but you know the thought of having you know.
You know it just so nancy may maybe you want to speak on those those photographs and tell us a little bit.
Rachel nick, it doesn't sound like there's a support for a resolution, and I think I'm okay with that, but maybe we can use the resources of the board office and the you know, police council, that we participate on to ask these questions and to see.
You know I'm very glad that we're discussing the matter tonight, but I think that it's probably a good idea to hold off on a resolution for all the reasons that ej just underscored.
I would like to hear from our elected officials on how they assess the situation, what they make of it and what kind of leadership they are going to push for or implement right now I haven't heard that I haven't heard corey say anything really specific to you know what's happening in our district.
I haven't heard the mayor certainly, and I think that you know pushing for those kinds of answers would seem like a good idea and we don't have to do it through a resolution.
So I want to just bring up the topic of property taxes, and this came up at our backs committee meeting last week, but ultimately we did not have a resolution on it, so I I'm not sure how much of the discussion that has been on the city level and on the state level, but a gentleman who participated discussed his concerns at our backs meeting last week mentioned that you know in supporting the outdoor street dining idea.
You know this is something that this is a big component in the resiliency, but I think that we all agree that, right now we don't have.
I don't think we're going to be talking about that in july, but definitely you know come september october.
Thank you so much nancy for taking these photos and sharing them with the with the committee, and I think that concludes our meeting.
Unless there's anyone who wants to add anything, I think that that would be it all right.
