Welcome everybody to our monthly meeting of Manhattan Community or fives transportation and Environment Committee via zoom I'm, also particularly on a new zoom setup right now, because I don't have any Wi-Fi or spectrum internet, so Luke's gonna generously help out as much as possible if I'm missing, for example, if there are hands raised or something in the chat right now, but I believe we can, we can go ahead and get started.
The first two items were that the committee wanted to briefly touch base on current status of two different issues, and you know I want to invite members of the committee who have concerns or observations about either of these things to feel free to bring them up, because I think we just kind of want to do as much fact-finding as possible and also invite folks from d-o-t who may have answers to some of our questions too, to feel free to answer that as well.
If there has been an affirmative statement by the NYPD regarding how long they're likely to be there and also how exactly they're able to have those streets closed for longer than 48 hours, which I believe requires d-o-t authorization to close the street for more than 48 hours, so again just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone does have any new information for the committee that we can kind of pool in terms of our collective knowledge, hi EJ, their street closures on 8th Avenue and 35th 36, and then I was near Bryant Park yesterday and there are definite street closures from like 40 streets, 43rd, Street, bored streets and 6th Avenue, okay, pedestrian street closures or, if you were I, saw a couple that had to show or say that they lived on that block in order to be led boom.
We simply didn't I think for the most part were referred around and then an and didn't end up getting any kind of answer on timing or more specific rationale than protests from NYPD, and you know from do tea in particular.
Do you have any give any new information on the fact that some of the pedestrian closures have been losing than the original, the original protective barriers around them, and whether or not the city is doing anything around that yeah I don't have a very specific update on the measure, but I know we are still looking to expand and add new okhla ministries, but also at a point where we think it makes sense to evaluate some of the locations.
Okay, if there's again, if there's locations that you guys are concerned about where we've been fielding, those and kind of kind of tracking them and we're certainly always looking to reevaluate and see where we can improve upon what's out there or you know, make adjustments reasons that are certainly blocks if they're not working.
So the second bullet owner agenda and the final quick status update, saying I thought we could check in on, is obviously the fact that outdoor dining rules went into effect today, as the city went into phase two we're all inside on the internet right now, so I don't know how many, how many of us have gotten the chance to say, experience it yet or take a real look at them at how it's going my understanding from reading the rules is that three scenarios are allowed starting today previously certified sidewalks eating backyard, patios and curb Lane parking, Lane seating he's going sure.
Understandably so, as people are trying to, you know, get their businesses back up and running at this point, we're limiting it to the space and directly in front of your establishment, but this is an evolving process and we're monitoring and reviewing- and it might be, you know, we're looking to potentially expand opportunities as we move forward over the coming weeks.
Yes, thanks everybody, so I apologize, I had to join late, but I was joining because I have a lot of concern about with the second that the open streets I mean the expanded outdoor dining plan was released.
So that's why we direct folks to other resources which, quite honestly, if you're, opening a restaurant at this point, you should probably be reviewing the state's guidelines anyhow, rather than just this particular program, which applies only to seating in the street and on the sidewalk.
I think what we have at the moment is links on the website, along with our guidelines that lay out like that connect to those requirements, and if, for example, you were opening outdoor seating in a backyard- and you had nothing to do with our program because you don't need to apply to it to do that, you would be looking in those other locations right.
My comment you may want to consider, although it is not the narrow application of duties for you to add some language, because this is a very serious issue and the public and businesses need guidelines and guidance and leadership, yeah I think I would say, I.
Certainly that kind of thing sort of gets abandoned when all the different groups can and agencies know that they're only a sliver of the jurisdiction there, but I think we'd, encourage you folks to potentially find a way to provide summary guidance.
We would be able to take over some of these storefronts next door and have a little bit more seating, so I think that's the question that was asked before, which is that we we've received that question a lot I totally understand where people are coming from and why that's desirable.
The closures will be limited to maybe the evenings, but in terms of street closures, how that's going to affect operations so I think you're getting at one of the challenges that we have right now overall, at do is he which is trying to manage a lot of the different demands, especially the curb space, which is always a challenge for us, but is especially challenging right now, as we're getting asked to provide more pedestrian space, more space for bikes make sure buses are moving quickly and accommodate deliveries as businesses come back and add outdoor dining.
As far as what happens when a street that may have a lot of restaurants on it, limited-access at the curb for deliveries, I think it's something we're gonna have to work through, as we see it sort of on a block by block in situation level, because this is something very new to us, and maybe it means that in certain streets it's best, you have to try to create an open, Street there, so that there's less through traffic and more ability to do deliveries, but it's definitely an ongoing process and figuring out how it works.
So if there's outdoor dining on the street, you know where you're, seeing a larger sort of- let's say concentration but I, guess that's really more of a question for NYPD, but a good question and we'll continue to have conversations with them.
Obviously, we've flagged some concerns and appreciate you guys considering continuing to think about those, and just generally know that the whole the whole program will be a fast-moving and always changing thing.
Meeting about the temporary bike lane we heard there was interest in learning more about what our plans are to build that out in more permanent materials, and so we're happy to be here tonight and be able to share that proposal with you of course, builds on our past work, I'm, 26, 29, 52nd and 55th, as well as 12 and 13th streets.
Yes, so tonight we're going to walk you through the background of other previous Crosstown protected bike lanes, we'll also share what went into the route selection criteria for these streets, also, the proposal details and, finally, some of the analysis that also led into this proposal development.
The routes are spaced evenly apart, every half mile throughout Midtown, from Union Square up to Central Park and as Convention we installed twelve thirteen, twenty six and twenty ninth streets in 2018 and last year installed 52nd and 55th streets, and so we found that the new lanes in the 50s and the 20s resulted in an increase of cyclists using the lanes from vehicle travel times not adversely affected generally maintained the new curbside regulation.
During the outreach process and throughout in the location of the project, we also conducted a number of walkthroughs and site visits with various stakeholders to make adjustments as needed and understand various issues, some examples of that food, adjusting signage and markings, fine tuning, the theater and hotel loading zone, entrances to accommodate arrival and departures and we're continuing to respond to feedback and recommendations moving forward if there are additional issues to address I, also want to mention that last year there were a number of construction sites along the routes know that those have generally completed.
So we prioritized connecting all the way through from 11th Avenue to the first avenue bike lane so in the eastbound direction, starting at the South 36th Street overlaps with the main entrance and exit points to the Midtown Tunnel on the east side, any further south than that, and it's a little too close to the 26 and 29th street pair and then we're getting away from that.
This was a quick installation and since our last update in May, we have returned to the location and installed markings in terms of long lines and also bicycle symbols to indicate and clarify the expectations how users come Street users can park on this road, and so the barrels are in need of ongoing maintenance and our staff visit the location on a nearly daily basis to shift barrels back into place, speak to businesses and drivers, and also post additional signs as needed and so getting into our proposal.
The bike lane would run along with South curved, with the rush hour lane along the north curb and would involve similar parking changes to 38th in terms of the day lighting and so to summarize, the existing capacity allows for two travel lanes and 2 loading lanes throughout the entire day and during the peak period.
If there is interest, especially from specific businesses, and just a highlight again that what we have seen a lot of is that even when there's available loading space, so people still double Park, and so our proposal will really help to encourage from a more efficient use of the street space.
One is the split phases which offer a separated space for cyclists to travel, the offset crossings which helps to calm turning vehicles and open up sight lines between pedestrians, drivers and cyclists, and the third is installing additional right turn Bay's, which is the side away from the bike lane at locations that need additional capacity.
This image shows an example of what the offset crossing typical has looked like on most of our crosstown bike lanes, and you can see that the vertical elements help to slow turning vehicles as they approach, cyclists and pedestrians, and so to give some additional context on what the routes the proposed routes look like, as we continue to the east and to the west to see before and cv6.
There are different existing technologies of the streets in both of those districts and so, for example, on the west side generally, it will include a park, a protected bike lane with a single travel lane here in cv5.
It's the typical of the parking protected bike lane with the option for two travel lanes during the peak periods and then on the east side, where there are multiple travel lanes, a lot of rush-hour regulations and different alignments approaching and exiting those tunnel access points.
We really look forward to the opportunity to install this in a more permanent fashion with more of our standard materials that allow to clarify the space a bit further and at this time, I'm happy to open it up to questions thanks very much.
And then can you speak to the Hudson River, because I know that on 11th Avenue, just south of 42nd Street, there's always a large traffic jams of people trying to get into the Lincoln Tunnel.
On our other projects, so when we work on our proposals, we review them with the fire department to talk about emergency access along the corridors, and although our off-peak design will take the lane down to a single traveling, it would include markings that I indicate no standing any time allowing for people to have an extra space to pull over and out of the way if there's some passing - but as I mentioned earlier.
That said, one of the big differences between this design and that stop the other things that you've seen in Midtown is that we've been we've really gone to one lane in most places here we're keeping the two lanes, because this is such an important corridor to move vehicles on for some of the reasons like you're, exactly saying, you need to be able to have this release valve as you come into 37 on.
That would be something that they would talk about, but I think that, like most of the time well, the way we look at this is during the rush hour when the most vehicles are moving.
Don't I can't remember if it was the exact specifics, it's kind of we haven't talked to the counterterrorism people I, don't believe unless somebody else knows differently, maybe Colleen or so we don't talk to counterterrorism, but we do share the presentation with the local precincts in the area and as Ted mentioned, we do get the blessings a review of FDNY.
Bus over okay I would only add, and then out stand down that when the lanes are painted green, whether they're protected or not, it's a visual trigger for the vehicles and it's incredibly helpful, I'm gonna, add really quickly something that I think why we're back this month.
This is wrong, but this sort of completes the set of protected bike lanes, spaced at half miles for Midtown going across town, and so you know I, it's filling the gap that exists now and if I'm understanding this correctly, you would not be aiming to slot in more Midtown crossed across time protected bike corridors following this one.
It's interesting that you say that, because there has been a lot of success and people have looked at these in bikers, like them, but I think there are other places of the city, especially north of here, where we've heard some interesting, so I'll just throw that in as a caveat, but it's not in you're, not in Midtown, proper yep yeah.
Thank you, BJ yep, just a quick question going back to the: how would you enforce the rush-hour traffic flow in terms of the parking regulations?
This is more of our typical design and then this is what kind of brothers and some of those properties of the clear lanes or the clear curbs work, we're adding capacity at locations so to be more of a parking enforcement or traffic enforcement for the vehicles there and the cyclists used, wouldn't really change and I.
That's the primary reason why we're leaving two lanes in place like there are today is that we don't want to see I think break down as people come in and out of these major gateways to the city and the design on the east side is a little different.
Thank you thank you, so not seeing any hands raised right now, I'll kind of ask one final question with all these other proposed bike lanes that we've that you guys have come to tell us about in the past, including the 20s, the 50s 6th, Avenue 8th, Avenue, we've passed a resolution.
So, with one last check to see if there are any more questions, I'm, not seeing any will, as a committee we'll take it into a committee discussion to talk about what, if any actions the committee wants to take right now, I'll simply start the discussion by pointing out you know, as I just said, we have for all these other for all the other bike lanes that have been installed over the last two or three years.
We generally call on deity to do as much outreach and teaching of good cycling behavior as possible, which often also calls on d-o-t to expand the street ambassadors program to as much as possible again understanding that funding is always an issue to encourage good cycling, behavior and teach the rules of the road again -, hopefully maximize success as much as possible, so I sort of just want to lay out what we usually do for the committee I.
You know generally personally think that this does kind of complete the set of what do T has been pursuing over the last several years in terms of crosstown bike lanes.
So you know I, think I think in the absence of any concerns or deviations, we would probably draft up a resolution again largely along lines of what we have said for similar proposals that we agreed with and liked, and attached enforcement and outreach stipulations -.
Don't it's important that you know this bike lane gets executed because it's just it's dangerous for cyclists to ride in one of the one of the city's busiest areas that I've almost gotten in an accident numerous times from cars, just thinking that they can speed and ignore whatever is going on right beside them, so I think it's a good prop.
I think this makes sense, along with our other, like resolutions, understanding that this is an interesting time for a city and a number of ways, but I don't see why those current issues and future issue should impact what this made us.
Yeah I've been trying earlier to say that I would be open to making our, whereas that regards enforcement just making that directly dependent on whatever principles come out of that last Genda item that were discussing today, so maybe exploring changing the specific wording that we've used in the past I'm.
But essentially, as you all know, the mayor announced the better buses restart to help speed up buses in key locations around the city during recovery and as part of that decided to make the 14th Street Bus way permanent and just a good clarification on that.
So I just want make sure that everyone understands it just because it's permanent doesn't mean that it's permanent in the exact same condition that it is right now, but we did see really good numbers over the months when it was first installed and then, of course, we've had have not been able to collect data in the same way that we were during the first several months, and so we're happy to feel questions about that as far as fifth avenue we're looking to do something similar, but obviously the roadway is very different.
That's a very accelerated schedule, so we're looking to at other ways of bringing people together to talk through the design and regulations, but Alison and Chelsea are here as well to add anything to that and then to answer our questions as needed: okay, Alison Chelsea!
I think Kim covered most of it, yeah we're just at the very beginning of our process, so we will be, as Kim said, setting up a Community, Advisory Board, but right now you know we're starting from scratch.
What's that going to look like I would say like we zoom as we start to move forward into the various phases of reopening, we can talk about potential site visits and things like that, but I think we'd probably be avoiding large-scale workshops, so primarily assume you have a sense of how many times it yeah do you have a sense of how many times it could potentially meet and how quickly you plan to iterate on the design if it needs to be implemented in July and then I guess also whatever gets implemented in July.
You know to provide options for people as they are going back to work and just traveling more, but it is something that we do see as iterative and as Kim said like that, the main piece right of a bus way that distinguishes it from a bus lane or from some other treatment, is the limitation of traffic traveling through on Fifth Avenue.
But the you know, kind of the basic structure I think we would start from is obviously maintaining buses along 4th Avenue truck traffic having a transit truck priority street, like what we have on 14th Street.
Maintaining local access in the area, and a lot of that is done initially, can be done with signage and then, as we kind of see how the traffic pattern adjusts and as people are, you know starting to travel more.
Okay, thank you, I'm, just taking a look at our calendar, there would likely not be an opportunity after you, because our community board doesn't meet next month.
I'll just say for myself that, given the calendar, given the time that we're in and given how quickly it sounds like this process is going to move, we would certainly appreciate being involved in the community advisory council, since there isn't say a proposal for us to assess and vote on tonight and there wouldn't be that opportunity before it gets implemented.
Specifically, we had a lot of community input from some of our elderly neighbors, about not being able to, for example, get a taxi on 14th Street for medical appointments, and that wasn't really addressed just kind of like thanks for your input and we're gonna move forward.
It's definitely a moving forward of the something going into 5th Avenue I think we need to learn from what happened on 14th Street, most specifically, some of the some of the education issues and some of the situation's of, like you, said elderly residents not able to get a get a yellow cab, not able to get an uber or a ride share of any kind.
Sam yeah thanks I, just wanted to add one of the things that's come up frequently is the location of bus, jumps and I know that they're in some movement of bus stops journey early days when the bus way was the old train shut down and then there's some construction occurring at various corners that are directly adjacent or next to the subway entrances and I.
Think, as the bus way continues to progress, it would be good if there was some community input about where those bus stops are, but also keeping in mind that if we're gonna have a bus way having the bus stops adjacent or next to the subway entrances was a principle that had generally been regarded as an important one by elderly, but also people with mobility challenges thanks Sam Noah.
This is this is a question via t, but are there plans to change the existing bus infrastructure in terms of I know when the 14th Street bus way was implemented both of the 14 a and the 14 D were converted to a select bus service?
Just add that but Allison I want you to speak to, but using that data for fifth avenue and how that works, yeah, so 14th Street data at least gives us.
Think you know one role we see with the Community Advisory Board is that it will be ongoing not just through the planning, but also through the implementation and the pilot and we'll be monitoring.
You know between what we might see in the data and on paper and isolated issues that people are seeing on the corridor, so I think the CA B will give us a good way for Fifth Avenue to address that.
You know to answer your very valid question: I think we're sort of at the mercy of the summer schedule at this point and we're of course sorta at the Murphy at the mercy of how accelerated the busway projects will continue, especially because 14th Street is being extended as well.
Others on the committee can, let me know if they, if they think otherwise, but to me, there's not there's not much specificity here yet with which to weigh in on so that leads me to think that we have two main avenues: one in terms of fifth Street, sorry, fifth avenue to participate as much as feasible in the community advisory board, as that goes forward to try to use what has been learned from 14th Street and to have a voice via that planning vehicle.
It was after the first one, so we should definitely take the opportunity offline to dig into the second one, but we would also very much appreciate I think to Buzz's point, perhaps two months from now, when our committee is back in session, for whatever it is, the August cycle, maybe getting a readout on what you learned from the code from the progressive to quarterly reports, and maybe whether or not more data is helping to explain more of what residents are seeing on those side streets and then, certainly, if you want to put in the no right turn as Bosley just makes everyone happy.
Yeah I can talk also about the updates that we do plan that are just not finalized it because of our imitation schedule, but some of the turn lanes and signal timing, changes and regulations updates and that sort of thing.
So, anyway, you know I'll, throw it back to the to the committee one more time to see if there are any other thoughts at this at this point in time, I don't think, there's a logical board action for us to propose tonight and I'd like to get a sense of whether the committee thinks that as well, BJ yeah just a kind of a related question.
Well, not at this point, seeing any other hands from the committee I think, that's probably how we'll plan on moving forward.
I'm sure we'll continue to be in touch as much as possible, as in particular that 5th Avenue plan develops and yes would very much appreciate the next time it's useable on the calendar for you folks to come back and continue to keep us read into 14th Street.
Now that now that we know we have to think about in a different way, just EJ I, don't know if this is out of order, but they there have been some hands raised from the public I, don't know if you want to I'm sorry, I did not I do not see those I want to give them an opportunity to UM to speak as well, especially since I recognize some of the names Gail Fox. Please go ahead, okay, hi!
For example, we've talked with folks at site, visits and other times about potentially making changes to University Place, which might include like a reversal of a block or something like that and that would have to go to the community board, would C be to other things like parking regulation.
Please sorry, children that we might, that really are responsive to things that we have been hearing that maybe it might make sense for us to do before community board okay and to the other question at least as far as fifth avenue is concerned.
Okay, no worries: I'm gonna, go to committee member Nancy I'm very concerned about the answer that d-o-t gave to Gayle Fox regarding the 14th Street bus way.
I know we've passed that topic, but the fact that he doesn't know what's going on and has not been spoken to is really troubling to me, because Gayle has come before our committee and before the full board many times to be heard by d-o-t, so I'm asking is there a way that we can get a list of the community members that do T is reaching out to regarding the 14th Street bus way?
It would be good to have more detail on what if any, ongoing community engagement looks like on the 14th Street bus way.
I think you know our plan was to have more quarterly reports and that involved probably more discussion with folks at the community board some more opportunities to give feedback.
In this district and there's a great deal of concern about how any proposed changes which right now or not very well defined, it seems, will impact a halt before commercial corridor between let's say the lower 60s and 42nd Street, so just something where we're looking forward to discussing with the community board and UT, but that that's very much on everybody's minds.
Are there any details that you know already there like, for example, is it can you say guarantee at this point that taxis and cars will theoretically be able to turn on for one block to make pickups and drop-offs similar to 14th Street, or is everything more or less up in the air pending the planning process that you talked about as far as I know, there's no intention of removing local access.
They can't continue down the corridor and you know we want to make sure that we also consider pickup drop-off areas on both sides of the street.
So you know, as we get further into the process, I think that's something we want to look carefully at block by block kind of acknowledging that every block is a little different and just making sure you know that we are meeting the needs of where people need to be where they need to access where they need to pick up drop-off.
I'm gonna go to Vincent Potrero and then we'll go back to Joseph Baumann Vincent, hi, I've spoken to Kimberly and Thank You Kimberly for the information you've given me, I represent the Metropolitan Park Association and we have members with parking garages on many of the side, streets or Fifth Avenue along this stretch and I think especially now, with businesses still trying to recover just beginning phase two that this is not the time to stop whatever to prevent automobiles from getting to garages, so they can think so.
You know it's not the time to be limiting things, and even though we hear that you know, car axis is going to be allowed, I mean to allow a car to go one block or one and a half blocks is really not the answer along Fifth Avenue, it's you know, I think it bad enough on 14th Street, but this is much different than 14th Street.
Don't at this time see any other hands raised, as I mentioned, I think there's a lot of different paths forward on both projects that we that we've asked for continued engagement on, but I like I, said I, don't think, there's a board action to take tonight, and so, if there aren't any other questions or comments, I believe we can wrap that topic and move on to the next one.
So thanks everybody for your patience as we go through a number of different topics: we've one more topic on the on the agenda on the website and then, as the committee members know, we want to discuss potential principles to hand off to one of our peer committees, but right now we'll let d-o-t talk about pedestrian hands, myths around Central, Park, South and Grand Army Plaza.
My name is MIA Moffat and I am a senior project manager in the pedestrian unit at the near City, Department of Transportation and I'm gonna be talking you through our proposal for Central Park South, Grand, Army, Plaza and 5th Avenue I'm gonna go over some background and updates to other work that we've done in the area for us.
So looking at our the markings that we're going to be putting in on the East Drive hack, stand, we're gonna be moving the pedestrian boarding area to be adjacent to that center median there, which is how its operating now and we're also going to be installing a curb extension on the southwest corner of 60th, Street and 5th Avenue at sixth Avenue.
Is there any plan to work with the hotel or do anything so that their loading zone can be more formalized and narrowed so that bikes and cars can get by and I can speak to I've already, we really shouts of a Plaza Hotel and we plan to meet with them and discuss the proposal and talk through issues in the area, but we usually come to the committee boards first with our proposal and then meet with stakeholders like that.
If it's, if it's well thought out, so you know I, think potentially teenie could write a resolution taking a position on the benefit to pedestrians and then also referring the effects on the landmark - to our own landmarks committee or perhaps, if it's Vicky might be able to tell us as well whether a resolution is appropriate for that or a letter or something else Jordan.
Do you have a question or comment on that issue and that's what I was going to say if we like what he's proposing and I for one do especially getting rid of that right term: southbound on Fifth Avenue over fifty nine shootings, redundant and dangerous.
If you go, hey I'll go ahead with the bus way and would make sure that this plan doesn't take away any options from that I think that's an excellent point and matches a theme where we always prefer a holistic and comprehensive look about how any changes affect the options and the overall traffic network of streets in the entire district.
Regarding this topic and I, you know folks, who have spoken up so far, seem to generally be supportive of these pedestrian enhancements with say some stipulations like Joel mentioned, examining whether or not time to lights are appropriate, suggesting that do t move forward with plans to talk to stakeholders like by the hotel that our pool will be conditioned on going to landmarks as well and considering network effect.
It expresses a sense of why we're talking about this now, but number two talks about what a positive vision of what transportation enforcement in our district should look like, and the principles that it should be underpinned by, but without leaping to a specific solution and, as I think would be most probably productive.
So with all of that have and said, you know, I see this as a as a as a scoped statement about what we think what we think the principle is, a good enforcement would look like and why we think that again, without getting into solutions and without getting into saying that the laws should actually be different than they are now so I'm, sorry that this long-winded I wanted to tee it up in that way.
I had a specific question about the second bullet point around automatic enforcement and just what was sort of the people who drafted this kind of intended to mean by that.
Don't know that I think automatic enforcement is a term that gets used as sort of a catch-all of ways to take the biased human enforcement as much as possible.
Another reason for us to be asking for a reimagine, so approach to enforcement is that this the demands on our streets and our streets are fundamentally changing and we're seeing it in such rapid speed by so much of what we consider here at this committee is so I think getting that point in about the way that our sidewalk is the demand on the curb.
The demands on the street are changing, and not only has the prior enforcement regime not worked just in general, but it's even further dealt fit for what's coming forward, so I think there's a prospective look ahead that should get in here.
I. Think there's a bike unit in the Central Park precinct, I'm, not positive, if they're still there any more of it, but so alternative methods, I, agree, 100%, you know if it's not added in ypd it's out of wherever it is my one point that I want to make it at college.
We don't know if it's d-o-t or the agency, who does it but I- think enforcement is really important of all our traffic laws of all the movement in a heavy pedestrian city.
Had a discussion with EJ a few days back that the starting to work on this- and you know my sentiment to EJ- was that I felt that we as a community board, like most community boards, had some complicity in the way in which the NYPD has treated people of color in our city.
Someone like me, who's not willing to vote YES on that to say what how do I think enforcement should happen otherwise and then to Joel's point.
But that's you know my reason for thinking that we do need to be pretty clear and pretty bold and if I recognize and appreciate and understand that is gonna be somewhat uncomfortable for some people and that's okay.
People who are in different places on this and I get it but I think there's a time to just sort of like put a marker down and say things have to change and we don't accept the status quo.
So you know I'm just trying to steer us toward a consensus a little bit and to find out, if, generally speaking, everyone's on board, which is what it sounds like right now, or whether there are kind of remaining, very serious concerns, otherwise I think we I think we would be well positioned to hand this to Beck's and again it's whatever Beck's does.
If there's inherently a political letter, I don't know I don't want to be for Simon or anyone else, but that's what I was thinking when I first read the letter and yep I mean I, certainly think about it as a as a very beginning of that whole pipeline, as I've said, and that's a first principles, sort of thing, and besides just feeling good about ourselves for having written a letter, I think it's valuable to define those principles that when there is something more specific to look at a month from now or a year from now, when actual changes are being proposed, we should be able to go back to our own principles and say is what is what's finally being proposed meet our criteria?
That's the reason ask is that the right now there's like five paragraphs of interim conclusion and three bullet points and I think if the goal is to communicate the principles, then focusing on the principles, probably matters, but if it's something that's going to lost for a while this, isn't it's not a coincidence that this is coming at this time and I could imagine five years from now somebody looking back.
