and also we want to be mindful of the time of the committee members and other applicants.
I will open up the floor to members of the public for questions and comments to the application.
These are photos of the building, as it is visible currently from a few vantage points over the past several years, beginning in 2012, a great deal of historic restoration and preservation works been done on the building, including restoration of the 42nd street storefront, replacing a more modern replacement that had been there for many years at the higher floors of the building.
Even from this vantage point, here's another view of the building looking west from times square along 42nd street, and you can see the building is now part of a fabric of high rises, and you know more obscured, obviously than it used to be by their presence tower roof at 130.
West 42nd street is a hip roof structure that is was originally roofed in baton, seam, copper and the reason that we're meeting tonight and presenting to you tonight is we're proposing to replace this roof and, as you can see now, it is no longer visibly batten, seam, copper, but underneath this is that copper and what you're seeing is a later installed modified, bitumen roof and layers of roofing mastic that were all applied over the copper as a way of repairing leaks over the years.
Typically, the committee gives sony more leeway to applicants for elements that are not visible I would also add for members of the committee who have not been on this committee for so long that this particular building has been in front of the committee numerous times and over the years the the ownership of the building has done a good job of restoring the the building.
I think, but this is the original condition, and so what you see there are projecting storefronts which were original to the building, and there is a an entry included, a little farther down a couple of entries actually on 18th street and those existed from the time of construction until the early 1920s.
Oh no, not next slide people stay here, go back to 1927 exactly so in 1924, the tendency of the the retail space changes to a bank, Ours goes away in the early 20s with the introduction of the bank at the at the retail space, and so here you can see that configuration that I was describing the large central bay, flanked by two narrower bays in the in the fifth avenue storefront and then and then shifts in signage, on the corner, pier and at the at the sign band at the second floor, cornice and a spectacular array of light bulbs at that point, , the storefronts, the infill and signage all change and evolve as the commercial use and So this as aaron said we're on the north northwest corner of 5th avenue and 18th street.
There was a storefront replacement program on the ground floor, which leads us to sort of the first major change on the roof which occurred in 1960 when there was a renovation of the infrastructure portion of the building, where two cooling towers were installed on the roof sort of directly behind the guardian light sign, and this was going to be consistent as we move forward in time by 1988.
you know actually did have, did utilize a lot of their rooftops, so whether it's the astor hotel, the biltmore or the ritz carlton So in a way, we also want to sort of replicate that in sort of today's language, for this building in on this very important location, overlooking union square all right.
This is a little key plan on the side, but you can see the the generator that's sort of sitting up there facing park, avenue south the cooling tower and then sort of this maze of ductwork and this large piece of mechanical equipment sort of right behind the w union square sign.
These are the elements that we're proposing to modify to be able to sort of tackle the the two-pronged approach of trying to deal with the infrastructure upgrades that we need to do on the building and also to provide rooftop access for people and for the public.
When we did that, of course, the stair bulkhead needs to also rise up as well, because we need to be able to get people out onto the roof and we also wanted to provide and need to provide elevator access for ada access up to the group, which, of course, for the 110 years of this history of the building that that's not currently exist.
So you'll see how we've you know intentionally taken the proposed structure and sort of tied it back to the bulkhead and sort of you know, leaned up against it, creating a setback along its full perimeter, which currently doesn't exist as well again, providing a little bit more relief from the sign and also the ability for people to be able to actually go up the edge of the building.
Since the south elevation of the building again you'll see the w sign cooling tower, the big mechanical unit that currently exists and the proposed glass structure that is sort of right behind the sign there set back in replace of that piece of equipment, as well as the expanded bulkhead that you can see sort of further beyond on the north east corner of the building on the park avenue side, you can see sort of the same comparison from what is today, the generator the bulkhead.
The piece of equipment which you can actually see in this comparison is shows how close it is to the sign versus what we are proposing here again, a very sort of simple formal structure up on the roof here that kind of just cleans up the roof line that may be visible minimally visible from the street and then the third facade is the east, That's very transparent both indoors and outdoors.
So from this vantage point, which is basically from the farmers market middle of the square, roughly 16th street, looking back at the building, there's actually really no difference between existing proposed or the mock-up.
If we sort of slide ourselves down park, avenue south towards 15th street and look back towards the building, you do see a few changes, so The third view is a view.
Members of the committee do we have questions, and I see that suzanne has her hand up suzanne go ahead, Yes, sure, of course you know, I think that we obviously wouldn't want to use, be able to use the space day and night.
Thank you any other questions on this application from members of the committee suzanne.
