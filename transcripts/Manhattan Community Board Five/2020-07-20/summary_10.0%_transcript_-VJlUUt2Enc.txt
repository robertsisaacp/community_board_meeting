It looks like in the chat I'm, seeing that one of the attendees is a member of the public that is blind using a talking computer, so I assume if they want to ask a question during that portion of the meeting.
So. First of all, thank you so much to all the members panelists and attendees who are joining us tonight, we're going to be discussing the draft scope of work related to the ohio station, complex project that was published by the governor of the state of New York on July 1st of 2020.
There will be a hearing held by the Empire State Development Corporation, which is the entity you know from the state of New York that has jurisdiction over this development and there's going to be a hearing on the scoping of this proposal on July 20th, so community board 5 needs to establish and develop a position on.
What is within the parameters that we want, you know discussed and reviewed and analyzed during the other reading process, so I'm gonna ask all members and attendees to actually refrain from commenting globally on.
I'm not sure I have the same of you as so, as you have on your computers and wait to be recognized before you speak, we will slice off via the conversation in questions and comments, but mostly you know we're gonna make comments, because you know we don't have a an applicant in the road to actually answer any other specific questions, and so, with all of that said, I think that it's fair, given you know the transit centric nature of this proposal to pass it on to EJ who is going to lead the conversation on transportation and transit, EJ.
Sorry, just an interrupt, it looks like we have a raised hand from Clayton I, don't know it's just pointing that out.
So it's basically you know that this board, that is appointed by the governor, that will have final say on approving the proposal by the governor there's going to be a number of hearings, but obviously the city, elected officials and agencies will not have the role that they would have in Euler.
You know all those things, so basically those are the questions tonight that we need to address and we need to figure out how we want to structure that to tell the sponsoring body what we want in the scope.
Thank you so, each if you, if you want to maybe start the conversation on the impacts to transit and infrastructure on this particular project, and then we can open up to members as a committee for questions and comments absolutely and before I guess the before I get started into some of the details.
The discussion tonight is not going to be what we think perfect train station looks like or what all of its capabilities should be or how we think this project should be executed, but the parameters for how that will be assessed and how its effects will be assessed.
The positioning of Madison Square Garden, where it is right now directly over the tracks that serve Amtrak and Long Island Railroad, New, Jersey Transit impacts the capabilities of what can be done to continue to increase and improve the capacity.
So the context of what the scope makes possible for the garden is going to be very important in terms of considering the capacity and future improvement that is open to not just the aesthetics of being inside Penn Station, but also actually continuing to increase the capacity of Penn Station, which of course, I said 650,000 commuters a day.
Six, seven and site a could be redeveloped as a not just redeveloped here, as is being proposed for new towers or new office space, or whatever is kind of vaguely alluded to in this document so far, but also for a potential new location for the garden that is leaving as many of those options open as possible is one reason why it's somewhat not suspicious, but detrimental for that whole block.
You know with a ceiling higher than 80 going forward, but to actually improve its transit capacity and in future development, creating capacity to move the garden somewhere down the road.
There could be an argument that the redevelopment on the actual Macy's block and going across 34th Street could be part of the part of the discussion as well, so that in sorry to go on for a little bit, but that, in a nutshell, are kind of all the interconnected implications of why this why some of these project areas seem to be defined the way they are on this map and why I think there's a very strong argument that extending the project area to contain the rest of that block that contains site six is probably something we want to push for very strongly, because it was part of the conversation already and because it's not doing so I think severely limits our understanding of what can be done and severely limits the possibilities of the types of transit improvements that are going to be possible and with that underscoring of some of the issues.
Don't know that would be considered part of the Penn complex master plan or not, but there should be something from the MTA about how they want to improve those stations included in the in the plan, yeah I J.
The master plan does not at this point, seem to be creating any new subway lines or subway capacity or and to affect local subway transit in any sort of specific way, but certainly the entrances and the capacity should be part of that discussion.
Okay, just to be on the safe side, we will add it as a recommendation so that you know we clearly tell the sponsor entity of this project that you know the it should be assessed in the environmental review process.
So currently, although it falls within the parameter, you know that the perimeter of the district that is being proposed for the year the land whose action it is actually not part of the action, the same way as EJ, explained the transit below grade transportation.
You know that the proposal sponsored by the ESD is a proposal that calls for the relocation of the garden that it is found that it is thought that he not just an alternative, because typically alternatives are studied their environmental impact study, but that doesn't mean that we're gonna go with the alternative more likely than not, especially in this political context.
So I think we absolutely need to call for alternatives, but the you know areas where we really want these changes to be included.
Think that is something that we should raise, because I think that just having you know an underground long hallway that doesn't provide the opportunity to transfer between those two stations without having to swipe in a second time is just something that I think we should raise, because it's not clear the document and then additionally, in terms of station entrances, I'm sure that a DA accessibility will inevitably be a large part of this scoping document.
Ok, I, definitely something that we can add in the scope of the proposal, any other comments or questions we're going to try to really stick to transit and transportation.
So, if you, if you look closely at you know the way the proposal is structured, the wall really of this redevelopment is to actually provide I mean.
That would then you know, unlock capital that currently doesn't exist to actually do those transit upgrades that part of the of the master plan once again, just to make it very clear and reiterate what EJ said previously, the master plan is not what is in front of us okay, so we don't know what the master plan is going to be.
All we know is that there is a big land use proposal and observing where the governor purchases lands in these areas through eminent domain or negotiation, and then observes these areas, meaning that he basically creates additional allowed density, and he sells this density and through the proceed of this sale, this will finance and fund the below grade improvements.
So there is a case to be made given who the stakeholders are, and in this process that you know maybe alternate sources of funding should actually be considered and that could dramatically change the scope of this proposal.
So I would like to have us consider you know, adding the funding as in part of the scope and that the scope should basically be revised, because more federal money should be poured into improving Penn Station rather than you know, creating density that would basically be negatively impacting community about five.
So you know I think the scope should be revised to include that language, but I would love to hear your thoughts on that and, if you guys don't share any thoughts, I will assume you agree.
More generally, is it possible for us to have to look at alternate ways of raising revenue, particularly through taxes, to have that be incorporated in the scoping plan or because that touches on some remastering rather than and the sound quality is not excellent, but I think I gathered the gist of your question, so we can certainly do that.
I personally believe that you know given who the stakeholders are there's a strong case to be made that it should be federal, but certainly you know, other forms of funding could totally come into play, but right now and once again, we're not really commenting on the marriage.
We'll have an opportunity to do that, but what I would like to include is to say you actually have a challenge and the burden is upon you to prove that you need to do this project that it is necessary and we believe that you can get money elsewhere and that we community board five should not be hit with the full burden of generating the revenue so that you can do these upgrades that you know I, think everybody agrees that you know.
I think we need to be as specific as we can so that our comments are not lost in you know the thickness and density of you know all the comments that the agency is going to receive.
You know, like the master plan for redevelopment of Penn Station and we're to you know generous me, decide that there's going to be a eight billion funding line in the next federal budget, then the need for this particular land-use action would disappear.
They, the proposal, talks about the need from office space and the need for better buildings and a more you know, a better environment around Penn Station.
I think that it's you know it's fair to say there should be other forms of funding and therefore the need for this proposal would be you know putting in question and therefore the scope she should be altered.
You know the most obvious is, for example, you know direct residential displacement, which actually will happen and is going to be studied and more likely than not will not rise to the level of significance and I will explain that in a moment.
You know some local stores and office space is going to disappear, but further than that as you're saying it is basically going to create a you know, influx of commercial real estate in close proximity to others, you know so mean orchestrate some in import for, and it is perfectly valid to wonder if it's legitimate and certainly it should be evaluated so I think it's totally fair to actually ask that this becomes part of the scope.
So unless someone has further questions about the funding, I think we can move on to the next bucket, which is going to mediate urban design, historic resources and socio-economic impact.
I think it's important that we include you know impact like role impact to do the commercial real estate market.
But whenever we've seen these huge developments, we've been concerned about hospitals and places for the homeless and around transportation hubs like Madison I like the garden and the Long Island Railroad and Penn Station, there's always a homeless situation and I, don't know if this is a proper place to insert something about our concern with this massive huge development of office space there's some concerned be made for the city in general in terms of homelessness, yeah, I, think I.
Addressing this specific issue of homelessness and in hospital needs and I think that it is very important that it is assessed in the environmental impact statement.
Similarly, to the way we worked with other community boards in the process of Eastman I think that you know there's strength in numbers and you know they probably share a number of our concerns, and you know they are technically less impacted because what's happening is really in our district, but actually their board has been like a member of their board has been appointed to the CAC, which is the Community Action Council that the ESD has appointed as part of the review process of this of this proposal.
That being said, the my understanding- and you know the many unanswered question at this point, but my understanding is that the zoning, the underlying zoning of the area, would be commercial and therefore, in a commercial district, a residential development is as of right, so it could be a possibility that one of those sites would become resident and as such, it could be market rate or affordable, and, as such, the impact of these residential developments are entirely excluded from this environmental study, meaning that you know if a building were to be residential.
You know the possibility of a scenario where some of these Lots would become residential, but as of now it is not part of the proposal and then I just want to tack on into the transit transportation piece.
You know the environmental impacts of the development, but I think it's definitely something that you should be advocated for I, agree right and then I don't know if it's within the scope.
So this could be an opportunity if they're expanding that corridor, an area to really offer to both minorities and WBS people for those opportunities right to open up businesses and I'm tacking on to what David said earlier, there's so many homeless as it is even outside now, 13 14 17, a in that open space, there's so many homeless, people there so I think again, there's going to be an incredible amount of you know displacement as well.
When it comes to whether they will recommend some sort of strategies for mitigating that walk, I'm wondering if there's anything, we can do to ask for a more firm commitment that they will actually propose some solution, because I mean if the plan goes through with getting demolished.
We need to make sure that all these issues are in scope and something to keep in mind is that we can ask, for you know specific.
Great I would be very supportive of including something like that, and that actually leads directly into my next comment, which was about the direct residential with displacement, so that was one of the places where it did not meet their thresholds for consideration, because they're not creating more than 200 units.
It looks like July yeah as a member wants the comments, but can raise her hand for bringing that to my attention.
If you currently, you know visual resources, so I think you know we should look into those, but I would love to hear other people's thoughts on the urban design and the impact that that's gonna have and I see that Dave Achilles has his hand up Dave go ahead, yeah for the incredible amount of GSF on this project.
So if there was something that these buildings can do, instead of sheer office space to become offering more to the public other than the obvious transportation of but other than that, because it seemed to be much in the way of public amenities as it stands now, yeah very true I mean they were proposing one tiny, little Plaza green area between two very large buildings and the existing 33rd Street closure would remain.
So one thing that I would want to ask is: how can we try to nail down with more specificity which of our open public spaces, some of which are new york city park?
You know I think it ties to making a threshold recommendation where you know it's not only necessary that the shadows study, but that thresholds for mitigation, be you know, meaningful and that this mitigation also be meaningful, because right now the mitigation that has been offered on other developments is actually just saying.
Well, so it's you know, I think we need to say that if indeed there's gonna be shadows on open space, it has to be mitigated in a significant way, which is basically be massing, the building so that it doesn't cause so much shadows well and actually Leila to that end, is there a way that we can, as we have in the past, in a normal Euler process, call for shadow impact studies for Bryant Park for Madison Square Park for anywhere that we think that this degree of FA are might actually impact.
Can that can some sort of mechanism to ensure that the air rights don't land in other parts of the city, a part of the scoping process I didn't think of that?
Then there is a determination that needs to be made that yeah, okay, you know it is worth a you know to if they are or three-fer, and this is how you build your added density.
You know 100,000 square feet of additional development rights and you pay that much in exchange it is you know you provide these upgrades that the city has identified as being necessary and then you get the permission to build more density and you also have to contribute to a fund that serves the public.
Yeah I think that you know it is so many something when the time comes to really.
You know discuss the substance that we should be asking for I think we can ask in the scope that you know the open space study and then the threshold be lowered.
You know there should be adequate open space provided so we may want to add language as it footage I see that BJ has her hand up EJ go ahead, actually like it I met.
Is this project still on track and then the second part of my comments last question is you know, as many of us know, during concerts and sports Kings met around Madison Square Garden, the traffic is just absolutely horrible, and especially during when you're trying to get an uber or and then a lot of one-way streets right so I think and I.
Don't know why this fits in, but it's around you know traffic flow, that's going to be impacted both because of the construction time and then what will happen because of the more buildings and more population people coming today yeah.
Very much so, as you could tell you know, the governor reads the scope ten days ago, thirteen days ago, so yeah I think the philosophy is to basically consider that you know it's anybody's guess what will be the current condition of the city in 16 years.
Dave Achilles you ever sort of follow up on what EJ had to say in terms of the socio-economic impact of Madison Square Garden, that for the last 50 years, has been home to all of New York City's sports teams, as well as its chief entertainment arena that whether there's going to be an alternative in the proposal or whatever happens to the garden.
Okay, I joined a little late, but can you just explain for me I'm just observing this, the relationship between the expansion of transit capacity at this site and its potential expansion or limitation by the scope of the project that were commenting on you know we is the is the governor and this plan painting himself into a corner.
I thought I heard you say that that's not currently in the scope, we're just commenting on the space on the size of it and how it's going to impact.
Not it's not in the scope yeah, so EJ actually discussed that at the beginning of the meeting he do you want to.
One of the other committee members make is that you know, got our government in dealing with these kind of a notoriously backward-looking and how they interpret these things and I was just looking at the plan, and you know it's basically, a series of huge office buildings, hotels and commercial space surrounding Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.
So we totally agree with you and we agree with those kinds, but there would be an opportunity to actually comment on the substance of the proposal itself in the process and the different phases and in the review of a big line, land transaction like this one.
The first step is to really comment on the scope, so that we can make sure that what is evaluated is exactly what we feel is important and significant and that we have an opportunity to shape that when the time comes to actually discuss the matter.
You know what is the environmental impact of this big land-use action and will have an opportunity to comment and hopefully to shape what that will look like.
Was it okay, great your hand is up go ahead, so this is sort of a combination of what Zach said and what Todd said and I think this might not be something that we can address at this stage, but is it possible to make in a consideration here only when it comes to the revenue that would be generated by the project, a consideration of his impact on the office market?
Okay, I see none, so one more area that, on this bucket, that I think is important to discuss, is actually the impact to our historic resources.
We had a interesting conversation this morning with the New York landmarks Conservancy, and they actually have commissioned a survey of all the historic resources that they are currently you know pulling and working on and we're hoping that they're going to be able to share that with us and that will greatly inform you know the type of recommendation that we can make, but certainly we want to make sure that, in the way the historic resources are assessed is not simply to come back to us and say well, yeah, there's no landmark elates and therefore the impact that basically, they really need to look at.
Concerns on this topic, I think we talked about it already just want to make sure that we're kind of like following the process, yeah Chris, go ahead.
Sorry I know I'm talking a lot, and this might actually come up in the public comment section, but would we be proposing that they look at a situation in which the transit expansion happens on the other side of the Hudson in New Jersey?
You know show us what you have show us, what you can do you know as a better proposal and also specifically show us what would happen if you take X, Y, Z steps and so asking them to consider the development agency in New Jersey and said.
There's talk about the actual project itself, having an alternative where development happens in New Jersey, instead of happening in midtown, Manhattan I know that that's a separate conversation, but would it be too specific about to ask that they consider a situation in which the fundamental assumptions of this project was before us right now, which are that and station would continue to be the hub of regional commerce of regional transit rather, where that assumption sort of goes away because the development is in fact having is happening in New Jersey.
You know if the community in New Jersey were in the room and saying you know what we would really like to have this development, and you should actually advocate for that.
Five, it was like oh yeah put in sleep, it's like well wait, so I think that we can make a recommendation that alternates of you know alternative scenarios be evaluated for development elsewhere, without necessarily being specific on where that could happen.
You know the brilliant idea right now that I think we should start thinking about it and in the scoping we should basically say that such part of the development should be included and should be evaluated for environmental impacts yeah.
But on top of that do we want to say you know: okay, you're, going to generate twenty million square feet of development.
I get it and the greater good of the region is, very importantly, very critical, but we're basically asked to pick up the tab, so I think it's looking fair to say: okay, you know it's, we get it, but out of that, something really specific to our needs need to come out of this development, and you know maybe we're gonna say well.
You know Madison Square Garden and it would impress the building and in the vicinity it's well we're thinking about having some sort of a tourist office or for tourists who come in I.
But there's tons of you know what worthwhile areas around there, including the Koreatown, as well as the Flatiron District, the genious plan, I, think often when people come out from Penn Station, particularly people are lost unless it's the taxi, dispatcher and there's no one guiding them so some sort of like a tourist.
You know we have been obviously less involved because it's not in our district, but it looks like the governor actually said, has time to redevelop, LaGuardia and do this train system that is going to get into Jamaica and will not be a direct connection.
You know we should emphasize when we when we argue for making sure that moving the garden is in scope and widening the tracks and widening the platforms that I think is within the realm of what we should be arguing for right now, and we can talk about all those possibilities as part of the argument for it in this document, without necessarily buying our own hands.
You know not to be too specific about where they should happen, but I think when we talk about some capacity for community space, you know how about a you know: museum area dedicated to the history of the original Penn Station.
Some sort of you know tie-in to yes, Historical Society of New York right some area dedicated to education and community space.
You know having a meeting place for community board five to have some sort of auditorium space or some area that can be used for that I.
You know, dreaming big and asking for both a park, which a thing is that there's a very strong case to be made, as well as the community space I think we can have both.
I want to tack onto what Aaron said, and you know the nonprofit sector plays a huge role in the vitality and health of our New York City, and you know, the nonprofit sector is a great partner to have, and one of things is to maybe work on some sort of, like public benefit, to offer incentives to nonprofits to open up their offices.
If you want to hear our comments, you know from two things.
So we're going to speak a lot to all those things and I encourage you to also raise it, because it's a lot when you start to have that such tall buildings, it's a lot of conflict, yeah, they're, very good point and I think we all totally agree that you know the ad grade redevelopment I think this is probably the area that holds most promise in this proposal.
Perhaps we want to say that the scope should really as transformative ly as possible, think about ways to actually increase in a holistic way, the pedestrian flow of the area.
But there's tremendous choke points and pedestrians just like on the street during rush hour when you're talking about 8th, Avenue and 7th Avenue on those specific stretches- and we may want to say that shouldn't just be transformed into a sheer you know, it should be as it should be assessed from the perspective of how can those pedestrian thoroughfares be improved as well from a more holistic viewpoint by thinking about the whole.
So I think if you make sense to recommend that these areas are included in the scope.
You know so that at the time that we get the opportunity to comment on the proposal itself, we can make those recommendations and advocate for those.
Are there any other comments or questions before we go to wrapping up this very long meeting, Leila I'm, not sure I, don't remember anyone mentioning Macy's and any proposed development on the block to the north, but should we discuss perhaps that being potentially part of the expanded scope, and so you know what once again, I don't I don't feel super comfortable making recommendations when you know for a particular party, when the party is not in the room, we have not heard that Macy's wants to be included in this development.
As you know, we want to make sure that the environmental study is done in a comprehensive way.
Think it's totally fair and therefore you know the whole residential component should be evaluated and part of the scope yeah.
Thank you so much for your participation and keep thinking about it because it's gonna keep us busy, for you know the next year or two.
