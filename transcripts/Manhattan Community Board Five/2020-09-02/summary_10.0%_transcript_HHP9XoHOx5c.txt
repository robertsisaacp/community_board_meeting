This a section of this proposal has been in front of the board before in front of the landmarks committee, because there's a landmark component so for the edification and given the complexity of this proposal, they wanted to give us a presentation, and we felt that it was a good idea so that we can digest all this material So members of the the court theater, if you want to bring a screen up, if you have a visual presentation that you want to share with us, you can do that or if you want to Hello, everybody in community board five.
That's going to remain and finally lot 11, which is owned by clarity, is the site of a new hotel and that's the hotel that will , we hope, receive the benefit of the bonus floor area generated by the theater rehabilitation.
The ability to use bonus floor area anywhere on the zoning lot, regardless of where it's been generated, and, secondly, the text amendment would clarify the description of qualifying rehabilitation work because this proposal, as you will see kind of expands the envelope on what has been done in the past to enhance and modernize a broadway theater.
This being one of them, we were able to find places where we could build accessible restrooms, but unfortunately, there was just absolutely no space at the court theater next and the I mentioned earlier, the bars you see the the bars are basically at the rear of the seating area at the top on the plan, the plan drawing on the left there, the bar is highlighted in yellow In that relatively small crossover, the area behind the seats, it can be a nightmare at intermission.
So next, so here we're showing the planned view of stage level or street level showing theater, plus annex Drawing you see, evie there is an elevator and the elevator was placed there to be able to serve audience during show times when the public is in the theater and then during the day time or during loadings or loadouts, when scenery is brought in and set up, and the elevator can also serve the show and will be very valuable, even on a daily basis, to allow wardrobe people to wheel their wardrobe racks to costumes and place them in the dressing rooms on upper floors.
So you see, on the right hand, side to the very right, a stack of floor plans showing the old, inadequate dressing rooms and then the new, much more than doubling in size, also with a specific wardrobe area, where the costumes can be much better maintained away from the stage as it's proper and then also accommodations for hair and wig for shows that need that separate facility next, We get to remove that stair that encumbers the loading door, because we will have access otherwise to the understage, and we will also create a room there where recyclable and trash containers can be put that are out of the weather, but essentially out of the building.
They will go down a stair to the under stage level and right backstage so that if the audience is at the theater early and people associated with the show do not have to go through the public areas to get backstage and get to work next.
So if you were sort of touching bases in this statute, we think that this project would do all of the things that it needs to do to support the bonus and, as julio said in the beginning, the fact that there is this kind of investment in the theater business at this time is itself a strong indication of support for the theater legitimate theater, for broadway and for the city next, and this is the last slide.
Another new hotel to the west along 7th avenue, so these are what we're talking about here- I just want to make sure that everybody on the committee, especially the new members, understand what community board five's position was on the landmarks portion of this application.
So, as the applicants mentioned and explained, there is a big restoration component to this to this proposal and this restoration had to go through the landmarks preservation commission for review and approval and before they went to lpc it had to be reviewed by the community board So we basically had you know great support for the alteration and restoration to the theater itself Certainly the component that we're looking at today we're not relitigating the landmarks position of community board.
So this is a boundary that has that quality for commercial uses and so that, in order to transfer the floor area in order to both generate the bonus in both sides of the line and to utilize all of the commercial floor area in the c5.5 effectively transferring it across the line, we need to have a text change because it would result in a slightly higher footprint, far in the c5.5 than would otherwise be permitted in terms of the 230 There are two as of right mechanisms for enlarging the hotel.
Okay, the 1977 special permit, modified, heightened setback and approved the floor area bonus for the arcade, which extends from 57th street to 56th street it all the building also included as of right bonuses for a covered pedestrian space, which is a triangular shape outlined in red, an urban plaza on the corner of 56th street and the arcade I mentioned, which is a corner arcade at the corner of madison and 57th street within the interior public space.
There is also a seating, slash retail area of approximately 3 500 square feet that did not receive a bonus, but since it's within the envelope of the space is also governed by the approved drawings of the special permit.
The proposed cafe seating, which would take up approximately 1400 square feet of that 3 500 non-bonus area is designed to visually integrate the cafe seating with the larger public space.
If there are no questions in terms of the action before you I'd like dan to not only discuss how the proposed changes to establish his cafe seating, but also detail the upgraded public space signage that we've agreed to do to reflect city planning's recent public space dan.
This indicates the entries the primary entries to the space, the through block the building itself and This is a picture of the existing facility prior to the pandemic when it was still functioning and as you can see, through the landscaping elements and some of the other pieces that made the the facility function, that it essentially created a boundary that is not in keeping both visually or with the city planning regulations regarding open air cafes, our proposal jc the next slide, please, is simply removes the landscaping elements that are around there and installs simple, elegant moving partitions that are transparent.
There are those seats at the bar, so to speak, there's a high table next to the window and then, of course, the seating throughout we've moved the service areas, so they are not in the public space proper.
What exactly is in front of us and who has jurisdiction over this particular area, given that it is a non-bonus area is still part of the pops and yes, it is absolutely Technically we city planning has asked that we amend the restrictive deck to call out this area as a pedestrian access area, a paa which would give it some more legal standing, but within that paa would be the kiosk, which is a required amenity of the largest phase, and this cafe seating, which is what we're seeking to show on the approved plans.
, the kiosk, which is on the approved plans, has both you know, grab and go for the public space or for office or whatever, and had added this sit-down element to it, which otherwise would be permitted.
What they found out was that by adding a sit-down element, they were able to expand the offering on the menus, because you have a you know and also obtain a liquor license because they had a defined space and that, in turn, made the cafe Oh, I have this landscaped area.
It never diminished the public amenities in terms of the number of tables or chairs being provided for the public or the other amenities, the sculpture, wasn't location wasn't moved Overall, we have not had resistance from city planning and on any level, because even the covered pedestrian space to the north that permitted under the fifth avenue districts up to one-third of the area could be an open air cafe.
It was just listed as a you know, retail seating area, so we were not operating in accordance with the approved plans and hence we had to go through a minor modification of special permit.
So you know if it were like a brand new application, they would basically say: okay, we want to install you, know 12 tables and 24 seats right.
with the with the applicant to share what our policy is and what our views are of this specific application Thinking of a specific other example, where we've allowed a cafe under the same rules, but where it's had the same sort of segregated area, you know tied to the kiosk, even with say a sandwich board, You know with the partitions specifically making it look like a private restaurant.
That is correct, because if anyone comes into this space, children, teenagers, young people they're under their underage- So what I would like to do is to move out of business sessions so that we can communicate to the applicant what our policy is on these types of applications, and then we can move back to to business session, so we're out of business session, and I just want to communicate to the applicants that typically, you know in the instance that we're not dealing with it with a violation there would be no tables and an applicant would come to us with an application to install more tables would basically typically support such application, provided that the number of tables is reasonable tables and chairs, and we would ask that these tables are open to non-purchasing visitors and that they're open to the public and not reserved for the patrons of such establishment.
Okay, let's hear what the what the applicant has to respond to our policy if any, and then we can continue back to business session , I'm actually aware of you, having articulated our policy for open air cafes that are actually taking away from what otherwise is bonus public space.
I think there are a number of levels of distinction here, one we're not in we're not occupying bonus space, whereas the outdoor cafe the entire area was open to the public in order to achieve the bonus, and the open-air cafe allows up to 20 of the area to be restricted for cafe seating as a permitted obstruction.
They didn't like the barriers they wanted us to use the open air bonus regulations that were just the white lines on the on his case on the floor, but came to the realization that, because of the liquor license type of operation, that would jeopardize our ability to operate such a such a premises because we couldn't define it, someone could theoretically order a glass of wine, a bottle of wine and just walk off without knowing that they were supposed to be sitting in a designated area.
I joined a distinction between you know a cafe physically sitting outside on a bonus, plaza, that's generated floor area bonus, and I understand your position that the public should not lose that and the amount of privatization should be limited here.
The first one is there's a violation that basically has triggered a chain of events that you know the seating started to creep in If this were, you know brand new situation, we had an applicant who would come and say you know this is a non-bonus area.
If there wasn't liquor, then perhaps we could push more for having the whole area open, but given that and also the being in the non-bonus space, I think should be appropriate.
