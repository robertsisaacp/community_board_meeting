To our full board for action until september this evening we have four agenda items. The first is a present presentation from lucas wolfe and elizabeth berg from scott stringer's office. They're going to be talking about this comptroller stringer's, strong school plan and we'll use this to educate the committee on the comptroller's approach to safely reopening schools. Vex is going to have a lot more on schools at our next meeting. So this presentation is not an action item for this evening. The second item we have on the agenda is the parent coordinator, patricia laria from the school of the future. Patricia is going to talk to us about some of the issues facing her school and in her particular request for open streets for school of the future. They want to access some parking spaces in front of the school for peak times. Obviously this crosses a little bit into our transportation committee. So we'll hear this as a potential letter of support and we can then forward that to transportation. Our third item is we're going to hear from abigail bessler from council member power's office she's going to discuss the small business tax credit against the commercial rent tax bill that is put forward by council member powers. Members of the committee is gonna. Are we probably will recall that council member powers came- and he spoke to us about this bill right before covet and that's about the commercial tax that affects businesses below 96th street you'll, probably recall that we were about to support that bill with a resolution it was drafted and then covet came along, and so we were waiting to see what would develop with regard to that bill. So here we are now we can discuss the adoption of a resolution, that's in line with the new updates. If, in fact that's what we decide to do and finally we're going to discuss the proposed resolution- that's been circulated, which is a compilation of our conversation and views on the nypd and the budget joseph freer and july, and rob and joe did trojan's work on that. You'll recall our conversation in the meeting, not the last meeting, but the one before that on the nypd in the budget and they've, distilled that into a resolution that we will look to adopt this evening. Quick, quick overview of how the committee works. Each presenter will speak about their issue and after the presentation is concluded, the committee will be prepared permitted to ask questions of the presenter when all the committee's questions have been answered. Members of the public will be able to ask questions of the presenter and then, once all those questions have been addressed, the committee will go into business session and that's when only members of the bex committee discuss the issue amongst themselves and determine what action to take we're somewhat different by we. I I mean bex than other committees within community board five and that we don't have applications so that our determinations are not as straightforward. We can decide to draft a resolution. We may decide to seek further information or use the presentation to inform our collective knowledge and we're going to do that tonight, for example on the issue of safe schools. If we do decide to draft a resolution, it'll be voted on by all present members of bex and then, if the resolution passes amongst us, it'll be presented for cb five board for a vote and then that vote is the full position of the board. As I mentioned our last, our next full board meeting is september 10, so anything we do tonight will not be heard in action by cb5 until that time we have a lot to do tonight. So with that, I will kick it off and begin with lucas and elizabeth, hey everybody, I'm luke wolf from comptroller scott stringer's office. We also have elizabeth byrd, who is our education policy expert on the phone as well, so together we'll be kind of presenting some of our thoughts around school reopening. I want to start by thanking renee and julie and the rest of the committee for inviting us to share more around our thoughts. We know right now. Schools are top of mind for everyone, because there's just the number of people and families and children. It impacts, and we all know the experience that so many had in the spring. With remote learning and how many flaws, whether it's the technological process on the learning side, with meals, with kind of everything in between- and we kind of, took all that feedback and all we heard from across the city and boils into a number of different recommendations for how we think it's a pass for schools to reopen safely and also prioritize quality instruction going into the fall I'll. Let elizabeth jump into more on that in a second, but I also kind of want to preface that these are our office recommendations that we've sourced from talk to a number of different stakeholders: families, students, teachers, kind of across the educational spectrum. They're, not what the doe is rolling out. We are pushing the doe to adopt some of our recommendations, which I think will be aligned with some of the things that the best committee has come out with or will be coming out with. At least I hope. But these are things that we are pushing as our office. Based on our experience and conversations, we probably have many of the same questions that you all have about how school will look in the fall. I think we also wish that we had more answers, as do so many students and families from across the city. So as we keep on pushing and finding out more we'll, certainly let you guys all know if there's certain things that you all want us to push on or think that hey. This is something that is not currently in your plan, but something we're hearing about and really think that should be part of your plan folks going forward, please let us know. I hope that this is not just us or answering questions and our thoughts, but you also, hopefully given us some good ideas that we can borrow and move the ball forward on as well. On that note, elizabeth, I don't know if you want to go through some of our plans, some recommendations and some of our work on reopening more broadly or yeah, and I can just preface it by saying again reiterating the fact that this is not a representation of necessarily the department of education's plans. In fact, we, you know we were huddling with a lot of parents and education experts, and you know different people who wanted to sort of give us input. I think wanting to provide some of their concerns and asking our office to make recommendations to the department of education ahead of their releasing any plans, and so when, when we, you know released our set of recommendations, it was in the spirit of you know, hoping to provide guidance and feedback in some ways. A lot of I feel like, even though this was you know like about a month ago. It feels almost like ancient history, because so much has happened this in the in. In that time period, the state has released its guidance on reopening schools and more clarity around requirements, and then obviously the department of education has made a set of different announcements. I don't need to go into every single recommendation, but I thought it maybe would be helpful just to kind of guide through the to the the way we thought about school reopening in terms of two separate sets of recommendations, one on safety and prioritizing how to actually reopen school safely and then another set of recommendations for ensuring strong instruction and hopefully addressing and mitigating some of the troubles that happened in the actual instructional portion of the school year last year, as everybody shifted to remote learning. So in the in the reopening school safely, it's a lot of what you would probably expect talking about the necessity to wear, masks and establish small cohorts of students. One thing that you know we have really been pushing the city on is to look into pooled testing, where numerous groups of you know, a group of students could all provide a sample test and then that test result is is one. One test is basically performed for an entire pool and it's a way to more inexpensively. I guess run a lot of tests and then you can go back and trace any positive results, obviously also having a full-time nurse on staff. I I know this is a concern for a lot of families and is not getting as much attention as I thought it would that there is a real shortage of nursing staff and it's something that you know. We've been talking to the administration about not just in this set of recommendations, but in subsequent communications that we've had with the mayor's office as well, and then one thing that has actually gotten a lot of attention is on the need to identify more outdoor spaces for learning activities and again. This is under that bucket of safely reopening schools. We know that virus transmission has been lessened significantly with being outdoors, and so we've included that, as a recommendation, we've been really discouraged that the mayor has seemed to be very dismissive in a way of the possibility, but I I think that this is something that has gotten a lot of attention. A lot of support from parents- and you know we'd love to see the city be more creative in ways that it could expand the use of outdoor spaces for learning activities, and you know again, I'm not going to go through every single recommendation. There are, you know many, but you know that's kind of a summary of some of the ways that you know. We wanted to encourage the safe reopening of school buildings in terms of ensuring strong instruction, there's sort of a separate set of recommendations, and they really largely focus on the need for additional staffing and child care capacity. I think, in terms of thinking of teachers in a blended learning model needing to provide support to students in both a remote learning environment, as well as in the classrooms it and potentially having groups of students in different parts of the building. At the same time, it it definitely feels like the city is at a critical point, where we need more more staff in schools, and it seems like a potentially a great opportunity to establish a hiring pipeline and- and let this be a potential job, professional development and professional training program. For you know bringing people into classrooms. They obviously would need training and develop and professional development, but additional support could be helpful. We included a recommendation on a scheduling model. We had heard from several people who were very convincing about the idea that a split schedule would be really helpful as an option for schools having students, one group of students come every morning. One group of students come every afternoon with a break in the middle of the day to clean classrooms. This has not been adopted by the city, it's not something that seems to be even really remotely under consideration. I know that there are a lot of logistical challenges to any of the scheduling options, but you know our office was really compelled by the evidence that having a regular touch point to the day is ultimately the one of the most important things you can give students, but understandably it seems like it's not something that has received a lot of support from the administration and and lastly, I'll just say the the needs for sustaining the child care sector. I think we are you know really hearing this. Our office has definitely been hearing this from families that their ability to imagine another school year where there is remote learning or blended learning and trying to return to work. There needs to be a bigger bolder investment in child care and the child care sectors really struggling. So we included some recommendations there as well and then very very finely is the need to invest more in high quality, remote learning. I think so many people who have gone through this experience have had the main consistency has been the variety of experiences, and it's really been telling that you know it's not even school by school, but teacher by teacher how their experience was with remote instruction and wanting to be able to level the playing field, knowing that remote construction, no matter how schools reopen in the fall or whether they reopen in the fall. What is sure is that there will be some ongoing dependence on remote instruction and really needing to push the city to make that a high quality experience as possible. Of course, that means every student needs access to a device and reliable internet, but it also means that there needs to be a real baseline for instruction outreach for professional development for teachers there. There are ways to make remote instruction better, and it's not. You know again. This is something that we've pushed the city on in a few different times and places, and I think we'll need to continue to follow up with them to find out more about the data that has been made available or or that hasn't even been tracked at all from the fall. I think that's could really help us in in framing the need for more consistency across the board. So that's a kind of an overview of a framework of our you know our set of recommendations. I think you know I don't want to devote too much time to it, but it it's. Obviously it's available happy to share the link to the report and field any questions at all. Thank you. So much sorry, thank you. So I dropped the link in the chat to both our report ellis colors, op-ed, calling for use for more outdoor space and a little bit touched on, but I think one of the things that we're really thinking about as an office is president. Before I work for the comptroller, I was a teacher for three years in high school in the city and jobs already up, and especially with all these other things going on it really. It needs to be an all hands on deck effort and there's transparency of communication kind of early and often, but I think the one thing that we're really hoping for is more creativity in that how we test students to ensure schools are safe, how we staff up schools, how we conduct remote learning. Obviously, we need to follow the best evidence and pedagogical knowledge available, but this is unprecedented. We need to kind of borrow from what we've seen work and not work around the city and around the world, but also really be be able to get creative in terms of, if there's an open street outside of the school. How can we use that as not only a place to sit into a classroom like we reimagine? What outdoor learning experience could look like, there's a park across the school across the street? How can I become a science lab for students? So we're not just saying okay we're going to take what's going on inside and move it outside, but also make it so that we're having the most enriching possible experience for students throughout the whole process. So I think that's just kind of something we're thinking about as well is how can we make sure that we're not just doing the bare minimum here in opening schools, but also making it the best possible experience, because these are students and every single day they have a chance, it's going to get the education they deserve and even though everything's going on in the world, we need to do the best that we can to give them that opportunity. So on that, I don't know if, let's let you have anything else or any questions from the committee. Thank you. Thank you. Luke. Could everybody on the bottom? You can see the raise hand function. Does anyone have any questions for luke and elizabeth rachel? Can you hear me we can okay. Thank you. So much for all that information. I think there's a ton of great ideas there, and so thank you. I'm wondering if your office has thought about metrics and measuring success of remote learning and how we track student outcomes in the next year or years. It seems to me like a lot of the ways we track progress and measure progress at various schools will need to be adapted, and I have not really seen much about that in terms of best practices so wondering if that's something your office has thought about at all or if you've heard of kind of any work, that's being done around the city on that yeah. I think that's such a great question. That is something that we have. I mean like. I know that the way the department of education so far has been monitoring like just basic student attendance is really not what what you or I might think of in terms of what attendance is it's it's tracking student engagement, which could be anything from you know. Turning in an assignment on google classroom to you know a phone call to a parent that you know was picked up and and a dropped call, but there was some connection with a parent made. Would that would still account for engagement, so I do feel very much the same like I don't have a full understanding of how we're measuring progress and how we're improving the the collection of metrics. It is something that we have communicated a concern that we've communicated to the city on a few different points, and I guess to answer the question. I think we would like to know more about standards around synchronous instruction more about how they will track actual attendance and engagement, and you know after that, just like wanting to know what are what are best practices that are, you know, being promoted by educational experts in other in other arenas. Do you have anything else yeah? I I think that, unfortunately, the data collection and consistency isn't what we hope for where we're still kind of in the okay, how many students are checking in each day on remote learning platforms? And what does that kind of timing? Look like where the conversation around okay? What sort of learning is actually being done? What sort of learning standards are being met? It is just so incredibly varied across schools and classrooms and and students that I think we're we're, unfortunately, still kind of in the in the very basic questions of how many students are regularly accessing it every day and out of that number, how many are logging into all their periods? How many are regular checking their google classrooms and just kind of the very basic metrics? I would love to have a more robust conversation around. What is a great digital learning? Experience actually look like, but I think, unfortunately, even at this late time, when we had months of virtual learning, we're still not quite there yet do I see any other raised hands. Thank you, luke. Any other questions. I have a question it's around the social workers in the schools, that's something that I believe has had the mayor had committed to, and I and I thought the mayor had committed to that. I know that many community boards and other people were supporting that initiative a year or so ago. Are we far from that? How many schools are we talking about that still do not have social workers in their schools. This is a really good question, and I know that there that this actually was one of the matters that kind of came up in the last minutes of the budget negotiations. So it's something that I need to go back and check on I. Yes, it's true that there has been a commitment to have a social worker in every school. I actually don't know if that is something that will be accomplished or or not. I do know that some of the special programs, like the bridging the gap, social workers who work specifically with students in temporary housing, as well as the shepherd single shepherd social workers who are assigned to students in certain middle and high schools in specific districts. I know those two programs have been funded for the coming year and survived, but in terms of additional funding I am I'd have to go back and check. One thing I would add is that that that recommendation, something that we called for in our school report is to make sure that every school is a social worker ready and on staff this year we think it's probably something that should have had them long ago, but especially now, more than ever, when there's been so much different types of trauma, so many students have gone through it's even more important for them to to know. There's someone in the school building, that's that trusted adult and trains adult who they can turn to in those situations, I'll try to find the data and send it over your way cause. I don't have that on hand, but definitely something that we need to keep pushing on right now. Thank you. Do I have more questions any more questions from the committee I'm looking for raised hands. I don't see anything I I just have one last question: you talk about social, emotional learning, many non-profits who work with children, particularly sports-based youth development organizations, focus on social-emotional learning as part of their curriculum. Have you thought about partnering when you need more of these people in the classroom, and you suggested I think, in the in the plan to to add more people into the classroom as a partnership among some of those not-for-profits on the table or something you've considered? Yes totally. I I completely agree that, like when we talk about the need for more staffing, you know sort of one of our our sub recommendations with something that could definitely be built out into something more prominent is leveraging many community-based organizations that work with youth throughout the city and who have you know many of these organizations are without contracts or their contracts. You know had to be ended, a mid-year or they thought they would have summer programming through you know some of the summer programs and- and then you know permitting, has been kind of a nightmare from what I've heard. I I think, that's an absolutely such a vital resource in terms of the community-based organizations and the youth development groups that work across schools and this and across the city, and that the city should really leverage that valuable resource. I totally agree I'm looking for any hands any any further questions for elizabeth and luke from the committee. I see none, I'm going to turn to the attendees. I don't know luke. Is that a is that a raised hand function or is that a that's a there is so attendees if you'd like to participate in this item, please find the raise hand button at the center of your screen. Okay, seeing none I'm going to. Thank you very much, elizabeth and luke for attending the meeting this evening. You've given us a lot to think about we're. Hearing more and more obviously, education and reopening schools is something that's evolving and so cb5 continues to take it all in, and we appreciate you coming and explaining and answering our questions. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Okay. Next up, we have patricia laria. She is the parent coordinator at school of the future, patricia I I hope that you will talk to us a little bit about what school of the future is thinking about in terms of reopening and very specifically about your request regarding open streets. Thank you thank you, renee and thank you for that title, but I'm a parent sitting on the slt at school of the future. I'm so sorry! No, it's it's fine! It's fine! I've been so active with them so yeah. Well, I have a. I have a 10th grader, that's going to be a rising 10th grader! That's going to be attending, hopefully in the fall, and there was a lot of parents working with the principal stacey goldstein to to troubleshoot like potential issues that may arise with the reopening in the fall and what we've come up with. Just to give you background, there are 700 students, pre-covered that were in attendance, it's a 6 to 12 middle and high school school, which is located at 127 east 22nd street, and we were hoping that cb5 would help with the open. You know like we wanted to do a play street, it's located on 22nd street, but we don't want to shut 22nd street down between lexington and I think it's park that that's a a major throwaway I guess going through. So what the the mayor and the governor have done with restaurants is they've. They've got open streets in front of their businesses like they take two parking spaces in front of their businesses, so we're hoping for a partial play street like taking two parking spaces in front of where our building is on the footprint of the building on lexington and on 22nd street, for when the kids are coming in in peak times, drop-off and then at dismissal, and to keep the staff the the children and community as safe as possible, we'll triage the kids there, like you, know, right before the doors open to kind of line them up. The other thing is we were hoping to do this. I guess monday through friday, because with the different cohorts that they're going to potentially have in the fall, we're going to need that time every day to do this work and usually when you apply through the dot for a play street, you need the support of the community board. That's why I'm here this evening to ask for your help with that, as well as the nypd and the department of transportation, because we have to apply for it and then you guys will help after we. You know put in the application to to help with that. We also, besides, that we've also put in through the department of transportation app for more bike racks, because then a lot of the teachers and I'm sure the students are going to be biking, and I don't believe currently there are any bike racks in front of the school, and so we're going to need that on on lexington avenue, as well as on 22nd, and you know the footprint of this of the building, and I think oh yeah and the other thing is to address what luke was saying earlier, that they are trying to think creatively of having the kids outside outdoors more we're, hoping that we could walk the kids to like madison square park or union square, so they can be outside. So we're we're trying to think creatively of how we can do this with our the teaching staff. So so those are, those are our requests and hopes for the fall. Thank you. Thank you. Patricia. Do any members of the committee have any questions for patricia use the raise hand function rachel. Thank you. So much for sharing, I'm just wondering if you've heard about other schools having similar requests like. Is this something that you've heard about other schools like getting approved by the relevant parties? Well, I live in community board, two, which is the west village, but my son travels to school of the future, which is on the east side near madison square park and on community board two, where I'm on the schools. In ed committee, there we've ps3, which is a local elementary school, that services over 800 kids. They have a play street and they came to us requesting that the play street around that play street still, as well as the one behind it the footprint of the building. So they want grove street as well as bedford street, to triage the kids and they do have a rooftop but they're trying to use utilize all the spaces around they have it. 75 morton, which is a zoned middle school, is going to be requesting on martin street for play street as well. The other elementary school that is in our zone is also reaching out to us ps 130, which is downtown in chinatown. They also are requesting, because they have this a similar request. So there's a lot of schools that have come to us and reached out that they really would like this, because it it says that the kids need to be out doors more. They need to have like fresh air recycling. You know not the recycled air that they'll be having inside and majority of these buildings are old buildings, they're, not new buildings that you have at the ac and and so forth, and it's going to be hot still in september and october. Does that answer your question? Rachel yeah, that's really helpful! Thank you any more questions for patricia. I just have a quick one: patricia are you able to utilize the I don't know if you can get to it from the outside the playground there, the basketball courts on the side of your school on the is that am I thinking of the right for school of the future. The I don't my son has never talked about a basketball court near there there's only medicine, something yeah ignore the question. Yeah, the nearest park is madison square park and I there are no courts, it's just like for little kids, the little playground in there, but I'm right, and just just for the edification of the committee. I want to let you know that this this has been. Obviously, this request crosses over into the transportation committee. It also crosses over to parks, to the extent that you had requested some connection to madison square park. Potentially so we have notified both parks and transportation. Just so our committee is aware of that. Evan I see you have your head raised yeah. I just had a quick question, patricia if you do you mind, just repeating what the process is for applying for placement yeah typical. There is an application through the department of transportation and that's where we would put in our request in writing through the school the school would have to put it in and once we do, that we'll send a copy to your committee as well as the parks you said, renee for dot. It would be transportation, it would be transportation okay, so it's yeah. We put in an application to a department of transportation for a play street, but it would be a partial play street in front of the the building. We don't want to shut down 22nd street, because do you know where the school is in in your area, because 22nd is like a major artery and I I and I've seen big trucks and stuff on there. So I doubt that they'd want us to close the entire street. It would be perfect, but it wouldn't be useful for that block and that's the same process again for the committee that you have gone through for the bike racks. Yes, yes, so co2 has a form that schools can just fill out and submit. Yes, any further questions from the committee. Any questions from attendees, please use your raised hand, function, seeing none we're going to move into business session and discuss moving forward on this support of the application of school of the future. For again, this crosses over into other committees. School of the future is a school, so budget education and city services. We would pass our recommendation on to the transportation committee, but here we're going to discuss our support or not supporting their requests. Thank you thoughts. Any thoughts from the committee are people generally in support of opening up play spaces for schools like school of the future, taking parking spaces to allow the kids to assemble both before and after school for check-in and dismissal rachel yeah, I mean I think, in line with our previous presentation. We have to get creative. I think it's obviously a great idea and we're doing it for restaurants, and so I think if we were to go out there and say we can't do this for kids safety, then it's pretty problematic to think about prioritization, so it makes sense to me. I I can't it'd be helpful to like see a map of the area. I can't picture it in my head, but I think, as long as everything kind of checks out with that, then I'm in general very supportive. Thank you any other comments from the committee kim yeah. I agree with rachel and in general, very supportive of play streets. I you know, of course, just want to make sure that safety is a priority as well for talking about partnership usage, but otherwise a hundred percent fabulous. Any other comments. Thank you, zach. Sorry, if I missed this, did she say the hours that they were requesting to have the streets open for play, patricia the hours, I'm not sure if it says it on the application, I'm not sure when, when you put in for an application for a play street you'd, you would shut down the entire street for the for the like the drop-off and or dismissal, or sometimes where, in the case of ps3, they shut the street down. Just for lunch, like in the middle of the day like like from 11 to like one and then they'd take the street back, but you need two adults outside to monitor, as well as the nypd. Would provide, I guess, those nypd- I don't know blockade so that the cars wouldn't come through, but we are requesting it just for drop off in the morning like between 7 30 and 8 30, and then between 2 30 and 3 30 at dismissal. Okay, thanks for the requirement any other comments from the committee, seeing none I'm going to ask. Do I have a motion for supporting the application of school of the future for the play spaces. Again, with the caveat that this will go to our transportation committee before presentations before do I do I have a motion motion you approve, I'm sorry slow motion. Do I have a second a second second thank you and julie. Could we vote on this? Please hey sorry about that! Renee! Yes, zach! Yes, I didn't see him miss mary, jo joseph yes, laura! Yes, tristan! Yes, rob! I didn't see him sam. I didn't see jamie joe yes, ken yep, evan, chuck, yes and rachel yeah in july. Yes, and I'm a yes thank you. So we have passed this motion to pass to support this initiative on behalf of school of the future and then pass it to transportation, for presentation to cbe to the full board that this is a little bit unusual, just because we're crossing over both committees. So thank you and thank you patricia for coming and and speaking to the committee and asking answering all the questions tonight appreciate it. Thank you. Our next item on the agenda moving right along is abigail bessler she's, going to speak with us about the small business tax credit against the commercial rent tax bill, and that has to do with the commercial businesses below 97th street. I still it's changed a little bit, I know so. I will turn this over to abigail to explain the bill and the changes. What has happened since we first heard of this? Thank you, renee nice, to see everyone again. So actually, this bill that we just introduced is actually a new under a new number in the council, so it's intro, two zero, zero, seven and but essentially it is related to our past bill and that we've kind of taken on this commercial run tax issue during covet, especially and this bill would actually the the old bill was a tax credit given to businesses below a certain size. If you remember part of it was full a full tax credit, meaning full relief and part of it was sliding scale tax credits based on income based on your rent. So this bill would actually temporarily suspend and repeal the commercial rent tax in full for businesses with an annual base rent of less than one million dollars for just the covid19 state of emergency. So it would start on the period that began june. 1St, which is the current period of the commercial run tax that we're in in terms of payment, and then it would end the day before it's very confusing, but basically it would end what, after whatever is later, the the end of the state of emergency by the city or the state, and so it's a little bit different than the other bill, but definitely the same aim and more about kind of the urgency of the moment, we're in in terms of being able to provide direct relief to businesses, and this is one of the ways that the city can actually take action and provide direct relief. So this was sponsored by councilmember, chin and also bro. President brewer, and you know, both of them in a release that that went out talked about how there's a desperate need for this and the need to reevaluate this tax. Only on manhattan, businesses has never been more dire because it's just on you know, stores that have brick and mortar space, which is what's being hit hardest. So the bill would help 5500 manhattan businesses, and this was actually also part of a larger report that keith released called open for business saving our small businesses post covid. I can send around the link for that, but it actually went into a lot of different ideas that we could do at the city state and that we should be advocating for at the federal level around helping small businesses. So this was this is kind of one piece of that plan that keith has proposed and yeah. I can answer any other questions, but that's kind of the the update and would obviously be happy to if we could get a you know supportive statement or resolution from cb5 about the bill. Absolutely thank you. Abigail evan, I see your hand is raised immediately, so I'll go to questions and I'll go right to evan. I don't want to over overstate my eagerness, but I guess the one question that I had, which came up last time when we discussed this was you know, I think, for reasons that are understandable to all of us: a lack of data around financial impact to the city by removing this tax, whether temporarily or permanently, I'm guessing. The answer is the same, but do we have any sense of impact on budget that removing this tax would have during you know a time I know when that budget is already pretty strained yeah. So I I don't have the exact impact that it would have based on this year's numbers, but based on 2019 data about the number of businesses who are paying the tax that are below 1 million in rent. That is estimated to cost about 21.3 million per quarter. So you know I. I don't think that we'll see how long the state of emergency lasts, but that's that's the estimate for one quarter, which I mean obviously also, I think you know based in order to get this passed. We it'll have to be a discussion with you know the speaker and other council members about how much where we want the threshold to be in the bill, and I think we you know, based on the cost, are open to negotiating it. But I think we wanted to start off with a strong statement that we don't believe that you know smaller or medium-sized manhattan. Businesses should be paying a tax just for having a space that other boroughs are not paying, and I think we also you know wanted to to do it, for you know, understanding that the city was in a is in a fiscal crisis and that we, you know, just passed this budget that took quite a while to get done. We didn't we made this going forward. We didn't make this retroactive to the start of the crisis, at least for now, but you know that is also an effort to make sure that you know we're not. You know we agreed to a budget and we don't want to put a hole in the budget retroactively so, but I think this will have a lot of support and I think we'll be able to get support from other members even outside of manhattan. For this thanks abigail, I wonder if it would be worthwhile just to refresh the committee to explain what the tax is below 97th street in, like two sentences sure. So it's a basically a a rate of a 3.9 charge on businesses, annual rent, that's only charged to businesses south of 96th street in manhattan, so I think it used to be city-wide, I believe, and then it was gradually repealed for other boroughs, but it remains for manhattan. Thank you more questions. From from our committee, hey renee, sorry, I can't raise my hand, but oh joseph, please! Yes, thanks! Hey thanks abby for presenting this. My question is, I guess I guess my question is coming from concern about businesses like when the state of emergency ends. I assume a lot of them will be trying to just like come come back from very far behind in their finances. Was there any thought or discussion around you know, making this last aft like well after the state of emergency ends to give businesses some breathing room to try to catch up and invest in the changes they need to make to get back to normal yeah? For sure I think, and this also got the support of the hospitality alliance, which I didn't mention in the manhattan chamber of commerce. I think everyone is aware that a lot of investment needs to be done to save small businesses, and I think that could include a more permanent repeal or at least relief from this tax and from other fines for that matter. That businesses are paying, and I think I think we wanted to target this bill so that we could try to get relief now for businesses. And then you could always do an amendment later to extend the bill, which is a lot of the covid related bills that we've passed as a council are limited to the state of emergency or to like a certain date in the fall and then potentially will be extended. So I think it was more of a matter of getting the support, so we could get something passed thanks, and I think you said this, but can you remind me what just who decides when the state of emergency over? Is it the mayor or the governor yeah? So our bill would actually say whichever one goes later, the the the state or the city so there's there has there both have been declared on the city level and the state level. Okay, thanks zach, sorry, so, just to clarify you said if their base rents under one million dollars right yeah for the year one million a year. That's great! So if I'm a small new york city hedge fund for the base rent of under a million dollars, I get a I get a tax break. I mean I I think that's that's one thing we'll have to negotiate is whether we want to target the relief, for example just for businesses on the ground like ground floor retail or whether we want you know, there's different ways to make sure that we're targeting the right people. I think it's just that you know businesses and other boroughs, no matter what kind of business you are aren't paying this, and I do think you know. Our intention is not to help hedge funds that are renting smaller spaces in manhattan. But I do think that the idea is that we need to come out with something to kind of resolve this unfair, and the reason I originally asked is because there are a lot of financial institutions that don't necessarily rent a lot of space, but they run very expensive space such as you know up and down midtown and fifth and sixth avenue, and so I completely agree with the rent. You know some sort of tax break for a small restaurant bodega, all the mom-and-pop businesses, but you know, I think, there's a if you look at like I'm guessing. If you looked at a curve as where the tax revenue flows from I'm guessing, the vast majority of it comes from a small number of businesses that pay a lot in rent per square foot, but maybe under a million dollars because the average you know restaurant, that you know has you know, has a few thousand square feet and pays under a million dollars. They may not necessarily be you know there may not be much rent. You know tax revenue generated from the city, and so I don't know, I just think it's bifurcating, which businesses benefit and which ones may, which ones don't could be yeah yeah. I mean, I know that there are in total there are almost 9 000 tax, crt taxpayers, so there are a lot of businesses that are over a million in rent. This is about you know, half or more than a little more than half so there there are a large number that we are cutting out of this, but one one option that we could discuss in the amendment process is, I know, in the past credits for this bill, including our bill, which would have extended that credit did apply a limit to not only the threshold was not only around the rent that the annual rent, but also around the annual income of the business. So you know you can kind of get at both of those things. I think we really wanted to just start off with just a clean bill that was helping the most businesses possible in manhattan because of the urgency of the crisis, and we didn't want to get into all the different thresholds that you could do but- and I think that makes it a little more complicated, but I I think we're open to that discussion and I'll talk to the council member about that as well. All right thanks a lot joe mafia. I would agree with zach I would I would like to see. I think it's a silly tax to begin with and it should be done away with, but I think that if you do it the way it's proposed, you would firms that are don't need, don't need, it would get benefit. So I would like to see it somehow tell I'd like law firms, accounting firms, probably don't need it right now. There are other entities that on retail that certainly need it and, like zach mentioned, not all retail, not all people who rent retail space need it like banks. Thank you, joe more questions from the committee renee. I have questions, but I'm not able to raise my hand for some reason july. Thank you, two questions that we go. One is I'm curious. If we do away with this tax for all businesses in manhattan, what would be the estimated quarterly revenue cost to the city? I answered that one so that one is 21.3 million. That's for rent base, rent under 1 million dollars right yeah, but the question is for all of the oh for all businesses I'd. I think we actually got that figure a few years ago when we looked into that. But it would be a that would be a pretty huge hole in the city's budget, which is why we are not proposing that for all businesses in manhattan. If you have that number, would you be willing to share that with the community later on yeah I have. I can try to I'll I'll, get it I'll get a calculation for it for 2019.. Thank you and second question, and maybe the council members in the city have already been discussing it and I'm not aware, but any discussion around tax responsibilities for landlords any tax responsibility for I know, there's discussions at the state level, around tax relief and a lot of the rental relief programs have come out of the state because they have more control over some of those areas. Unfortunately, for us, but I I know that they're they are discussing tax relief. For you know various you know: landlords renters, you know rent suspension. So I think that that discussion is happening more on the state level. I would say thank you and just a technical question. The extra rent revenue tax, this 3.9 percent or 3.7. How is that billed and paid? Is that built to landlord or the actual range of the business? I believe that the actual businesses are the payers of the commercial rentals and it's for the amount of space that they have and then it's paid based on their rent. Thank you, yep. Thank you more questions from the committee, seeing none I'm going to turn to the attendees and ask that you use your raise hand button. If you have a question, if you're joining us from a phone, you can press star 9 to raise your hand, seeing nothing from attendees, I'm going to turn it back to the committee, we're going to go into business session and discuss the bill support of the bill, a resolution in support of the bill. If this is something that we're interested in, with the caveat that both zach and joe mention, meaning that you look to annual income, who would like to kick off the discussion, evan yeah, I I would, I would offer my support of the bill as I did with the previous version of it. I think it made sense when we looked at it four months ago and it makes even more sense today and I would offer one thought as well on looking to distinguish between businesses who need it and businesses who don't. I think when we start doing that on something related to your rent, rather than your income, which this tax does you lose sight of the real purpose of the tax and the purpose of getting rid of it? I don't think I don't think it would be beneficial to the council, member or the purpose of the bill to basically impose some sort of double taxation on companies that are still doing well on their income and thus will be taxed on their income accordingly, by trying to also include them in some rent relief bill, which this really is. I just don't think that that makes sense to me conceptually and trying to parse that out when you're, just when it can be as simple as saying here's a million dollars, it's the threshold, that's the point at which the tax is exempt versus letting politics seep into well, which businesses do we think deserve this or not. That makes me a little bit nervous, so I I would. I would be strongly in favor of the bill, and I would also be strongly in favor of not trying to parse out who gets the relief and who doesn't when it's really about the relief on rent and nothing more, and these folks will still be taxed on their income accordingly. So that's my comment. Thank you, evan. Any more comments. Would somebody like to speak to evan's point he's not he's not in favor necessarily joe. My only comment would be that by leaving the the bill as it is or as as it's proposed, it would benefit people who don't necessarily need it and that's why, if it's not based on, if there's no exemption for income or or or whatever, I just don't, think it's a, I don't think it's necessary benefit for certain tenants. So I know I know we've moved out of the question session, but I guess abigail. Do you mind confirming? I know that the previous iteration of the bill did have an income component to it, so it was like five to ten million dollars or something to do with that. Does this version just wipe that out completely so there's no income cap on who this could apply to it's just about the million dollars in rent? This is just about the million dollars but, like I said, I think we're open to adding that in an amendment I I think the intent is obviously to help businesses that do need it, and so I'll I'll talk to the council. Member about that, but yeah this is, it exists. This is just about the one million threshold. Thank you. Sorry. Can you remind us what the income threshold was in the previous version, because I I'll admit I didn't appreciate that this version doesn't have that at all. I thought we were talking about businesses under 10 million dollars like last time in income, but or was it fun yeah? I think there was an income and I'd have to also see what the like, what number of businesses we'd be talking about for who who would be under this kind of like venn diagram and income higher than that and rent lower than 1 million, but yeah I can look into. I think it was 10 million, but it was actually it was different, different incomes at different thresholds. I think under the original garadnik small business tax credit proposal that we were expanding upon, so I think it was like five million for certain things and then a sliding scale credit from five to ten million, so it was different. It was kind of complicated, but it was different limits. Thank you. Zach your hand is raised. Ah thanks. I just want to you know kind of response to evan's comment. You know under understand what you're, coming from in terms of you know double taxation issue, but my view the spirit of the the bill is to help companies that were most directly impacted by covet and those those you know whether it's a movie theater, whether it's a small restaurant, small retail operation. There are, you know so many you know: investment firms, mine included, that have rent you know, have rent under a million dollars whose businesses have not been impacted by this because they don't sell widgets and they don't sell meals. They make fees on. You know the four or five or six billion dollars of capital they manage. Who can very well afford to pay this, and so I don't think giving them a break necessary is isn't it, in my opinion, in the spirit of the bill, which is why I would support something with some sort of revenue or income cap. Thanks zach joe, your your hand is raised. Abigail a possible solution might be to limit it to certain sic codes, certain industry codes, so that it and have no income limitation. So if a retailer would get it, a financial institution would have a different sic code. An investment company would have a different sic code and you already have that in your on the tax returns, so it wouldn't probably be an easy way to implement this. Thank you any more comments comments from the committee. Yes, I would just like to add. I agree with joe and zach's comments and another way of approaching it might be considering a number of employees or rather per employee within the business, but I understand how challenging that can be. That approach can become, but I think that will really, you know, paint a more clear picture of what type of business it is and how many jobs it is generating and how many you know, people who will be indirectly benefited from the success. Thank you july. Any other comments. What I'm hearing is a general support of the bill with two different two different philosophies about how to implement one thinking that it's good the way it stands another one zach and joe and july thinking that there should be some parsing of the type of small businesses that get the relief I'd like to hear so from a few other members of the committee and get a sense of what they're thinking about this hi renee. Can I chairman joseph yeah? Sorry, it's still the right same thing. I I'd just like to say that I I agree with trying to parse it in some way, keeping it as simple as possible. I think I think joe's idea sounds very straightforward. You don't want it to be administratively difficult to actually implement this, so you know, I think, maybe we could use language. You know that that says that we would like to parse out. You know the businesses that have been directly impacted by the covid pandemic, and you know say that you know we leave it to the council to find the simplest way to do that. You know I don't know if we need to figure that out, but I do like the idea of keeping it simple great. Thank you joe charles. I agree with. I agree with joe. I think that a way of endorsing the bill and encouraging the council to look at opportunities to to focus the need on businesses that need it, the most would be a good position to go. Okay, any other comments from the committee yeah renee, I was just gonna, say I actually completely agree with what joe and chuck just said. I think it it seems, like abigail, corrects me from wrong, but it seems like there is some expected negotiations to happen to even get it implemented, so I'm definitely comfortable with supporting the idea in general, with some of the language. That's just been brought up, and I imagine there'll be some caveats kind of thrown in there to get it passed thanks. Rachel last comments from anyone. Okay. So what I'm hearing is that we're in favor of the bill generally, but we would like to see language that indicates there's some parsing between who is impacted by covid and ensuring that they are the ones that that receive this. This release, so whatever the council member can do, could to to sort of make sure that this is focused on those who need it. I think that's what I'm hearing from the committee do. I hear support for a resolution in favor of that response that we're in favor of the bill, generally, with the caveat that we would like it focused on those businesses that truly require it as a result of coven and that it it belongs to the council member and to the council to figure out how to parse that specifically robert, I missed you go ahead, no, no problem. I just raised my hand. I just wanted to see if, when we're talking about focusing on on those that need it I mean. Are we talking about needs, testing or you know, means testing, or are we just kind of saying? We want to make sure that it does go to people in need, but we're not suggesting you know how that should be done. Necessarily, I I think that's what I was hearing from the committee that there's there's some. You know I. I know that evan spoke about the income. You know an income threshold. I don't think that we're specifically advocating one way or the other of doing the parsing, we're suggesting that if the bill has been introduced to provide relief to businesses that have suffered because of kovid that are paying this commercial rent tax, then it should be focused to those players and not necessarily, as zach pointed out to maybe a hedge fund that doesn't necessarily need or require the relief because covet has not impacted their business. Does that answer yeah yeah as long as I think it's it's dangerous to start suggesting how it should be done. Given all of our you know, layman capacity, but I think it's right to include some degree of needs or means testing, because I think that's often been a failure of some some programs in the past to really make sure that it's going to folks who who most need it. Thank you thank you for that comment. So, do I hear a motion in favor of a resolution to support the bill with language that says we do believe there should be some way or some parsing of businesses that require the relief as a result of covet, and that's we want it to be directed to those businesses and not necessarily to businesses as a whole. I motioned to support a bill with that open-ended caveat. Yes, let's second it okay, then we will move to a vote. Julie, renee! Yes, oh my gosh zach! Yes, joseph yes, laura! Yes, justin! Yes, rob yes, joe mafia. Yes, ken, yes, evan, yes, chuck, yes, rachel yeah in july! Yes, thank you. We have thank you abigail for coming. Thank you very much. We're gonna get you back, hopefully at the end of august, for the rest of the the remaining ideas that you're looking at for small businesses, because we're really interested in hearing a nose. But for this the resolution is passed unanimously. It will go to the board, but that's not happening until september, but thank you, okay and I'll I'll put the link to our report in the chat here. So you can all look through that too, but thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Our last item for tonight is the consideration of a resolution that is was created by all of you. During our conversation on the nypd and the budget, this resolution was trojan work by joseph brewer, rob isaacs, peter webb and july yang were also involved. Thank you very much for all of your hard work. They took our conversation, our comments, our determinations and put them into the resolution that you all received by email and basically this resolution reflects the view of all of you, the committee with regard to the budget and the nypd, and recognizes that the budget itself is a statement of values. It provides the core principles that every single person articulated as a committee that includes the efficient use of funds, equal opportunity, budget alignment with the purpose and mission of each agency, diversity, transparency and accountability, ethical and legal, behavior and trust and respect. The resolution itself demands honest communication from our electeds regarding budget decisions, a request for a targeted plan to reduce the nypd overtime spending, a request for the mayor and the city council to provide a plan for the transition of school safety agents and school crossing dogs to the doe, as well as a report on the shift of homeless services from nypd to dhs, to figure out how that's being done. What's being done, we also asked that omb standardized its reporting for comparisons. You will recall even the presentation that we had it's very hard to parse and and really hard to get into the weeds and understand the budget reporting process, and we finally reiterate our firm commitment for the reconsideration of the role of the nypd within the city of new york. I trust that you've all received and read the the proposed resolution. Has anyone not received that or not seen it? Okay again, I want to thank joseph particularly and then rob july for their work and pete on the resolution and I'd like to open it up to questions. I'm seeing no questions, any questions, no questions. Okay, I'm gonna move to the attendees before we go into comments, any questions from our attendees hi. I had a question, I'm not sure. If you can hear me, we can hi hi. This is chris clark, I'm a member of this community board, but not of this committee. Obviously, and if this is not the appropriate time to be discussing this, obviously I'll have the opportunity to bring it up at the actual meeting, but I have been looking at the the resolution. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about some specific language that it seems it's sort of tough looking at the the edit history to see if it was actually removed or just proposed that it be removed. But there was a paragraph towards the end of the resolution calling for city council and the mayor, I believe to quote oh here: it is to drop a formal plan from the mayor and city council to enable and require nypd to dismiss, rather than keep on modified duty officers who have committed illegal and or unethical behavior, and it goes on was that indeed struck from the resolution, or is that still in there? It's it's not in the resolution. That was not something that I had in my notes as something that we had decided upon as a committee. Certainly, if we can discuss it here and and add it into the resolution, add it back to the resolution when I went through my notes that particular piece of it, although it obviously it's very popular, it's in the media, it's something that's happening. I I did not have it in my notes, as commentary from members of the committee, so I didn't. I struck it from the language. Is that something that you're proposing and would like to discuss now, if it's appropriate for me to propose that I, I certainly think that it is in keeping with the broader spirit of the resolution and is specifically, I think, an actionable and important concrete step when it comes to how the nypd spends its money. Okay, I'd like to I'd like to hear. Thank you chris. I appreciate it comments from the committee questions from the committee on that issue. Panelists. Where am I zach? I I agree with chris's point I would be in favor of including that in the resolution. Okay and just a second second point, it's a question for folks that wrote this: did you take into account the the overall size of the nypd or the type of kind of combat style equipment that they use? For you know to deal with protesters again we did not. That was not an issue. I don't think that came up during the conversation, our original conversation again, we can add that to the resolution here. If that's something that the committee would like to discuss and add to the resolution, the purpose right now is to read the resolution as presented. It's a discussion. I believe it reflects our conversation. We have the opportunity right now before adopting it to add to it. So if that's something that the community that our committee would like to add to the conversation and that to the resolution, certainly I I hear what you're saying- and I would like to hear from other committee members about that issue. Our our conversation about this issue was huge. It was far-ranging it touched on the nypd and the budget and a whole host of things. So, as I said, joseph and his group did an incredible job of putting it all together when this was given to me. I looked through my notes to very specifically reflect what I heard from our committee members, because I didn't want to include something that hadn't been there at the outset of our conversation, but certainly we can discuss it now and add it to the resolution. So thank you. Zach, do I have some comments and questions from people on the committee. I do renee. Oh joseph go ahead. I think I just wanted to ask zach, because I think I might not have gotten that note, but I think I do remember you potentially bringing that up in our earlier conversation this question of, I guess their equipment and kind of the military style. I guess like weapon trip, weaponry tactics. What I don't remember is whether did he bring it up now kind of to put in a provision that references the cost of that and to talk about limiting nypd's ability to spend money on that sort of equipment, or was this a broader point about kind of the tactic that they're, like the tactics that they use with protesters in general? You know I I'll be honest. I don't fully remember every aspect of our conversation, which was you know this point a month or two ago, but I think both of those I mean so as first I I think the resolution is great as it stands and if that's kind of what everyone could agree to, then I think you know that would be great, but I would be supportive of adding points that address both of those issues: the cost that kind of equipment and secondly, the measures they they take with them. Well, thanks I mean I I'd be really supportive of including a provision. Personally that includes a mention of the cost of this type of kind of military-grade equipment. I tried to stay away from kind of like tactics and behavior, because I kind of felt like that could be a whole other resolution and I was trying to just put as clean as possible, just kind of like anything that wasn't didn't have some time to the budget I kind of figured. Maybe we should do something in collaboration with public safety or just have a separate resolution. Just about that. So that's the only reason I didn't include the tactics in there understood yeah. I agree with the first point more comments from the more questions from the committee. What do we think about chris's point? Charles? Thank you renee. Thank you, chris for the comment. I think I think it's appropriate that that struck language. I don't remember what was what we talked about originally that some form of that struck language being this resolution, because it does have a budget effect on the the resolution comes at this issue from a budget perspective. I wonder if, if you would be, if, if you'd be, if it would meet your goal to have the committee and then the board, if it's approved by the board, I request a formal plan to enable the nypd to dismiss officers who have committed illegal, so we wouldn't put in rather than keep on modified duties, it would say to dismiss, and then I I wonder if, if it would be satisfactory to delete from the already deleted paragraph, the sentence on the status quo, it's I I think it it's a it's a certainly a strong call to action by the committee. I don't know that it adds anything to our purpose in the resolution and it it's going to attract a lot of attention by labeling, a gross misuse. My initial reaction- and thank you for that that suggestion my initial reaction is that I I think that would get up the same purpose. I would ask that we add in the term desk duty so rather than keep on modified duty, aka desk duty. I think having that language in there is important just for understanding it in the terms that that we normally hear use to describe police protocol when it comes to discipline, but I I think that removing the this sort of editorializing, which I agree with by the way but the the editorializing about the status quo, wouldn't you know, affect the the outcome of of that language. I'm curious to hear what everyone else thinks. Is there any disagreements comments from the committee regarding that statement, charles chuck, sorry, I meant to lower my hand nothing else. Okay, joseph I see your hand. Do I see your hand joseph was that you or that was chuck. I think that was me pulling my hand back down. Okay, other comments, other thoughts about this. I I I did not understand your response to chuck's comment. Can you just say it again and I'm sorry if I'm the only person who did not understand no, no problem, I I have no problem saying it again and I'm I'm referencing something that I'm looking at in writing, and so my comments might be sort of hard to follow. As I understood it, chuck's comment was about removing certain phrasing, and all I wanted to say was that I think the phrase desk duty is important to include in the resolution just as a sort of plain language explanation of of what the current protocol is and and what this is in contrast to, and so I had a sort of convoluted way of making that point. Does that help clear it up? Yes, so you're, saying police officers who need to be reprimanded, for, I think the term was criminal. Behaviors should not be reassigned to death duties. Yes, that's correct, and specifically this this language would be requesting that the mayor and city council take that action. Can they they? It would be taking action to enable nypd enable and require nypd. So this would be a request that we're making to city, council and and the mayor rather than making to nypd directly right, but I guess the question is: are they legally? Is that within their legal jurisdiction? Right, I think what july is asking is normally police members of police department who are being investigated. They have their own disciplinary system and hearing system their own sort of oath system that they go through with their judge, a judge who then determines whether I think things are substantiated or not substantiated. I think july's question is whether are you asking for a change? Are we asking and discussing a change to that system to the disciplinary system within the nypd? Is that what you're getting at chuck I'll jump in here? I think that that is what we're getting at. At least that's that's what I interpret it as in july. I think that the city council has the authority to to to either enable or require the department to come up with a program like that. We're not specifying what the program would be. We're asking them to exercise their authority to put that kind of program in place. Thank you, chuck and renee. My worry on that point. Then. If we're asking for the procedure be modified, my worry becomes. It will, on some level, deter current police officers to respond in their daily activities, duties and will cause a delay in emergency situations, but I certainly understand chris the merit of your point. I guess I I don't know how to balance that any other comments or thoughts about this questions. I I have a comment who's speaking joseph sorry, joseph I I think I guess my response to to your point july about officers you know declining to respond. I think you know just like the nypd is it's a department that works at the pleasure of the mayor? You know it's a city agency. You know, I think, I think, of a change in the policy that they implement causes individual officers to decide to slow down their work or not respond. You know, I think I would think that would be insubordination and those officers should also be disciplined accordingly and or terminated right and we hire officers who will you know conform to the policies that the city places upon them? So I guess my opinion would be that I wouldn't mind if certain officers didn't respond, because I think that would be creating a force that we want. What does the committee think about that? Any thoughts, I'm not seeing any hands? Oh renee I'll, get the chuck. I didn't raise my hand, but joseph the devil is in the details there on how many officers that would be and where that balance comes out, and I think that that the value of the proposed resolution is that it doesn't require us to resolve that balance. It puts that back into the council and the police department where it belongs so july. I think I think the concern you have july is a very good one, and I think that that we are essentially amplifying that by asking the council and the department to come up with a process, we're not prescribing a result, just just a just a procedure july. Your thought about that or anyone's I'd like to hear from people that haven't heard, get a sense of what they're thinking about these two. So perhaps we can add within that same sentence a changed procedure in relation to reassignment, but ensuring that it does not reduce the level of service from the pd, something in that line that the change in procedure does not deter current police officers in responding to their duties, which I I think is really hard to do. But I'd be okay with that kind of language. So you're saying you agree that they'd not be assigned to death duties, but whatever process is is adopted. It ensures that the level of service remains the same and it ensures that police officers continue to attend to their duties. Is that what I'm hearing from you july be not reassigned to desk duties after due process? Okay, I think that the term going back to desk duties, I understand what you're saying but modified, is sort of the term of art. That's used for police officers when they're being when they're being sanctioned. If you will do, we want desk duties and I'm perfectly happy to keep that language, I'm just throwing that out there renee. Maybe we can say modified duties, open parentheses, eg desk duty and just throw it in the parenthetical. Is that tristan? Yes, okay, good idea, tristan! Thank you! Okay, so I just want to go back and round up on zack's point regarding the militarization and the tactics. Are we in agreement that the issue of tactics we're going to leave off this resolution and very specifically speak to budget and then the question becomes. I wasn't clear how we felt about looking at the cost of the the materials the the military type materials. Could we go back to that for a minute comments? Charles chuck, sorry, to talk so much. I wonder on that one if we could say that the concern would be about the cost of acquiring and maintaining that military style equipment clearly states in the context of a budget. That goes but goes to the issue. I understand I see that that's to be supportive of that. I think stripping. I think limiting it just to the budgetary concerns does make sense, so eliminating that first point that deals with method. Okay, all right! I have both of those points. Are there any other issues that arise for people? Any questions with regard to the proposed resolution? Any other questions, the attendees really don't have access. Necessarily if this is a resolution in support, I gave you the outline of what the resolution said and and the the core values that the resolution sort of wanted to put a stake in the ground about these would be the nypd. I don't know if the attendees have further questions about the specific language or about the resolution itself, I'm going to turn it over to the attendees for questions. I have a question. I have a comment. Okay, I'm going to go back to us, joe I'm going to go back and now we're in business session. We're going to have our comments, joe go ahead. Okay, just two comments, the the very the last part, the last, whereas paragraph page, two or three, two: okay, let me bring it up, it says want me to share my screen or something please do I don't know if luke could do that wizardry for us absolutely! Thank you! Luke! Okay, you have it pulling it up now: okay, okay, you said the last paragraph right last, whereas on page two, sorry right before the core principles, all right there you go so in reading that paragraph, it says to that end. Cb5 believes that it stands out future new york city budgets and is the intent here to narrow, where these core principles apply, because I I don't know if I I feel like we're saying: new york, city, the police department and certain other services or other services. I just think it should be all future budgets. I I would not single out the police department here in this partic. This is the core principles to for all new york city budgets, all agencies, because I, I think, the provision of other services that provide the city's health, safety and well-being. You know there might be an agency that doesn't fit those those criteria, so I think we're it seems, I'm interpreting it that it's limiting how these core principles are to be implied applied, and I don't think that that's the intent and I suggest that my friendly amendment would be that essentially after new york city budgets and strike out the police department and and other services, because in the provision of other services, actually joe, I think that's a very good point and I actually agree with you our the attempt wasn't really too narrow. I think the core principles were really to apply as a touchstone as we go forward and look at budgets going forward, and that would apply to everything that we look at. So I actually agree with what you're saying I want to hear some other committee members and then I have a second point. Okay, one! Second, can you hold it for one? Second, and I hope I remember it joseph do you have? You were very instrumental you penned this. Do you have a comment to this? I no I I. I appreciate the feedback and renee. I agree with you. I think I think joe's right about the intent of it and I think if we strike that part, we can avoid confusion. So that sounds good to me. Thank you any other. Any other comments. Does anyone else have any problem with doing that? Any comment about it for some reason: luke. I can't see raised hands so maybe luke. If you see the raised hands, does anyone else have a comment or or issue with changing that language, because I think the intent was exactly as joe said, all right, we're going to move on to joe sing, none I'm going to move on to joe's second point: we have raised hand from kimberly. Oh kimberly, I'm sorry, hey there. My hand isn't raised to comment on that, though I I agree with the change. Thank you all right, we'll come back to you. I know you. You have a raised hand about something else, we'll go back to joe's second point, joe okay and then on the core principles. I think they're they're well written. I agree with them all. I do think we should add one more principle or or revise the second principle. I think if it says efficient use of funds, I I think we should emphasize the the principle that the city budget should be used to streamline to. I don't have my words together to I'm having a joe biden moment, to streamline the and to leverage technology to be more efficient in the delivery of services to be more efficient. This is the efficient use of funds, I'm thinking that might be a second like a third, maybe number three in terms of the core principles, I'm thinking you know, I like I like the sentiment, I'm thinking it might be a third a third core principle. What do can I get comments from the rest of the committee regarding that statement? We do have a hand raised by kimberly, but kimberly. I don't know if this is still your other comment, any any comments. Any comments on on adding an additional core principle that the city use leverage technology to be more efficient in their use of funding in their delivery of services. Okay, more efficient, okay, I guess with the goal of saving saving the budget or reducing the budget right, I think a recurring theme of this committee has always been saving funds and looking for efficiency, so I think that's right in line with things that we've done again and again and again, but I want to hear from the committee renee: can I chime in joseph yes right yeah? I I think I think that's a great addition. My I do think number two. The efficient use of funds might be a good place to add that I, because I do, I see it as being aligned with that theme right. You could, you can maybe say you know, take what's existing there and just add kind of a clause about leveraging technology to be more more efficient with the delivery, because I think it all it all kind of goes under the same umbrella. In my mind, okay, any other comments. Then I have one more joe. I have one more addition. Now we finished on that comments on the the number two what I would like to. I think there should be a core principle about fiscal responsibility or or balanced budgets. Okay, do you want to expand on that? Yes, I I agree with all of the statements, but if, while the city is developing its budget, maybe it's part of number six, maybe it's part of number one, the you know they should always strive to balance the budget. I I think that gets. In my opinion, it gets a little too political just because balancing a budget is a very political process, because that just yeah you break it down. That's raising taxes versus cutting services, and I think it just opens up a huge can of worms, and- and I would argue that, yes, it is political, but I think it's important. It should be a core value when you're developing a budget, not just you're, going to automatically it's, not a constitutional limit, it's just their core principle that they should try to balance the budget. Okay, rachel, I see your hand yeah just gonna, say I thought it was already like a legal requirement in the city for them to have a balanced budget. I'm pretty sure it is so. I feel like we can. I don't want us to like stray away from the core of what this is trying to achieve, and I, I think, that's kind of already something that's required, so I just want to make sure we stay focused here. Okay, I see kim's hand is raised. Yeah my hand is still raised from before, but I kind of echo what rachel was saying on that point: okay, so I'm hearing that we're not we're not in favor, particularly of adding a balanced budget to our core principles, to strive for a balanced budget. Would anyone else like to weigh in on this? I want to hear from the committee I mean I get renee, hey. Sorry, it's still chem. I don't know if, like the word, you know responsibly, allocating funding is something like just adding that but agree with rachel as far as like the balance of the budget already being required. Okay, I agree with joe's point. I I just speak a lot: okay, yeah it's july. I agree with joe's point. I just think running, proposing a balanced budget and running a balanced budget not just proposing but ensuring that you at the end of the year the actual actually is in line with the proposed is super important, but I think in light of covet, that's that's probably hard to achieve okay, and I see that rachel is definitely right, that it is part of the new york city budget process that it's the budget should be balanced. Okay, so I think then we can leave that out of our core principle kim. Do you still have your hand up? Do you have your hand up again? No, I I just have my my hand up to comment on something separate when we close out joe's comments. Okay, any other comments I think we're putting to bed the issue of balance budget. We'll move on to the next issue kim. So mine is just more of a comment, and you know the most important thing to me during this conversation has always been the reinvestment in community and youth services, and I just wanted to remark that I thought that that was very eloquently and articulate articulately included in this iteration of the resolution. Of course, I'd love to hijack it and include even more language about it, but I recognize that's not necessarily the purpose, but I I just wanted to make that comment that I felt good about how it was included. So thanks for that team that is joseph and his crew july and rob and pete who, who worked on that and joseph was the lead on that for her so yeah they did a fantastic job. Any more comments. I think that I think that we are going to. I think what I'm hearing is that people are not in favor of adding a balanced budget piece to it, but we are in favor of mending amending efficient use of funds to include leverage tech to be more efficient in the delivery of services. I think we have the language around modification desk duty and putting back in the struck clause regarding the nypd actions after for criminal and insubordination, and then we're leaving out any mention of tactics, but we will discuss and ask about the cost of equipment, the mention of military-grade equipment, both the cost for keeping obtaining and maintaining that equipment. That's what I'm hearing for modifications to the to this resolution? Does anyone have anything else to add any other comments about the resolution? I'd love to hear from people who haven't really had a chance to speak. If they'd like to to say anything to the resolution. Okay, I don't see any more raised hands. I'm going to ask for a emotion on the resolution, with the caveat that we will make the changes as discussed. Do I see emotion in favor so moved and second, second, okay, we will move to a vote renee. Yes, emma, yes, zach! Yes, joseph yes, laura, yes, tristan tristan, he said yes right, rob did rob, go away as well. Now rob's here just had to get off mute yeah, I'm a yes! Thank you, joe! Yes kim! Yes, evan! Yes, chuck yes, rachel yeah in july. Yes, that is looks like we have the anonymous vote in favor of the resolution that again will present to the full board, which will not happen until september. I want to thank everybody tonight for really making time. I know this was not a regularly scheduled meeting, and so I appreciate all of your interest and your time and your thoughtfulness in making time to be here. Thank you. Thank you very much we're going to be back in two weeks. Some of the issues I just want to say some of the issues that were raised like the tactical issue we can revisit so just because it's not in this resolution does not mean that we have totally put it to bed. We can look at those issues at another time. We have many more meetings to come. What's going to be upcoming with our next meeting, which again is in august we're going to be looking at small business issues and issues of the community, particularly vis-a-vis, the homeless issues, some of the issues that have been coming up around that so that's coming up at our next meeting. If anybody has any questions, please let me know and again thank you for attending that we're at the end of our meeting. Thank you thanks, renee hi thanks everyone hi everyone bye everyone. Thank you all right. Thanks. So much.
