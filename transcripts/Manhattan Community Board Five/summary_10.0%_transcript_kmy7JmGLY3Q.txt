Are we probably will recall that council member powers came- and he spoke to us about this bill right before covet and that's about the commercial tax that affects businesses below 96th street you'll, probably recall that we were about to support that bill with a resolution it was drafted and then covet came along, and so we were waiting to see what would develop with regard to that bill.
If, in fact that's what we decide to do and finally we're going to discuss the proposed resolution- that's been circulated, which is a compilation of our conversation and views on the nypd and the budget joseph freer and july, and rob and joe did trojan's work on that.
I want to start by thanking renee and julie and the rest of the committee for inviting us to share more around our thoughts.
With remote learning and how many flaws, whether it's the technological process on the learning side, with meals, with kind of everything in between- and we kind of, took all that feedback and all we heard from across the city and boils into a number of different recommendations for how we think it's a pass for schools to reopen safely and also prioritize quality instruction going into the fall I'll.
On that note, elizabeth, I don't know if you want to go through some of our plans, some recommendations and some of our work on reopening more broadly or yeah, and I can just preface it by saying again reiterating the fact that this is not a representation of necessarily the department of education's plans.
I think wanting to provide some of their concerns and asking our office to make recommendations to the department of education ahead of their releasing any plans, and so when, when we, you know released our set of recommendations, it was in the spirit of you know, hoping to provide guidance and feedback in some ways.
I don't need to go into every single recommendation, but I thought it maybe would be helpful just to kind of guide through the to the the way we thought about school reopening in terms of two separate sets of recommendations, one on safety and prioritizing how to actually reopen school safely and then another set of recommendations for ensuring strong instruction and hopefully addressing and mitigating some of the troubles that happened in the actual instructional portion of the school year last year, as everybody shifted to remote learning.
We've been talking to the administration about not just in this set of recommendations, but in subsequent communications that we've had with the mayor's office as well, and then one thing that has actually gotten a lot of attention is on the need to identify more outdoor spaces for learning activities and again.
We know that virus transmission has been lessened significantly with being outdoors, and so we've included that, as a recommendation, we've been really discouraged that the mayor has seemed to be very dismissive in a way of the possibility, but I I think that this is something that has gotten a lot of attention.
A lot of support from parents- and you know we'd love to see the city be more creative in ways that it could expand the use of outdoor spaces for learning activities, and you know again, I'm not going to go through every single recommendation.
At the same time, it it definitely feels like the city is at a critical point, where we need more more staff in schools, and it seems like a potentially a great opportunity to establish a hiring pipeline and- and let this be a potential job, professional development and professional training program.
I know that there are a lot of logistical challenges to any of the scheduling options, but you know our office was really compelled by the evidence that having a regular touch point to the day is ultimately the one of the most important things you can give students, but understandably it seems like it's not something that has received a lot of support from the administration and and lastly, I'll just say the the needs for sustaining the child care sector.
It needs to be an all hands on deck effort and there's transparency of communication kind of early and often, but I think the one thing that we're really hoping for is more creativity in that how we test students to ensure schools are safe, how we staff up schools, how we conduct remote learning.
So I think that's just kind of something we're thinking about as well is how can we make sure that we're not just doing the bare minimum here in opening schools, but also making it the best possible experience, because these are students and every single day they have a chance, it's going to get the education they deserve and even though everything's going on in the world, we need to do the best that we can to give them that opportunity.
It seems to me like a lot of the ways we track progress and measure progress at various schools will need to be adapted, and I have not really seen much about that in terms of best practices so wondering if that's something your office has thought about at all or if you've heard of kind of any work, that's being done around the city on that yeah.
I know that the way the department of education so far has been monitoring like just basic student attendance is really not what what you or I might think of in terms of what attendance is it's it's tracking student engagement, which could be anything from you know.
I I think that, unfortunately, the data collection and consistency isn't what we hope for where we're still kind of in the okay, how many students are checking in each day on remote learning platforms?
It is just so incredibly varied across schools and classrooms and and students that I think we're we're, unfortunately, still kind of in the in the very basic questions of how many students are regularly accessing it every day and out of that number, how many are logging into all their periods?
Experience actually look like, but I think, unfortunately, even at this late time, when we had months of virtual learning, we're still not quite there yet do I see any other raised hands.
One thing I would add is that that that recommendation, something that we called for in our school report is to make sure that every school is a social worker ready and on staff this year we think it's probably something that should have had them long ago, but especially now, more than ever, when there's been so much different types of trauma, so many students have gone through it's even more important for them to to know.
I I completely agree that, like when we talk about the need for more staffing, you know sort of one of our our sub recommendations with something that could definitely be built out into something more prominent is leveraging many community-based organizations that work with youth throughout the city and who have you know many of these organizations are without contracts or their contracts.
I totally agree I'm looking for any hands any any further questions for elizabeth and luke from the committee.
She is the parent coordinator at school of the future, patricia I I hope that you will talk to us a little bit about what school of the future is thinking about in terms of reopening and very specifically about your request regarding open streets.
You know like we wanted to do a play street, it's located on 22nd street, but we don't want to shut 22nd street down between lexington and I think it's park that that's a a major throwaway I guess going through.
They've got open streets in front of their businesses like they take two parking spaces in front of their businesses, so we're hoping for a partial play street like taking two parking spaces in front of where our building is on the footprint of the building on lexington and on 22nd street, for when the kids are coming in in peak times, drop-off and then at dismissal, and to keep the staff the the children and community as safe as possible, we'll triage the kids there, like you, know, right before the doors open to kind of line them up.
We also, besides, that we've also put in through the department of transportation app for more bike racks, because then a lot of the teachers and I'm sure the students are going to be biking, and I don't believe currently there are any bike racks in front of the school, and so we're going to need that on on lexington avenue, as well as on 22nd, and you know the footprint of this of the building, and I think oh yeah and the other thing is to address what luke was saying earlier, that they are trying to think creatively of having the kids outside outdoors more we're, hoping that we could walk the kids to like madison square park or union square, so they can be outside.
Do any members of the committee have any questions for patricia use the raise hand function rachel.
Any questions from attendees, please use your raised hand, function, seeing none we're going to move into business session and discuss moving forward on this support of the application of school of the future.
Any thoughts from the committee are people generally in support of opening up play spaces for schools like school of the future, taking parking spaces to allow the kids to assemble both before and after school for check-in and dismissal rachel yeah, I mean I think, in line with our previous presentation.
Okay, thanks for the requirement any other comments from the committee, seeing none I'm going to ask.
1St, which is the current period of the commercial run tax that we're in in terms of payment, and then it would end the day before it's very confusing, but basically it would end what, after whatever is later, the the end of the state of emergency by the city or the state, and so it's a little bit different than the other bill, but definitely the same aim and more about kind of the urgency of the moment, we're in in terms of being able to provide direct relief to businesses, and this is one of the ways that the city can actually take action and provide direct relief.
I can answer any other questions, but that's kind of the the update and would obviously be happy to if we could get a you know supportive statement or resolution from cb5 about the bill.
I don't want to over overstate my eagerness, but I guess the one question that I had, which came up last time when we discussed this was you know, I think, for reasons that are understandable to all of us: a lack of data around financial impact to the city by removing this tax, whether temporarily or permanently, I'm guessing.
We it'll have to be a discussion with you know the speaker and other council members about how much where we want the threshold to be in the bill, and I think we you know, based on the cost, are open to negotiating it.
Businesses should be paying a tax just for having a space that other boroughs are not paying, and I think we also you know wanted to to do it, for you know, understanding that the city was in a is in a fiscal crisis and that we, you know, just passed this budget that took quite a while to get done.
You know we agreed to a budget and we don't want to put a hole in the budget retroactively so, but I think this will have a lot of support and I think we'll be able to get support from other members even outside of manhattan.
For this thanks abigail, I wonder if it would be worthwhile just to refresh the committee to explain what the tax is below 97th street in, like two sentences sure.
Was there any thought or discussion around you know, making this last aft like well after the state of emergency ends to give businesses some breathing room to try to catch up and invest in the changes they need to make to get back to normal yeah?
Okay, thanks zach, sorry, so, just to clarify you said if their base rents under one million dollars right yeah for the year one million a year.
I mean I I think that's that's one thing we'll have to negotiate is whether we want to target the relief, for example just for businesses on the ground like ground floor retail or whether we want you know, there's different ways to make sure that we're targeting the right people.
But I do think that the idea is that we need to come out with something to kind of resolve this unfair, and the reason I originally asked is because there are a lot of financial institutions that don't necessarily rent a lot of space, but they run very expensive space such as you know up and down midtown and fifth and sixth avenue, and so I completely agree with the rent.
You know some sort of tax break for a small restaurant bodega, all the mom-and-pop businesses, but you know, I think, there's a if you look at like I'm guessing.
I think we really wanted to just start off with just a clean bill that was helping the most businesses possible in manhattan because of the urgency of the crisis, and we didn't want to get into all the different thresholds that you could do but- and I think that makes it a little more complicated, but I I think we're open to that discussion and I'll talk to the council member about that as well.
Thank you, joe more questions from the committee renee.
Thank you and second question, and maybe the council members in the city have already been discussing it and I'm not aware, but any discussion around tax responsibilities for landlords any tax responsibility for I know, there's discussions at the state level, around tax relief and a lot of the rental relief programs have come out of the state because they have more control over some of those areas.
Thank you more questions from the committee, seeing none I'm going to turn to the attendees and ask that you use your raise hand button.
If you have a question, if you're joining us from a phone, you can press star 9 to raise your hand, seeing nothing from attendees, I'm going to turn it back to the committee, we're going to go into business session and discuss the bill support of the bill, a resolution in support of the bill.
If this is something that we're interested in, with the caveat that both zach and joe mention, meaning that you look to annual income, who would like to kick off the discussion, evan yeah, I I would, I would offer my support of the bill as I did with the previous version of it.
This is just about the million dollars but, like I said, I think we're open to adding that in an amendment I I think the intent is obviously to help businesses that do need it, and so I'll I'll talk to the council.
I thought we were talking about businesses under 10 million dollars like last time in income, but or was it fun yeah?
I think there was an income and I'd have to also see what the like, what number of businesses we'd be talking about for who who would be under this kind of like venn diagram and income higher than that and rent lower than 1 million, but yeah I can look into.
What I'm hearing is a general support of the bill with two different two different philosophies about how to implement one thinking that it's good the way it stands another one zach and joe and july thinking that there should be some parsing of the type of small businesses that get the relief I'd like to hear so from a few other members of the committee and get a sense of what they're thinking about this hi renee.
You don't want it to be administratively difficult to actually implement this, so you know, I think, maybe we could use language.
Okay, any other comments from the committee yeah renee, I was just gonna, say I actually completely agree with what joe and chuck just said.
I hear support for a resolution in favor of that response that we're in favor of the bill, generally, with the caveat that we would like it focused on those businesses that truly require it as a result of coven and that it it belongs to the council member and to the council to figure out how to parse that specifically robert, I missed you go ahead, no, no problem.
I don't think that we're specifically advocating one way or the other of doing the parsing, we're suggesting that if the bill has been introduced to provide relief to businesses that have suffered because of kovid that are paying this commercial rent tax, then it should be focused to those players and not necessarily, as zach pointed out to maybe a hedge fund that doesn't necessarily need or require the relief because covet has not impacted their business.
So, do I hear a motion in favor of a resolution to support the bill with language that says we do believe there should be some way or some parsing of businesses that require the relief as a result of covet, and that's we want it to be directed to those businesses and not necessarily to businesses as a whole.
Okay again, I want to thank joseph particularly and then rob july for their work and pete on the resolution and I'd like to open it up to questions.
I looked through my notes to very specifically reflect what I heard from our committee members, because I didn't want to include something that hadn't been there at the outset of our conversation, but certainly we can discuss it now and add it to the resolution.
I think having that language in there is important just for understanding it in the terms that that we normally hear use to describe police protocol when it comes to discipline, but I I think that removing the this sort of editorializing, which I agree with by the way but the the editorializing about the status quo, wouldn't you know, affect the the outcome of of that language.
As I understood it, chuck's comment was about removing certain phrasing, and all I wanted to say was that I think the phrase desk duty is important to include in the resolution just as a sort of plain language explanation of of what the current protocol is and and what this is in contrast to, and so I had a sort of convoluted way of making that point.
I think that the city council has the authority to to to either enable or require the department to come up with a program like that.
I I have a comment who's speaking joseph sorry, joseph I I think I guess my response to to your point july about officers you know declining to respond.
I think you know just like the nypd is it's a department that works at the pleasure of the mayor?
I didn't raise my hand, but joseph the devil is in the details there on how many officers that would be and where that balance comes out, and I think that that the value of the proposed resolution is that it doesn't require us to resolve that balance.
So I actually agree with what you're saying I want to hear some other committee members and then I have a second point.
Okay, more efficient, okay, I guess with the goal of saving saving the budget or reducing the budget right, I think a recurring theme of this committee has always been saving funds and looking for efficiency, so I think that's right in line with things that we've done again and again and again, but I want to hear from the committee renee: can I chime in joseph yes right yeah?
Okay, rachel, I see your hand yeah just gonna, say I thought it was already like a legal requirement in the city for them to have a balanced budget.
Yeah my hand is still raised from before, but I kind of echo what rachel was saying on that point: okay, so I'm hearing that we're not we're not in favor, particularly of adding a balanced budget to our core principles, to strive for a balanced budget.
