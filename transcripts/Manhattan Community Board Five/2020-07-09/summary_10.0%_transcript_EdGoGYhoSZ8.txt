Okay, everybody thanks for logging in and taking the time out of your afternoon to attend our first power to the youth town hall, brought to you by our partner community board v, which is so graciously hosting this event.
What can change look like for young people who are directly affected by policies implemented now and in the future and who better to ask than our very own New York City teens today for power to the youth, we've brought together three young leaders who will be in direct connection with our lead public officials, and you could go ahead and pour that over.
Today, for our public officials, we have deputy borough president Matthew Washington of the Manhattan borough, president Gale, a brewer first deputy public advocate Nicki Smith of the office of public advocate Jumaane Williams, and then we have also New York City Council member Carl, inna Rivera of district 2 and with all of those introductions with that I cede the floor to our young people, and if you could go ahead and show on your camera Paula, would you like to take the mic?
We have a chance to Center the voices of young people who are really the leaders of today by tomorrow, with during all of us ourselves, a big favor and in fact that Ashley is a great segue into your question, which is why am I in this stuff as I get into policy and politics and organizing for me, I think it started around the same age as I.
Think, like you all, are doing here, speak to the elected officials and actually getting involved in city government there.
So, while I was spent years here in New, York helping elected officials literally drafting right bills, I did that myself during college, so that was really great grounding my soul, to wrap it up and to get to your point power about how that all relevant said today.
One is the problem and two are the solutions and I'm privileged to be in space now, as deputy public advocate working with public advocate's Ronnie Williams in pushing the mayor or certain reforms, and also working with council members, including councilmember Rivera, who is on and adopting the reforms that young people in others are pushing hard on so I love that question I.
I never thought that I would be an elected official, but I tell you that now that I am I've used all the years of organizing and providing services and being on the community board, which all of you all can do and now I'm in a position where I can actually push legislative reform or I can advocate to you, know, repeal fifty-eight and make sure that we have transparency and accountability in the NYPD that we're still a very long way from that.
And then you know, put forward a bill to ban the chokehold nationally to make sure that I'm funding programs and services that not only I needed as a young person, but that I know that are important to just basic survival.
Those of us who are working government and all so much thanks to Sidney and Richie in New, York, Public Library, and also to Lucan Community Board five, how I love that you're promoting reading on your shirt, which is awesome because we definitely need to read it's so important and critical, and you know when I think about how I got into public service.
I want them to get jobs and I got a job and I went to college and I still can't live in my neighborhood there's a real problem here, and so it started and kicked off my effort to join my community board and be in public service to say, I'm going to use whatever power I have whatever voice I have to fight for somebody else, because I know some of the struggles, but I know that if we're given an opportunity, if we're given a doorway to walk through that's different than what somebody else may have told us, we have to walk through.
So I could help make sure young people know that we have choices and we can do great things.
Thank you and you're speaking about choices and young people, and so I want to again go ahead and open the floor back up to our young leaders.
It's an important one when we think about our communities and when we look at proficiency rates in reading and mathematics too many times too often we're falling behind, and so what are we doing there couple of things right when we look at those things when we look at protection, when we look at education, we look at health.
One of the things that we have really worked hard to do is to make sure that there is food available by supporting farmers markets in neighborhoods by supporting growing programs working with great organizations like Green City force that are putting farms on NYCHA developments, harvest home farmers, market, concrete, safaris and many of these organizations that are help providing food.
How do we work with all of them to make sure they have what they need is critical and then, when we think about the protection that you talks about, pinnacle is making sure communities are healthy and alive and thriving, and you know if we are building more cohesion amongst ourselves between us and our neighbors.
The office of public advocate is working on some legislation right now on the mental health issue, to support families and including young people, I think, as many of us know right now, if you call 911- and you complain that you know a friend or a member of the family is going to a mental health crisis right now, they send police officers to respond to the scene, but then often yeah they often can become a dangerous situation, because if you think, logically, by sending someone in the uniform with a badge and a gun and their posture is, you know not necessarily to de-escalate a situation and they may not have the training to de-escalate those can turn into some pretty terrible situations and I think in particular, of a black woman who lost her life for Deborah Danner in a similar circumstance and there's just all the cases across the city, but in recent history of encounters people who are experiencing some stress by any counters with police.
I think is really fantastic in the sense that you are yourselves organizing and pushing change, and we try to as an office make sure that we are having similar types of events, but ensuring that we're listening as people who are in government, because there is no real division between you know, quote young people and Carlina Matthew to myself.
So this form I think it is great to help those in power really hear from understand the things that you are pushing for some grateful for this space, pink I'll just say: I'm, the you know in the City Council on the chair of the Committee on hospitals and a lot of my work has focused on addressing systemic barriers to healthcare, and that includes mental health as well, and Co would really Illustrated the inequity in our health care system.
If you wanted to go ahead and talk about that or asked about that, hi I'm nyah, so yeah I, don't really have a lot of questions in regards to policy, but a lot about education and I just feel like k12 is not getting the proper education, especially black and brown teams, and we really ask ourselves why teens of color drop out of school, but when we see what we're learning at school and has nothing to do with our history, it has nothing to do with where we come from.
What reforms do you think we should make in the education system to make sure that all groups are represented and all groups are all forms and traces of history are talked about and understood not just by black and brown kids, but also privileged white kids as well and I do want to interject Maya before everybody else.
While also grappling with what is just you know, racism, systemic racism, entrenched and really just affecting everything that I think is basic, which I always say is food housing, education and health care.
You know one thing about K to 12 education and thank you for the question and I yeah I.
Well, can somebody tell me how trigonometry is helping me get a job that I can help take care of my family with and so I think we need to infuse more career pathway, ideology into schools and help young people.
You know the importance of economics, you know how many you know how many young people are learning about credit in high school right.
Next great chef, you know whatever show that we're watching these days, and so how do we think about the conversion from the classroom to real life, to addressing real life needs and I think we have to do a better job at showing those connection points and providing more information to young people about how there is a pathway for something beyond just the classroom?
I really feel, like you guys, made really good points about, like all the elements within education, especially the connection between, like my life and the life that we learn about and I feel like a lot of older people who, you know, aren't really worried about high school and learning anymore.
The fact that we have to continuously repeat over and over our life matters, because other people look at us and feel automatic threat or feel like we just automatically don't matter in society that you know just because the way that my skin color looks and not what's in my brain and my potential and how I want to strive to be important, strive to move Society, it's very disheartening to be a person in society to continue fighting for something that we shouldn't even be fighting for.
Well, how I think the first thing that we need to do is all sit down, keep our mouth shut and listen to you talk because you have, you know, just you know an incredible passion and understanding for what's going on and the way you articulate the argument is really powerful, and so thank you for being willing to share, and you know, with respect to what we need to do.
You know, love towards others in a way, that's meaningful and show respect for the people who were trying to fight for and so I think it is.
So almost one community boards and that's a sort of a way that many of us can start really engaging in a quote, unquote or formal capacity with issues that we're seeing you know on our block and in our neighborhoods so and I think the age was dropped to I, believe it was 16 or 17 right, say: 16 yeah, so you can even apply to become a member, and actually you can just obtain these meetings and they talk about issues of housing and policing and education and they also push themselves as board members, elected officials and others with solutions that you pitch and then you know more longer-term, consider running for office yourself.
I recently asked my interns, you know what does it mean to you when we talk about defunding the NYPD abolishing the NYPD just to hear directly from the people that are out there from the people that are really have been served with a lot of the mistakes that we have made as a society and that they're going to have to live with and try to grapple with police brutality with climate change, with everything else so is just trying to bring as many of y'all around the table and the way you can do.
So, as a matter of you know, like housing policy alone, it's making sure that we can afford homes that are kind of more spread out in different areas that we have opportunities to live in areas that are not dance terminal to our health.
I mean what you all want to do is kind of like an everyday no-brainer and in some school districts, because they have the resources they can go on trips all the time, because they're PTAs can raise a million dollars.
We just need to make sure, as Nick mentioned, that there's equity and how these resources are being distributed to our school systems and we're not listening to the young people.
I mean you know the school leadership teams, the community education councils.
The way that dollars flow to our hospital systems, -, is very inequitable, so I think it's really listening to you all and then making sure we're looking at some of these formulas that deal in finances that are just not coming down to the black and brown low-income immigrant communities that we need them to also want to encourage on education.
What's going on be engaged and make sure all of our voices are heard in these discussions, and thank you - posting that information in the chat and, of course, I know.
We have to change the way those dollars come into our systems, and we also have to look at kind of the local health clinics that serve people very culturally, humble care, our federally qualified health systems, which is, are those local clinics that probably a lot of our families go to and how are incorporating health into the education system.
If you know any black people trying to go into the medical field, support them, which you can to get them in there, because I personally has health issues and I do have a fear that going to a doc, you know I'm now, 18 I can go to the doctors by myself and I'm afraid of having to encounter someone saying I'm not going to help you simply because they don't want to.
If you have, when did you see your first black teacher I mean there's some real issues right there and a lot of that is, you know, actually lies in our education system, even medical school, the bias that is within that institution.
We don't have to stop learning about math or English composition, because we do need those things to read, and you know it's just like.
You have here March again today, right now at 5:30 for Columbus Circle and then Fernan youth, huddle, pinnacle you're, doing Saint, Mark's, Church 712 in Brooklyn and, of course, the march on Washington August 28th, led by Reverend Al, Sharpton, okay, folks, thank you so much and Luke did you want to jump on speaking of community boards Matthew that you continue to push.
Did you want to talk a little bit about the community board meeting coming up on Monday and I will take this cause opportunity to plug the census?
So, thank you I'm just going to say that since this New York, Public, Library and CB 5, who they know, I love them so much.
Okay, I think that's a great point to end last thoughts from our young people, one more time since everyone's saying thank you.
