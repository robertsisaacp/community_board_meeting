We will be using question and answer feature at the bottom of the screen to help with that, because we expect a lot of people to attend tonight, but we'll go over that at a later point, thanks luke.
We have three items in our agenda tonight: they're all updates from the department of transportation who has who's joining us here tonight, we'll be hearing updates on a couple different topics, including the status of the open streets and restaurants program, which of course, is ongoing, we'll be hearing updates and some follow-up information that we asked dot to come back to us with regarding data and observations about the 14th street busway, which of course has been underway for many months.
At this point and we'll hear an update on the ongoing fifth avenue improvements, design process so without further ado, we'll we'll get started with the the first of those items on the agenda, which is an update on fifth avenue and the design process, which I will I'll introduce briefly to provide some context for the members of the committee and and then I'll send it over to ed pinkar and the team from dot to to present what they brought tonight.
There are several elements of improving fifth avenue that we've heard about over the years, including a long-standing desire to continue to add to the city's interconnected bike lane network, to improve cyclist and pedestrian safety and to provide a little history.
What you might have heard about is the is the busway which the mayor announced earlier this summer to be installed at some point soon that has been the subject of ongoing community advisory board meetings or cab meetings being run by dot in communication with the community to discuss and design whatever the rules and structure of a bus way would be in dialogue with the community.
So for that reason, and to kind of set expectations for the for the committee, because the design we're seeing is not final, because the bus way is actually still under discussion and the rules and goals of it aren't finalized yet and because community board five is frankly already on the record relative to the concept of a protected bike lane and, of course, doesn't need to take a redundant position on that.
I don't anticipate there being a vote or the taking of a position by the committee on this proposal this month, because it's still in development dot will certainly come back to us after the final cab meeting relative to the busway after continuing to design and discuss the rest of the fifth avenue development and continuing to iterate on the kind of complete street design.
You know asking questions from members of the committee and members of the district and I'm sure that dot is interested to hear our feedback as the design process continues and is ongoing.
We were happy that fifth avenue was included in that plan and we convened two community advisory board meetings thus far over the summer to start discussing what those improvements could look like.
One of the things that we quickly heard from some of you from our elected officials and from other community stakeholders, is that fifth avenue serves a variety of interests and needs not only new yorkers who work there, who live nearby, who commute through it, but also millions upon millions of tourists who come to this most iconic avenue each and every year, and hopefully, they'll be back in mass pretty soon.
So, at our second community advisory board group meeting, we presented not only our initial ideas for how a bus way could operate, but also the bones of a complete street for fifth avenue, including both needed pedestrian space, as well as a protected bicycle lane, and we're excited tonight to run through that presentation to give you a sense of what we're thinking for the corridor as we look towards implementing a project later, this fall.
Obviously I personally, I hope that we get some good feedback on the complete street design in 2017, along with a former member of janet's team, we presented the double busway proposal and I remember getting some pretty strong criticism from this committee and from a lot of members that it failed to include any pedestrian or cyclist improvements we promised at the time.
The better buses restart plan was announced among highlighting the critical role that buses have played during the covid pandemic and as the city adapts and reopens, ridership numbers are still indicating that bus ridership has increased while subway ridership remains low and this furthers a need to provide reliable transit service that prioritizes the bus, especially as we can anticipate people have a greater desire for alternatives to the subway, which will include a shift to buses, bikes, walking war and private vehicles.
Coming from all five boroughs with so many routes, there can be 60 to 160 buses per hour throughout the day on fifth avenue, increasing the important importance that delays here have an impact on bus speed and reliability citywide and with a focus on transit service, reliability and better buses restart program, highlighting the critical roles that buses have played during the kobe 19 pandemic.
Again, we just include this to emphasize the role improvements on fifth avenue has for the entire city and communities with limited options to talk more about the daily bus riders who use fifth avenue, I'm going to hand it over to a colleague at the mta laura who will share a few slides with you all hi ola.
During the height of the pandemic, the decreased traffic levels led to an increase in bus speeds on the fifth avenue corridor speeds increasing 32 in the morning peak and up to 48 in the pm peak, which is really impressive and obviously helpful for our bus customers to get you know to complete their journeys more quickly and reliably.
I'm happy to answer any more questions about bus service if they come up, but with that I think I can hand it back to chelsea flora thanks and right now continuing.
Ed and others have already acknowledged that this that there are, we have received support from the community previously, when the double bus lane was implemented in 2018 and that there have been longstanding requests for more of a complete street approach, including a protected bike lane in this midtown portion of fifth avenue and all the time we're making sure accommodating the highest pedestrian volumes in this area, especially during the holiday season, and just to elaborate on the complete street approach.
There are multiple opportunities that present themselves on fifth avenue, as we consider how critical it is to improve bus speeds and reliability, create more pedestrian space, safer conditions, adding a protected bike lane and accommodating the vehicle, pickups and drop-offs that take place in such a busy corridor and also finding ways to incorporate beautification efforts with these opportunities.
A complete street approach will provide space to have a dedicated safe area for bikes during the city's recovery and when looking at the vehicle travel speeds, it's useful to think about what traffic typically would look like on fifth avenue and also looking at where we are in the middle of this token.
So now we'd like to present to the board a complete street proposal for fifth avenue just to catch everyone up on where we are since the mayor's announcement, starting with outreach and engagement, a community advisory board or a cab which is made up of the of elected officials, cb members, representatives of local institutions, property owners, transit advocates and bus riders on 5th avenue.
We are continuing to without evaluate this feedback and suggestions that we're receiving and we'll be meeting with the cab again next month, and even though we are still evaluating all of the possible traffic restrictions in this project area, we know we want to move forward with the safety elements, including the protected bike, lane sanded pedestrian space and the pickup and drop off zones.
Our proposal tonight includes a parking protected bike lane along the corridor by providing dedicated space, we're able to boost safety and better organize the roadway to promote better interactions amongst all street users.
You know you're able to set things in the roadway pause and then and then find a gap across the bike lane and make your way to the sidewalk or the pedestrian space next slide.
We think these will be on almost every block and the point is to provide space for taxis and other free for higher vehicles to be able to pull over outside of the travel lane and maintain traffic flow.
We want to make the existing double bus lanes on fifth avenue work as well as possible way.
Some of the strategies that we're considering cyclists that are currently using the bus lanes will be relocated to the new projected bike lane bus lane cameras can be used for enforcement and, of course, we'll continue to monitor the use of the new pickup and drop-off zones can also continue monitoring, seasonal traffic and if there needs to be any seasonal traffic restrictions on 5th avenue again, all traffic restrictions are continued to be evaluated and sharing the ways we plan on monitoring.
We benefit from a monitoring system called midtown emotion, which captures traffic congestion and travel times we'll continue to coordinate with colleagues at the mta, reviewing bus speeds and reliability data and our plan is to provide more detail on monitoring thresholds when we meet again in september, as we begin to wrap up the presentation, I want to quickly summarize our next steps dot will discuss the details of the updated sign with the cab in early september and return to the cb in late september.
I'm not going to read it off, but when this presentation is posted on the previous website, you will have that link yeah and the project timeline currently consists of consists of ongoing outreach and stakeholder engagement, including meetings with you all and the cab throughout this year.
So, as I understand it they'll you know they'll, of course, be at least one more cab meeting, while the design is still being developed and finalized, and the rules and goals of any eventual bus way.
I can definitely take that we over the summer heard again excellent feedback from not only cab members, but our elected officials and property owners and other stakeholders, as some ask great questions, others put forward some suggestions related to the restrictions that we're currently analyzing.
Obviously, you know, if that slips at all my office will keep cb5 and other cab members updated along the way and then, when we get to implementation, certainly depending on what goes in the ground, when we're always going to have some initial back and forth as we, you know, try to fight through that awkward construction period, and then we can discuss with the cab at the next meeting.
What the most helpful schedule will be moving forward on providing updates, but my office attends the transportation committee meeting every month and we're happy to you know provide updates along the way if we need to do something more formal in terms of additional presentations.
Please always send our way so that we can work with our colleagues to address them as best as we can thanks just planning ahead to the to the public member session would encourage members who I'm sorry, members of the public, who have a question to please review what has been asked in the q a and instead of asking a second time a question.
As always, first of all, we started off not only this presentation, but the original idea for the project, understanding that fifth avenue is an iconic corridor that serves many different uses, not only all of the pedestrians who walk through the area, both on the avenue and the cross streets.
You know this stretch of fifth avenue sure that's another great question and we learned a lot from our experience with 14th street in that respect, and certainly when we launched the 14th street busway, it was not seamless in dealing with the taxi industry and some of the others, the trucking industry and other buses non-mta buses.
Fifth avenue is a little bit of a different you know set up than 14th street.
You know companies so that they would take drivers on a different route from earlier on and there are a lot of different ways depending on where people are coming from and where they're going that traffic would be able to find its way and still ensure local access janet chelsea.
So the whole part of the better buses restart program was to allow us to implement projects before all of the traffic came back so that we would be doing this monitoring instead of a lot of intense upfront studies like the kinds that we may have done on 14th street.
So that's where this monitoring comes in and where, if we're, if we end up a bus way and those traffic restrictions, are a pilot where we could actually study how those things are working as it goes along and make adjustments as we needed to okay.
It was a little bit of a sophie's choice as to whether or not to do get those numbers before we dug into fifth avenue here, but it will, I think, be useful to see what we learned from 14th street and bring that I think to the next cab meeting final call for any questions from the committee.
Unfortunately, but we hear from many stakeholders, including our elected officials, about that connection- and it's something we're working on thanks next question: dot is expected to come back next month with a final design.
You know, stakeholders throughout this corridor and beyond, who had legitimate questions and concerns, and it's certainly been beneficial to us and to our teams at dot to be able to hear those questions, and you know try to work through them to make sure that we are implementing the best possible proposal for fifth avenue, and you know, I think the inclusion of a complete street plan is a worthy inclusion and it's certainly taken some time to do some of that engineering, but it's going to lead to a better overall project thanks.
Okay, the next question protected by lanes and bus lanes, would increase the number of people going through the area who might stop into busi.
I do think that you know we we're absolutely looking at ways to improve bus service throughout the city.
Great thanks then- and I just want to say to members of the public thanks very much for for rolling with us, as we you know, try this new system, as opposed to all being in a room together and going around the room, appreciate your cooperation as much as possible and we'll continue to prioritize the questions that seem to have the most up votes.
Those bus riders are very well represented, but we're happy to take any question comment feedback complaint from different community boards or residents throughout the city.
If anybody from dot or mta can identify questions that can be answered, feel free to type in answers, everybody will be able to see them thanks, luke, that's very helpful and a great way to get more questions answered while being respectful everyone's time.
To answer any of your questions, I just wanted to thank everybody for their time tonight and certainly commit to being in touch soon as we move forward with this very exciting proposal.
Sean can elaborate on this if he has more to add, but essentially we are widening proposing to widen the sidewalk on the east side, where feasible adjacent to the bike lanes, so it is taking into account the needs of pedestrians, as well as cyclists, and as sean mentioned, or as chelsea mentioned, we have thousands of cyclists using this corridor and we've had requests from elected officials and the community board to add space for cyclists.
I think we do understand that the barrels haven't been working out as well as we might have liked and that they're very challenging so, which is why we are looking to use delineators instead, I don't know if sean is still on, but I think ed kind of touched on the other reasons for not using other materials earlier, but we have learned from you know our experiences with the initial temporary bike lanes that the barrels really are a challenge to maintain and so we're looking at the delineators and stuff right- and I I'm still here kim and the goal is to try to get this in this year.
I think right now we are trying to get through a lot of the early planning stages meeting with the cab, making sure that the cross sections that we're working towards make sense- and I think some of those finer amenities can come.
You know a little later in this process, but I think could be included in this plan and just to note that, generally, we have gotten a lot of requests for increased bike parking as buildings anticipate folks coming back to work on bike, so we are working on expanding our bike parking around.
I will say that we have added some camera enforcement on fifth avenue already and we will be looking to do more if we think that is a particular issue or concern, I mean, as you should know, pickups and drop-offs are allowed in the bus lane, so it is always possible for people to access the curb, and that is legal activity, but if people are parked there for longer than or making the incorrect turns off the corridor driving in the bus lane, we would issue violations for that.
I'll just add- and you know thanks for that question I'll- just add that we are really looking to how we can make this street work best for everyone and most fairly for everyone.
110 000 bus riders a day is a huge number of people that come to fifth avenue from all over the city, working in all kinds of jobs, and you know we are trying to make their commutes as easy as possible, encourage people to take public transportation, but we also know that people need to get to all of their businesses via fhv.
There is a huge pedestrian need along this corridor, so this complete street proposal is really trying to balance out all of the means of the corridor in the best way possible to make it work for everyone thanks.
Let you speak to it again if you'd like to, but I think the question is: why not faster sure I mean the general answer.
Okay, thank you, yeah that might be might be useful information to have when you folks return to us down the last dozen or so next question are pickup times factored into measuring the bus speed.
I understand the question specifically so the bus lanes are currently in place and the pilot would be the addition of restrictions on through traffic or turn movements and that sort of thing, and so it's so it's a pilot, there's no plan for permanent restrictions.
The cab is evaluating, separated from the rest of the complete street proposal, so I think one of the challenges here is that we're looking to install a bike lane, be it temporary or permanent, and some pedestrian space.
While we work through some of the other concerns, we've heard and tried to just come up with the best plan for the bus as well feel free to add anything to that d.o.t. Okay, thanks next question is how will adding these painted lanes affect the black lives matter, mural currently painted on 5th avenue?
At this point, the current bus lanes are in effect, 24 hours a day for any other traffic restrictions that we might employ here, we'll we're still examining that and that's part of what we'll bring back to the cab and to the cb final question: if there will be polls and cameras and signage added all along fifth avenue, what does that mean for the community board's established priority of clear visual corridors?
Quite so many attendees we'll continue to try to do better and improve on this process as well, but with that we'll we'll wrap up this agenda item talking about fifth avenue thanks again to dot and thanks again to all the members of the public who participated in it with that we'll go to what I believe should be much briefer sections of our meeting.
The next agenda item is updates on the 14th street busway d.o.t. We sent we sent a couple questions along in advance, not sure if you want to speak at all to to those questions and whether or not you had any thoughts on addressing them and some of the data that we had talked about in the past in terms of continuing to assess 14th street sure I think janet was gonna.
I think there were just a few questions about the busway and so just to speak generally, as you may know, dot through our through the consultant, sam schwartz engineering released two monitoring ports monitoring reports about the busway, each, which showed really positive results for the busway pilot.
The survey took place before the pandemic and the lockdown, which really changed traffic patterns since then, and you know obviously business conditions and residential occupancy along the corridor and all that, can you speak to what and I guess I might be asking you to think back to pre covid, like february and march.
I know that going door-to-door was some of the preliminary work that was done by dot or sam schwartz, contacted by dot before the before the bus way was implemented, and I was wondering whether that kind of survey of businesses on the corridor was done.
I think I want at this point to open things up to the committee and see if there are any any particular questions again, knowing that we still have this.
Are there any sort of open or lingering questions for members of the committee that they'd like to direct to dot at this point, perhaps relative to any questions that we might have brought up the last time we were discussing this with them feel free to raise your hand if you have a question: okay, not seeing any.
So I think there's a couple questions there, which I think are very valid, given what we've heard the intention of the fifth avenue cab to continue operating in a in a feedback and iteration sort of way, even after it's theoretically implemented, is anything equivalent is an equivalent community advisory board planned for 14th street.
The cabs were acknowledgement that we couldn't do that same thing for these projects that we have been doing for 14th street, and I think that the process that we've had for 14 through the boards and other means has been effective, and we can continue to take questions from the community through the board process, and I think that that's a good way to do it and obviously kimberly and jennifer, can talk about how they are accessible at all times in manhattan office.
We don't have specific data on that ej, but you know generally, traffic volumes right now are lower due to the pandemic, but if there are any questions about certain congested areas, we could take a look.
You know like a 12 to 15 foot emergency lane, I'm not quite sure what the specific example is here, but if there are questions or if there's a restaurant owner or a restaurant group, that's asking you can connect them with myself and kimberly and we can take a closer look great.
So there are, you know, circumstances where establishments have short frontages that also align with bus stops or moving lanes or fire hydrants, and at the moment we don't have a mechanism to allow those restaurants to do outdoor dining setup and hopefully in some situations they have wide enough sidewalks where they can apply for sidewalk seating and if not all, right, thanks bj has a question.
