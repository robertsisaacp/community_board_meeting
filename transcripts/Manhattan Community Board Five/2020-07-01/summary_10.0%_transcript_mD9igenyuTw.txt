So the first item on the agenda is for an application to obtain a four-year extension of time to complete construction of a new building, and the address is 12-14 east 48th street.
This is an application based upon a request that the board determined that the owner of the property has a common law vested right to complete construction.
As of this week, they are re-mobilizing, but we don't expect that they're going to start physical construction until the middle of july, and at that point there is some concern that they will not be able to finish a hundred percent of the work to get a tco for the entire building by the existing expiration date.
So, in the absence of any statutory basis for further extension of time, the option that presents itself is to seek a common law vesting remedy, and the reason for doing that is that common law, investing is, has been regarded by the courts and is now regarded by the board as an alternative to statutory vesting that preserves essentially what are considered to be vested constitutional rights.
There have actually been two common law, vesting cases involving hotels decided by the next slide, peter decided by the board in the last couple years, and they have found that percentages of completion or number of days expended or percentage of total number of days required to complete that were sufficient to establish a common law right to best, far less than what exists here.
The first finding includes the notion that the owner had a valid permit issued pursuant to approved plans and specifications when the zoning was enacted, and that has already been determined by the board of standards and appeals in the first application, and the board is a quasi-judicial body.
Again, this amount is far more than both the board and the courts have found appropriate for a finding of common law vested rights in west 39th street, which I meant mentioned earlier.
So that's those are the three findings peter and I think that's essentially what we have to say and we're happy to answer any questions that the board may have all right.
We will start with questions from our members of the committee, so I'm going to ask you to use the raised hand function if you need any assistance with the interface luke zavados, who is a the community board associate, is with us and can chime in, but hopefully you're all fluent with the zoom platform, and so please raise your hands and yeah.
I just wanted to make sure that you said you did not need the full four years and how much time do you expect, given that we don't know what's going to happen with covid, but how much time do you expect to complete the construction if we can, if we are able to fully mobilize and get all the required workers on the site, we believe will be done by the end of march, if there's no further shutdowns, if we don't, you know in a second wave, have to close the job again.
Okay, all right, let's see any other questions from other members of the committee.
Only members of the committee are allowed to discuss the matter and we need comments on this application.
I just think there's an issue with giving four years, because, even though they say they don't really need the full four years, I just worried that the traffic on 48th street there's a lot of construction going on the next block over is the is the jp morgan tower that's being demolished, and I just want to make sure that the date is more firm than just four years.
I am comfortable with giving them an extension, obviously there's an extraordinary amount of work that has been completed, and I think particularly this is a time for us to be to recognize and to and to assist whenever possible projects like this to be fully completed.
I also recognize that it is imprecise projecting when something like this is gonna, be complete and so like mike four years, feels like a long time to me.
You know what is a an end date supposed to protect against, because I guess like what is there a downside of saying, okay, you can have another four or five years like what is that meant.
So in that particular instance, I think we all recognize that the applicant does meet the requirement, for you know these criteria to make this determination.
Now, if you were to decide that you know it can be sort of like open-ended another applicant, that may be, you know less professional in the way they're handling a situation could actually take advantage of it, and we don't want that type of situation where you know a project may be stalled and it may be in the interest of the developer to actually install a project so that, for example, they can speculate that you know the market is going to boom and it would be beneficial to actually wait a little bit before a project gets completed, or you know.
So in essence, you basically want to protect yourself from you know some sort of like rationale that doesn't really have to do with the actual meat and potatoes of building a building and completing a building.
I see the rationale for asking for the maximum amount of time, and I see the rationale for making a recommendation that would be less than what is being requested, as the applicant stated in the end, it's up to the board of standards and appeals to make this determination.
We're not comfortable with that, and we can say that you know we feel that one year would be good and that maybe two years is still okay.
If they need more time, they can come back, and I think that you know putting the burden of the proof on them for another two-year extension.
It looks like you know, as for their statement right now, they're expecting to complete in march 2021.
You know I'm hoping that you know a two-year would be you know, sort of like reasonable recommendation so that the bsa can make their final determination in the end.
You know the bsa makes the determination we don't if the applicant is able to convince the bsa that they really need four years or that three years would be absolutely necessary.
That's what I would like to see, because I just I just think that supply chain is a problem right now in every construction site in the city.
Anybody object firmly to two and a half mike go ahead, I'm okay with two and a half as long as we can put in the provision that they still meet with the east midtown special sub-district hotel permit findings that so that would be like what would prevent other people from saying that this is a precedent that the findings that they met last time with us in october that because I believe the applicant says that they still meet all those same findings and they meet these.
So I'm gonna make a motion to approve the application, with the recommendation of a two and a half year, extension spelling out very precisely and clearly why we are granting this.
You know the specificity, all the details, the fact that the applicant was in front of us in october, 2019 the circumstances, the windows, their window situation, the pandemic and the halt to their job progress, and those are really the specific reasons why we're comfortable with granting this permit and that anything else.
This was assigned to aaron for due diligence once again we're going to jump directly into our presentation, but aaron looked thoroughly at this, and they have some good pointed questions and insights to share with the committee, but I want to invite the applicants to share their screen and start getting ready for their presentation.
We are before you tonight with a city planning application for a minor modification of a special permit number cp202 to allow a 639 square foot outdoor cafe in a privately owned public space at 1633 broadway.
We hope that the outdoor cafe can activate this portion of the of west 51st street, make good use of an underutilized open space and provide an amenity to people living, working and eventually visiting the area.
As I mentioned, we began this application or, as ellen mentioned sorry, we began this application before coven and we were seeking approval of a cafe meant to operate after covid this past saturday, the mayor issued a mayoral order, suspending provisions of the zoning resolution that require cpc certification for outdoor cafes in privately owned public spaces in order to provide restaurants.
The flexibility needed to open in this time of social distancing princey will be looking to take advantage of the mayor mayoral order in the short term and I'm going to hand it over to taya stenson, on behalf of the client, to walk you through the precautions that prince you will be taking.
So I think that's our whole presentation we're happy to take any questions that you have either about the application or about the plan you're.
It's a little bit hard to see because the signs up here, but there's already seating all throughout that area- that's just open to the public, so there isn't really the kind of space for an outdoor cafe.
Oh you know what let me go to the other one, sorry, okay, looking at the site plan, the pink here is where princey would like to be located and then azalea is over here.
I think it's something that is very much needed in this conversation, because you know this is this has always been our position, so I don't know I don't know if the applicant is aware of our signage requirements.
I think we want to review that with we review the language with the client before committing to doing anything, but certainly open to reviewing the language and certainly adhering to what the community board would like in terms of signage yeah.
So we were able to present a a full approval and support for the for the open air cafe great, and you would just need that a few days before full board correct along with the official affidavit.
Thank you to the applicants, okay, so members of the committee I wanted to let you know that, like an hour ago, we received a notice from the governor's office that the governor is going through with its plan for redevelopment of penn station.
I haven't had a chance to look at the the scoping document yet, but I think it's you know pretty thorough good summer reading and it is massive I mean what is being proposed is massive from what I understand he is proposing and observing to bring the far to 35, which is kind of unheard of.
Yes, I'm going to just to send you the link, so I think it would be a good idea that we schedule a meeting before 20 days so that we can have a chance to you know, review it say something meaningful and and be on record, because on july 20th there will be a a public hearing and it will be our opportunity to log our comments on the on the scope leila.
But you know, if wishes were horses so yeah, I think I would agree with either a say, joint meeting of our two committees or a task force with select members of our two committees.
So we need to find out what the archdiocese thinks and you know, do they welcome the opportunity to knocking down a 100 plus year church.
You know a little bit more condensed by the time it gets to a giant meeting of like it's gonna, be maybe 35 people with the two committees yeah.
You know like half of the board, exactly more, which is great, it's good, but it's it becomes a little harder to maneuver.
So let's do that any other members of land use who would want to take a deep dive into the the scoping documents raise hands tristan.
I don't know how you feel, but I think it would be a good idea that it is circulated to all members of the board.
