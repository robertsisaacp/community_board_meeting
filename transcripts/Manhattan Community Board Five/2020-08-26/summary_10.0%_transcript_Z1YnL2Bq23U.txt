and I'm the assistant director of community relations and I'm going to speak first, just kind of briefly about the university's reopening plans Since we're not, we didn't close and, as I said, I just want to provide a brief overview of the strategies that the university is implementing to safely bring back our students, faculty and staff to the community.
So we currently have a group of about 2 600 students who are quarantining in our residence halls and that quarantine will end at the beginning of next week, so that they're able to attend the first day of classes on the second, in terms of covering face coverings and masks like most facilities, individuals will be required to wear a mask when inside nyu building masks will be made available to all students, but they've also been instructed and recommended to bring their own face coverings in addition to nyu facilities, because I know a lot of the questions we've been getting are.
The university is also emphasizing the importance of following these safety guidelines when outside of our facilities in order to protect the community at large, I think physical distancing is pretty clear.
We've already started getting a lot of feedback from community members who, you know want to share their opinions and views about the various reopening strategies that we've implemented, so our office again will remain that space.
Proximity to nyu facilities and public transit options was an important one, compliance with all fire and safety requirements, quality and reliability of I.t services, since students are likely to be attending some of their classes, virtual, virtually or remotely residential life features like common areas or room sizes or kitchenettes, and that kind of thing and performance with dob requirements on zoning and usage was an important one to us as well importantly, the university has laid out the health and safety protocols for our nyu community members temporarily living in this space, and there will be a constant communication with the with the hotel, so we'll get more into details about that in a second.
All students there will need to complete the community standards, fall, 2020 module, there's an attestation, as I think valentine mentioned, that's required for all members of the community, nyu's health and safety protocols for the community apply to all residence facilities, whether they're on or off campus, so that includes the hotel students will be held to the code of conduct that outlines behavior, both within and outside of university facilities.
We recognize that and we're committed to new york city's revitalization, bringing back students as well as university faculty and staff that support the academic services will help spur economic community activities in the community surrounding nyu facilities in the hotel.
Thank you very much for attending valentin and chris, and I would ask that you contact luke at our board office so that we can disseminate the answers to all the questions about the congregating on the sidewalk and what the public safety will look like and all the other questions that we had absolutely.
