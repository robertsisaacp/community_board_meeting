We will leapfrog that item and we will jump right to Madison Square Park Conservancy, who are joining us to discuss revised plans for the food market in Worth's square I believe it would probably be who've the new committee members to have a little bit of context around what we are hearing tonight in the thumbnail sketch of this long history is that for many years there was a food market twice a year in word, square called Madison Square eats you are probably familiar with it and we there was a lot of support in the community for this event, but there was also a lot of concerns around navigation issues and signage and other things, and over the course of many years we worked with the Conservancy to address those concerns and improve them year after year, at the time that the contract expired for that particular event, and it was time for a new one.
How a new iteration of this food market could better address the public benefit in response to that, not in response to that, but over the course of several months, working with the Conservancy and the Parks Department on the language for the RFP, a lot of community board five and the public's questions and concerns became baked into the text of the RFP itself, thereby ensuring that those concerns would be addressed since they would be required of any operator who would be ultimately selected as a part of the process.
Well or I can do its know that I'm Keats and Robins a fabulous person so I'm happy getting in this Robin, so Thank You Clayton for that introduction, I have to say that Rory who is supposed to be giving this presentation can't get completely on.
That would be great because I am was not prepared to give the presentation, but I would, if I had to there is your favorite worry so so yeah Thank You Clayton for the introduction, I'm sure you on the Madison Square Park, and we are the organization that funds a hundred percent of everything that happens in their pre Cova days.
I, don't know what the number is now I think it may be a lot less because there's no workers in the park, but I would say that the people that come needed a lot more and so I, don't know who have you have been going?
This is a brand new layout proposal that has passed muster with the parks department so far, pending some social distancing stuff like sign-in to that, and it's the first time we're presenting it here to the community board.
A pasta station a bar and escuela or school for interactive lessons and cooking lessons, and things like that, however- and this was supposed to take place in May of this year and again in September of this year, following the RFP and the model that was lab4 by parks and by cb5 over the past years, May was cancelled due to coronavirus and we were looking at possibly adding October but frankly, with everything, that's going on with coronavirus and then the pressure of the city from the city to activate something we are now looking at a start date of the 30th of July and then going through the 56 days total to the 23rd of September.
The community highlighted points still some kind of interaction, although frankly we're not sure how exactly to do that in action with social distancing, but we can imagine that it would be people behind the glass behind the service counter explaining some of their products and Italy right now is working hard on getting those upstate farmers as partners for any kind of program starting the 30th.
We are free to ask questions and comment, as we please tonight on this issue, but I believe that it is appropriate to leave it to the psql committee to determine how to move forward, given that this particular seasonal license.
If you want to weigh in on that at all about procedurally moving forward, but I believe it seems appropriate to let psql take that up if they, if they deem it yes, yeah and just to read, are we playing that we we've never I, don't even think we brought you in to the psql Committee on this issue ever in my recollection, I think that psql, you know, can take it up and it can I can discuss it this week and go forward and potentially move pretty quickly on that great.
That said, as we move forward in a discussion, anybody who has any questions or concerns about this issue obviously feel free to raise that and that can that can go forward to Craig and Nick's conversations, as well as for the word square.
If you have any questions or comments about that point, and if so, you can raise your hand and I am seeing none so I kind of feel like this is: oh, we have one from Chris Clark, Yeah right, yeah, I'm, sorry if this was already addressed, but I just wanted to confirm what I'm sort of assuming, which is that entrance into this seating area, is only for people who are going to be purchasing something here, it's not possible to sort of game the system.
As someone who wants to check out the monument to sort of go into the seating area and not get anything, you know, that's funny, I think that we will let anybody in and there's some social distancing stuff that we're working on like we may require a mask.
But let's talk about the possible scenario, if not palpable of somebody wanted to see the worth monument, then yes, you could wait in line and see it, but I, wouldn't you know it's.
The only good thing out of coronavirus right now with this proposal is that we have one set up in one: take down not two setups and two takedowns, but we've maintained the 28 days of operation, we're conservative there, and so it's simply 28 plus 28, with a start date of the 30th of July.
You know, we've lost something like at least 40 percent of our revenue and, as you know, we raised everything to run the part, so the revenues from this event are important and I think, additionally, the ability to shop outside to go and get food and things that you can then eat whether you take it to go and go sit in the park or you take it to go in the home or whether you sit in we're square I.
Yes, but let me just be clear: I think, maybe you maybe you hopped in when we were explaining the pure concepts, the concept that doesn't involve a pandemic, that what we're looking at right now is one kiosk that serves beer, wine and prepared foods which is most likely ice cream and then some farm products great.
Obviously the more points of sale we can create the faster we can put people to look, but at the same time you know getting people to sit down.
We don't know yeah I mean like right.
Cash, maybe coming back in you know it's a dynamic thing from an Operations standpoint, the more people you can service the better you're going to do from a revenue standpoint, but to do that safely and also for the first time in a new location like this, the more complicated you make these plans, the more these plans can go awry so we're trying to balance that out.
Would it be that much I mean really that's asking a lot of a pedestrian a lot of the pedestrians like to stroll down that part of Fifth Avenue and take in the views of the park, especially during the summer?
There is no walkway down fifth that then the west side of Fifth Avenue for the public unless you're coming through Italy, so Clayton and Todd to your point and there isn't a great plan to stop people from walking in traffic down Fifth Avenue.
If there were a way and I'm not saying there isn't I, just can't just think of it, though, if we allow people down the right side of the perimeter of this venue, we'd have to create - two barriers now one to protect those people from vehicular traffic and another to protect those who are socially distanced from the public and I'm, and you know, I just came well Pete I can't see, and we only have thirty tables in this whole thing.
I have an idea with the open restaurant plan that is now happening where, if the restaurant is entitled to use a lane of traffic for seating, they may self-certifying I mean how you know what is the degree of traffic right now at that spot like how unreasonable- and this is an open question- maybe my own committee members can shoot me down, but how unreasonable is it to use those 18-inch barriers and put it on the eastern side of the pedestrian walkway, even if that goes into the lane of traffic?
I actually was going to suggest I'm looking into taking Elaine I mean you know it's worth asking the question.
I also think that we have to just remember that this is for 56 days and I think that it's I do I, think that there is something about bringing back a little bit of spirit to the city that is so important right now, it's just a big bummer and you know some are supposed to be fun and people want to be outdoors, and so you know it's 56 days and I think that either maybe traffic patterns can be changed or pedestrian walking patterns can be changed.
I think it would behoove us to put our concerns and questions and support and all the things that we discussed today into a letter that can go out as soon as possible to the parks department and also do T to investigate this particular issue seems like it might be the one that we would have the most concern about, but also to pledge our public support generally for moving ahead with a revised, socially distant version of this event.
We can continue to ask questions, but I just want to let you know what I see is framing our conversation.
After listening to what Keats at the said had to say in the fact that it's just a short-term solution, you know we can't obsess about perfection, especially since we've lived with all sorts of issues with that space and past years, I think we should simply state.
You know that I'm in the neighborhood and I see everything that's going on Brian, especially given what the whole idea of having we're trying to generate more street traffic and the most important thing is just people getting out and walking around so, but I wouldn't make that you know I wouldn't make that stumbling block to get this done right simply, we asked the department we express our concerns about the OT if it's possible what's possible if it isn't in the future post pandemic.
For this event, so I wanted to call you out and see if you had any questions or comments at the moment, muted and Miriam I, don't know how you unmute yourself on a phone I think she might be the attendee.
They just said hello, hi, Mary, hi, Mary, Ann, oh great hi, everyone I just was trying to chime in ever since Clayton said, because that's exactly what I was thinking about was opening you know is taking in that lane of traffic and because of the amount of time that it is, and you know, I think that if it can be done like as Todd was indicating to have that wonderful card, it would just be a plus all the way around.
You know if DoD will see this through, but I'm definitely an agreement in trying to grab that Lane as a as a special effort to the into Fifth Avenue great Thank, You Miriam, that's very helpful and Keats.
Did you have any other questions or comments, and not really so the main kiosk is going to be the full width of the worst monument in front of it right, which is you know, fine, you know, I, don't see another way for some reason it has a much area and better feeling than it had in the past.
So do we have any other questions or comments and then I'm going to yes, John you're, unmute, okay, I just have a very general question about Kahn about cashless payments, I fully understand in for health, public health reasons and also pedestrian traffic reasons.
Okay, thanks John other questions I'd like to ask members of the public in attendance.
Think committee members: do you have any other questions or comments on this revised application, so seeing no further hands I?
Will we're not going to take this to a vote, but I will just move informally that we put these comments and questions into a letter, the biggest one being the fifth avenue navigation, but, most importantly, being on record supporting the revised iteration of this event for two cycles in a row and I will wait to consult with the psql chairs and with the key chair of the board as to how we want to rope into alcohol portion of that visa.
Yes, there you are I, see Steve's here from the Department of Parks and Kim I wondered if you actually wanted to kind of kick off this item.
This was something that had been tossed around and Beck's a little bit about summer programs for youth this summer in the parks, citywide and yeah Kim I, wonder if you wanted to just frame this conversation and with your specific questions as well sure things Clayton, so I had been thinking a lot about what youth will have to do this summer.
Of course, we recognized the Summer Youth Employment, Program, being somewhat halted and, of course, programming in general being late to be released and so I had questions around how parks was creating a recreational calendar for youth this summer and just so fearful that there won't be things for kids to do, and you know without opportunities to either work or our skills or be physically active and engaged that they could turn to other behavior and so I think providing you know positive calendar of events and things like that would be really helpful.
So those are some of the questions that had been kind of kicking around in my head when I had, you know, brought it up to Clayton and to Renee with and hearing more from the parks about what the plans were right thanks so much Kim, Steve, I'd love to just hear your response and welcome.
People use I guess as we might have done in past years, but we are looking at doing programming in various parks and hopefully at least a couple of times a week, and we are, we are hoping that we're going to be able to fill the gap.
We are waiting to get a green light to see if we're gonna be able to issue permits, or for the summer right now, the system that you cannot it.
If you have an event with 20 or more people, we don't there are as far as I know unless we hear otherwise, there is no distinction made between larger or smaller events, but obviously any larger event is going to create complications and is a gonna require.
The hope, I believe, is that it will begin in mid-july and what would and what would the it would there be a plan how people know about this I mean if it's not even known yet what the programming is.
Yes, that's the point just that we could, with the direct questions as things move along I, think we would want to do our part to stay in touch with them and see what news we can get as it happened, because it is mid-july.
Yeah, I'm, sorry Kim, so you know I mean it could very well be that we're gonna be told any day.
Obviously, as we're the one who put this item on the agenda and I'm curious, if you are moved to propose a resolution to ask the parks, department and City Hall to look at these specific questions rapidly, obviously taking public health into consideration, but knowing that the community has the support to look into that and to and to seek some solutions.
You're not talking to me now right, yeah I mean I'm wondering if it would in time, though, in a case, in a case like this witness Padma I love, having chaired the board on the call parliamentary procedure wise when it comes to something like this, where the sooner our input is given the better.
Tell me what exactly you're having in mind you want to do a letter, well either a letter or a resolution, because if we write a letter, it can come from the committee as we've done before quickly and if it's a resolution, you're concerned that we would have to wait for the film or that's right and I think the most important thing right now is for City Hall.
You know the systemic inequity that continues within marginalized populations and thinking about kids that don't have access to paid programming are the ones that take advantage of free Park Recreation.
If that ends up being or if we need a letter, we could change it to a letter, how's that great okay, absolutely I would just like to be able to say can I say one thing: - Kim yeah.
I guess, I'm just curious from the rest of the committee, like their questions, comments, other thoughts that might help better shape it and hopefully I'm, not the only one that sees this is really urgent and important for our city's kids.
Yes, let's have open the floor for committee members to add any finer points or questions or comments about our position.
Think perhaps you know, Brewers office might be working on this a little bit too.
I just think this is like so vital and yeah I was just going to also give my support for what you're proposing Kim. It is so critical and I am a little concerned that you know.
My concern is that there's new information in there wait and our letters are really reiterating things that committees have really already taken a position on that gone to the full board and then we're only you know, making further comments substantiating something that the board has already agreed to.
Okay, that one issue, obviously we've never talked about social distancing before, but their plan seems so well thought out that we didn't even really have that many questions for them about that yeah.
If that's okay, all right great, thank you so much Kim and everyone.
So that's really the extent of the activity that can happen on this item during this meeting, but I think in the coming days, we'll figure out if there's another committee that can formally hear this and if so it'll certainly be helpful for that committee to know that this committee reviewed it as well, unless there are any further thoughts on that I think.
We have to make sure that if they're going to come down that they come down and a reasoned and careful way and not just torn down, you know in a moment of political expediency, I mean that's our parks committee.
All right, everyone I think that's going to call it for tonight unless anyone has any last questions or comments.
