Very briefly, we'll take you through sort of the nuts and bolts of what we call for in the research brief, the policy brief and talk you through some of what is available for you to do right now and We think this is a practical solution, not the only solution but a practical solution among many for two many issues that we all know affect the public realm in new york city.
As it's a brief we've presented, you know what we think this person should be able to do where we think it makes the most sense for it to function in terms of city agencies and various powers and what resources that person needs in order to be successful, and so I want to take a moment to get us all on the same page and what we're talking about when we say public realm.
I know that you guys deal with this every month in your meetings, but it's useful to have the same terminology when this project, when fight for fight for light talks about the public realm, we're talking about the 40 of new york city's land, which is streets, sidewalks, plazas, waterfronts parks.
You know it goes all the way to community gardens and privately owned public spaces, and I think that my colleagues later on are going to talk through, like the governance side of that and the fact that when it comes together, it's really just a big mess.
You know when we're talking about reinstating a permitting process for youth sports and adult sports, we're talking about pieces that are just integral to the way that we live life both for our health and also for the exercising of our first amendment rights, we've seen in new york city, not just parks, but our streets, our sidewalks, our plazas, get used for assembly and speech, and that's something that we believe is also critically important to the way that we function.
you know it's clear that new york city sort of needs, this role in the city we currently, if you go to the next slide, we have a lot of specific specification in the public realm we'd lack a sort of central organizing function.
All these different people from businesses to schools are looking to permit into the public realm to continue to sort of have some similance of everyday life, and so I think this role speaks to that need consistently next slide, and so that's evident in our public spaces in a very general way But as an example, you know our playgrounds can be governed by parks or the department of education or in some cases nycha.
It can be a really big obstacle to being creative around how to sort of support uses across these different spaces, because what we want to do is actually have a seamless public realm that can be coordinated and facilitated to create these really unique experiences that both allow for movement of people and goods, but also serve this real place, function that supports new york, city's neighborhoods businesses and to really be a thriving place next slide.
But we still need to do more and so looking to other cities as an example, the city of boston next slide has a public realm director that works primarily on people-oriented projects, they're looking at sort of streets and sidewalks, and that experience that's a really great focus to think about activating that area of the public realm.
So the director could regularly update these assessments as public maps in order to guide policy decisions, and certainly obviously, this understanding of needs also can't be done without significant engagement and partnership with community boards, elected officials, city agencies and other stakeholders.
You know, I think what we've learned is that the director should really be able to mobilize to repurpose streets for passive recreation, for example, without significant bureaucracy or creating a burden on other emergency priorities, and we've also outlined some monitoring and review functions like advising and making recommendations on the open space components and shadow impacts of major projects like neighborhood rezonings, and I think a key part of this is is working to ensure accountability for the public realm commitments that are that are made, but sometimes not upheld.
We also have members of the public in attendance who, I'm sure might want to weigh in as well hi, so I support your efforts and the sunlight is obviously one example of something that needs city-wide planning and somebody to crack heads and make sure all these agencies or the mayor really and the governor, even so that they think in terms of the city overall, but I'm just thinking of practical issues that have come up in our own experience as a community board.
