Hmm last meeting we had 43 out of 50 people pretty good. Actually we had everybody. Last time you probably looking at the voting and because the new folks didn't do we have a full cast, not the whole time. Not probably that's right. I'm thinking of the joint meeting the joint meeting had 43 out of 50. right the last time we had all 50, nothing, not everybody's day, the entire day. That's right, I remember saying it's the first time yeah talked about it afterwards in the history of community board fives meetings that we had everybody there. That's right, hmm, so hmm we're good on quorum, but I'm going to wait a little bit longer see if we can get a real good majority. Foreign. Hmm, all right, hmm hi, if you're joining us from calling in from a phone just know that you can press star 9 on your dial pad and star 6 to toggle, mute and unmute, so that's star 9 to raise your hand and star six to unmute. So far I see we have our council member mark, levine and keith powers. Am I correct? Do we have any other electeds? I don't see any others at the moment. Okay, all right! I wonder if gail's joining us tonight, I don't see brian. I think she is going to join us tonight. Gail or brian gail brian signed up to come okay, brian's here, okay, I think we can get started. We do have two electeds and some reps. So welcome to our third virtual board meeting I'm vicki barbero chair. I thought I'd open tonight's meeting by reading cb5's statement of solidarity to protest racial injustice. So this is what we have posted and it's, I think it's very important to be read out loud. Over the last two weeks, thousands of people within our community have peacefully gathered in solidarity to protest racial injustice, manhattan community board. Five stands with our community to demand meaningful change in the wake of the murders of george floyd, ahmed arbory riona taylor and so many others in new york. In the five years since the killing of eric garner for selling loose cigarettes, there has been no meaningful systemic reform of the police department. We have one of the most segregated public school systems in the country. According to the municipal arts society, new york city's housing stock is the fourth most segregated in america, and communities of color are dying from covet 19 in disproportionate numbers. The peaceful protests for change demand a response community board 5 pledges to do our part in our district through our work with our community, with our stakeholders and board members and to commit to supporting those whose voices have been silenced and lives and works that have been affected by the pervasiveness of systemic racism. As always, we are here to represent all residents, workers and stakeholders in our district and to advocate for what is in the best interest of the public, we will continue to fight for more equitable housing and land use policies, social services commensurate with need and advocating. Excuse me for a more just economic policy in the city's budget. It is essential that we actively create this more inclusive and just society through our actions. Accordingly, cb5 commits to exploring the issues around social justice and equity in our district and plans to hold inclusive conversations, which will be the building block of our efforts to support change. We will continue to maintain an open forum to hear the concerns of the public and engage with the administration city agencies and other entities to exact the strongest possible solutions for social justice for our district. To that end, we will be working to identify effective ways to engage more deeply with the public on these issues in the coming weeks. We also must examine our implicit biases in ourselves individually and in our institutions, including community board. Five. We are open to learning and developing best practices for deepening the integrity and equity of our systems and procedures, so that we may participate in the strongest possible way in the fight for an equitable and just city. So I'd like to say that there is an awful lot of work that has to be done and our bex committee will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing models, access to housing, new approaches to criminal justice and the provision of education, educational equity to all students. These meetings will be open to the public and community board five and the beck's committee ask and encourage members of the public to attend and participate. It is through the engagement and feedback from the community that cb5 can best represent the needs of everyone in our district and ensure that we provide a voice for all. We are committed to starting discussion, as outlined in our statement with great haste. Please note that tonight's agenda concentrates on the many timely issues that we have been hearing over the past month, including our budget, a budget resolution in your packet. So I'm going to start tonight's meeting by recognizing and hearing from our elected officials. So far I have council member keith powers. Keith. Would you like to start sure? Thank you. Thank you vicky and thank you to everybody, and I just want to thank you for reading that statement, and you know all of us at this. I think time have to think about our priorities as new yorkers and individual beings, and also as organizations think about how we're advancing goals to make sure to advance the goals that we're all out there marching about, and for me that goes I'll talk about policing in a second, but that goes into you know: educational integration that goes into housing integration. It calls on us, and particularly institutions on community boards that have, you know some say and influence over that and elected officials to be. You know, continuous in our pursuit of policies that will help ensure that our city is not segregated, that our city, our city, is inclusive of all voices and that we are not forgetting that after the protests are over that we are, we are, you know, never ending in our pursuit of making sure that we are a city that is for everybody. So thank you for that, and I appreciate your community board taking such a clear position about you. I knew I really say like a real affirmation of your commitment to that. So I really appreciate that. I will start just you know for many of you who probably live in areas where there's been a lot going on in the last few weeks. Certainly, I've been in both my in probably in cb5 in other areas out there with the protesters with folks calling for change and congress for reform, but also to make sure that you know out there in my constituents, my community calling for need for change, and I really need for racial justice here in the city, and you know we have a few things that we're doing as we move forward. I think some folks may have joined us on tuesday for our public safety hearing, where we are now preparing to move a number of bills that are related to accountability in the police department, and I will say I think, councilman lee would probably join me in this and others. These are overdue. We should have done these in the past. I know mark and I have both sponsored these bills for a long time, but you know we really that's, maybe a fault of all of us. We should not wait for crisis to arise, to move items that are so meaningful, but we are still nevertheless doing them. Albany has just been done. A number of bills, including the repeal 50a. We are doing a number of items. One is the ban on chokeholds, which was we'll actually add another layer onto that from what the state did. We are doing that the post act, which is about understanding new yorkers understanding how surveillance equipment is being used here in new york city, we're doing a bill, that's related to discipline and requiring that they publish, and we have information about how discipline occurs in new york city there's a whole host of bills mark will probably fulfill the ones I forgot, but we had a really meaningful and long public safety hearing the other day to talk about ways that the city can move forward immediately. What we really need to do now is to have a transformative moment when it comes to the police department in policing. I'm reading a book right now about the 70s crisis here in new york city and you realize how much has not changed when it comes to, and that book is not. The bronx is burning as fear city, which are both great books if you're never. But but you realize how much nothing you know, things have really not changed so right now we're going through the city budget. Both I like counterfeiters and talk about his, but I think we both have been calling for the council to do more than what the mayor has recommended by a large margin when it comes to the budget. The mayor's proposed budget basically makes essentially zero cuts in this fiscal year, but puts all the burden of cuts onto programs like summer youth, employment. We'll talk about composting in a bit which I have a bill on that. But you know other programs that we really care about and new yorkers care about and ask you know for no meaningful cuts to the agency. So, even before this moment hit, we had started to call for them to make deep and more meaningful cuts, and now I think, all of us feel not just to look at the number and the numbers but to look at the role of policing in new york city when it comes to transportation, homeless, services and mental health services and police and as the schools to have a better idea of what we want policing to look like in the future. To make our budget reflect that and to make our department better reflect that and there's going to be a lot to digest in the coming weeks and months. But I would be glad and be happy to join as I can with any discussion. Cb5 is having it sounds like you're preparing to do many of them and also to you know all honor and obligation here to keep talking about things like housing and education, and things like that, so my office would be more than glad I put. I just know. I put a longer statement on all this onto my website, things that I'm fighting for in this immediate moment, but I may continue to talk about others when we talk about racial disparities of covet. We talk about housing, education services in the city. So if you want to see more longer from that, you can go to my website and of course my office is answering lots of flaws and questions and taking a lot of feedback from constituents it. You know not nearly as sort of in the moment as that, but I mean or not nearly as for the national call here, but you know we are particularly in cb5. You know did see some folks, you know have small businesses and other businesses have become impacted by that as people you know took out and or some people came in and otherwise looted or or damaged properties, both in cb6, cb5 and other areas around my district- and you know it goes without saying, people are- should be calling for justice and doing a lot of stuff, but you know it seems unfair to some of the small business owners that they became, or are you larger that they became? You know impacted by that? I just want to let you know that they did actually do a program they announced today for any of those businesses it's 750 thousand dollars. They did originally a program for the bronx, but they're doing one now, signature bank actually is made a donation. So if there are businesses in your area that you think could use like it's like a ten thousand dollar grant, I think to help out with any damage incurred. That's just I was announced this morning. It's good to know. If you know somebody you should certainly let them know about in my office can help facilitate any details on that. But but this whole moment has been very difficult and I do want to share with everybody that I hope you are hanging in there and wherever you may fall on this issue or where have you been? I think you know it's a reflection moment for all of us. I also just moving on to other issues but happy to come back on questions with what we're doing in the council. On the please saying I wanted to thank the board about their support. In addition to small businesses for increasing outdoor seating for bars and restaurants, your support was meaningful. I think you saw that phase. Two will include that as part of as part of reopening for the restaurants, they will be allowed to do it and the dot and the mayor actually have announced a program to do that. It's going to be fairly discretionary on the small businesses, but it is a good moment to start thinking about how you want to see that happen in your own area or, if you have recommendations around that, but we've been leading the charge and the council on trying to get some version of that to help our restaurants. I've been particularly involved in it. So I want to thank the board for that and if you have questions or businesses that want to know more about the grants I've announced today, just have them reach out to my office and then I'll stop because I don't. I don't want to take too much time, but I'll just one thing yeah, you are guys, I think, are taking up a resolution. I believe tonight, or at least discussing related to my bill on composting in new york city, which is one of the programs that was cut as part of the mayor's budget cuts and still an uncertain future here in new york city. I am a composter in my building. There's a lot. We can do in this city to expand the use of it right now. The most immediate thing we can do is to create some locations in each community where you can still drop it off, even if it's not in your building and our legislation, I did with councilman radio so requires there to be three in each community board district that could be surface drop-off sites and we're going to have a hearing action this on monday. So if you want to be part of that, just sign up and testify if you want to share ideas before that, we're willing to take them, but it's a hearing monday at one o'clock at the city council and that it's about it's going to be about saving our composting program in the new york in new york city and the last I'll just say I'll. Take questions, of course is we are joined by my colleague mark levine, who has been if you're, not following on social media, one of the best voices around covid and understanding. He gets a little controversial. Sometimes I won't, but no I'm actually kidding. He gives you very straightforward information about what's happening in covet, what's happening with this public health moment, so he has been a good voice. I appreciate him being here today and I know he like. I are committed to doing much more right now in this moment around racial justice in the city and glad to have him as a partner as well so I'll stop there. I actually I'm off. I came off of a budget call, so I will have to go back to it shortly, but but I'll have to take questions or anything hey. I just want to mention. Thank you so much keith. I think our budget, our budget committee, chair renee kinsella, is joining like a coalition of other boards on helping small business. So that's great that's great. I think so! That's so the program they announced today came from a private from a private donation. That's for businesses that actually got impacted from the last week or so. But as we look for longer term here in the city, you know we have a major budget crisis right now, it's going to be hard to find those extra dollars right now to do some of the things I'd like us to do. If we get stimulus, money, direct aid, there might be opportunities to do more, but also just ease regulations in the city around small businesses, so renee I'll make sure I connect with her okay great. Thank you so much mark levine hi, I'm leaving you mark levine, bye, keith, bye, guys. Thank you well. Thank you, madam chair, and thank you councilmember powers. I wanted to speak you to you all briefly in my capacity as chair of the health committee, about what I think is a very complicated upcoming phase in our battle against coronavirus and, of course, as councilmember powers, and you, madam share so eloquently addressed. We are in the midst of a long overdue reckoning with systemic racism in law enforcement and, in fact, racism and inequality have also defined the pandemic. You know that the fatality rate for new yorkers of color has been over double that of white new yorkers and in low-income communities of color around the city neighborhood by neighborhood, zip code by zip code. The inequality has been by as much as a factor of 10 or 15 relative to wealthier neighborhoods and zip codes, and so that should give us increased urgency and ensuring that we don't face a second wave in this horrible pandemic, and I know that most new yorkers are now really ready to be done with coronavirus. They are sick of quarantining and sick of avoiding social contact. But the truth is that we're not through this yet and in fact there are over 300 new cases being confirmed in the city every single day and the national view is even more worrisome with 21 states now have increasing case numbers, and all of them are states that opened earlier than new york, and so we need to be really concerned about whether we too could see a rebound once we get a couple weeks out of our phase one reopening now. The good news for the moment is that all the numbers we're looking at are stable or even going down, but the way this works often is not that there'll be a gentle slope upwards. That will give us weeks to reconsider our approach, but that we may be confronted in a few days, a few weeks or a few months, with a rapid increase in measures like the number of people who are coming into emergency rooms with covered-like symptoms and we're going to be forced to make a really difficult and really quick decision at that point about whether to roll back some of the reopenings. I think that thought is pretty painful to all of us and I don't think any of us ever want to let it get to that, and that means that we need to redouble our efforts now to slow the spread and, frankly, do a lot more than we are today. Some of it is the basic behaviors that we all have to be even more obsessed with from wearing a face mask to keeping six feet distance, where we can, of course, washing our hands obsessively, but there's also a lot. We have to do as a city as policy makers, and that's really what I wanted to put on your radar screen. We have to make sure that we are really building a system for contact, tracing, quarantining, isolating and testing that will slow the spread and we're not there. Yet as a city, these really are the pillars of protecting us. As we begin to reopen the basic concept, is we want to catch people who may have been exposed even before they know it, because we know that you can be asymptomatic in the early stage and you could be out in the world. Exposing people that's happening today. Most of the people who are getting positive test results today were out walking around beforehand, and that's why this is continuing to spread contact. Racing can interrupt that chain and what it means, and what it's meant now for 10 days is that if you get a positive test, result you're going to get a call, those calls are going out and we need people to answer that call and complete an interview with the contact tracer to talk about who you may have been in contact with close contact for at least 10 minutes or more right. Now, it's mostly people, you live with, or people you work with, but as we open and things like restaurants, come back, they'll probably be more avenues for exposure right now. I think very few new yorkers even understand that this is happening and would be wary about talking to someone with such private information. They don't understand the the privacy protections and the anonymity that's built in, and so we need to communicate to them. Likewise, with quarantining and isolating. If you get sick, you shouldn't remain at home where you could spread the disease to people. You live with in manhattan, apartments boy, it's tough to avoid that, and we need people to know they have an option. The city will pay for them to isolate in a hotel for two weeks, if necessary, providing food and prescription and even laundry so that families and households can remain safe. Again. Very few people know about this service. Very few people are enrolling in it and again, a pillar of our of our public health system that we need to strengthen testing a similar story. We have much more capacity than we had months ago, probably by a factor of 50 or 100. That's great news, but there's not a lot of demand, not a lot, not enough demand from members of the public for diagnostic testing. We need to talk. We need to talk about the urgency that more people get tested if they have been potentially exposed in crowds or in other settings. Diagnostic testing, not antibody testing antibody testing has its purpose, but there are real challenges and the reliability of those results. And, frankly it doesn't tell you much. You can bank on vis-a-vis immunity, but that seems to be where the public's interested. So we need to steer folks back to diagnostic testing. And finally, if you learn that you're exposed from a contact tracer, you got a quarantine at home and that's much more than just hanging out and going to the grocery store or once or twice a day. No, it's really staying at home and not leaving the house, so the city will provide you food and other needs to make that possible. That's a lot that I've shared with you, but I want your help as community board members, as community leaders, as ambassadors from public health to communicate no less than you've communicated on the importance of the census. We need to rally now as a city to prevent a second wave or we're going to be faced with a really difficult choice about rolling back the reopenings. None of us want that, but that threat is real. We lived through the hell of march and april. We don't want to live through that again. Let's do the work now to prevent that, so I'm going to stop there and thank you so much vicky. Okay, thank you! So much it's good to see you mark, take care and be safe. Well, everybody stay safe. Do we have any other electeds here? I know we have the representatives of elected officials, but we have some hammers raised. Well, we have some hand raised renee and clayton. I just wanted to ask is mark still on? Oh, yes, I'm here, I'm here hello, I wanna ask a quick question. Obviously you know people need to go out and protest, but I've been really concerned about it becoming a public health crisis and causing you know quite an immediate spike, especially because it's you know the disproportionate deaths by covid and the black and brown communities so about a week ago. I did what I could and you know, bought 7 500 masks and was talking a bunch of community organizations and nycha houses, and I think the com, someone from the comptroller's office that I know helped me get these out and they were very happy to be able to try to get masks out to protesters. But I was told by many organizations that actually the bigger issue is the fact that people on the ground in those protests were saying that the nypd we're not wearing masks, and I was wondering if that was something that the council, you know u.s health chair could address, but also in addition on that, if there has been anything any calls to action, I mean we saw the whole world rallied for ppe for nurses, but I'm not seeing that same sort of call to action for protesters. It sounds like. Maybe the need might not be there as much, but you know has that's. I guess a two-part question is anyone thinking about ppe that could be donated for the people that are out there, but also to enforce I'm sure the cops with all the money that they have ppe I've seen that some do and some aren't wearing them, but how you know an enforcement issue needs to happen because this first and foremost they're you know we don't want people to die a covet on top of all of this. Yes, you're right. Look. Thank you. First for donating, 7, 500 masks. That's incredible generosity. I'm hyper aware of all of this. I am coming at you live from ohio. I have the privilege of being able to leave the city, but with a compromised immune system with new york reopening you know, I'm very hyper aware of how devastating this could be. So that's we understand. I know that I'm rare I'm a rare ability to do that, but you know it's just something that's been weighing on my mind and the more I talk to community organizations. The more I found that not a lot of people were talking about protection for the people in the streets right now with black lives matter right. We understand that look. The vast majority of protesters have been wearing masks. I know that I've been out there proud to have marched. I think this is a cause. That's compelling enough that we need to get out there and speak out. The failure to wear masks by police officers at the protest and generally around the city in recent weeks is alarming. It's unacceptable! It's dangerous and I directly asked the police department about this at our hearing on tuesday. They pledged to fix it. They haven't yet based on reports that have been widely circle circulated in the last day or two, and the times is up with the story today on this has to be fixed, partly because of the risk of spread. If people don't wear a mask, also, it's an example. You know I just talked about the imperative of everyone doubling down on protective measures like wearing a mask. What kind of example are we setting if public sector workers aren't doing that, so that has to be fixed, you're, absolutely right, we're pushing very hard on that and we're not gonna stop until police officers are doing the right thing to protect their communities thanks renee and thanks mark renee, it's so good to see you mark. I still think we have one more clayton have your hand up yeah, thanks so much mark. I just quickly wanted to ask a question about diagnostic testing, because just in my own personal circle, I have an 80 year old, close friend who had symptoms, got a test at city md and received the test results. 14 days later, I have another friend a friend of my husband's who was had to leave to go to australia because he lost his job and therefore his visa and couldn't stay so he got a test in order to protect himself and others and waited 30 days and never got a response and finally just got in the airplane anyway. So if it's just in my circle, two horrible stories like that, I'm sure that's happening elsewhere and people are just like well, whatever it's been two weeks and I'm not sick. So I guess it's fine, but I guess my question is: what is the actual formal? Is there a mechanism for addressing that, aside from just calling the individual place and trying to harangue them and never get through to anybody? Is there somewhere to report that problem? Well, I've been reporting it a lot and the health department is well aware. I don't know how recent those two episodes are. I think it's mostly a little bit better, not anywhere near what it needs to be. It's probably more in the two to four, maybe five day range, which is still not going to work, because that means someone who's contagious is out there in the world for two to five days. God knows how many people could be infected in that time. To really, I think, reopen safely we're going to have to have something closer to instantaneous test results, the technology. Now that can get you an answer in 45 minutes, the city health department is buying some of those machines they're very expensive. I don't know how widely they'll be deployed, but we've got to solve this problem, otherwise it's just they're rendered impractical, especially for disease, whose average course is 14 days. So thank you for identifying this problem clayton. You are absolutely right and I'm doing what I can to sound the alarm on it, and hopefully we fix it. Thank you. Wonderful, okay, hold on, I think I saw another hand renee kinsella, hi vicky. Thank you hi. I wonder if you could speak to the funding for the isolation program in hotels and the food. Is that state funding is that federal funding, hopefully or how is that all being funded? And how is that accessed great question? The city is paying for that, but it is mostly going to be reimbursable from fema, so it's less of a financial challenge than you would think. Thank you, okay. Anyone else, I don't see anyone. So thank you very much mark. It's really good to see you. That was very helpful. We look forward to being in touch with you. I'm sure renee will on these issues. Thanks again again, do we have any of the elected officials other than their representatives here? If not, I will go to let's see if you can raise your hand if you're representing an electoral lori is on laurie. Are you is laurion from corey's office? I am okay, hi lori hi, how you doing okay, yeah so mark and keith touched on a lot of what I was going to talk about, but very quickly. I just wanted the office to know our cv5 to know that we have created an excel sheet made up of all of the businesses in the district we've been calling them. We've been offering information about the sbs hotline we've. Let people know about the expedited insurance claims that can happen now, and we divided this up and we've been calling hundreds of businesses every day. I believe flatiron district provided us with 50 alone. If not more also, I believe that it's june 18th that the council will be voting on those police misconduct conduct bills that keith referred to. So that's a little bit of an update there, and also you should know that the speaker, along with council member drum and gibson, wrote a letter to de blasio de blasio about the inequities of the budget and how unfair it was that agencies like dycd is, you know, being asked to cut 36 percent, but the police are being asked to cut less than one percent. Okay, really, all that I have oh, and also I just wanted to bring you. Thank you for the support of the open dining. I also made a note to our office about the suggestion that there be one person in charge since there are multiple agencies involved. Okay, great thank you, lori sure. Moving on to luke of control of scott stringer's office, hi, everybody luke from comptroller scott schringer's office. Here I want to start by thanking vicky for that statement that you made on behalf of the board at the top. Obviously this is a difficult time for our city. We have the overlapping crises of a pandemic economic crisis and then, of course, the disproportionate impact of policing on communities of color, which has been front and center the past few weeks, but has been going on for far longer. So I'll briefly touch upon a few of the things we're doing in each of those categories, which are, of course inter connected as well. So on the policing front, we believe that we do need to start breaking down a lot of the structural racism that has been in new york city and the police department and one of the ways we really need to do that through the budget. So we put out a proposal to cut 1.1 billion dollars from the nypd over the next four years and take that money and transferred into community programs, and the community is most disproportionately impacted by policing. On the economic side, we are facing a 9 to 10 billion budget gap and we really do need federal support which hopefully comes in the coming months. But one of the steps that we think we should be taking now is restarting our city's capital program as a way to invest in schools, affordable housing, theaters outdoor spaces, to make sure that our city is ready to recover and reopen, and it's also one of the best job multipliers to get our city going and on the cobra front. One of the things we're really focusing on still is food access. So over 30 percent of the pantries across the city were closed at the height of the coveted pandemic, and the city has done a great job ramping up. But we still have a lot of concerns about quality and nutritional value and other things related to the food program. So we're still really focused on making sure that everyone across the city can get the quality and accessible food that they need, and one last thing we're working on is making sure that we're holding the city accountable so that in case there is a second wave. We know what decisions we need to make when we can make them so we're ready to take that on. If it comes great, thank you, lou. We are joined by our wonderful state, senator brad, hoyleman brad. I believe we are yes I'm here. Can you hear me there? You are hi there. I am. My colleague annabelle is on the line we had, as was mentioned this historic weekend and all. But you know I just want to thank you for your statement about racism and police brutality. The protests have been you know rather inspiring. The peaceful protests have been, I think, obviously far outnumbering anything that involves property damage and I'm happy to say that I passed a bill this week called the police stat act vicky. It's called the police statistics and transparency act and, for the first time, new york's going to be collecting statistical data from ranging from low-level misdemeanors all the way to deaths while in custody. Believe it or not. We were not collecting that information in any kind of systematic way. The division of criminal justice services state of new york was actually news. Articles you're going in and out brad a lot of light on. So I just want to thank the support for their support. Let me know or annabelle no, if your colleagues still have unemployment insurance issues, I apologize for the for the bad connection. Okay, it's good to see you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Okay, connection. Okay, nice, to see you! Okay, thanks going back to representatives, we have jeremy unger caught from carlina's office, hey everybody thanks, vicky and wally, and everybody and hope you're all doing safe, wanted to briefly just touch on a couple of things. Obviously, you know councilman's very concerned about the effect that small businesses have been going through right. Now we put out a letter or open statement from carlina and a couple of local black women leaders from lower manhattan, addressing both, I think, the nypd's over enforcement and escalation in protests, but also the fact that the city did not do enough to put our small businesses in a better place to be kept safe and protected, particularly as they were being you know, addressed you know being hit by. You know caravans of cars from other neighborhoods. You know we have also been working really hard on the budget that I think everyone else has touched on. You know if you haven't subscribed to carolina's newsletter highly recommend you do. You know we touch on we've been touching on every week there, but you know we're committed to fighting to slash the budget as deepest cuts as we can get. We are working on a number of legislative bills to hopefully rein in some of the worst behavior of the nypd, take away as many kind of roles that the police do not necessarily need to be involved in whether that's schools or traffic enforcement and always open to you know other suggestions. You know, I think, there's been a lot of really great things coming from the community on ways to address police issues, and you know happy to hear from anyone else and that's all for me. The only other thing is we have hospital working on covid stuff with council member levine through the hospitals committee. We have a hearing next week on the mental health needs of healthcare workers, so hope you guys tune into that and if you have another question, just let me know okay, thank you so much. We are definitely working on that, as I mentioned earlier, the full question of protesting, and so on so we'll by most assuredly be in touch with your office. So thank you and say hi to carlina. I will she will she couldn't make it because she was in that same budget meeting as keith? Oh okay, thank you, audrey tannen from liz, thank you and let me just say, as a citizen, I'm very happy to have heard your statement, so I appreciate your community board being such an activist group on those issues. As senator hoyman said, brad blizz too was very happy and very satisfied to be an elected representative up in albany having passed, help to pass so many of this comprehensive legislation to confront the policing and public safety issues in our city to follow up on that just know that next week we are going to be hosting two virtual town halls on topics that were brought up this evening on next wednesday june. 17Th liz will be in conversation with insha rahman, who is the director of strategies and new initiatives at the vera institute of justice to discuss this issue of policing and public safety going forward. They'll also be joined by liz's colleague state senator zellner maire, who you might remember I've heard, is the state senator who was actually pepper, sprayed in brooklyn a few weeks ago at a peaceful protest. So that is going to be next wednesday june 17th at 5 pm off of liz liz's facebook live page and on thursday june 17th at seven o'clock. She will be in conversation with dr ted long, who is running the contact tracing program in new york city. So we just want to let you know of that, and I hope you'll share it with your community of neighbors in community board. Five. Thank you and stay well and healthy. Okay! Thank you! Audrey! Okay! Next we have betsy schmidt from congresswoman carol, maloney's office, hey so congresswoman maloney. We just wanted to put out you know things as well, just about with all people across the country protesting marching to condemn police violence, demand justice and declare unequivocally that black lives matter. First, woman maloney knows that we must do more than decry police brutality, racial profiling and excessive use of force. We must act. I just wanted to highlight a few of the various legislative proposals that congresswoman maloney is supporting to do just that. She's supporting rep presley's house resolution 988 condemning all acts of police brutality, rep justin amash's in qualified immunity act, which would end the practice of qualified immunity which protects officers from civil suits, h.r 4359, the peace act, which would require law enforcement to use de-escalation techniques and use force only as a last resort, as well as rep jeffrey's hr, 4408, eric, garner, excessive use of force prevention act which would ban the use of choke holds by law enforcement. These are just a few. We have a growing list on our website under the tab, combating police, violence of everything we're signed on to we've, gotten a lot of calls about that. So I just wanted to really. We appreciate the people calling to voice their concerns, and so just know that we're doing things too. Yesterday, congresswoman maloney held a committee in oversight examining the ways in which hr 6909 the pandemic heroes. Compensation act of 2020 would help essential workers and their families who have suffered from the health and economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. It's modeled after the vcf bill from 9 11, so it's similar strain. I also just wanted to hit that a lot of people have been contacting us if they haven't received their economic impact payment. Yet I want to know that some of those have gone out as prepaid debit cards and they come in a white envelope that just says money, network card holder services I'll put a number in there to call if you think, you've threw yours away by accident, I'll put it in the chat. Okay, thank you so much betsy, I'm sure renee from our becks committee, our chair, the beck's committee, will be in touch with all the electeds on that very important subject that we all are really concentrating on now. So thank you again. I think. That's all in terms of representatives, do you see anyone else? Luke wait a minute. We have a question from july. Okay, thank you. I just want to ask with all the elected representatives here available if there's a program set up for people to donate, to small businesses who don't have insurance to cover their damages betsy. Can you repeat that one more time what sure, if somebody wants to donate to a small business, who's sustained damages to their storefronts and don't have insurance to cover that? How does one go about doing it? I don't know that we have a federal program or anything that would do that. I can I'll be glad to look into it, but I think that may be something more on the city basis or on a one-on-one. We do have like the small business, the sba and some of those loans that are still available, but those are really centered around the pandemic, like if you had to close. Because of that, I don't know that we have any new provisions, specifically addressing businesses that were damaged. You know recently, but I'll be glad to take that up the chain and see if we have anything. Thank you, okay, yeah, I mean well. I have a feeling that july july that our council members would be right people you should check with on that right, glory. Yeah for sure. Let me get pull together some resources. I know our newsletter every week has a lot of resources. Let me see what's available for individuals to donate okay, thank you, and this is jeremy I'll, just say generally like when there's like so many different types of places you can donate but, like I think when in doubt the best place to donate right now is like the mayor's fund to advance new york city, because that is going to a bunch of different things and because that is a quasi-government nonprofit organization that can sometimes more easily donate to small businesses which are for profit ventures than the city can, through other funding mechanisms. Okay, bring that to you. Okay, thank you so much. I think now we'll be moving into our public session. Members of the public are invited to speak on issues that they think would be of importance to the board. Luke. Can you be sure to raise your hand if you would like to speak during the public session? You'll have two minutes. You can find the raise hand button at the center of your zoom screen. Gail brewer just joined us. Oh okay, let's definitely go to gail hi gail. We are ready for your update. You can hear me now. Sorry, the state liquor thought it was on the phone and you might want to have them come and discuss what would be relevant for your topic, because the short version is that if a restaurant is simply going to a little bit in the outdoor cafe or even perpendicular out into a parking space, there is not a lot of forms to fill out. You still need to do a forum, but it's not a complicated form. The issue becomes if they decide to go to around the corner, because I know there are a lot of restaurants where there might be a closed street or a plaza and there the situation would be. You can get the drink to go and the food to go, but the city has to do a waiver for suspension to open container ordinance. So that's something that I just called the mayor's office to say: we need the suspension to open container ordinance so that people can walk to an adjoining area and sit and enjoy dinner. So that's relevant in order to do the extended sidewalk cafe or the parking space on the governor's website. There's a form you have to do a simple diagram and it sounds to me like they're, very quickly going to say yes to whatever is presented and they've been working with d.o.t and the law department, so the community board does play a role, though, because sla says, oh new york is very complicated. They have community boards. Yes, we do have community boards. So if there are specifics about a restaurant in terms of the time that it closes, then the restaurant has to be in touch with the community board. So I'd like it without going into a whole lot, I just think you might want to get more guidance and we will try to get the same, maybe sla, to come to the border board. So I just want to say sounds like everybody is trying, but I want to make sure that you know all that they're doing, I think we've been working a lot on that issue of more street space for the restaurants. Second thing, of course, is we've been working not so much in your area, but with the buses and trying to find more bus lanes around the city and, more importantly, how we can involve more in terms of having the buses uptown more along fifth avenue and 181st degree, as you know, were announced the other day, and then I just want to say summer is coming and school is coming in september. So, in terms of the summer we've been pushing, we all want the summer youth employment program and your wonderful council members have been pushing you've been pushing for that. If I had to make a bet, I think that would be an easy one that it will be funded. I don't know what level so that's one aspect, but the other one is the issue of the camps, and I just we wrote a letter. You may have gotten a copy saying that the governor has okay summer camp as of june 29th, but there's no process for doing it in the mayor's office. So we have so many camps who are calling us about. What are we going to do with the kids? This summer, if we have permit for september well that doesn't help very much so anyway. That's something that needs to be decided very quickly, and I know that independent budget office did an analysis of some of this today in september, school will start, I believe, there's 178 000 young people going to summer school. I don't know exactly the number of manhattan and we are trying again. This would be another project that people want to work on that we're now working with the executive superintendent in manhattan, because I know jcc to their credit, has 200 volunteer tutors and they are all signed off on by the department of education, they're, all fingerprinted, et cetera, so they're going to help starting working with students, because if you didn't get through during the year, I don't know if you're going to get through during the summer. Unless you have some more help and then come september, I don't know exactly what's going to happen, we believe that it would be like 49 of the school would be occupied, so I guess they call it blended learning. I don't know what that means, except some at home and some at school, so again lots of challenges to be able to discuss quickly. We had the idea before the mayor for painting at one center street right in front of the building that you've been in many times at david dinkins building for a hundred thousand meetings, and we are already working with different groups who have to paint the knowledge and I'm hoping that over the weekend, it'll all get worked out and for juneteenth, which is coming up very soon and often celebrated at the african volley ground, which is also here in the civic center that we will have black lives matter painted down here. So I again without getting into all the drama of thousands of phone calls, that's the short version. So I know you know that what the euler schedule, I believe the suspension has been extended to tomorrow friday june 12th. I think you know that already and I'm simply stating that. Thank you for your work and for all the work. You're doing and I know, there's a lot of legislation that has passed. We've all been marching and participating in different forums, and I think the state and the city people can tell you more about what has passed. I will say that I had a little bit to do during the worst of the looting in soho and midtown and meat parking, not so much in your district, but you know you seem to have. You certainly have a lot of space in midtown a lot of territory in that particular situation, I must admit I was constantly in touch with the police department and I think, to their credit. They did close manhattan. It was a little bit my idea because I didn't know how else we could stop some of those trucks coming in that we're looting. Thank you very much community board five, and I appreciate the time. Thank you. Okay, gail, before you go, I think nick athanal, the head of our liquor, license committee, would like to speak with you great thanks, vicky hi gail. I just wanted to address your comment about the open container law, saying that it should be relaxed. We've got a resolution tonight that comes to the opposite conclusion, because we've been getting a lot of complaints about people loitering in front of restaurants that are serving liquor, not respecting social distancing and we've been having a lot of trouble with with things that would be resolved by the open container law. Okay. Well, I mean that's a good point and I appreciate it. I don't I don't really know what to do. It's uncharted territory, obviously right now, people are not supposed to be doing that you're, absolutely correct. I don't know like if you're a restaurant and you're gonna have seating in a plaza and you're not adjacent to the restaurant, then I don't know I guess it would be illegal to sit there and have your dinner. That's the problem. I don't know how to solve it, so you should go ahead with your resolution, but just think about this other. I don't quite know what to do. To be honest with you, I think- and we can address this when I deliver my resolution, but I think one of the suggestions is that you require people to be seated in order to consume that they can't just mill around walk around the streets and congregate. I think that's a great idea, perfect. That's why you're on the community board to come up with all these great ideas thanks! Thank you, okay, anyone else! Okay! Thank you! So much gail good to not see you! I wish we could see you. Thank you, take care and be well too. Thank you all right now. I think we can move into the public session. Oh there, you are, I'm here go ahead: okay, luke! Do we have members from the public with their hands raised? Yes, we do. We have melissa, rathbone melissa. You can unmute yourself, okay and unmuted hi. Can you see me sorry, I'm new to zoom. We can't see you, but we can hear you okay. Well, I'm really happy to just. I am a small business owner and I've had my business in the flatiron neighborhood for 15 years. I've been shut down during this whole covid time, but I've stayed in new york and I've seen what's happened and I've seen how disproportionately affected the low under-resourced communities have been in our city and those majority black and brown populations, and I just think now it's such an important time to really look at the budget and look at the six billion dollars that nypd has and really think about how pulling finding some excess in there and pulling it out and being able to put it into resources that the communities really need right now in order to rebuild whether it's mental health or youth, employment or housing or food banks or anything, so you guys all seem to be headed like on the same page. I just want to add my voice and say thank you, and I appreciate what you're doing thanks for letting me speak. Thank you. We wish you luck. Thank you. Okay, who's! Next luke, I'm not seeing so we have nissa tang, okay, nissa you're on you're allowed to talk just hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay, I'm also new to zoom. My name is nisa tang and I'm also a small business owner in your district, and I am new to local politics, and so I'm trying to learn about how to make my voice heard. I am also just calling I'm very heartened to hear this community board's position in fighting racial injustice and pushing for more just city, so I'm also just here to add my voice to help redirect some of the six billion dollars in funds allocated for the nypd to reinvest in social services for the communities that are hurting the most right now, and I think this is a great opportunity to reimagine public safety and build infrastructure for the most marginalized among us, so yeah after hearing everyone today, I just feel really encouraged that we're on the same page and fighting for the same thing. So thank you for your time. Okay, thank you very much. Next luke, I don't see any hands raised if you're, calling in from the public on a phone be sure to press star nine, otherwise press the raise hand button so that we can call on you. Okay! Is that it apparently okay, very good, that closes the public session of the board and we now move into our business session. At this time, only board members will participate by hearing reports and opining on agenda items that are presented by committee chairs by way of questions comments and, finally, by voting on the issue before then. So. The first thing that we're going to do is the election of officers with evan meyerson. Thank you vicky.

Yes, wine, trout, yeah, wayland, yes yang, yes, motion passes! Okay! Thank you very much. Now we move on to the chairs report. That's me, and my report to the board this evening is to bring something to the board's attention, which is the community board committee's letters to the mayor regarding shaping the city's response to covet 19. you've all been involved in this, but I'd like to still give you a little intro as to how this all came about. I'm not sure if everyone knows at our last full board meeting borough. President gail brewer spoke of the mayor, having established several advisory councils to help the city reopen and recover from the coronavirus pandemic. We now know that these advisory councils include small business, large business, labor and workforce development, art culture and tourism, and so on. These councils range in size from roughly 24 to 43 members, who represent a wide variety of organizations in the city. As the borough president pointed out, not one representative from any of the 12 community boards in manhattan was asked to provide a representative, actually no one from any of the community boards. She was very clear that since cb5 is the city's business community, it would have made sense for us to have representation on these councils. It is indefensible that community board input was not included nor sought and our committees have responded in full force this month. So whether the mayor wanted our input or not, cb5 is definitely going to give it to him. So the committee met all the committees met to discuss and end and address new york city during covid and post covert 19., and each committee has prepared either a letter or a result to be sent to the mayor. So I'd like to call upon each chair to speak in regard to their committee's letter, it's very important and they're very impressive. It's unbelievable the amount of work that went into this it's super. I think it really deserves to be heard at our board meeting to be on the record, so I'd like to start with renee chair bex. Thank you vicki. I just want to preface our letter with the fact that, while our conversation and what's included in our letter, touched upon the budget deficit, our comments were not making specific budget recommendations because that's something we had commented upon back in march. But what our letter did say is that we want to see our electeds fight for as much state and federal funding as possible. We believe that time is of the essence in getting these funds. We want the city to be a good steward of the money it does have and look for savings. We want parity in any budget cuts but believe that housing, the summer youth employment program in our schools, areas where we've always called for more funding, must not be duly impacted by the deficit. We ask for our electeds to look at innovative ways to engage people who may be unemployed rather through free education or volunteer programs or other innovative ways. We agreed that it was absolutely necessary to retain the vibrancy of the city and that means figuring out how to safely operate the restaurants, the theaters, the shopping and all the small businesses that make up new york- and this includes making sure more is done. I was really heartened to hear tonight. Our elected speak to this with sbs loans to make sure that small businesses survive in our city. We also agreed that covid made us more aware that we need more hospital beds, not fewer hospital beds, and we need to ensure that we don't continue to lose hospitals, but instead add capacity and funding to our medical infrastructure. We favored the measures that were taken to prevent renters, but we also ask our city to recognize that the landlords alone can't bear the full brunt of these policies. We want public safety and we would love to see innovative ideas like looking to a volunteer force to ensure quality of life. Issues are maintained, we've always requested money and support for the homeless, and we reiterated that concern in our letter. We ask that any cuts to the budget do not impact homelessness, housing and supportive services. We also agree that there's great need for mental health services both for the homeless and then for students and everybody, and how critical that it is that mental health services be accessible to all. We talked about transportation hubs and how important it is to get people back using the trains and the buses while safeguarding and improving bike lanes and keeping the network in balance with the amount of cars that continue to be present. We reiterated our off request plea that class sizes be reduced and added that we want students to have resources that they need to learn in remote settings, whether that be ipads, free, broad pan and the tutors that we heard about tonight. We also asked that any cuts in the doe be made to the back office rather than front line teachers, and we were supporting. We were unanimous in our support for doe to place a social worker in every single school, and our last request in the letter is that the city fund the summer youth employment program, which is so critical to so many children and their families. Thank you so much renee excellent next ej califorski, who is speaking for the joint committee meeting regarding outdoor seating. This was a meeting of transportation and environment, public safety, quality of life and parks and public spaces. E.J thanks vicky, so parks, psql and tne held a joint meeting, as you heard about from several of the electeds this evening, as the city continues to open up, several elected officials and other advocates have been calling for a new expedited, permitting process for outdoor seating for restaurants, so that they can begin to serve customers, even while indoor capacity restrictions are in place. Obviously, the general thinking at this point is that outdoor seating is much safer than indoor seating with recirculated air and close quarters and difficulty social distancing, because this is a proposal that has very few examples or precedents in new york city, and we don't receive proposals like this very frequently. It actually seemed to dovetail with the jurisdiction of those three different committees parks which approves sidewalk, cafes psql, which obviously approves liquor licenses and conditions on the establishments that get those liquor licenses and t e, which traditionally approves street closures. This is essentially a combination of those three jurisdictions. What we heard was a high-level proposal from the new york city, hospitality alliance and we also reviewed several letters and proposals that call for that same new, permitting capacity by the city, including one written by city council, speaker, corey johnson, as well as other officials proposing legislation to that legislation. That would charge the city most likely, the department of transportation to select streets to close and the dca to issue these permits to create this new permitting scheme very quickly, because the proposal- you know, as you heard, a lot about tonight, was moving very quickly and because new york city ha itself has already moved into phase one and because, while restaurants and bars are slated to be in phase three and the state is already allowing outdoor dining in other regions, seemingly already in phase two. Obviously all of this is moving very quickly and our joint committee wanted to be able to weigh in via a letter as quickly as possible. So very briefly, the joint committee was very much in favor of the principles behind the proposal. Given decreased streetcar traffic on the roads during the crisis and the overwhelming need for outdoor space to allow social, distancing and some degree of these businesses operating, we were very much aware that which streets get selected for closure will have a tremendous impact on not just the flow of people in traffic to the city, but also which businesses will get to benefit economically and commercially. With that in mind, we did lay out some certain criteria that we thought should be followed by the city in executing this number, one in choosing which areas to close. We suggested criteria to maximize the benefit of any such area along the lines of the matrixes or matrices that we often use as a board to determine public benefit of issuing a liquor license. Assessing a new bus stop et cetera. We asked that each closure maximize the number of restaurants that it can help minimize the number of residents that live nearby, that it disrupts minimize the amount of traffic that it that it reroutes continue to allow access for pedestrians and the flow of bike lanes through the area. The bicycle network through the area and also allow appropriate sanitation to continue to access the block. Secondly, we ask that the city work closely with the local bids to establish security for any closed area, to clearly define whether or not the business is responsible for enforcing the social distancing and the safety of customers that define who is responsible for setting up erecting barriers and ensuring the safety of everybody on the on the closed block or lane that they relax signage regulations, so that the restaurants can advertise themselves and their outdoor areas and coordinate with food trucks so as not to inundate a particular area. Thirdly, we recommended that, along the lines of what are usually more minut and business by business, psql assessments that the city do prescribe hour of operation and noise regulations for a given area so as not to completely disrupt quality of life. And finally, we ask that the city implement this scheme with maximum adaptability, including 30-day review and, as has been proposed in expiration of the overall scheme at the end of october. Generally, we just asked for maximum reporting and transparency as the as whatever gets implemented gets implemented, so that we can understand how the scheme is going at every step of the process. Excellent. Thank you so much ej and you can move into the report from your committee. Transportation, environment, okay after the joint committee meeting about outdoor dining tne, also met to have a wide-ranging discussion about all the other effects that the kova crisis is having on the transportation and environment of our district and to express the sense of the committee around our concerns and suggestions regarding the city's response, notably many of the enacted and proposed changes already dovetail with some pre-existing priorities and long-term plans that the that community board five has weighed in on like reducing traffic through congestion, pricing, other street use reconfiguration, and so you know we wanted to emphasize that the plans should not just be looked at in the context of the crisis, but also our long-term priorities as well. We agreed on some broad principles first, that actions that the city takes be rooted in research and data and accompanied with very consistent reporting about changes that are being made and their effects the situat. The overall situation is fluid and continuously changing, and the city must be iterative in its response. Instead of prescriptive and just laying out an end goal, it really has to be able to respond to continuously changing conditions. We also discussed how all the changes that the city makes will be interconnected. Obviously, reallocating street space from one purpose to another purpose inherently affects both you're creating space for one thing, but you have to take it away from something else, and all the environmental concerns must be must be balanced as a holistic picture, instead of assessed in individual silos, street closures for dining other street closers for pedestrianization, the installation of new bike lanes, the proposed installation of new expedited bus lanes, we've already heard those either implemented or proposed, and you know there will obviously be the other implementations coming down the pike. All these and future proposals have to be looked at together to understand their interconnected network effects. Thirdly, we also ask that the city make sure to avoid sort of mindlessly re-implementing the status quo at any point, for example, reinstituting the curbside bus stops that we have before, while maybe an attractive opportunity to revert to what was normal before, would not be a good idea, while curbside gatherings without social distancing. You know mobs of passengers all together on the sidewalk, when they should be social distancing should be discouraged instead of instead of brought back and and particularly while, for example, usage of the port authority. Bus terminal is far below the capacity it was at before so, instead of reverting back to what was normal before by default, the city should assess each of the reinstitutions or re-implementations on a case-by-case basis to do that smartly and effectively. Finally, we also wanted to emphasize the second half of our committee's name, the environment, and to ensure that the city is looking at and providing data on noise and pollution and other environmental effects that are affected by any of the types of proposals or changes that we that we just mentioned. Obviously, the city needs to move fast to respond to the crisis, and we simply ask that the city also likewise step up the speed and and the responsiveness of its reporting and transparency throughout the process as well. Any temporary solutions and long-term solutions will merge and overlap each other, and it's critical that we have insight into every step of the city's evolution. Great another wonderful report. Thank you. So much ej takes us to parks and public spaces with clayton, okay, hello, everyone. In addition to the input that parks and public spaces submitted at the joint meeting about the outdoor dining proposal. There are further thoughts and questions about our parks and our pedestrian plazas in particular that we want to highlight so district fives parks. As you all know, bryant park central park, madison square park, union square park and harold and greeley squares are very beloved public spaces to say the least, and now in this time are critical because they offer new yorkers a safe opportunity given the following of probably proper health protocols to get outside and move around and get fresh air, which is good for physical and mental health. But there is concern that, given the estimated 121 million dollar loss in the park's budget, both from the mayor's proposed budget cuts, as well as revenue that will be lost from park activities that won't be happening. There are a lot of questions about how the city can ensure that our parks can stay welcoming and accessible and maintained, especially given the prediction that they will get more intense use this summer than ever before. So more to the point in our district, specifically the various conservancies that partner with the city and managing our parks, as well as the times square alliance with father duffy square, which is parkland and union square partnership which assists in managing union square park, will suffer shortfalls of their own. So committee board 5, has long-standing concern and public record about our objections and concerns and questions about some of the sources of revenue that those entities raise and the events and fundraisers they employ to do that. But we have long understood their role in the health of our parks and cb5 has spent a lot of time and years building a reliable system for working with those partners to ensure the best possible outcome for the public and the health of the parks. So without the sources of these of this revenue. Without these events or concession contracts and fundraisers, what can these private public partnerships do to best hold up their end of the bargain, which in fact is legally binding? They have signed contracts with the city, so we question whether these existing partnership agreements are open to modification and, if so, whose call is that and what modifications might be proposed? So we are offering ourselves to help be arbiters in that conversation, if we can be of help to our conservancies and our bids, while also representing the public interest. A critical question that we have is whether the administration is considering any changes to the long-standing mandate of the parks department, as a city agency to prioritize passive use in our parks. If there is any thought that being that is being given or whispered about to opening up any amount of parkland for any commercial or privatized use of any kind beyond what is already permitted. And that includes the talked about idea that the outdoor dining could extend into parks. We would insist that be transparent and that we would be noticed and consulted and that there would be proper public review for any of those ideas before they go into any kind of, certainly any kind of further planning, let alone implementation and then, finally, with our pedestrian plaza network. Our network in our district is the most extensive and trafficked pedestrian plaza network in the city. By far and the bids are the ones who partnered with the city to manage those spaces, they of course are undergoing their own tremendous challenges. So we have questions about how the city will work with them in managing the crisis and their contractual obligations, for example, phase two which will allow for the extended outdoor dining proposal. Pedestrian plazas might very well be a location for some of this, but what are the expectations of a bids, customary contractual responsibility to clean and maintain that pedestrian plaza if it is being used by a restaurant, given that the biz resources are depleted as well, which city agency will outline the precise obligations that the bid will actually have and will that be uniformly applied across all pedestrian plazas in the city, or will that be decide on a case-by-case basis and who makes those decisions and other questions about the bids role in the selection and execution of each of these dining areas? There are a lot of questions that remain to be answered. Finally- and this is a really important one- what protocols will there be for existing sidewalk cafes that will come back to us with applications for renewals or for new applications for new sidewalk cafes, even without the extended outdoor dining just the normal sidewalk cafe permit? That's all. That's always been part of our rules and regulations. Given now that the sla is recommending distancing of tables will the city require cafe layouts in these applications, including renewals, to adhere to the historic standards that were required in their applications? Or will there be new standards based on social distancing protocols that have not been developed and are not being talked about? One thing that raised the red flag for us was the dot commissioner's recent public statement that the city's enforcement of the new outdoor dining spaces would be handled quote with a light touch, so the enforcement of social distancing is of unparalleled importance and we have questions whether the monitoring can really be light. What is the penalty of a restaurant failing to ensure social distancing? Nobody wants to add to the financial hardship on a small business in our district, but obviously we have a critical interest in strictly adhering to the best practices for public health. So those are the biggies and we look forward to working with our partners to ensure that we can address all these in an equitable way for all new yorkers I'll. Just close this by. I think on the last letter presenting right now to just remind everybody that all these letters in full with their text have been posted on the cb5 website. So if you want to read those yourself or spread them around or whatever they're all there under, I think special projects coveted that's it. Okay. Thank you. Clayton really important concerns and great questions. A lot of questions hope we get the answers. So that brings us to the last committee, which would be land use, and I mentioned a resolution earlier and that's because the land use committee prepared two resolutions instead of a letter on the same subject that we're discussing now, which we will vote on this evening. So that takes us into our regular committee reports, starting with the resolutions from the land use committee on this subject, and I asked layla to introduce them. Thank you so much vicky. So indeed we put ourselves through the same exercises: the other committees we basically looked at the urban planning and land use impact of covid19. I think that we all recognize that you know the the. It is very much an evolving public health crisis that we're going through, and the impact that this is going to have on our built environment still remains to be seen depending on how this healthcare crisis evolves. Are we going to find a vaccine? Are we going to find a cure? When is that going to happen? Is there some sort of herd immunity that is going to be reached? Nobody knows so. We certainly appreciate that, and therefore the land use committee is very much committed to continuing to work on these issues as they are ongoing and, as we better understand the needs that the city is going to have to evolve to to address these these health issues. So basically, what we did this this month is that we focused on what we see as being two very pressing issues. The first one is an issue that vicky underscored in her initial statement, introducing the work that the committees have done, which is that currently, the mayor has created a number of advisory councils, 10 of them to be to be precise and in the this these advisory councils are, you know, made up of a number of individuals who have you know some level of expertise, but it is really striking to see that there are actually no community activists and, as vicky said, no community board members who have been appointed to to these councils, and this is really very problematic for a number of reasons. Some of them are very obvious. You know it's like. We know what's happening in our districts and having an opportunity to to express it is you know it's kind of a no-brainer, so we took it upon ourselves as you've seen throughout the review of these letters done by other committees and by my colleagues that you know, we've been hard at work doing that, but we also want to tell the mayor that community board members should be appointed to these advisory councils, and we know that other community boards feel the same way and you know may actually sign on to a similar type of letter and and call to the mayor, but further. We also recognize that currently, there is no clear and official process for us to weigh in on what the recovery is going to look like. So you know it's great that their these advisory councils have been created, but you know they are in essence destined to be a short-term body that you know once we get a better sense of. You know how we're heading into this healthcare crisis. You know they will probably subside. We want to have a more permanent role and a more formalized and codified role in what the recovery is going to look like for our district. So, basically, the first resolution underscores those two points we would like to be appointed to the advisory councils and then we would like the city. You know the mayor and the city council to create a system, a mechanism that is going to give us an opportunity to be consulted, weigh in so have a reactive response, but also have a proactive approach to the urban and land use issues and broader issues. Actually, you know whether it's transportation environment impact to parks, businesses as they pertain to the recovery from the covet crisis. Okay, are there any conflicts with this resolution? If there are, would you please click the raised hand? Okay, I don't see any. Are there any questions to the resolution? Again, click the raised hand, I'm looking through. I don't see any okay. Did you say something luke just that I don't see any either okay good and any comments to the resolution. Okay, seeing none leila you're? Oh, if that's okay with you vicky, I would like to bundle the the certainly the two coveted response resolutions. Okay, great, thank you, so the second resolution that we felt was really important to pass is that, right now, as I said, you know we're committed to working on what our urban planning, zoning and land use response should be. We also, as I said, understand that you know the healthcare crisis is in flux and we're committed to you know continuing to work, and you know think about these issues. The one very salient issue that we that we found and that we really felt was a pressing one to express is that in the past 10 15 years, the city has basically taken the route. That planning was not really their prerogative, that they should let other forces. You know the market essentially decide what should happen with the way our land is being used. So, although there is a 10-year plan, because it's a mandate of any municipality, it really focused on other aspects of what planning entails, and we believe that in this particular moment the city must reacquaint itself with its core mission of planning. Basically, a municipality kind of has two really main goals. The first one is, you know, putting together a budget and the second one is to plan. You know have a clear sense of how many hospitals should we have how many schools should we have should we have some areas that are dedicated to industrial development, residential development, affordable housing, and we really believe that, especially in cb5, the city has not done that, and there was something that was really very troubling at the peak of the of the epidemic was really to see all these towers on 57th street along central park, south entirely empty, deserted, entirely dark, and thinking about the fact that healthcare workers were commuting long commutes to come and care for the sick, and there was something just so profoundly wrong in looking at those two realities that coexisted. So the reason why these towers are empty is there is a reason, and it's because the city chose not to plan. We also recognize- and this is something that is echoed in the in the budget- consultation- that the city has allowed 20 hospitals to close in 20 years and as a result, our health care network was not as robust as it should have been to address the pandemic. So all these aspects are actually really under the purview of zoning and planning, so we're basically calling on this administration and the next one to reacquaint themselves with their duty, which is to plan okay. Thank you, laila. Are there any conflicts to this resolution? Click the raise hand button. If so, all right, seeing none any questions to the resolution. Again. Click. If you have a question all right, I see none and any sorry clayton yeah layla. I wonder if just because this reso at press time, if we vote on it tonight, I wondered if you wanted to update that number of the cases which at this moment is 205 405.. Yes, absolutely thank you for reminding us of that, but it will absolutely be updated. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, thanks clayton. Anyone else, any other comments, david galas, who is it david, akilas? Okay? Yes, I just want to say I'm so proud of this resolution. Layla's done a great job for far too long. The real estate industry has had a stranglehold over the city and it's about time something changed, and I think this is great resolution. Thank you. I am too okay, sarah dawson! Yes, I had a question. Do we really need more hospitals and I'm just saying it, because our medical system is terrible, it's fee for service, it's money and, yes, we need places to care for covet. 19 emergencies, that's pressing, but why do you ask for more hospitals? If I'm interpreting you correctly we're in comments but I'll? Let it go! Thank you vicky. We are asking for planning. We are asking for a planned vision of what services, what infrastructure both on the you know, the sort of like hard shell of our city. You know: do we need roads? Do we need parks? Do we need tall buildings short buildings? This is planning, but also on the on the soft side. You know: do we need more educators? Do we need more services? This is planning. So what we're saying is that what we know is that closing 20 hospitals in the course of 20 years as critical as one may want of this. The these hospitals put our response to an epidemic to a test that yeah some can argue we own. I mean our hospital system was put under a strain that was just untenable and we are saying that this could have been avoided if there had been more intention to plan okay. Thank you. Does anyone have any comments to this resolution? I, like david's, okay, seeing none. We are bundling the two. So if that's okay, given that I want to do the third, if that's okay with you, let's give it a try all right. Okay, so we also had an application, and this application is for the renewal of a chair certification for an open-air cafe in a public plaza, so to give a little bit of background, basically in the 1960s and the city. Basically created this mechanism, where additional density additional far floor area ratio would be granted to a a developer in exchange for open space. So they would, you know a developer would be allowed to build a taller and then sir building, but in exchange they had to create an open space at the base of the building. That was a way to create open space in our very dense midtown area. Where you know it's unrealistic to imagine that we would ever create a new park. There's simply not the you know. We don't have real estate for that, so instead it was a mechanism that the city felt was a good compromise. Over the years it has been deemed that creating a cafe inside this public space could be seen as a public benefit, but these cafes have to be certified and they have to be recertified every three years. So we received an application for recertification of a cafe within an existing pops, publicly open public space, the so the address is 12 east 49th street. So this is in midtown. This cafe was originally authorized, I believe in 2004, and there has never been really any problem. You know it's operated properly and you know in compliance. Basically, the scrutiny that we bring to these cafes is about signage and about making sure that, although these these cafes, which is basically you know, a set of chairs and tables are authorized to, you know, provide you know, sort of like accessory support to the cafe, but the seating should remain open to the public and that no purchase is necessary because the intent, the original intent of these areas is to serve the public in exchange, the developer got a much taller building than they would have so the way the committee has approached these resolutions and these applications is to basically say we will support the cafe. But there has to be clear signage, because if you see a waiter- and you know- let's say tables with white cloth- you're not going to think oh gee yeah- I'm going to bring my sandwich and sit there. So we want to make sure that these cafes are open to the public, but that also they are clearly notified and marked as being open to the public and that no purchase is necessary. So, although it's a renewal, although we have really no issue with the cafe, it has operated in compliance- and you know it's really a good operator- we still call them in and we ask them to agree and commit to continuing to advertise these tables and seats as being open to the public. They agreed, they retold our conditions during the meeting and they signed a an affidavit that I actually just received a few minutes before this meeting. So I'm very pleased and to report that to the committee and to report that to the full board and we voted to support. I wouldn't say that you know it's really important, that we do have this good level of relationship and communication with applicants, because it really sets an important precedent for all the other pox operators who may not be as good. We can really show that you know that these pops can be successful. These cafes can be successful while preserving the intent to keep them public, okay, anyone who might have a conflict or who does have a conflict with this. Please click the raise hand button. I'm scrolling! I don't see anyone. Okay, are there any questions to the resolution? I don't see any comments. Also click. If you have any comments, okay, see none. We will vote on these three res.

Yes, all right I'll! Go back to bitesman! Yes, okay. Motion passes, okay, the resolutions pass and before we go on. I just want to go back to mentioning that. We just finished all of the reports and the resolution. I just want to thank the chairs and all the members of the board, who invested really an inordinate amount of time in the preparation of the letters and the land use resolutions, and I want to thank wally kim luke and at the board office as well. This was a phenomenal job. Well done. Thank you thank you and moving on now we'll go to public safety quality of life. Thank you, vicky. I've got two resolutions for you tonight may have them bundled and deemed red, bundled and so deemed great. The first one is our position to address the delivery and to go legislation, that's being proposed by senator hoyleman. By way of background the when covid first struck and the state was shut down. The mayor asked the state liquor authority to provo, propose some guidelines for licensees to deliver alcohol with their orders or to provide them on a to-go basis, and the resolution outlines the guidelines from the state liquor authority, which senator hoyleman is now suggesting be made permanent for a period of two years after the end of the state disaster. Emergency, the legislation that hoyleman is proposing does have a few modifications from the from the current guidelines of the sla, and that would provide community board input and it would require some hearings and some other things. The committee was completely supportive of the legislation. We did have a few caveats which I will enumerate for you. One addresses what we're seeing now in our district as a big problem, where patrons are getting alcohol to go and loitering in front of the premises congregating, not recognizing social distancing in violation of the open container law. As I said to the borough president, at the at the start of the meeting, we take a different position about the open container law. We really think that it's necessary to enforce the open container law to prevent this kind of congregating and loitering in front of liquor licensed establishments. One of the things we suggest is that perhaps the legislation will allow the open container laws to provide for service in a seated capacity, and that would certainly be consistent with open air dining that we also discussed tonight. We wanted to make sure that these licensees ensure that the recipients are of legal drinking age. If they're delivering alcohol, they need to think of some creative ways to enforce that all the consumers are 21.. We want the ability to have input on problematic venues so that if there are issues if there are operators that are not being compliant, that there is a quick way for these to be addressed, we want the sla to have the ability to quickly suspend or revoke these privileges, and we want to be quick and efficient as opposed to the process that exists now, that can be a little bit more cumbersome. And, finally, we want to make sure that the bill is equitably administered to ensure fair treatment and inclusion of all smart small businesses and with those caveats, we approved this legislation unanimously. Sixteen zero. Okay, thank you. So are there any conflicts with this resolution? Click the raise hand. If you have all right, I see none. Are there any questions to the resolution? Please click. I don't see any there's clayton michael clayton and chris clark, thanks nick just given what we've seen and what you mentioned before to the borough president, where it's already a problem. What I fully agree with the decision the committee reached, but that caveat about preventing the loitering seems pretty major, given that enforcement is unlikely. So I'm curious, I guess two things like. First of all, what do we really think can happen to address that caveat, and, secondly, do you think that there is a way? Is there a reason why the committee found that support with caveats was a stronger way to go than a deny unless, given the fact that caveat seems almost unable to be addressed to answer the second question? First, there wasn't really much impetus from the committee for a deny on. Unless you know, I think the caveats were really more of an afterthought than than or you know a real reason to deny what I think will happen, and maybe this is a lot of my personal opinion once open street dining does take effect and there is a place for these people to go and sit and be served or to take out and go and sit that there would be, or should be, more enforcement against this loitering and congregating okay. Chris hi. Can you hear me yes great? So my question is about the the loitering provision. Basically just do to ask if that would require an actual police enforcement of loitering or if that would be left up to the businesses themselves. I know we're just addressing how difficult it is actually to guarantee that any. If that happens, but yeah I don't know, I mean. Certainly, the police would have to enforce the open container law and the orders about social distancing, but this take goes a step further and asks the sla to, or as the legislation to give the sla the authority to enforce that and perhaps suspend a licensee's license or their privilege to to deliver or sell alcohol to go. Okay, so oops go ahead. Is it all right for me to ask questions? Yes, so is the idea that the loitering provision would be a consideration for determinations when you're revoking a license, or would that result in if loitering, that the anti-loitering provision is not met? Would the business or loitering individuals be held criminally liable? I didn't see any criminal penalties in the legislation, but what the reason we asked for expedited review by the state liquor authority was so that if there are complaints of loitering congregating that the sla could quickly react and revoke that license or revoke those privileges to deliver or sell to go, got it. Okay, yeah, my concern was regarded. The policing of loitering has always been a very difficult issue when it comes to disparities and how it's enforced. So I wanted to make sure this didn't have any criminal element to it. Okay, thank you. Nancy yeah. My question is: was anything discussed about public urination or use of bathrooms? If you're serving alcohol and liquor you need to have bathrooms? That's just part of the process. Has that been discussed at all, because there seems to be a rise in public urination, it's becoming a problem, yeah! No. I agree with you nancy. This wasn't addressed in the legislation at the at the state, liquor authority level. You know, I think it's something that we need to address at a local level, but it's certainly not something that you know. We wouldn't want to consider todd hi there, everybody I just wanted to pick up on what nick was saying. You know when we had our discussions. My I was concerned about this whole issue of what can we do if all of these people that are out on the street or loosening the rules for good reason, and we all agreed that it was critical for all these restaurants and small business to get out there if there were some bad actors or, if they're just overwhelmed, so the expedited review, I think, is critical and you know we try so hard, even in normal times, to hold the occasional bad actors to account. I think that, as this big experiment rolls out, we have to pay very close attention and you know it's if it's not in there, we'll regret it so, to the extent that we have influence we just have to, we have to push that and do what we can to see that it gets into the law. The proposed legislation. Okay, thank you, matt you're, muted. I don't know where matt is I'm here. I think my connection's a little bit unstable here. Can you hear me? Yes, all right. I just wanted to just to add the logic of. I think the conversation that we're having was that there is already the sort of ability for liquor stores to be able to sell and to deliver a thing to deliver alcohol, and so the question that we were discussing was and our understanding of the of the legislation which I loved. I know that I think that kendall offered to speak to it, but our understanding was that there's already the ability for liquor stores to do delivery, and so the question was in the time in this moment in kovid, when restaurants have are having such trouble with their potential trouble with their business models, certainly actual trouble right now that it wasn't actually clear why they shouldn't be allowed to deliver. They already have the ability to they're already ordering alcohol. They already have a liquor license, and so it seemed logical to expand the ability for them to do that. So that's that was, I guess, my logic in why we were supporting it, and then we just wanted to make sure that the loopholes that a lot of people have experienced around getting deliveries and not having to show id things like that were addressed directly. Okay, thank you july. Thank you, vicky. I want to add to what matt just mentioned the logic behind our committee meeting our discussion and personally I would go a step further and to say for me where's pre-culvert. When everything was normal, you know weekends people go to bars and restaurants they consume. You know we all consume alcohol personally to me when people are intoxicated leaving a bar or restaurant and walking on the street. The effect of that is not that different from people consuming. You know seated outside to me, there's no difference so that's one layer and secondly, I'm a resident cb5, I'm not far from penn station. I have not felt safe to be outdoors and I'm hearing that from a lot of female friends and some female board members. So I think this allowing the establishments to serve to go alcoholic beverages, go hand in hand with the open street dining so that we can bring some street life back to cb5 district, because I don't think we had a huge surge of fat people on the street. I think we just are missing the good people on the street, so this will hopefully balance things out and bring some straight life back. Okay, thank you july. Are there any other comments? Okay, kendall jacobson has one hi vicky. I had one comment, but I don't know this race button wasn't working for me. If that's okay is it okay, kendall had his hand raised. Should we should we acknowledge them? First, no, that's! Okay! Please go ahead jamie and I can make my comments at the end when everybody's finished. Thank you. So my only comment was that these open container laws so for some context I grew up in boston but have lived in london for three years and over in europe, and the uk. Open container is fine like it is a law. People are civil. There's, no, you know outdoor bathrooms, so I think you know it might take some growing pains, but you know I'm hearing a lot of concern about this and I just wanted to assure that people can be civil even with open carriers, maybe even more civil once people get used to use of the concept might be a novel concept, but it doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to be more. You know disastrous and or whatnot, and that's something that I have not never seen in london or across europe, so just wanted to kind of make that point. Okay. Thank you. This is a little unusual, but kendall. Jacobson is this. In regard to this discussion. We usually, this is usually only the discussion that's held by the by the board. Kendall got it yeah, I'm senator holman's legislative director, so I was just gonna offer to answer some of the questions that were raised today on the bill. If that's okay, but if not I'm happy to just you know, take all the things that were raised back to the senator for his having to do with what he spoke about. Is that what you mean correct, yeah not having to do with this issue? No having to do specifically with the questions on the bill. I was happy to answer some of the questions people raised about the bill's provisions. Okay, how about at the end of this, so that we can continue? Our conversation, of course, is that, okay, yes, okay, very good! So stick with us, okay, sarah dawson, just a quick comment: I attended an open bar at mcsorley's old ale house. It was wonderful. We had our drinks in the street for a couple of hours. The police came by. There were no riots, the police left. It was very pleasant. Just a comment. That's all! Okay! Thank you. Any other comments. Let me take a look. Okay, I don't see any so. Do you want to move on nick to the next resolution since you're bundling? Did you want to hear kendall's address we'll do that at the end of all yours? Okay, fine next resolution, 1204 broadway glass ceiling events llc this resolution. This is a psql matter, but the resolution is being brought to you by the executive committee and I'll explain why we received notice of this application the day after the psql meeting, and the sla only gives us 30 days to comment on this on this application. So if we waited until the next psql meeting, we would have lost our time to input. So instead it went to the executive committee and now it's being presented to the full board. So this application is an application for a wine and beer license. We previously heard an application for a full liquor license at this premises. In december of 2019, we denied that application, because the rooftop premises was too close to an adjacent residential building. The applicant asked us to reconsider that denial in march of 2020 and we did and we again denied the application for similar reasons. That position went on to the full board of the state liquor authority who had a meeting on april 29th and they agreed with our denial recommendation and they denied the applicant for the application for an on-premises liquor license the application. The applicant is now applying for a wine and beer license, but our position is that whether the license is wine and beer or full liquor, our reasoning for denial remains the same, so we denied this application unanimously. Nine, zero. Okay! Thank you any conflict with this resolution. Any questions to the resolution see none any comments. I don't see any comments so before we vote, we kendall I'd like you to now in case it has any bearing or any questions that might apply to those two resolutions, so we'll do it before we vote. Okay, great, thank you and I appreciate the chance to be here and speak. You know I just wanted to say. I appreciate the feedback that we've received tonight on the bill. It's a proposal that we are very interested in community feedback on and all of your questions and comments are definitely something that I'll take back and discuss with the senator. I just wanted to touch on a few points, namely a few people mentioned: enforcement of social, distancing restrictions and open container laws. That's something we've heard from others as well, so certainly something we're keeping in mind in terms of what we can do to ensure that you know social, distancing and open container laws are continuing to be enforced. The bill is not intended to create. You know, giant crowds of drunk people on the street, certainly so we want to make sure that that's not something, that's becoming an issue and we'll be monitoring that and seeing what we can do. As far as you know, an equitable enforcement that doesn't pose an issue in terms of some of the bias policing issues we've seen as well. Over the last, you know a long time. There was a point made about making sure that recipients of delivery alcohol are 21. The bill specifically requires that a recipient be 21 in order to order for delivery, and you know we didn't. We weren't prescriptive in the bill about exactly how the checking the process of checking ids would work, but assuming that would happen at the door when the delivery person delivered the alcohol that they would have to check an id, because the law specifically, is you have to ensure that the person is 21. and also I just want to go into. We did add significant new requirements for community board input during the entire process. So some of the things the bill does in that area are require the sla to regularly conduct outreach to community boards and municipalities to solicit comment on the implementation of the law. The sla then has to prepare a report within six months about how the implementation is going, and they also. This speaks to some of the concerns that were raised. They can hold hearings to revoke, deliver to go and delivery privileges for bad actors with notice to community boards to give them an opportunity to weigh in either for or against revoking a licensee's privileges, and those hearings can be held upon complaints of any person. So the process you know would go according to the usual sla processes, but I do understand you know, given that this is a new. You know situation. I do understand the desire for potentially expedited processes. So that's something I'll take back to the senator and let him know that that's something that was raised at the meeting great. Thank you so much thanks for the additional information and clarification very helpful. Okay, does anyone have any further questions or comments based on what kendall has just told us clayton? Thank you so much just to say that in the current in the pre covid world, liquor stores that delivered and whole foods and instacart- and anybody else already did not require id upon the point of delivery. They could leave them with a doorman. They could leave them. I mean that's just known, so I guess just to put a finer point on what you take back to the senator and what you guys think about moving forward the proposed legislation. Just saying it'd be required it just it kind of isn't enough, because it's already the law and it already doesn't happen. So what can be done to actually take that a little more seriously, especially given that I think, until we are fully reopened and back in a normal world, people are going to be having private parties. People are already are, having kind of you know, anti-lock down, let's hang out in my apartment and if it's all the easier for underage people to do that and to get a case of booze delivered or whatever we can't have that be. We cannot have contributed to that thanks, clayton, okay, kendall, absolutely thank you for that. I appreciate it. We'll definitely take that into consideration. I anticipate that this bill will, you know, potentially see you know we're, certainly open to making changes to it. If that's necessary. So you know we'll keep that in mind. Okay, thank you again. I do not see any other raised hands, so I think we are ready to take a vote on those two resolutions, craig yang, we're going to reverse order. Yang, yes, wayland yep wine, trout, yeah, web you're. Muted. I see you yes stern, yes, bandor, yes, smith, yes, shapiro, yes, ray bar, yes, pawson awesome! I see she's trying to do something. Yes, okay, miller. Yes, myerson! Yes, mccall! Yes, mafia! Yes, lucy! Yes, lopez! Yes, levy! Yes, johnson! Yes, okay! Yes, isaacs! Yes, higher! Yes, heartland! Yes, harris! Yes, goldman! Yes, garcia! Yes, brewer! Yes, ford! Yes, docent! Yes, athonail! Yes, michaelis! Yes, resolutions pass! Okay, both pass before we go on luke. Is there a way when we do the vote that you could just unmute everyone? We go through it very quickly and then mute everyone. Instead of making everyone, you know go back and forth. Is that possible? It is possible. The only risk we run is that, depending on how people's speakers are set up, it might create a feedback loop and that's when you hear that really nasty glaring echoey sound. So I'm trying to avoid that we'll try it on the next go around and see where it's okay. Thank you. We move on now to landmarks all right, so we had three applications this month and I would like the resolution steam red so dimmed, and if it's okay, I would like to bundle yep, okay, so the first application it's on page 20 of the reso package. This is 234 fifth avenue. This is in the madison square, north historic district. This is an application for a rooftop edition. Basically, it is entirely non-visible from the street, with the exception of a tiny sliver of the railing of this new rooftop. The committee really had no issue on the landmark standpoint. We actually did thoroughly review the proposal, though, although it's not visible, so you know it's done in a tasteful way. It is recessed, as I said, it's not visible from any thoroughfares. The amount of lighting that they're proposing is going to be ambient light, they're, not planning on putting a big light show of any sort. I should note, though, that they are building this rooftop edition as a outdoor bar, and so there was discussion about the amount of lighting that could come out of it, so we made it very. You know clear in our resolution that you know it's represented to us that it's going to be ambient lighting and if it were to you, know, be something substantially different, which only will be sure to to raise it with lpc for enforcement. So, overall the other committee felt that it was an acceptable application and we voted unanimously to approve okay. Thank you. Any conflicts with this application. Let me scroll through click the raise hand. I don't see any questions to the resolution. See none any comments. Okay, next resolution, all right. The second resolution is 1177 broadway, so this is also in the madison square, north historic district, it's on broadway between 27 and 28th street, and this is an application for a demolition of a facade and the reconstruction of a fsmart. So you're gonna be like what you're demolishing something in a historic district. Well, yeah. Sometimes it happens, and in this very specific instance, we are allowing it. You know, recommending approval of said demolition, because the building is a no style building and is listed in the designation report of the history district as being a non-contributing building, which means that you know this building I mean it does exist, but it really serves no supporting function in the existence and the character of the historic district. What the applicant is proposing is to demolish the facade, not demolish the building, but demolish the facade and rebuild a new facade. We find that the proposed facade is contextual. You know it's pretty modest, it's going to be a three-story facade, although it's a two-story building, the applicant is proposing a sort of like faux third story facade portion to to the building the reason he is doing, that is that it is really bringing a better proportion to the building and anchoring the building in that block in a way that is more sympathetic by no means that should be seen as an endorsement of faux top floors. We actually spell this out in the resolution, so this is sort of like the interesting pardon. You know the feel good part of the story. The design that the applicant presented to the committee was actually not exactly pleasing to us to a point that we could support it. So we issued a denial unless some conditions were met. Basically, we wanted a better design of the top portion. That would be more reflective of other buildings in the district, which are basically articulated in the same way, which is a base a shaft and a top, and the building was really missing a top. So we communicated that to the applicant. We told them that we're going to pass a denial unless that would be addressed, they addressed it. They submitted a new design. We liked the design much better. The committee felt that really met the level of conditions that we had expressed and now we're presenting a street approval we did mention. We did notify the applicant that now they have to submit those approved design and drawings to lpc, so that this becomes their official application with lpc. They have committed to that. If we were to realize that they submitted the initial version, our position would revert to what we have agreed at the committee, but right now we have every reason to believe that those this second iteration of the design is what is going to go forward to lpc. What we have been presented is basically meets what we can, what we consider to be harmonious and contextual with the historic district and it's a straight approval, and it was unanimous votes right, which only proves the point that if we say no, because we want a better product or a better application or better, we get it absolutely I mean not always because you know some applicants are very stubborn. You can try right, but it is always a very good idea to start there and and quite often actually lately, we've actually had a great relationship with applicants who really take our concerns and reservations into account and they come up with better designs right, great okay. Are there any conflicts with this application? Any questions to the resolution just a minute. I'm scrolling any comments: okay, oops clayton. Oh my god, I'm talking so much tonight. All I have to say is the landmarks committee has been doing such great work and this I believe that cb5 should start creating a binder now, where we have these poster child case studies which happen with relative frequency on all of our committees, where we can point to very concrete examples when our deliberations resulted in a better result for the public. I mean there's many examples, but I think it's. It would really behoove us to have these strongest kind of obvious cases and really quick reference at one point. But I just wanted to thank the committee for the really great work and I'm happy to be saying this streaming live on youtube that I think that community board 5 does a better job than the lpc. We think so too. Thank you, clayton, and that also brings me. I was going to say one other thing that brought to mind, and that is I was going through some booklets the other day, and I came across our the booklet that your committee put together on the landmarks that are in cb5. We have a huge number of new members, since that was done. How many years ago was that done? That was before five years ago, five years, okay, so half of the board is not aware of that. Can we figure out a way to share that with everyone? Of course, okay. I think it would be really helpful just to for people to understand what we have in our district, because I think in addition to having more parks than anyone, we have more landmarks than any other district. I think isn't that true yeah, we have the better ones. That's true, very true, okay, thank you. Where was, I lost my train of thought we're on the next dresser, or did I do? Oh? That was a comment from clayton, any other comments and a comment from vicki, and I would I would say: clayton, I'm gonna. Take you off on the the suggestion we're going to compile the feel good victories that the committee has achieved yeah. Thank you and thank you for the kind word. Okay, all right, seeing no more comments. We will move on to your third resolution. Okay, so the third one 45 rockefeller plaza, as you know, rockefeller center has come to us. Pretty much like sin, I want to say since september of 2019 they've been in front of us every month, they're doing this big. Overall, you know we redesign upgrades to to the center and with many parts they chose to do it. You know to sort of like stagger it so that they would not overwhelm us overall, very high quality of work. You know they're very good stewards of the of the buildings and they really are surrounded by teams of fantastic architects and landscape, architects and lighting architects. So this time around, I think it is the last time that they're coming to us. I think that they've pretty much wrapped up all the the different parts of the work that they're proposing, and so they came to us for 45 rockefeller plaza, which is also known as the international building. So it's the building that is in front of atlas and this time around it is a re-vamping of the lighting scheme for the lobby and the mezzanine anytime. We have these presentations, we feel, like you, know we're given like a private museum. Tour of you know some exquisite piece of art. So what they're doing is really, in essence, re-lamping and bringing back the essence and the spirit of the original lighting scheme of the lobby and and the mezzanine over the years. The the polishing of the marble has has become, like so saturated that it has this glare. That you know provides a very reflective effect to to the existing lighting and the incandescent lighting has been changed so many times it's become very almost like the orange that is a little too intense, so they're basically scrubbing all of that, putting re-lamping the existing light fixtures and bringing a more natural consistent with the original design and a tiny bit upgraded, because right now it's really dark with some hot spots, so they're really addressing these issues, they're, also creating an alcove in an area that is actually not historic but they're doing it in a way that is very sympathetic. Bringing some metal elements from the other parts of the lobby really beautiful work. We've approved the application unanimously. Okay, are there any conflicts with this application? Are there any questions to the resolution and are there any comments? I don't see any and that somebody's there, no okay, all righty, that takes us to the end of the landmarks resolutions and, let's give it a try by unmuting everyone and having a roll call vote for you guys. Please unmute yourselves, you can't do it! No, I just when I click the button. It just sends a request to everybody: okay, alice! Yes, anthony! Yes, all right, heichmann! Yes, rosnahan! Yes, burton yes, jew! Yes, brewer! Yes, martha! Yes, goldman! Yes, goshow! Sorry, haas, okay, harris! Yes, hartman! Yes, higher! Yes, isaacs! Yes, johnson! Yes, payback! Yes, kaliforski! Yes, yes, mafia! Yes, mccall! Yes, myerson! Yes, miller! Yes, austin! Yes, raybar! Yes, shapiro! Yes, slutskin! Yes, smith! Yes, pandora! Yes, stern! Yes, song! She just left! Yes, wine, trout, yeah, wayland, yes, yang, yes and I'll! Just tristan are you on? I see you're still listed. Okay motion passes; okay. I think that was a little better and just if everyone meets himself as soon as we finish, I think maybe it'll work we'll try it again. Okay, that moves us to budget education and city services renee. Thank you vicky. I just want to say quickly. Please excuse my video I've been told by people on here. It's not a good look but zoom, and I are not friends, so I'm holding my phone while I do this bex has two resolutions. May I deem them red? Yes, thank you. The first resolution is in support of the core act. That's the community recycling and empowerment act. The council member powers mentioned it's composed of two bills that were introduced to address organic and electronic waste disposal. When the current budget deficit came along, it resulted in a 24.5 million dollar cut to organic waste recycling by the department of sanitation. What this meant in real terms that there would be no organic collection sites and no curbside collection for organics and electronic waste, so there was simply no way for new yorkers to dispose of this type of waste in any green way. The first bill, which is intro 1942, would require at least three drop-off composting sites in each of the community. Districts and intro 1943 would allow for the collection of recyclable materials like electronics and ensure they're not put into the general waste stream. It's one: it's important to note that studies show if people get out of the habit of recycling that it makes that much. It makes it much more difficult for cities to reintroduce recycling initiatives successfully. The city has been doing has been making great strides as they move towards zero waste initiatives, and it seemed to the committee very important to continue. We voted unanimously and of this rezo and we ask that they be introduced and adopted, and I was heartened to hear they're going to have a hearing tomorrow. Good, thank you, renee, okay, are there any conflicts with this resolution? Are there any questions to the resolution? Are there any comments to the resolution? Okay comment from july. Thank you. I I'd like to say that I support the bill. We discussed it in depth on the committee level. Of course, at the time we hadn't really talked about the city-wide budget deficit, yet so now that we know we're going to be looking at a 9 billion dollar or more city-wide budget gap, even though I still I'm going to vote in favor of this bill, I think this calls our attention to think about. You know where our elected officials are prioritizing, what programs to save- and that's my point just where our elected officials are prioritizing programs. Okay, thank you. Any other comments. Okay, see! None. We will vote on this resolution. Unmute everyone; okay, yes, sandor! Yes, smith! Yes, fluttskin! Yes, shapiro! Yes, raybar! Yes, austin, yes, miller! Yes, myerson! Yes, mccall! Yes, mafia! Yes, hey lucy lopez; yes, leaving yes levy; yes, okay, sorry, logancico! Yes, concealer! Yes, jalaporosky! Yes, johnson! Yes, isaacs! Yes, higher! Yes, hartman! Yes, paris! Yes, how's that here gotcha! Sorry! Yes, goldman! Yes, garcia! Yes, ford! Yes, joseon! Yes, clark! Yes, chew! Yes, burton yes, athanal, yes, michaelis! Yes and I'll! Ask laga! I see you're! There were you! Yes! Thank you. Motion passes. Okay, thank you! Everybody! You knew it again! That should be right after you vote, so I think it does go a little bit better. Okay, we are on to the next reso and before renee presents it it's a little different. So this is the mayor's reduction of the 2021 budget, and we have something a little different tonight in that this resolution was not able to go through the regular knitting procedure, and I wanted to explain why and how we are at a different way of handling this. So community boards traditionally have the opportunity to weigh in on the mayor's budget in march, which we did this year. We do not have an official opportunity to hold pine again until october, and at that time we opine on the fiscal year 2022, so many changes are occurring that require us to take a very unprecedented step by weighing in again at this time, particularly in light of the current proposed cuts by the mayor. Traditionally, this would go through the next meeting of the bex committee, but we do not have the time to wait. Another two weeks, however, members of that committee had been informally discussing the possibility of these cuts and that discussion initiated the resolution that is before you this evening. It was prepared, in conjunction with all the committee chairs and officers of the board, with information that was taken from the previous input from the board in our response to the mayor's budget in march. So on this particular resolution. Since time is of the essence and this week and next week the budget will be finalized by the mayor and the city council, and since it did not go through the beck's committee, the whole board must now act as a committee, which means that we are now. According to parliamentary procedure, a committee of the whole, the board still proceeds as usual, with a presentation, questions, comments and finally voting so renee. Please present this last remaining resolution of the evening. Thank you, vicky. May I deem it red? Yes, thank you. As vikki said, we normally make our comments to the preliminary budget, as we did this year back in march, and then a whole lot changed since then, including the need for the city to reduce its budget by nine billion dollars, which itself is a number that has grown and grown from initial deficit projections. When the mayor issued his executive budget and that's what comes out in april, it immediately and specifically called for cuts to some programming like the summer youth employment program, 100 cuts, I mean 32 cuts and the organic composting program like that would have been gone completely, as well as some of the cuts to doe and just as we supported the core act. This evening, community board immediate board. Five immediately voiced its opposition to defunding things like the summer youth employment program and to deep cuts to doa, which are areas that we identified, because we are consistently on record as supporting those areas and asking for funding. But now what has happened recently is that recent events, the murder that happened of george floyd and other things have directed us to examine the disparity in the percentage budget. Cuts that have been proposed and the impact such cuts have had on critical social programs on education and on housing for underserved populations. That's why the resolution is calling for the executive budget to be revised and cuts to be redistributed across all the agencies fairly. We do not want the city funding to be cut for children or programs and agencies that strengthen underfunded and underserved communities that need our support right now more than ever, but perhaps more importantly, our resolution asks that the nypd not be exempt from its share of significant budget cuts. One other thing I would add is that this is just the beginning of the of our work in this area. The budget ends at the end of the month, and then we start the process again. As vicky said, for year, 2021., we as a board start looking at the budget and our request in june, as we prepare our community needs statement. So I would encourage all of you to join the vex committee meetings and have your voice heard about this. One. Other thing I would say is that I know that some people have voiced their interest in police reform. That is something different than this budget issue. We are going to be looking at that and in fact it's scheduled for our next vex meeting. So I leave you with the resolution. Okay, you want to go through the resolution or you have I'm happy. Would you like me to go through the read the resolution? No, I just wanted to make sure that you had covered everything. Okay, all right. Does anyone have a conflict with the resolution chuck miller? Let's see, okay, one person, you got that greg. Okay, I'm sorry! Madam chair, I don't I don't have a conflict. I had a comment and I was preparing and hitting the button. I apologize. Oh okay, a comment when, on the last one: okay, yes, when it's when it's time- oh sorry, okay, all right! So no conflict on this one, correct. Okay, all right! All right questions to the resolution comments to the resolution. It's it's chuck! May I may I comment. I appreciate the work of the committee and the and the bex members in particular and the executive committee. I support the resolution wholeheartedly. I wonder if it would be a little stronger if we took out references to elected office holders because it seems to, in my view, unnecessarily single them out and it might be stronger as a statement as a non-political statement of board position to exclude those references. Thank you. That was a question. Wasn't it I apologize? It was a question then I then I make in the form of a comment. I recommend we exclude those okay like renee. Would you like to respond or any of the members? I think I'm happy to take that as a as a friendly amendment. I think we included included the electeds to. I think we took the adverse position that it would strengthen the fact that we are standing in solidarity and recognize that so many people are of the same mind, but I'm happy to adopt that same okay, renee, that's not a friendly amendment. So no it's not a friendly amendment. Okay, really I apologize. It was intended as a friendly amendment. I apologize that it wasn't okay, so really what we have to do, since it's a recommendation is hear from anyone else. We can't do it automatically. I understand. Okay. Would anyone like to speak to that chuck? Can I just ask you where you're referencing? Yes, you can certainly it's lines 573 through 581, where it references controller, stringer public advocate williams, calls out. Several council members quotes council member rivera, all people for whom I have great affection and respect. I just wonder whether it's appropriate in a resolution of the community board to have a reference to some electeds and not all who have the same position. That's my comment. Sorry dave caleb, I'm in favor of chuck's recommendation clayton. I think one reason why I like those references is because all three of our council members are sharing our position. So aside, from whatever idea about politics or optics or something we work to represent the constituents in our district, as do they and the fact that there is a I'm not going to say unanimous, but the fact that there is a kind of sea change in the way that people are looking at this right now, I find to be a very persuasive argument for anyone who might not have been following closely or or whatever I just I personally when I read that felt that it showed that we were all kind of locking arms in what we believe to be the priorities of the district. That's my take on it any other comments, mary yeah. I just wanted to second exactly what clayton said. I think it just strengthens what we're what we're about and that we're in solidarity with all those members. Okay, joseph sorry to be repetitive, I'd like to third that and the only new take I have on it is you know, I think I think it's especially useful here to talk about how much widespread political support this has gotten in such a short time, because this idea was broadly seen as very radical of any significant cuts to a police budget. So I think it helps. I think it helps normalize the idea by saying that this has broad support. It's not just some community boards. Okay, any other comments. Okay, all right! Chris clark! Sorry vic! Are you asking for comments on the issue that chuck raised or just general comments? No on the issue that chuck raised? Oh okay, I don't have anything unique to add, except that I support what clayton said. What clayton said is that what you said chris? Yes, okay, matt! I did. I don't. I think this is actually a question versus a comment, but the that lines 574 and 575, that they talk specifically about a reinvestment reduction, mitpd budget and reinvestment in communities, particularly when it comes to critical social services best executed outside of the nypd. That strikes me as that. A very important part of what the whole resolution is about, but the majority of the resolution really reads about really reads, or at least to me, about distribution of reduction of budgets and I'm just curious how the those who drafted it ended up kind of landing on that side of the are you do you have any opinion in terms of clayton's comment and chuck's comment? I'm sorry, you have an opinion on chuck and chuck's comment and then clayton I support leaving it in. I meant I guess when I had read this it. My comment is that I thought that it was the resolution reads read to me like reduce in the reductions, make sure there's a fair share of reductions in the police, which I understand. That is also what the resolution intends, but it didn't have it didn't sort of, I guess double down on the comp. The point that is made in line 574 and 575, which is that the reinvestment of the move from the nypd budget and reinvestment in communities particular comes to those social services is sort of it struck me. I guess as underemphasized okay, thank you layla. I concur with clayton. I just wanted to underscore that the electeds that are mentioned actually serve our district, whether you know they're, city-wide or district-wide. I think that their reference should be kept in the resolution. Okay, I'm getting the sense that the majority of people would like it kept in is there anyone who would have you know who has a different viewpoint: dave achilles, yes, taya, flip-flopped, and I now support clayton's point of view. I think it makes sense. Thank you. Okay, thank you chuck, without going, unless you want to make a motion to change the resolution, we're going to leave it, as is so it's up to you. That's the. I support the resolution. Thank you for entertaining me. Okay, all right. Moving on to other comments, chris clark, so to start, I think that this resolution is a good start. I think if this were the final word that we were having on police brutality, I would definitely have a lot more comments and questions, but I understand that this is just the beginning of a very long process or less fleshing out our position. That said, I do have one specific comments and a friendly amendment to propose for this resolution. I think it would be remiss of us even with the strong statement that vicky you read in the beginning. I think it would be remiss of us to pass a resolution on the nypd's budget without mentioning police brutality specifically, so my friendly amendment would be to add a short phrase in line or to the section that begins on line 554. So the way I would propose that it read would be, whereas the nyc budget crisis continued health care crisis, and this is what is new ongoing crisis of racist police brutality, as highlighted by and then the black lives matter, movement demand that we then dot. Okay, that does sound friendly, but it really is up to the full board. I don't know if everyone understands the nature of a friendly amendment. A friendly amendment is an amendment that you propose without having to go through the official parliamentary procedure of proposing a motion getting a second voting on. You know whether you have to whether you want that motion and then voting on the motion, so a friendly amendment and it and it can't change the resolution. It cannot change it to any great degree. That does not change it to any great degree, but further to what a friendly amendment is once it's made. It's. This resolution belongs to the board, especially now we're in a committee of the whole. So it's up to the membership to agree to that and we can do it unofficially. The way we just talked about chuck's suggestion. So I'd like to hear if anyone either opposes or agrees with chris, so that we can get an idea of where we go on this joe freeward joseph brewer yeah thanks so yeah I'm on I'm on the becc's committee- and I agree with this- I think I don't think it changes the the the language very much, but I do think it's important to acknowledge. You know the fact that this it's not a coincidence that this is coinciding with this moment after the murder of george floyd, so I think it's appropriate. Okay. Thank you, clayton. I totally agree, and I think this is a friendly amendment, I'd totally back chris's suggestion to add that and separately. I do concur with the other things that he said, which is that you know it's stands upon: cb5's responsibility to address the rest of police reform of brutality separately in a form. That's more! That's more efficient and helpful outside of the budgetary process, exactly okay, anyone else! It's is there! Anyone opposed speak now or forever hold your peace. Okay. That means the friendly amendment can go in so okay. Chris. Can you give that wording over to renee when you get a chance? Yes, I can okay. Thank you very much. Any other comments to this resolution. I'm scrolling, I see none luke. Do you see any no nope? They should pop up to the top of your list. Their raised hands should pop up to the top of your list see, and there are none. I have correct. Okay, very good. Then I don't have to keep scrolling. Is that the point good? Exactly? Okay, wonderful, okay, seeing none? I think we are ready to vote on the very important resolution. That's before us now and it'll be the last resolution of the evening, at which point we will adjourn, and I will wish you all a safe journey and good help. So, let's take the vote. Everybody please unmute and please mute as soon as your name is called yang. Yes, waylon shapiro, yes, raymar! Yes, austin, okay, miller! Yes, myerson! Yes, lopez! Yes, levy! Yes, johnson!
