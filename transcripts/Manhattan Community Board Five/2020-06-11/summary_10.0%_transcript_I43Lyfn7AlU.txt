That's right, I remember saying it's the first time yeah talked about it afterwards in the history of community board fives meetings that we had everybody there.
Hmm, all right, hmm hi, if you're joining us from calling in from a phone just know that you can press star 9 on your dial pad and star 6 to toggle, mute and unmute, so that's star 9 to raise your hand and star six to unmute.
As always, we are here to represent all residents, workers and stakeholders in our district and to advocate for what is in the best interest of the public, we will continue to fight for more equitable housing and land use policies, social services commensurate with need and advocating.
We will continue to maintain an open forum to hear the concerns of the public and engage with the administration city agencies and other entities to exact the strongest possible solutions for social justice for our district.
So I'd like to say that there is an awful lot of work that has to be done and our bex committee will be holding a series of meetings to address issues such as alternative policing models, access to housing, new approaches to criminal justice and the provision of education, educational equity to all students.
These meetings will be open to the public and community board five and the beck's committee ask and encourage members of the public to attend and participate.
I think time have to think about our priorities as new yorkers and individual beings, and also as organizations think about how we're advancing goals to make sure to advance the goals that we're all out there marching about, and for me that goes I'll talk about policing in a second, but that goes into you know: educational integration that goes into housing integration.
I will start just you know for many of you who probably live in areas where there's been a lot going on in the last few weeks.
Certainly, I've been in both my in probably in cb5 in other areas out there with the protesters with folks calling for change and congress for reform, but also to make sure that you know out there in my constituents, my community calling for need for change, and I really need for racial justice here in the city, and you know we have a few things that we're doing as we move forward.
We are doing that the post act, which is about understanding new yorkers understanding how surveillance equipment is being used here in new york city, we're doing a bill, that's related to discipline and requiring that they publish, and we have information about how discipline occurs in new york city there's a whole host of bills mark will probably fulfill the ones I forgot, but we had a really meaningful and long public safety hearing the other day to talk about ways that the city can move forward immediately.
But but you realize how much nothing you know, things have really not changed so right now we're going through the city budget.
Both I like counterfeiters and talk about his, but I think we both have been calling for the council to do more than what the mayor has recommended by a large margin when it comes to the budget.
The mayor's proposed budget basically makes essentially zero cuts in this fiscal year, but puts all the burden of cuts onto programs like summer youth, employment.
So, even before this moment hit, we had started to call for them to make deep and more meaningful cuts, and now I think, all of us feel not just to look at the number and the numbers but to look at the role of policing in new york city when it comes to transportation, homeless, services and mental health services and police and as the schools to have a better idea of what we want policing to look like in the future.
I just want to let you know that they did actually do a program they announced today for any of those businesses it's 750 thousand dollars.
It's going to be fairly discretionary on the small businesses, but it is a good moment to start thinking about how you want to see that happen in your own area or, if you have recommendations around that, but we've been leading the charge and the council on trying to get some version of that to help our restaurants.
So I want to thank the board for that and if you have questions or businesses that want to know more about the grants I've announced today, just have them reach out to my office and then I'll stop because I don't.
I don't want to take too much time, but I'll just one thing yeah, you are guys, I think, are taking up a resolution.
The most immediate thing we can do is to create some locations in each community where you can still drop it off, even if it's not in your building and our legislation, I did with councilman radio so requires there to be three in each community board district that could be surface drop-off sites and we're going to have a hearing action this on monday.
I think our budget, our budget committee, chair renee kinsella, is joining like a coalition of other boards on helping small business.
But as we look for longer term here in the city, you know we have a major budget crisis right now, it's going to be hard to find those extra dollars right now to do some of the things I'd like us to do.
If we get stimulus, money, direct aid, there might be opportunities to do more, but also just ease regulations in the city around small businesses, so renee I'll make sure I connect with her okay great.
I wanted to speak you to you all briefly in my capacity as chair of the health committee, about what I think is a very complicated upcoming phase in our battle against coronavirus and, of course, as councilmember powers, and you, madam share so eloquently addressed.
The good news for the moment is that all the numbers we're looking at are stable or even going down, but the way this works often is not that there'll be a gentle slope upwards.
That will give us weeks to reconsider our approach, but that we may be confronted in a few days, a few weeks or a few months, with a rapid increase in measures like the number of people who are coming into emergency rooms with covered-like symptoms and we're going to be forced to make a really difficult and really quick decision at that point about whether to roll back some of the reopenings.
I think that thought is pretty painful to all of us and I don't think any of us ever want to let it get to that, and that means that we need to redouble our efforts now to slow the spread and, frankly, do a lot more than we are today.
Racing can interrupt that chain and what it means, and what it's meant now for 10 days is that if you get a positive test, result you're going to get a call, those calls are going out and we need people to answer that call and complete an interview with the contact tracer to talk about who you may have been in contact with close contact for at least 10 minutes or more right.
Now, it's mostly people, you live with, or people you work with, but as we open and things like restaurants, come back, they'll probably be more avenues for exposure right now.
That's a lot that I've shared with you, but I want your help as community board members, as community leaders, as ambassadors from public health to communicate no less than you've communicated on the importance of the census.
Obviously you know people need to go out and protest, but I've been really concerned about it becoming a public health crisis and causing you know quite an immediate spike, especially because it's you know the disproportionate deaths by covid and the black and brown communities so about a week ago.
I did what I could and you know, bought 7 500 masks and was talking a bunch of community organizations and nycha houses, and I think the com, someone from the comptroller's office that I know helped me get these out and they were very happy to be able to try to get masks out to protesters.
But I was told by many organizations that actually the bigger issue is the fact that people on the ground in those protests were saying that the nypd we're not wearing masks, and I was wondering if that was something that the council, you know u.s health chair could address, but also in addition on that, if there has been anything any calls to action, I mean we saw the whole world rallied for ppe for nurses, but I'm not seeing that same sort of call to action for protesters.
I guess a two-part question is anyone thinking about ppe that could be donated for the people that are out there, but also to enforce I'm sure the cops with all the money that they have ppe I've seen that some do and some aren't wearing them, but how you know an enforcement issue needs to happen because this first and foremost they're you know we don't want people to die a covet on top of all of this.
I have the privilege of being able to leave the city, but with a compromised immune system with new york reopening you know, I'm very hyper aware of how devastating this could be.
What kind of example are we setting if public sector workers aren't doing that, so that has to be fixed, you're, absolutely right, we're pushing very hard on that and we're not gonna stop until police officers are doing the right thing to protect their communities thanks renee and thanks mark renee, it's so good to see you mark.
I still think we have one more clayton have your hand up yeah, thanks so much mark.
I just quickly wanted to ask a question about diagnostic testing, because just in my own personal circle, I have an 80 year old, close friend who had symptoms, got a test at city md and received the test results.
Wonderful, okay, hold on, I think I saw another hand renee kinsella, hi vicky.
Let people know about the expedited insurance claims that can happen now, and we divided this up and we've been calling hundreds of businesses every day.
So on the policing front, we believe that we do need to start breaking down a lot of the structural racism that has been in new york city and the police department and one of the ways we really need to do that through the budget.
But one of the steps that we think we should be taking now is restarting our city's capital program as a way to invest in schools, affordable housing, theaters outdoor spaces, to make sure that our city is ready to recover and reopen, and it's also one of the best job multipliers to get our city going and on the cobra front.
But you know I just want to thank you for your statement about racism and police brutality.
The peaceful protests have been, I think, obviously far outnumbering anything that involves property damage and I'm happy to say that I passed a bill this week called the police stat act vicky.
Okay, thanks going back to representatives, we have jeremy unger caught from carlina's office, hey everybody thanks, vicky and wally, and everybody and hope you're all doing safe, wanted to briefly just touch on a couple of things.
Obviously, you know councilman's very concerned about the effect that small businesses have been going through right.
Now we put out a letter or open statement from carlina and a couple of local black women leaders from lower manhattan, addressing both, I think, the nypd's over enforcement and escalation in protests, but also the fact that the city did not do enough to put our small businesses in a better place to be kept safe and protected, particularly as they were being you know, addressed you know being hit by.
We are working on a number of legislative bills to hopefully rein in some of the worst behavior of the nypd, take away as many kind of roles that the police do not necessarily need to be involved in whether that's schools or traffic enforcement and always open to you know other suggestions.
You know, I think, there's been a lot of really great things coming from the community on ways to address police issues, and you know happy to hear from anyone else and that's all for me.
We have a hearing next week on the mental health needs of healthcare workers, so hope you guys tune into that and if you have another question, just let me know okay, thank you so much.
Oh okay, thank you, audrey tannen from liz, thank you and let me just say, as a citizen, I'm very happy to have heard your statement, so I appreciate your community board being such an activist group on those issues.
As senator hoyman said, brad blizz too was very happy and very satisfied to be an elected representative up in albany having passed, help to pass so many of this comprehensive legislation to confront the policing and public safety issues in our city to follow up on that just know that next week we are going to be hosting two virtual town halls on topics that were brought up this evening on next wednesday june.
So we just want to let you know of that, and I hope you'll share it with your community of neighbors in community board.
We just wanted to put out you know things as well, just about with all people across the country protesting marching to condemn police violence, demand justice and declare unequivocally that black lives matter.
We appreciate the people calling to voice their concerns, and so just know that we're doing things too.
Yet I want to know that some of those have gone out as prepaid debit cards and they come in a white envelope that just says money, network card holder services I'll put a number in there to call if you think, you've threw yours away by accident, I'll put it in the chat.
Okay, thank you so much betsy, I'm sure renee from our becks committee, our chair, the beck's committee, will be in touch with all the electeds on that very important subject that we all are really concentrating on now.
I just want to ask with all the elected representatives here available if there's a program set up for people to donate, to small businesses who don't have insurance to cover their damages betsy.
Let me see what's available for individuals to donate okay, thank you, and this is jeremy I'll, just say generally like when there's like so many different types of places you can donate but, like I think when in doubt the best place to donate right now is like the mayor's fund to advance new york city, because that is going to a bunch of different things and because that is a quasi-government nonprofit organization that can sometimes more easily donate to small businesses which are for profit ventures than the city can, through other funding mechanisms.
Members of the public are invited to speak on issues that they think would be of importance to the board.
Sorry, the state liquor thought it was on the phone and you might want to have them come and discuss what would be relevant for your topic, because the short version is that if a restaurant is simply going to a little bit in the outdoor cafe or even perpendicular out into a parking space, there is not a lot of forms to fill out.
There's a form you have to do a simple diagram and it sounds to me like they're, very quickly going to say yes to whatever is presented and they've been working with d.o.t and the law department, so the community board does play a role, though, because sla says, oh new york is very complicated.
So I'd like it without going into a whole lot, I just think you might want to get more guidance and we will try to get the same, maybe sla, to come to the border board.
So I just want to say sounds like everybody is trying, but I want to make sure that you know all that they're doing, I think we've been working a lot on that issue of more street space for the restaurants.
Second thing, of course, is we've been working not so much in your area, but with the buses and trying to find more bus lanes around the city and, more importantly, how we can involve more in terms of having the buses uptown more along fifth avenue and 181st degree, as you know, were announced the other day, and then I just want to say summer is coming and school is coming in september.
That's something that needs to be decided very quickly, and I know that independent budget office did an analysis of some of this today in september, school will start, I believe, there's 178 000 young people going to summer school.
Unless you have some more help and then come september, I don't know exactly what's going to happen, we believe that it would be like 49 of the school would be occupied, so I guess they call it blended learning.
Okay, gail, before you go, I think nick athanal, the head of our liquor, license committee, would like to speak with you great thanks, vicky hi gail.
We've got a resolution tonight that comes to the opposite conclusion, because we've been getting a lot of complaints about people loitering in front of restaurants that are serving liquor, not respecting social distancing and we've been having a lot of trouble with with things that would be resolved by the open container law.
That's why you're on the community board to come up with all these great ideas thanks!
I've been shut down during this whole covid time, but I've stayed in new york and I've seen what's happened and I've seen how disproportionately affected the low under-resourced communities have been in our city and those majority black and brown populations, and I just think now it's such an important time to really look at the budget and look at the six billion dollars that nypd has and really think about how pulling finding some excess in there and pulling it out and being able to put it into resources that the communities really need right now in order to rebuild whether it's mental health or youth, employment or housing or food banks or anything, so you guys all seem to be headed like on the same page.
I am also just calling I'm very heartened to hear this community board's position in fighting racial injustice and pushing for more just city, so I'm also just here to add my voice to help redirect some of the six billion dollars in funds allocated for the nypd to reinvest in social services for the communities that are hurting the most right now, and I think this is a great opportunity to reimagine public safety and build infrastructure for the most marginalized among us, so yeah after hearing everyone today, I just feel really encouraged that we're on the same page and fighting for the same thing.
Is that it apparently okay, very good, that closes the public session of the board and we now move into our business session.
At this time, only board members will participate by hearing reports and opining on agenda items that are presented by committee chairs by way of questions comments and, finally, by voting on the issue before then.
I think it really deserves to be heard at our board meeting to be on the record, so I'd like to start with renee chair bex.
We agreed that it was absolutely necessary to retain the vibrancy of the city and that means figuring out how to safely operate the restaurants, the theaters, the shopping and all the small businesses that make up new york- and this includes making sure more is done.
E.J thanks vicky, so parks, psql and tne held a joint meeting, as you heard about from several of the electeds this evening, as the city continues to open up, several elected officials and other advocates have been calling for a new expedited, permitting process for outdoor seating for restaurants, so that they can begin to serve customers, even while indoor capacity restrictions are in place.
Obviously, the general thinking at this point is that outdoor seating is much safer than indoor seating with recirculated air and close quarters and difficulty social distancing, because this is a proposal that has very few examples or precedents in new york city, and we don't receive proposals like this very frequently.
That would charge the city most likely, the department of transportation to select streets to close and the dca to issue these permits to create this new permitting scheme very quickly, because the proposal- you know, as you heard, a lot about tonight, was moving very quickly and because new york city ha itself has already moved into phase one and because, while restaurants and bars are slated to be in phase three and the state is already allowing outdoor dining in other regions, seemingly already in phase two.
Given decreased streetcar traffic on the roads during the crisis and the overwhelming need for outdoor space to allow social, distancing and some degree of these businesses operating, we were very much aware that which streets get selected for closure will have a tremendous impact on not just the flow of people in traffic to the city, but also which businesses will get to benefit economically and commercially.
Secondly, we ask that the city work closely with the local bids to establish security for any closed area, to clearly define whether or not the business is responsible for enforcing the social distancing and the safety of customers that define who is responsible for setting up erecting barriers and ensuring the safety of everybody on the on the closed block or lane that they relax signage regulations, so that the restaurants can advertise themselves and their outdoor areas and coordinate with food trucks so as not to inundate a particular area.
Transportation, environment, okay after the joint committee meeting about outdoor dining tne, also met to have a wide-ranging discussion about all the other effects that the kova crisis is having on the transportation and environment of our district and to express the sense of the committee around our concerns and suggestions regarding the city's response, notably many of the enacted and proposed changes already dovetail with some pre-existing priorities and long-term plans that the that community board five has weighed in on like reducing traffic through congestion, pricing, other street use reconfiguration, and so you know we wanted to emphasize that the plans should not just be looked at in the context of the crisis, but also our long-term priorities as well.
Thirdly, we also ask that the city make sure to avoid sort of mindlessly re-implementing the status quo at any point, for example, reinstituting the curbside bus stops that we have before, while maybe an attractive opportunity to revert to what was normal before, would not be a good idea, while curbside gatherings without social distancing.
Finally, we also wanted to emphasize the second half of our committee's name, the environment, and to ensure that the city is looking at and providing data on noise and pollution and other environmental effects that are affected by any of the types of proposals or changes that we that we just mentioned.
As you all know, bryant park central park, madison square park, union square park and harold and greeley squares are very beloved public spaces to say the least, and now in this time are critical because they offer new yorkers a safe opportunity given the following of probably proper health protocols to get outside and move around and get fresh air, which is good for physical and mental health.
One thing that raised the red flag for us was the dot commissioner's recent public statement that the city's enforcement of the new outdoor dining spaces would be handled quote with a light touch, so the enforcement of social distancing is of unparalleled importance and we have questions whether the monitoring can really be light.
We certainly appreciate that, and therefore the land use committee is very much committed to continuing to work on these issues as they are ongoing and, as we better understand the needs that the city is going to have to evolve to to address these these health issues.
The first one is an issue that vicky underscored in her initial statement, introducing the work that the committees have done, which is that currently, the mayor has created a number of advisory councils, 10 of them to be to be precise and in the this these advisory councils are, you know, made up of a number of individuals who have you know some level of expertise, but it is really striking to see that there are actually no community activists and, as vicky said, no community board members who have been appointed to to these councils, and this is really very problematic for a number of reasons.
We know what's happening in our districts and having an opportunity to to express it is you know it's kind of a no-brainer, so we took it upon ourselves as you've seen throughout the review of these letters done by other committees and by my colleagues that you know, we've been hard at work doing that, but we also want to tell the mayor that community board members should be appointed to these advisory councils, and we know that other community boards feel the same way and you know may actually sign on to a similar type of letter and and call to the mayor, but further.
You know the mayor and the city council to create a system, a mechanism that is going to give us an opportunity to be consulted, weigh in so have a reactive response, but also have a proactive approach to the urban and land use issues and broader issues.
Did you say something luke just that I don't see any either okay good and any comments to the resolution.
Oh, if that's okay with you vicky, I would like to bundle the the certainly the two coveted response resolutions.
Okay, great, thank you, so the second resolution that we felt was really important to pass is that, right now, as I said, you know we're committed to working on what our urban planning, zoning and land use response should be.
You know have a clear sense of how many hospitals should we have how many schools should we have should we have some areas that are dedicated to industrial development, residential development, affordable housing, and we really believe that, especially in cb5, the city has not done that, and there was something that was really very troubling at the peak of the of the epidemic was really to see all these towers on 57th street along central park, south entirely empty, deserted, entirely dark, and thinking about the fact that healthcare workers were commuting long commutes to come and care for the sick, and there was something just so profoundly wrong in looking at those two realities that coexisted.
Yes, I just want to say I'm so proud of this resolution.
The real estate industry has had a stranglehold over the city and it's about time something changed, and I think this is great resolution.
We are asking for a planned vision of what services, what infrastructure both on the you know, the sort of like hard shell of our city.
So what we're saying is that what we know is that closing 20 hospitals in the course of 20 years as critical as one may want of this.
Okay, so we also had an application, and this application is for the renewal of a chair certification for an open-air cafe in a public plaza, so to give a little bit of background, basically in the 1960s and the city.
Basically, the scrutiny that we bring to these cafes is about signage and about making sure that, although these these cafes, which is basically you know, a set of chairs and tables are authorized to, you know, provide you know, sort of like accessory support to the cafe, but the seating should remain open to the public and that no purchase is necessary because the intent, the original intent of these areas is to serve the public in exchange, the developer got a much taller building than they would have so the way the committee has approached these resolutions and these applications is to basically say we will support the cafe.
So, although it's a renewal, although we have really no issue with the cafe, it has operated in compliance- and you know it's really a good operator- we still call them in and we ask them to agree and commit to continuing to advertise these tables and seats as being open to the public.
Well, three resolutions, yes by land, use; okay, michaelis, yes anthony!
Unless you know, I think the caveats were really more of an afterthought than than or you know a real reason to deny what I think will happen, and maybe this is a lot of my personal opinion once open street dining does take effect and there is a place for these people to go and sit and be served or to take out and go and sit that there would be, or should be, more enforcement against this loitering and congregating okay.
My I was concerned about this whole issue of what can we do if all of these people that are out on the street or loosening the rules for good reason, and we all agreed that it was critical for all these restaurants and small business to get out there if there were some bad actors or, if they're just overwhelmed, so the expedited review, I think, is critical and you know we try so hard, even in normal times, to hold the occasional bad actors to account.
I think the conversation that we're having was that there is already the sort of ability for liquor stores to be able to sell and to deliver a thing to deliver alcohol, and so the question that we were discussing was and our understanding of the of the legislation which I loved.
I know that I think that kendall offered to speak to it, but our understanding was that there's already the ability for liquor stores to do delivery, and so the question was in the time in this moment in kovid, when restaurants have are having such trouble with their potential trouble with their business models, certainly actual trouble right now that it wasn't actually clear why they shouldn't be allowed to deliver.
So that's that was, I guess, my logic in why we were supporting it, and then we just wanted to make sure that the loopholes that a lot of people have experienced around getting deliveries and not having to show id things like that were addressed directly.
There's, no, you know outdoor bathrooms, so I think you know it might take some growing pains, but you know I'm hearing a lot of concern about this and I just wanted to assure that people can be civil even with open carriers, maybe even more civil once people get used to use of the concept might be a novel concept, but it doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to be more.
If that's okay, but if not I'm happy to just you know, take all the things that were raised back to the senator for his having to do with what he spoke about.
I just wanted to touch on a few points, namely a few people mentioned: enforcement of social, distancing restrictions and open container laws.
That's something we've heard from others as well, so certainly something we're keeping in mind in terms of what we can do to ensure that you know social, distancing and open container laws are continuing to be enforced.
You know, giant crowds of drunk people on the street, certainly so we want to make sure that that's not something, that's becoming an issue and we'll be monitoring that and seeing what we can do.
So that's something I'll take back to the senator and let him know that that's something that was raised at the meeting great.
I do not see any other raised hands, so I think we are ready to take a vote on those two resolutions, craig yang, we're going to reverse order.
You know it's pretty modest, it's going to be a three-story facade, although it's a two-story building, the applicant is proposing a sort of like faux third story facade portion to to the building the reason he is doing, that is that it is really bringing a better proportion to the building and anchoring the building in that block in a way that is more sympathetic by no means that should be seen as an endorsement of faux top floors.
What we have been presented is basically meets what we can, what we consider to be harmonious and contextual with the historic district and it's a straight approval, and it was unanimous votes right, which only proves the point that if we say no, because we want a better product or a better application or better, we get it absolutely I mean not always because you know some applicants are very stubborn.
But I just wanted to thank the committee for the really great work and I'm happy to be saying this streaming live on youtube that I think that community board 5 does a better job than the lpc.
That you know provides a very reflective effect to to the existing lighting and the incandescent lighting has been changed so many times it's become very almost like the orange that is a little too intense, so they're basically scrubbing all of that, putting re-lamping the existing light fixtures and bringing a more natural consistent with the original design and a tiny bit upgraded, because right now it's really dark with some hot spots, so they're really addressing these issues, they're, also creating an alcove in an area that is actually not historic but they're doing it in a way that is very sympathetic.
I don't see any and that somebody's there, no okay, all righty, that takes us to the end of the landmarks resolutions and, let's give it a try by unmuting everyone and having a roll call vote for you guys.
Okay, that moves us to budget education and city services renee.
Good, thank you, renee, okay, are there any conflicts with this resolution?
Since time is of the essence and this week and next week the budget will be finalized by the mayor and the city council, and since it did not go through the beck's committee, the whole board must now act as a committee, which means that we are now.
We do not want the city funding to be cut for children or programs and agencies that strengthen underfunded and underserved communities that need our support right now more than ever, but perhaps more importantly, our resolution asks that the nypd not be exempt from its share of significant budget cuts.
As vicky said, for year, 2021., we as a board start looking at the budget and our request in june, as we prepare our community needs statement.
One. Other thing I would say is that I know that some people have voiced their interest in police reform.
Okay, you want to go through the resolution or you have I'm happy.
Oh okay, a comment when, on the last one: okay, yes, when it's when it's time- oh sorry, okay, all right!
I think we took the adverse position that it would strengthen the fact that we are standing in solidarity and recognize that so many people are of the same mind, but I'm happy to adopt that same okay, renee, that's not a friendly amendment.
Okay, joseph sorry to be repetitive, I'd like to third that and the only new take I have on it is you know, I think I think it's especially useful here to talk about how much widespread political support this has gotten in such a short time, because this idea was broadly seen as very radical of any significant cuts to a police budget.
I think this is actually a question versus a comment, but the that lines 574 and 575, that they talk specifically about a reinvestment reduction, mitpd budget and reinvestment in communities, particularly when it comes to critical social services best executed outside of the nypd.
I just wanted to underscore that the electeds that are mentioned actually serve our district, whether you know they're, city-wide or district-wide.
Okay, I'm getting the sense that the majority of people would like it kept in is there anyone who would have you know who has a different viewpoint: dave achilles, yes, taya, flip-flopped, and I now support clayton's point of view.
Okay, thank you chuck, without going, unless you want to make a motion to change the resolution, we're going to leave it, as is so it's up to you.
I think if this were the final word that we were having on police brutality, I would definitely have a lot more comments and questions, but I understand that this is just the beginning of a very long process or less fleshing out our position.
You know whether you have to whether you want that motion and then voting on the motion, so a friendly amendment and it and it can't change the resolution.
