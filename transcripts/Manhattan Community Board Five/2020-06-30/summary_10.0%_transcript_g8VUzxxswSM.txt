You, okay, it looks like most of our members are in attendance with us tonight so good evening.
So he can, you know, add any additional insight that I might not have the specific answer for so let me go ahead and share my screen and pull up presentation.
Although my office has worked in the past over the past 15 years on this building, we have done some storefront replacements and things like that over the years go to the next page user, several photographs that are landmarks representative provided to us of the designation of the building, as well as a close-up of the windows.
As new tenants came in and there's never any order to the whole process, so presently there's an application at landmarks to replace several of the windows for one of the offices and that's what prompted this master plan- and this goes back about two years now that we've been working with landmarks and with skyline windows.
Provided a lot of insight and specifications of the proposed windows that they're you know providing to us to replace and we've worked with them on several other large buildings like this for the same owner to provide a master plan.
It's probably going to be something that comes up as tenants take over the space they'll replace windows during their renovation, but we want to have this master plan in place, so it provides a streamlined approval process with landmarks moving forward, one last sheet of photographs.
Here we have some drawings of the existing versus the proposed and elevation and in plan so based on you know, skylines expertise in this field and they've developed a window called the D H 100i, which is something that they developed to be in close comparison to the Campbell steel windows, although it is an aluminum frame.
You know these things can be looked at closer I, believe everybody should have the PDF if you're interested- and this is just a schedule of all the different types of windows that were sharing so I.
You know I'd like to open it up to any questions and go from there all right.
We love that, but often in residential buildings, we see the approach where each tenant or union owner would elect to replace the windows themselves, I'm, not so familiar with it in a commercial application and I'm a little bit curious.
Why that's the approach just because it seems like it'll, take a very long period of time for commercial lease tenants to flip, and you know to get a consistency of Windows and yeah like maybe you can talk a little bit about?
Quite a large real estate entity in New York City I've done master plan replacements on 200 Park Avenue South, which is just a few blocks up from this, which is their headquarters as well as 210 11th Avenue, and the approach that they've taken on both of those building is that they place the order from the full lot of windows and they put them in storage.
Think we're improving the amount of glazing by removing the dividing bars of the windows, and that was one of the big points that abs was very fond of is that they wanted to provide as much natural light as possible and by having three over three.
You know having to go through a public hearing process, so we believe we have support the staff in this, but it was just a matter of principle that they couldn't approve something like this at staff level, which is why we're going through the full Board hearing?
There's you know, there's a wide array of different types, but I think the majority you will find are aluminum windows, ok, prob about 90% of them any other questions by members of the committee.
Okay, so seeing none we're going to move to opening up the floor to members of the public.
If you are going to make a comment, preferably use the raise hand button, we need comments, otherwise, I'm gonna call upon people Karen.
You know, windows in the lady's mouth historic district are actually a very strong feature of these buildings.
I would love for the applicant to be able to salvage them, maybe there's a way to remove them and reduce them on the building at a location where they would become harmonious with each other that this building has an interesting facade articulation where you know at the top of the building.
Well, we would also approve in and the master plan, so I'm actually going to turn back to the applicant and ask them if they would be agreeable to our to that idea, and then the committee can discuss that thought so I think it's an interesting idea.
So, although it was probably not by the owner of the building, you know it looks like the demolition companies have found a way to you know capitalize on these historic elements.
Building where this could be done, you know I would love to get more of a commitment from the applicant as of right now, I will personally probably vote no on this, knowing that it's not the majority, but you know I think with it with a better commitment.
If L can see were to be in agreement with this recommendation, then the applicant would be asked by LPC and it would become you know, part of the master plan and replacement process that these windows would have to be repurposed.
Okay, so seeing no hands raised so I'm going to make a motion to approve this master plan for window replacement with, in addition that the 13 or like that, all the existing Campbell steel windows that are original, be reused and repurposed and relocated on a facade of the building where they would be organized in a harmonious fashion as permitted by the condition of the window?
Existing windows, install new building, canopy and restoration at entry, doors and new building signs, light well, infill modification and extension of window openings, relocate relocation of floor area to construct a real rooftop edition and replace fire escapes with new balconies.
Just for the sake of moving the meeting along, we're gonna go directly to the your presentation, but to me we want to hear from Karen and her insights because she looked at this application closely, but I will invite the applicants to share their screen and share their presentation with us.
But we wanted to just show you the entirety of the project, so you'd have a well-rounded view of what it is that we're proposing thanks, lakin Colm, my associate is up he's doing what I cannot do, which is which is screen share and talk at the same time.
You go okay, so just locating the building on the south side of 57th Street between 6th and 7th, it's in red and there's a photograph on the right next, the office townhouse part just FYI.
Just FYI you can see when you look at the base, the bottom two floors of the building that it had an area way and it had those large studio windows and then the smaller standard residential windows for two stories that changed in the 1920s on both buildings as you'll see in the next slide.
So on the left is the tax photo circa 1940 and you have to look a little bit hard, but you'll see that there are those 1920s, typical, 1920s, large storefront openings on the ground floor and then the grouped residential scale windows.
The left is the existing building and on the right is a photo montage of what we are proposing and next slide.
There is repair of weather, stripping and reglazing as necessary, but we are not replacing any of the windows we are proposing to paint them a darker color so that they, both the cornice and the windows, are moniece with the darker color of the existing 130 building next door, and also more in the in the tonality that is shown in the historic photographs we're planning on the ground floor on the on the base of the building.
As you can see, the ramp and the step are removed, new wood doors with glazed panels above and opaque wood panels below are proposed and a and a glazed wood framed transom above and we're proposing on, as you can see, moving those plaques to the flanking pilasters next, just a little historical background, slightly intricate, but not too bad on the left are, is a photograph from the 1970s.
They, as far as we can tell, are also not original doors, 1920s doors from the time that the that the entry was changed, there's a possibility that maybe the transom above might be earlier, but we think the whole installation was from the 1920s on the right is: what is there now?
Think you can see when you look at the Hercules doors that their current position is just behind the paneled elements.
So we are removing that one step putting in new wood doors and the doors just need to get adjust that six inches are so taller in order to fill the opening down to grade and provide in a very simple and sort of semi restorative fashion, and certainly harmonious with the building providing at grade access.
So without getting too detailed here's the story, this installation is probably going to meet the staff level rules, although the installation that you show here that we have here shows the framing of the canopy going all the way back to the door, and so it partly covers the ornamental in intrados of the arch.
We are actually planning on changing that design so that it stops right where lakyn is showing with bronze stanchions, so that it does not go any deeper inside the opening and doesn't interrupt or conceal any of the of the ornamental stone or of the of the transom.
It's the it's the typical floor plan lower level, it's the it's the lower floor of a typical two-story interior space, so existing on the left and proposed on the right and, as you can see at the top with the oriole windows, that's the 57th Street facade.
So what's you can see if you compare the windows in the in the rear and the side portions, you might want to point to those lakyn yep there and there we are proposing changes to the windows as you'll see they meet the staff level requirements you'll see on the on the on the right-hand, drawing a left-hand, drawing sorry the right-hand side of it there's a that area that is in that is shaded in blue.
Well is an existing fire escape which we are planning to remove, but the green area there is a fire escape like terrace or balcony that we are proposing for each floor.
We are proposing to make the openings a bit taller by lowering them and all the changes that you see here conform to staff level, staff level guidelines, but you'll see that on the top two stories we're doing some proposing a little bit different, which you'll see in more detail- and you can see those proposed balconies projecting out, they are essentially in the locations of the existing fire escapes, except we're pushing them for wishing them back absolutely.
They also all conform to staff level requirements, but the balconies do not the windows that are to the right of the balconies, though that's the area where we're proposing to push out that light well, so that it has a wall that is, that is coplanar with the existing wall, that, although again not visible from the street and not affecting any original or ornamental fabric, nonetheless goes beyond staff level guidelines, and so it's going to the Commission next.
This allows you to compare the existing windows on the South elevations to the left and the proposed windows to the right again, everything that you see except the top two floors, yep those all conform, but those do not, and that's because we are proposing to sort of swap some bulk that is existing on top of the building.
Thank you very much, so very thorough presentation, a fairly large proposal with many different parts, just four members of the committee I, want to just you know, reframe what it is that we are looking at.
They don't go as far to the south, but they that that's where they are yeah there they are, and so in fact they cross some of the windows actually, so it's really we're proposing those balconies at the place where they are, because that's the that's the floor level of the of the building.
If you look at the floor plan there, where Lincoln is showing that's the outward swing of the doors and then that little that little area there that little square area is the stanchion any questions, let's go to me, I, don't regarding the canopy yep that you're proposing and forgive me if I missed it, but the sister building.
Yeah I have a few questions, should I just run through them all and let you answer okay, so I'm curious about the current use of the building we know.
Could it would still rain potentially on you, which canopies you know, protect you from the elements a little bit, but you do have an overhang yeah and it would go in to go right like him.
Yes, the material of the cornice, because we haven't been able to do a lot of site inspection for kind of obvious worldwide reasons, but my recollection I may be wrong, but my recollection is that what the what the designation report I think says, is metal, but our plan is to is to match materials I'm, pretty sure that is a that is a metal cornice, although parts of it might be wood but I, don't think it's a terra cotta corners yeah now I have an open page guide since terra cotta- oh it's not referring to the lower floor, can't cornice verses to refined, cornice I'll.
The canopy, in the line of questions that Karen had I'm, not sure I, actually totally understand the two possible installations of this canopy in the instance that you would go with the insulation that is not rendered on this drawing, but that would basically he visibility on those rosettes and this stonework.
Yes, that's correct and the fabric would be a dark, green or so like hunter green, it's good, it's great, yeah, dark, grey, green, okay and the twin has a canopy.
Yes, it done go ahead, yeah so I'm, just a quick question, so this dark gray color that you're working in is there.
Do we have any members of the public who would like to ask questions or make comments?
You can see part of it right in the image, a that is the angle of that stair coming down, okay and that will be removed because we're changing the dressing in the building, simplifying it.
You had mentioned that the fire stairs were there before and I believe those are slats of metal, so light does come through it as it's not a tremendous amount of light, but it's sort of like a pergola when you do get Mike coming through slats, maybe there's a way: I don't have anything in general against such a balcony, but maybe there's a way to make the floor somehow a translucent material, so light can still comes through because I think this will be very dark spaces right underneath the window and what is already a dark area.
So I have seen that, of course, in buildings, where they're glass or something that you know obviously very hard material glass but I've given thought to that as an option, or it's simply to answer the question that that's a difficult assembly, we're concerned about there, and we do appreciate your comments about how it affects the interior space.
Okay, thank you any other questions by members of the public on this application.
I. Think I think you can go right ahead unless someone has another question: okay, great!
Okay, so we are in business session now, members of the committee we need comments.
Maybe we can slice it off in you know, looking at those different areas, I think that we can start with the facade, so the facade.
The relocation of the plaques are basically what is in front of us there's a number of other elements that will be accomplished, but they were being dealt at staff level and not really under or approve you, although, if we feel that you know we should comment, we soon, we can but I, don't think that it really raises any or any particular concern.
Yes, overall I'm in favor of the application, I think they're doing a lot of wonderful things to the building as far as restoration- and you know, bringing the original life back with the cornice is just a fantastic thing that we don't always see.
Some very in favor of that you know it's a little bit hard to say, since we don't exactly what the canopy, where they're landing with the canopy, but I think that they're doing this they're going in the direction of the most sensitive to respect the ornate stone so I'm in favor of that as well yeah.
Think overall, everything from the from the street level from the facade itself looks great and we're so fortunate to have a mirror image of this building next door.
With that, being, you know, standing as a pair, the windows, of course, have changed from its neighbor, but the bringing back the cornice is going to be huge reading through the initial application.
The questions and comments raised by members of the public or valid it will diminish the amount of light that gets into the building.
We just want to make sure that we're not setting a precedent when you know maybe there would be a little more significance on an applicant.
You know on a building where an applicant would propose to remove so much fabric that you know we don't want to be caught in the situation where we would have approved and supported removal of historic fabric, and we don't want that to come in contest.
We are convinced we have been convinced by the applicant that there is really no significant architectural or historic elements to these facades, and this is why we can consider the alteration other comments by members of the committee raised: hands.
But you know we just want to make sure and mentioning that we have been presented with enough evidence that the secondary facades that are going to be altered contain really no architectural element or historic elements, and that this is why we can consider and support this alteration.
The project that I'm going to discuss today is the fall of building the interior lobby, we're looking to replace a door for this project.
It would be two new bronze on side lights, but the existing frame and the transom above will remain you're, not going to touch that, and you know as long as we as long as I'm, you don't need to the other part of this now to make it more ad to make it a be a compliant the door.
Ada compliance is a little bit heavier, so we do need to install a new ad, a actually button that once fast, obviously the door will swing out.
So, just to kind of give you guys a map of what the interior of the lobby looks today, so the doors that enter the building on the 57th street side, we will match it in every way.
Note that these doors are actually three foot doors, they're, not small, like you, the ones that are in that were that we're talking about this one is just a view of the lobby doors again and then, as far as the stairways, the other doors within the space of the you know, the stairway see which is located here.
This is the existing board they're a little bit larger I, think I, believe they're 42 inches in width and they swing out and again one of the reasons why we are actually changing it from a double door.
It's going to be part of the new side, light that we're building into, and this is just another profile of what we're looking to do you there and that's it all right.
Yes, sorry, I wouldn't ask a question, so these are eveness doors or will be people be accessing the space from the lobby as well.
We still want to make every door because, particularly it is a public space in the event that you know, somebody does need to it.
As the you know, building architect we did look at before.
Well, I mean if you notice, you know what we did think about is that those I guess vertical I mean horizontal bars, is part of the architecture and, if part of the bill existing doors in the space has that so whether what side you're on you're gonna see that door, those handlebars, and we want to maintain that down.
Look whether it's on the push or the pull side view so and obviously because of the door swing, it changes its location.
Ask a follow-up question: all the Richard may also have some, but are you saying that these design elements exist only on the push side of those doors in the existing other doors of the building, or are they on both sides?
We thought about I think we definitely thought of the use of the handle more than the aesthetics, because it has both functions within the lobby that end, you know within the other locations of the door.
You know, although the picture looks like it's a little bit chunky, but it's only an inch and a half I'm sorry ancient 3/4 wide, and it's for 3/4.
If you have to thicken that up in order to house it, or is it wide enough that you can, you know open it up, install the motor and then encase it again in the brass or bronze panel like we're looking to conceal it?
That's she I take in the middle space, okay, and is there a tenant lined up for the other retail spaces, not that I'm, aware of I'm sure that they are looking, but with you know, with the economy the way it is I'm sure it's a little bit of a hard sell right now then, have you given any consideration to the vertical lines and how their line where the transom the vertical lines you mean these.
Do we have any questions or comments from members of the okay?
Raise your hands so I know you want to speak yeah I'm sure that this is a be terribly helpful, but I'm going to say it anyway.
The two things trouble me about those horizontal to me: I found find that main hallway stunning, as it and I think it loses a lot not just in changing the shape of the dimensions but also losing that horizontal bars and you know, to sort of drill down a little bit almost following Sam's comments, which are not about the global picture which I feel like I can't take into account.
When asked about the alignment to the question that Laila you raised about the alignment, the answer that said, we want to do as little work as possible, and it feels to me as though, unlike a lot of the other applications, we see this was an attempt to do the least work possible and I think if we would lose, especially with the losing those horizontal elements.
He was assigned the year the review so Nick go ahead: okay, hello and then I'm hearing two things: - I'm, hearing, horizontal and vertical so I think Lela raised the question of the vertical bars on top and Richard talked about the horizontal bar, so those are two different things that were discussed right.
I. Look at the electric doors like those are the stunning elements of this building, and this Lobby and so I think this is a basic application and I wouldn't have an issue supporting it.
There is something that is sort of awkward in terms of the you know the view that we're looking from the lobby, which certainly isn't the case in the original and I'm wondering you know part of it- is I think maybe the side lights are so small and, of course, it's a new element that is being introduced and I.
You know if it was looked at with not doing you know just having bronze on either side and not doing the side lights since that's really kind of a new vocabulary, elements as it were I mean it definitely doesn't enhance the lobby and I and I, wouldn't even say that it's neutral, on the other hand, I'm not like extremely offended by this but I feel like you know, maybe it could be a little better yeah Thank You Barbara other comments on this application.
No, you know primarily realization and the thing that Barbara destroyed up I believe is Barbara around the trying to I would prefer to see them go back and try to address some of these issues and come back to us, but I'd like to hear from other folks with more experience if they think maybe I'm good walking up the wrong way.
Side are striking down the middle I mean it's not like perfectly aligns of the edge of the door like in the original, but I still look at this as symmetrical and then I think with a Lobby that this that's this grand doing something as least intrusive as possible is would have more of a respects to the lobby then trying to play around with the statics that wouldn't make sense for a TA what it makes sense for a user who needs to operate the door yeah it is you know it's one of those really.
You know small scope of work, types of applications that have actually much broader implications, so I think we're having the right conversation any other comments and thoughts that have maybe not yet been expressed on this on this application.
It looks like it can be subdivided in two spaces rather than three, and if it were to remain true spaces, then the existing other means of egress on the outer perimeter would eliminate the need for this alteration, so I struggle with that I'm, not sure I have the right.
Yes, but the existing door is narrower and would there still be an interference I'm just asking what the question of the applicant the narrowness is, the issue the narrowness meets.
So did we want to just pull the group to see how much of the neutral folks are out are on the committee and then, if there's, if there's more of a concern about some of the historical fabric being altered, the design elements that you mentioned, then we will move to the move to the proposed resolution of deny and less okay, but that would make sense so Barbara, you have your hand up, tell us what your thoughts are.
If you want to tell us sort of like where you would fall on a sort of denial, unless the applicant, you know, brings a more sympathetic design or another position, I'm gonna be on to deny the less side of this.
You is there a general feeling that we need to be providing a commercial tenant in a landmark building in a landmark interior, the ability to subdivide their spaces for one tenant rather than three tenants, but for one tenant with no further ability to know what the other two tenants if they will ever be two tenants in those phases and I feel like it's hard because, as everyone has pointed out, this gets done once it doesn't get done again and I wonder whether it's a deny, unless they do a more sympathetic work on this or is it a deny?
So could we formulate a position that would be we that this space would not be subdivided and therefore there would be no need for your any change, but we understand that you know it would be a hardship and we want a better design.
We would much prefer that this space is not subdivided and there is no need for this application to even come to us, but given that you know we understand that it is a reality.
Buildings do have to change the time, a DA with environmental regulations with anything, and the question is going to be: how much did they alter like?
Okay, I changed go ahead, I've definitely moved into the deny and come back with a better idea, because this is an interior landmark and if they wanted to subdivide it six more times, we can't always accommodate six more new entries or exits 488 compliance I just feel that they didn't do enough and I think we have to preserve the interior landmarks that we have.
Okay, all right, so it looks like we are leaning towards a we.
You know I think it's also important, given that LTC may you know very well consider this alteration, it's important that we tell them how we feel about it, so that you know this is on record and you know, hopefully your LPC will take it into account, so I'm going to make a motion to deny this application, while also making a specific comments about the proposed design and why we believe this design is not sympathetic, including the removal of the horizontal bar in the interior ma, be the lack of symmetry and the lack of details on a number of elements, including the opening mechanism.
So that's the motion that I'm making and we need a second okay and I, see that Sam has his hand up so Sam Jake I just want to say that if the motion is a denial with the further discussion, I am comfortable voting in favor with that resolution and we're taking the opportunity to specifically comment on what was presented on the design, and we have a second on that.
Any other questions from members of the committee- okay, so the second I actually have a question in terms of the applications that we see for Central Park.
It looks like you you're, using your the tools that are in the d-o-t toolbox and I'm, just wondering if you have considered partnering with the Conservancy to actually give maybe a you know a more specific and you know Central Park, specific treatment to these areas that you're proposing to alter I, don't know if Mia you want to add to that, but I think in general, for safety and for helping to people to sort of really understand how streets work here at the city.
We do work with Lucy, obviously when we're in the park, and we do review our plans with them and then I think you know if there were to be sort of longer term changes that aren't just standard markings.
Okay, all right any other questions from members of the committee.
So we're really pleased that you know for phase 2 DoD came to us, so the question now is: do we want to say something about this proposal?
Yes, okay, I need other thoughts from other members of the committee right, I'm gonna be calling upon you buzz.
Central Park is quite the year the gem of New York, and it would be great if the oh, the Conservancy, could you know team up with d-o-t for something a little more elegant, any other thoughts and comments.
You know, along the lines of restating a little bit of the history, thanking beauty for coming to us tonight and urging them to work with the Conservancy and the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a more refined final design of this proposal?
