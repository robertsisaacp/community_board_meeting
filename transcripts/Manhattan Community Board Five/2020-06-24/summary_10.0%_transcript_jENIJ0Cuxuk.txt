We will be going through committee assignments and team updates if anyone from the public is here for any other reason and wants to be recognized.
At that point, the operator came to came to agreement on certain issues in terms of time, the time the amount of noise in terms of like music and stuff like that and then agreed to enter into an affidavit.
They have live music with stops for a certain time and they agree to this in writing and they feel that they signed an affidavit and that gets sent to the State Liquor Authority and become part of their license.
They can also go radio silent because they're still negotiating with their landlord, and they don't want to enter into an agreement if they don't know that they're actually going to be there today they actually came back to us.
There's no need for a public hearing, given that we did come up with agreements that were amenable to both the operator, the community port and the residence okay.
So essentially the business model is going to be a bar on the ground level and I think two or three classrooms on the upper level offering people an experience show you know I guess an experience to make their own gin.
They wanted to be able to have like a three class tournament turn around every evening, so they wanted to potentially operate from 5:00 p.m. I think to 2:00 a.m. and we pushed back on behalf of the residents across the street, there's a condo building across the street and they were concerned about late night noise, later hours of operation and also there's a place of worship diagonally across the street.
The second application is on the same block further down towards six seven, eight 110, West, 30th, Street and they're doing business us I know.
We think they're just asking that, because why not we've found back to them and said this is not appropriate at 4:00 a.m. closing time is not appropriate for the block, because it's mixed between residential and commercial.
It's a hotel chain, I think it's a Best Western and Todd Simon and a previous member of the committee, I think, might have done a site visit and it looked like a slam dunk, but they have an outdoor space in the backyard.
So we asked the applicant to reach out to the their neighbors and we received about 40 letters, 40 emails saying that they don't want a an outdoor space serving alcohol and the facing their building, so Todd's trying to organize a meeting with the applicant and the and the adjacent building, as well as the rectory, to coordinate and see if they can share their method of operation and resolve and come to some resolution.
You muted, you hear me yep, so I sent out an email last week to all of the key parties, we're trying to as Miss Jo said, coordinate that meeting until we got this big pushback from the residential building.
It was a slam dunk, but I'm, hoping that once we get these people together in the same virtual room and possibly if the applicant explains what they're doing and modifies it or agrees to do sound studies or limits their hours of operation or reassures the residents that maybe they can agree to some reasonable stipulations and get this done without a public.
We have to do a site tour and we really want to talk the applicant and yeah get a sense of what their method of operation is and then brief them on and show them what our new policy statements are for that area.
You know we don't want any new applicants coming in and flooding the space with lots of the foot.
Everything's been deserted, but again and of course we have the situation where the city and state or letting everybody use the outdoor space in a way that is independent of this, but nevertheless, we'll have we'll have our discussions with this applicant and see.
Actually right now, unless you know, if you know we could always just let the SLA know that, even if they have received an application, we can request that they not take any action on the application until we've had the chance to comment, and we can explain that we're waiting for the applicant to get back to us so that'll at least put a you know a bookmark in the application.
In that context we should get let the SLA know we're working on this and then the ys1 Joe 11 West, 19th Street.
They have asked for a license for the entire hotel, as is customary, it is in The, Times, Square area and that's an interesting question of whether it is actually in Times Square for the following reason.
They have asked for 2 a.m. closing for two outdoor spaces and that may or may not be of concern to us but pointed out to the group that the Knickerbocker Hotel, which is literally in Times Square.
The bottom line is that there is a site visit plan for July 15th and the team of intrepid explorers will look at these outdoor spaces and see if they can see any residential buildings.
Jessica, yes, so it's a 12 story, co-working space and for two of the floors they want to have liquor a liquor license.
I'm making notes and sending them a message tomorrow and any other comments from you know: I think I'm, Sarah and I'm max I was kind enough, walk me through the process, so we met last week and we were only able to see the exterior, but we hope to see more on July 15 and at today's call the team was kind enough to kind of walk me through the process.
Okay, all right, thanks guys, let's hear from Daniel Rob and Jordan I think Rob you're the point person for these tonight.
There is another application, I think it was 893 Broadway, it's a loft space and they were looking to firm up their lease details and had kind of said.
Think that's one of the reasons we're having this meeting, because things have sort of just fallen off the falling out of mind over the past couple of months, and you know, hopefully the other things are starting to open up again.
There was a lot of resistance from the residents in the neighboring building, but at this point the applicant themselves seems to be going very slowly.
The operation looks really nice really clean, they do have a little outdoor space, and so we think probably an affidavit is an order, but we never got that far with them and we haven't heard anything from them.
We're paying we're clearly, as we all know, in a disastrous state with our budget and I've, been here throughout, the entire prices have been in New, York, City resident for 22 years, and it's just beyond irresponsible to be doing this frankly, I, don't really care so I think the best Avenue to go forward because psql, as you kind of learn from being on this call, primarily deals with liquor licenses and the board office deals with constituent services.
You know, I, don't think what he's doing is legal based on placed on the bid.
