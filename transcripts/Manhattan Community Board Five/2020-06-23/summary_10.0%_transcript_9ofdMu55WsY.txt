I'm just going to give you a brief overview of how the committee works, we are going to discuss our issue, which is budget and alternative policing, Public Safety tonight the citizen budget Commission CBC, who is a nonpartisan I, always say that we're wrong nonpartisan nonprofit civic organization, whose mission is to achieve constructive change in the finances and services of New York City is here.
The committee is going to be permitted to ask questions followed by the public and then we're going to move into our conversation mode now, while a resolution regarding our committees, you of alternating policing and potential areas where the city might explore new paradigms is the eventual goal, that's where we want to get here.
It's gonna be finalized at the end of the month, and although there have been statements from the City Council and the mayor regarding what this budget is going to look like, we really don't know.
Until it's formally adopted, we have already sent our electeds a letter which supports cuts to the NYPD and support for things like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, and so we are now as a committee looking to the next budget cycle, which begins on July 1st, the transportation and environment committee of CB 5, provided us with a set of principles that they have informally adopted regarding the enforcement of transportation violations, and that's really going to be helpful for our conversation this evening, and we should look at that.
As we start, this conversation is what are the tasks that are currently handled by the NYPD that could be better handled by other agencies or other organizations even think about whether armed police are necessary for all functions, and we also need to think about enforcement, and how do we ensure enforcement is done in a non biased way, but also even thinking things like?
We need to maintain with this I'm going to hand it over to Joseph who's, been working on this agenda item with people in the policing silo to provide an introduction and overview of CBC's presentation.
There is that you know they're a good place to go for the facts, about the budget to understand how the city budget works and I'm hoping that they'll give us the information that we need- and you know maybe stick around for the Q&A and maybe parted the last part of the discussion, if possible, to answer questions that come up about different budget lines.
Yes, great, all right, so, first things first I think you know often we see sort of thrown around the news or on Twitter or whatever, that the NYPD's budget is about six billion dollars.
One important fact to note is that this doesn't fully account for the entire expenses of the city pays on the NYPD and related costs, because it doesn't include what are known as central expenses, so in 2020 the NYPD's operating budget which funds it's like day-to-day operations, the costs of staff, the cost of programming or anything else that the agency might do is about five point six billion.
But then there are another 5.3 billion dollars in central expenses which are managed centrally by the city, but then can be allocated back to the agency, for which you know those costs are responsible for, and this is things like pensions fringe benefits, which includes things like health, insurance and other welfare contributions to employees as well as there is spending for any capital projects that NYPD might have.
For example, if you look at how many people did NYPD employees, it's a bit, it's about 54,000 in 2020, about 36,000 of those or uniformed employees, and seventeen thousand of those are civilian employees, and the civilian employees include things like the school safety agents, as well as traffic enforcement agents that eat see in the street.
If anyone has questions and then also I'll turn to on to see if she has anything else to add, but some of the budget Basics online way, PD thanks, Adrienne I, don't have very much to add I, think yeah I think he did an excellent job sort of discussing the general contours of the budget and how it fits into the city's overall spending.
Revenues have come in much more much lower than expected, given the economic crisis and the pandemic, and so we at CBC did a report looking at sort of what we would recommend as the way for the city to close the budget gap, and we have a framework that was developed by Charles pressure, a research staff.
You have a lot of expansion of programs and services being provided and much less focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government, and so the largest piece of the recommendation is the pot city count by nine thousand positions, and in that we identified the NYPD is one specific is where one specific agency were.
This was one place where there could be a rollback of the size of the force without unduly impacting the service that they're providing yeah, but I think it would be best if we you know if there are questions and Adrienne can go for anything else, that he whenever we can explain anything else, that people have questions about.
Rachel sorry was on meeting and thanks for the presentation, I thought the stat you had on the distribution between city and federal / state funding was really helpful, so 92% of NYPD's funded by the city, wondering if you have the same kind of stats for the other agencies, you showed in one of the first few slides I.
Thank you for the presentation that was really helpful on just to Questor small question: do you know how the number of uniformed and civilian officers, as well as the New York City police budget, compared to that of other comparable cities, whether it be San, Francisco, LA, Chicago, on a per capita basis?
What diversity has been built up over the last say, five or seven years so I, don't know if the budget Commission looks at that like there was a big push and lots of information came out about how much more diverse the more recent classes are, and my worry is that if we go all out and start cutting just into NYPD instead of just threatened and through easing back on the new classes, we're really gonna lose what diversity they've managed to build up recently.
If you're aware of any things like that, okay I mean I can talk about the pension side, I think Adrienne has been in the payroll data more recently.
There hasn't been a whole lot of movement, so I'm not sure that that's the only thing that could explain the growth in the police force on the budget side, I think the growth rates have been pretty comparable when I, when I, remember and I was looking at them.
You know, I know you're not really focused on the conversation about cutting the NYPD budget or looking at alternative sources, kind of alternative plans for Public Safety and trying to balance those priorities.
Some advocates, including you know, the City Council Speaker I'm, called for 1 billion dollars per year in reductions to the budget.
So I guess one thing that I don't really understand, and if you have some background on it, I'd love to hear is just you know: how does the negotiation process work between the city and the police union?
You know I wanted to put that to you, since you look at budgets from a lot of agencies.
And what do you think about that I can handle transparency first yeah I mean the city provides a lot of it and when I started like every once and again, I need to find out about other cities and then I realized how much the city provides, but it is still really difficult to get in and really understand the spending.
It's they're cutting headcount in many agencies or stuff, it's usually through attrition or moving people around, and so you know, I think that's just part of the general way that the city has worked has been through, and the separation rate is something like 7 percent.
That's about all of the other work rules and salary and other benefits thanks Anna I have a quick question: are the overtime amounts consistent from year to year, or you know, if you're saying they're sparked by events or at certain circumstances, but are they consistent from year to year such that you know, you could plan for a certain amount that you see year on year of activity, I mean they're generally sort of in the same ballpark I mean you know, around 500 million dollars for uniform to overtime at the police department is sort of.
Guess you would call it like city funded payouts from civil suits against police officers in the New York Police Department I was I was surprised that the money that the city pays out doesn't come from the NYPD budget, but I'm curious to hear whether that's just standard.
Like does the money that they win just come out of this general city fund rather than from the d-o-t budget, or is this something unique to NYPD?
Is that just the legal department Department and the Comptroller I'm, not as yes, I me and the Comptroller instituted something at the beginning when he came into office and I think costs down I want to say the total is somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 million was released recently for festival, 19 and there's a budget line they're doing this based on friends, so I think you know they have an assumption based on what in most years and then, if they're, exceptionally large payouts coming it would make during the year, and sometimes that is what happens that you have like some long-standing litigation that gets just for some context.
Zack your hand is up thanks, Rene, just one question: I'm, not sure the extent to which you would know this, but so the City Council is obviously thrown out a 1 billion dollar annual cut from NYPD budget.
That is the level at which the council appropriate, and so they can say you know this unit of appropriation, which might be something like administration or executive administration at NYPD is going to have this budget, and so the city can make some they can move up to like 5% within an agency across these different groupings, to make movement any greater than that they need to go back to the council.
What we'll do now is turn to the committee for our two-hour conversation about the NYPD, using what we've learned tonight to think about the resolution that we want to put together for our next meeting about the principles for CB 5, so who would like to kick off with their thoughts their conversation, their comments?
Is that something that we agree with, that there are agencies that might be better served outside to be put outside of the NYPD July I just noticed: oh yeah, sorry, okay, Thank, You, Renee, I, just I guess they want to start up the discussion by asking what would be the purpose of us getting a resolution together, because the city budget is going to be finalized by July 1?
What we're talking about is a statement of principles and a resolution moving forward CBI's position on perhaps alternative policing and you're correct that the city budget is going to be decided in the next week and we've already weighed in we've, provided our position on cuts that we'd like to see made at the NYPD some of the programs that we would like to ensure continue.
You know my thoughts about the discussion about kind of like what we might want to fund instead of certain components of NYPD, because I know that's kind of where we're going in one way.
You know potentially moving safety officers from NYPD to Department of Education, and then there was homeless outreach, which you know it's kind of related, obviously to the mental health bucket, but I think it's more talking about.
You know at instead of increased patrols, especially in places where homeless individuals tend to congregate, like the transit system, kind of especially in parts of Midtown, Port Authority, so yeah just wanted to offer that Thank, You Joseph does anyone else have a view of this?
You know they're not trained to be mental health professionals or to deal with the homeless or all sorts of other issues that they are forced to kind of handle on a day-to-day basis, and so I think all the areas that Joseph mentioned are some perfectly appropriate for increased funding.
If you know, if that you know whatever as a replacement for whatever is cut from the NYPD budget, right I think that we need to recognize that what we're talking about and I think Anna would agree with me.
Can you hear me I can mm-hmm, okay, great, so I just have a question more generally about the actual document that we'll be producing on the principles, as you mentioned, because, like you said, we are talking about a deficit, so I just wanted a little bit more clarity in terms of you know, are we just saying we support cutting the NYPD budget, and these are ways that we could do it and sort of leaving it at that or are we saying you would like budgets be cut, and this is how we want that money that could have gone to them?
You your hand is up again, I want to say, I, agree in principle with what Joseph and the sack we're talking about in the three areas, its fullness mental illness and exclusivity, to have to NYPD the police officers, nothing loth, but have other more appropriate or relevant.
Now then think of it, whether it has to do with people violating social distancing rules, the state law of a mask in public when you're, not it was maintained, so she did social distancing or when it relates to business, closed temporarily and opportunities present themselves for people who want to you know, take what don't belong to them, and just public safety as a female signifying resident I would not feel safe with you police officers in the street.
Yes, so I mean I, guess we're discussing the police department today and we're talking about taking out the certain enforcement actions that the police don't do well and they probably shouldn't be doing, but in terms of the budget I, don't think we're saying that these items should not have enforcement.
Think first and foremost, we have to understand is the committee: what are you know as T&E put down what our guiding principles where we stand on the issue of policing?
So I think our principles need to be defined first and that's what this conversation is about and that sort of drives and they're bound up together is that well and overall, philosophically I would agree that certain things should be taken away from the police department, because they're probably not well equipped and they're inclined to use force and handcuffs versus.
You know that put together mental health workers and police I think there's a group called the core response teams and there have been a number of efforts to try to soften the approach of the NYPD to emotionally disturbed people and folks of that of that ilk and I.
Wonder if there's any information available on how effective that effort has been and whether some things that combine police enforcement with social services or mental health services are actually achieving any success currently in the current climate, because I guess, from my point of view, is the interface between NYPD and emotionally disturbed people or people that are in crisis.
So, in other words, everybody shows up and they all look like police, but some of them may have different training and I guess for me, I'm curious to see how the PD has worked to provide a more you know, synthetic kind of service that might respond in more ways than just brute force to control the situation.
A very good point and I think that as we as we develop our position, it will help us to look at other issues like the front end of the homeless outreach situation, I seeing anymore Rachel.
I think most of the funding is from Department of Health, and you know, basically, they have social workers, they have psychiatrist, they visit people in their homes, they make sure they're properly treated diagnosed medicated getting what they need in other ways and then doing that helps them prevent people from being on a street corner in a psychotic episode, and so my partner told me that actually there's a two-year waiting list right now for a new client to be added to the act caseload like someone who's identified as needing those services unless there's a court order, it takes two years.
People of color in the department Renee can I ask one more question: I'm sorry, I'm talking a lot so I guess I, don't know, I want to hear what you think about this.
We've talked about kind of functions that might be better served in different agencies, but I mean there are also some things that the City Council and advocates are recommended in terms of changes within NYPD that have budget implications, but that also have like Public Safety implications that, like I, don't know if that's appropriate for our principals.
He was on the NYPD pay line for five years, so I think if we're looking for ways to save money and avoid officers losing their jobs, they're doing a really good job.
Let's I, don't know, I would support a statement of principles that allows changes like that to be made where we can actually take quick action to fire officers who hurt people, and you know, and then also there is concerns about overtime, that I think Zach and a few others raise that and I also agree with I.
I think that services like mental health response, school safety and homeless, outreach and support that you know Mary Joseph Sam that entire team here is been speaking adamantly about tonight like it makes sense to divest those activities from then, like you.
Dude does everyone agree, Sam, you're, still, muted yeah, all right there we go so Joseph mentioned the ACT teams and that's another one of those combined units that responds and I think you know you know if we're going to be looking at a deficit which means a budget reduction, perhaps one of the things that we might want to look at is trying to at least protect or continue to study these programs that sort of soft soften the impact of having the police show up for a mental health event or for an emotionally disturbed person, perhaps without uniforms or in other ways that would try to lessen the tension in the situation when the police show up on the scene.
Okay, July, just a general comment when Rene, he put all of the points together and read them out loud, transferring the duties and reducing the overtime, and they just think I forgot that it sounds a lot like we are unhide, policing or untie police and I understand we're not trying to say that so I'm, just I, guess asking out loud how we can make that clear.
If we can out of lying about accountability, those with Joseph's comments, I think one of the articles mentioned uploading videos, certain actions to be taken so that okay I've learned that so what you're saying is you'd like additional body cams on police officers and you'd like that to be uploaded to the public and yeah.
That program wasn't working well hitting records published of cops who have records hiding guy in okay, Thank, You, Lucas hi, so I think that one thing that might be able to guide us and in this conversation, perhaps is just looking more at things like we have talked about in terms of details in their budget like in terms of overtime, I, don't know if it was one of the presenters that talked about it or if it was in the article, but about how overtime is fact factored into their pensions right into the NYPD pensions, in a way that not even other cities do and let alone other city agencies do right.
Mary I do want to point out, because I have experience working with low-income housing complexes, some of the community policing officers I think when they were added to the PD force.
Cam does not prevents people from you know, even wanting to have a conversation with the police officers.
That's awesome is that I'm sort of reiterating the position of the committee when I said that Sam yeah so I mean I think it was just a little over a week ago that the governor challenged every community in New, York State to reimagine, policing and Public, Safety and I think that's part of our charge here as well, and so you know when you, when you think about enforcement, I guess from my point of view.
You know all the better but I, don't think those decisions should be made by you know necessarily police officer thanks Sam, that's a very good point and I think in the framing of coming to our position on all of this reimagine ation of the NYPD.
This is a big ball of wax people and they're all interconnected, so it can seem overwhelming because we're talking about so many things but I think right now, if we frame our position, get our principles down and have a resolution that we can use as a touchstone as we move forward in doing all the budget requests and all of the agency requests and looking at all the different issues that come throughout the year, it'll be helpful for us overall, let me just see if anybody else has anything to say anybody else we haven't heard from Evan I, don't want to call on you untold, but I haven't heard from you.
A lot of the focus is on police right now, but they're, not the only ones who come up over the years, and you know we can talk about those things, but I think we should also be mindful of the fact that those are big structural things that are gonna, be tough to do much more than an open on or at least kind of say, look.
We think the community is focusing on this a lot and we want you know the city Grande's to know it so yeah generally on board of the statement of principles, and you know mindful of the fact that these are tough issues and aren't contained over night.
So much you'd make some good points all right with that I think the way forward is our police siren of who spearheaded tonight, Thank You Joseph.
