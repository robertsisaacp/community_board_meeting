Like the welcome you all to the regular schedule committee board five meeting here at Christ, the King high school cafeteria for those of you at home and that of watching the live streaming, we appreciate you paying attention to what's going on and we understand why you may or may not have come to the meeting.
Thank you, as you recall, board members, the at the last meeting we had a table in motion which takes president precedence, so the first order of business tonight is the table in motion on the report of the executive committee regarding the Fresh Pond road festival.
This is the last time that you're gonna hear about this, but it's a very important issue, I'm sure by now everyone's aware how hard that cures has been advocating for the containerization of waste coming from a long island to many years, the bill supporting their efforts was finally moved out of committee in the Senate for a floor vote.
We want to open at 7:00 in the morning and offer sort of quick casual counter service by day and a little more intimate setting by night, we're inspired by French, cafe and Italian bakery, which are little tapas bars in Venice, that provide a casual atmospheric environment for the enjoyment of eating and drinking, and we have a lot of experience in food and beverage.
Okay, so I know there was one question that comes up from several of our board members.
So when the DOB comes in, they look at the building in its entirety and the four businesses that are there are illegal and approved, and the alt one has been also the plans there have been approved for expansion into the basement, so you would like it to many malls so to speak, because the bolts have multiple liquor license establishments functioning molls.
I'd like to temporarily suspend the public forum to introduce our borough president Sharon Lee good evening.
But I am here because I wanted to say farewell as I promised a few months ago, when I first came before you to introduce myself to some of you or to say hello again to some of you promised that I'd be back in March and Here I am but since I have the mic in front of me, I'd like to remind you of two things and things that you already know, but I want to make sure that they're at the forefront, because there's a lot going on right now in our borough number one.
Early voting begins this Saturday thanks for that check and then March 24 is the actual special election and as we know, we don't vote you just don't matter.
I firmly believe that the future of New York is Queens, but our future is counting on being counted and that we matter and that we're visible, and so it is just critically important, fortunately had nothing to do with the Cova 19 or any other things that are before us right now.
Whether you arrived yesterday, whether you arrived yesterday or whether you're fifth generation Queens resident, everyone needs to be counted, it's census.gov, but we actually urge you to come to Queens, VP org, and so those are the two things that I wanted to put before you front and center.
We elect our borough president and they are sworn into office because they certainly won't have a lot of time before their June primary, so they're gonna want to hit the ground running, I'm sure, whoever that is March 24th through December 31st or next November.
The borough board just voted a few weeks ago on the Queen's budget priorities for fiscal year 2021, and we submitted it to the mayor and the City Council, but there are three areas in particular and I: do want to leave you with this, because these are facts and I'd like to equip you with some of the facts that we, you know, we crunched the numbers of Borough Hall trying to see.
Although you know I wouldn't put my bets on that, but we'll see how the count turns out this year, but we have only nine acute care hospitals in the borough of Queens and we are the least vetted meaning we are under bedded.
We have the least number of beds per 1000 residents here in Queens than in any other borough, and we are overburdened already by the closures of I, believe it was like four hospitals just in the last decade and so those three areas: schools, seniors hospitals and many other areas, but those are the most glaring disparities, glaring areas of us getting shortchanged relative to the rest of the areas of the city of New York.
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting our request to be here today to present I'm speaking on behalf of the company called for cable we're coming from Brooklyn and to introduce our company our mobile application platform.
We were writing to all community boards around New, York City, and actually you guys were the first to say yes and to invite us to this meeting.
So the idea what's parka bill is portable is trying to create a peer-to-peer community based mobile application for drivers in the cities like New York City, so two drivers can exchange free street parking spot between each other, so how it works is as soon as the driver finds a parking spot in the street.
So we came to the idea of the application, not by chance we're also drivers in New York City, and we know how frustrating it is how stressful it is to find a parking spot for most of the drivers.
For example, New Yorkers spent more than 100 hours a year, just in search of parking and parking in this street is also one of the major causes of traffic congestion in cities like New York, every three cars in ten cars we see in our streets, they're, not just moving or going anywhere they're just cruising around in search of parking, so helping drivers to find parking spot can also help to decrease the traffic congestion in our streets.
We also address the same issue, the Department of Transportation of the New York City, and we just some general answers and in one of the conversations over the phone, the representative of the d-o-t told us that they are not interested at the moment because they consider themselves as a revenue bringing organization revenue bringing branch.
But the reason we're here today is just to know to first of all introduce our idea we're just getting our first users early adopters of the application around New, York City, and also to find out what are the best ways to interact with the community boards.
I want to bring up with you guys- maybe you guys already know about it, but during my time there there's been like five or six incidents of illegal dumping, of just piles of wood and possibly sometimes furniture bed bedding.
So there's also the issue of a garbage and debris that collects under the vehicles that are parked on Woodbine and Palmetto Street between whooping and Palmetto, and you just can't clean it because you can't get into the cars and I assume all that dumping is because the place looks like a and abandoned lot because of all the garbage and the vehicles that don't move there are kind of contributing to it as well, because I believe there are a couple instances of abandoned vehicles there I think and then yeah it's just something.
There was a truck car there that my neighbor by googling it on Google Maps, was able to prove that it had been in the same exact spot for a complete year, so it needs cleaning and there is right across the street from me.
The next speaker is Robert Cooper, our key Barada hi good evening, distinguished community board, five members guests and chairperson I'm here referenced by Neil Seiji Gianelli, and this is in regards to residents of bridge, request, speed reduction devices on Forest Avenue between Putnam Avenue and Palmetto Street.
What I'm requesting is of the New York City Transportation Department, to start a an assessment of the traffic that is going on there?
The only objection that the last that I would say here, two three four five: was they reduced the number of days because of the construction on Metro and Fresh Pond, but naturally that's over, and that is why the community didn't see no problem with approving the fall for the street festival last year and I hope you'll do the same but years we disapprove that it still went on.
Thank you all again for coming like to introduce his staff, pressing Cathy, O'leary Laura Mulvihill, just a granted - Gary Giordano, representing the borough president, is Jonah.
Holden I'm sure you'll wait a little bit while I introduce police officers Barrish and Perez, and Sanada and Sergeant rain premium right, [Applause] good evening.
Captain will give you information answer any questions, any issues that we have going on as of late anything new by that time, April 2nd 6:30.
Yes, it's important that all of us try to get there because she expressed a concern that she would like to put the faces with the voices and the people that she speaks to she and it's very hard to do.
We remind everybody to wash your hands, cover your nose amount and to please stay home if you are sick as of earlier today, our case total was fifty three confirmed cases and I'd just like to remind everyone that is the first of this month.
Additionally, I wanted to just provide a small update to the board regarding the Wyckoff Avenue reconstruction project, which we are working with, the community board our district manager to get an update from the Department of design and construction on this project, which has been stalled for some time, so we're just working on some logistics as to when we can get all the agencies involved.
Volunteering coming out and doing your part and, like I, said last night we had the MTA workshop virus aside, people came out and in I think about 120 130 people were there and it was a very productive workshop as opposed to a presentation.
He did admit that they started off, rather poorly I would say, to put mildly, the coronavirus we had an emergency meeting again today in the council and by the way the City Council feels that we have to do a lot more.
You know they're going to switch our phones if we have to if we get to that point to our personal cell phones, which that will work too, but we need to be there in the offices to answer not only answer calls but to meet with constituents.
So just be aware, if you like, the mayor's office said if you don't have to, if you have a cold, don't go out and if you feel that you know it's, a non-essential meeting don't go, and some people feel that sporting events should be canceled because I was at the garden the other night for the Ranger game they lost.
But you know it came into my mind that there's a decent large gathering, 15,000 people or more and it's it- does cause concern that this will spread the virus even much faster.
So the City Council is talking about a lot of things, we're taking it very seriously, and we have to show leadership here and certainly my office will answer any questions, but we're trying to desperately get more testing kits and get more testing sites.
This is not a place to live or to stay or to feel comfortable, I understand that, but it doesn't have to feel like a halfway house or a jail, and it does folks it does and I'm concerned just the mentality of building this kind of facility to house 200 men.
This is a minimum security jail like I mentioned before, but another issue is going around the building department process, which I feel they definitely did, and we just mentioned a couple of other things.
No, it wasn't, and it's often and then he also mentioned something that we need a procedure with parochial schools, especially because the public schools have a safety procedure in place, the parochial schools, as we witness they really don't, and if central command, that's the people that actually send out the cars from the precinct or from the in the neighborhood here when they hear a school is involved and there's a safety concern.
Would Sacred Heart that I, don't like and I did see the video by the way that day I went into Sacred Heart and looked at the video, and that gentleman was upset at the door because he wasn't getting an answer that he thought he wanted.
No one comes directly, there's an intake process, so yeah the answer is yes, they're using it as a halfway house single most important thing: we've had to deal with as a community board in the past five years right and by the way I'm on the Criminal Justice Committee and I mentioned this a number of times in print that it was said that 40% of the individuals leaving jails go into the homeless shelter system.
Okay, quick question, Bob I understand there were residents living there, I don't know, but I'm told that there are always.
So as we move forward on that, we'll be keeping the board involved and just updated in our day-to-day and then I just want to quickly touch base on everything going on with the corona virus.
Okay, what's the question point it away from the microphone Thank You Leslie Alessi bless you Rebbe, please everyone hi everyone good evening, just really quickly from Brian's office we're having our annual breast cancer screening.
I think we have a few left for everyone that if anyone wants to call has been postponed so just spread the word you could still call and reserve one, but the dates for that and the breast cancer screening about is kind of TBD, so feel free to call our office for any questions or concerns are always happy to help.
Thank You Allison Cummings from Catherine Nolan's office, everyone I know, there's a lot going on.
It's been a very long day, so my name is Chad know from the New York State Department of Health, a Mental Hygiene I am the assigned liaison for the borough of Queens, so the entire borough is my jurisdiction.
How the New York's responding, how you can protect your community and our you know: greater city and resources.
They make you know: cats get cold, diarrhea things like that, but every so often the virus jumps shipped from an animal to a human.
So, like I said before this was this slide was updated earlier today we have 53 cases in York City.
Green card holders and family of American citizens and green card holders are allowed entry and New Yorkers, who return to who returned from China Iran, Italy, South, Korea or Japan are being asked to stay at home for 14 days, where we told them don't go to work, don't go to school, don't go outside stay home so right now the New York City is identifying people who may have been exposed to the virus.
They we investigate and we inform communities like yours and providers, so we're conducting enhanced surveillance, we're not stooping our phones or actually looking at different cases, we're also implementing federal monitoring requirements which happen to change ever so often or educating the public, we're providing guidance to health care providers, and we have good news.
So there's a lot of fake news going around like I said before, and it happens to encourage stigma against a certain population.
You know stigma and, like I said before, misinformation of rumors cause fear bullying, derogatory comments on found exclusion from work in school.
We're keeping an eye on people it's illegal to discriminate, like I, said before, if you feel that you're being harassed you to race, nation of origin or other identities, please report this to 3-1-1 and say human rights.
It's the final option, because New York City public schools serve as a shelter serve as a place where children can actually learn.
So it's like an example of let's not take things lightly when it didn't seem like much here in the beginning and I want to thank Jessica for being here from the mayor's office they've.
Given us a lot of good updates, as far as where the situation is at any point in time, so they've been right on top of this.
As far as I can see, I don't agree with the mayor with everything, but on this I think they've been very good, as has the Health, Department and I wish that nationally, we were as on the ball as we seem to be in New York City, a couple of other things on a maybe I, wouldn't say a lighter note, but maybe a more positive note.
The library committee is going to need on Monday at the Ridgewood library and the Public Safety Committee is going to meet at the board office on Monday any questions.
Remember it's a very tight area and they also have trees that they can't touch so, and it was pretty good presentation and everybody on the board liked what they saw right, yeah I think so.
We were one of our committee members who lives in that area is also going to look at some of it, but our recommendation first off was for the board to request an area wide study for that area.
Yeah I just wanted to mention one thing with the coronavirus and all that stuff everybody, a lot of organizations taking a lot of precautions and what's happening is a lot of events are being canceled and that kind of thing so I heard today that you know some of these st.
