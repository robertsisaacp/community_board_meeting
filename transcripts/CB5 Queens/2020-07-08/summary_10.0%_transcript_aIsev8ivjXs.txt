We're getting close to time 36., so we have 34 participants and, for some reason, richie's on twice lied with the ipad 8 and the phone number okay.
Yes, okay, I'm not even going to attempt to spell that sorry yeah.
So if everyone will okay, so welcome to a live, visual meeting of community board 5 queens will open with, as usual the pledge of allegiance donald.
Just gonna ask if everybody can mute themselves unless you've been okay, so, while you're doing that the first order of business tonight is a corona update and is that you che?
Yes, sir yeah, let me know when to start go: okay, all right so hi good evening, everyone!
I work for the office of external affairs and I'm glad to be able to join you today tonight once the board meeting so tonight I'll be providing some situational updates on what the city is doing, what the state's doing and so to begin I'll, be discussing numbers so globally we have more than 11.8 million reported cases.
Last month, when I spoke at this board, I say I said- maybe eight million or nine million- I don't know, but the number has gone up dramatically.
New york city lost 18, 618 people and confirmed deaths and 4 4606 probable deaths, and we currently have a 213 confirmed cases and 500 pen I mean 55 pending cases of misc, so the pending cases are retractive and were acquired after the data match.
All new yorkers should get tested for covert 19., please stay home if you're sick, only leave for essential medical care and testing or other essential errands and keep physical distance stay at least six feet away from other people and don't forget to wash your hands often with soap and water use hand sanitizer.
What is new york city's get tested day of action so today begins the campaign of we hope to get 175 000 new yorkers tested for covet 19 in a week, and the test and trace core with which is a combination of the health department and home health and hospitals is trying to have all new yorkers receive free testing for coping 19..
Personal care establishments are open, real estate, retail, which is limited to curbside or in-store pickup or drop-off, retail rental, repair, cleaning, vehicle sales leases and rentals and wholesale trade non-essential worker workers not included in phase 1, 2 or 3, are directed to work from home with phase 3.
So in order for them to be open, child care, centers must have new york city permits and attest to the following: no more than 15 children per room base, coverings for staff and children, daily health screenings, frequent cleaning and disinfection and limited sharing of items, including toys.
We will inspect programs to verify compliances and for businesses to have questions about restarting they can call the department of small businesses at 1, 800 sbs for nyc, so that's 1-800-727-4692 and as for reopening guidance, please visit ford.ny.gov, let's see what's the hot potato topic: yes, the travel advisory, so new york, new jersey and connecticut, have agreed to quarantine individuals from various states.
Yes, if I could ask a question, there's been a lot of discussion about false positives and false tet negatives on the testing.
So that's a concern that we definitely have and therefore you know with this day of action and going forward we're trying to offer you know we're offering free coping 19 testings so that new yorkers can get tested as frequently as possible if they want to okay kenny, you have a question yeah over the week I was away from upstate for the weekend and on the news up there.
They were talking about being that it's you know that we're in july and higher heat, they were saying not to leave hand sanitizer in your car because it can't explode well, anything that contains 90 percent alcohol.
As for the enforcement mechanism, I haven't received additional word on that, but per the new york state public health law.
That's why so new york state, you know, thankfully right now it has calmed down.
I do not have that information on hand, but I understand that different criteria and daycare child care providers that are looking to reopen must attest that you know they fit these requirements under penalty of law.
So that's why they're trying to keep it under a manageable number and as for like the spacing the distancing itself, I can you know, look at the guidelines and I'll give you a definite answer later on.
Okay, if not the next item of business, is a presentation by hold on I'm going to get my cell phone up a presentation regarding white cough hospital adolescent program: gary, do you know anything more about that?
So this program came about because concerned staff, members and doctors said you know in ridgewood and bushwick and the surrounding area of wyckoff hospital.
So if you know any young people who need these services or you're a member of another organization or just a concerned adult for youth, this is a really great resource to have in your back pocket to be able to bring up and to give further details.
If you don't know where wyckoff pediatrics is we're at 1411 merle avenue, that's right off the knickerbocker m train, but we will be screening virtually and I can give my phone number.
You know our program because they're sexually active or curious and they can get services through us or we reach out to other schools or community organizations, and they tell youth- and it kind of happens like that, so the youth that I'm currently working with, who are my clients?
Are you allowed to advertise in the walk-in medical centers throughout the area like city med, and I have not asked about city, med and city md, yet I could definitely ask the clinical manager about that, but I don't think there's I don't think, there's a relationship between wyckoff and those locations, yeah wyckoff someday, will be doing outreach to all of those locations and the regular doctor's offices on the queen's side.
I do I just wanted to know if there's any statistics on the homeless, shelter what's going on there, a lot of rumors where is hold on a second, let me just kathy massey you've been dealing with that you have anything to say about it.
Actually, I just got off a community advisory board meeting with 21 people regarding what goes on at cooper, rapid center and needless to say, we spent an hour on the phone and personally it was a waste of my time.
I've requested that we have another meeting in august, not wait three months, because all the problems that we brought up to them, if they're not corrected we're going to wind up with a larger problem, given schools open in september, I think that's.
The question is: what's the count right now: 100, okay and there's no program, the only programs they're doing and everything they're blaming everything on the coronavirus.
They can't do group anything and basically, whatever we brought up to them, and we questioned what programs they have basically were concerned that they were not addressing the alcohol and substance abuse issue which we've seen quite a bit of and their response to that is, they will refer people to a medical, professional, all right so for the next meeting, you'll have a full report for us yeah and give you a report at the end of this meeting.
Okay, thank you all right, yeah!
Gary richie, you had something question yes regarding if it's regarding the homeless, let's keep it to when kathy reports right now we're doing the public forum.
Census takers will begin the non-response follow-up operations starting july 16th in some parts of the country and the new york city boroughs.
Thank you all right, hikari hi good evening, yeah, okay, great vincent o'curey, tony benanti, amir eric butkowitz yeah, eric he's here, yep, I'm here bob chamelli.
Okay, I wasn't making a sound that I know.
Okay, nope, you know what's going on a monk?
Thank you, ard group llc doing business as slide bar b bq 527565, please rogna, llc 6359 farsw has notified us that they will be submitting a corporate change application to the new york state liquor authority, as the current owner is selling his business to dave goberdon.
The next item under my report is well I'm going to skip around a little bit so before I get to the elected official, I've been reviewing the outline from d-cass and the mayor's office on what needs to be done to restore full-time or and or part-time use.
I gave a report to the community board about what was going on there and I guess it wasn't in the minutes, or maybe we didn't.
I submitted it to the borough president and I think what the issue was at that time, walter after talking to her and getting that information from harry was that she was competing.
Then I was just wondering: do you know what kind of filters we're going to be able to use at the office?
So, and I don't think the average system in any facility, including a mall, can't support hepa filters right so and the governor said that was going to be a problem probably and it's my opinion that a hepa filter will not, on its own, will not present prevent disease from traveling.
Okay from the office of robert holden, hello, neighbors, community board, five members and fellow elected officials.
Social distancing, wear, masks and practice good hygiene, my office in middle village remains closed, but my staff and I gladly continue to serve our constituents every day while working from home, please do not hesitate to call 718-366-3900 or email district 30 at council.nyc.gov my office anytime, when you need assistance.
Okay, so going back to the correspondence we received from the mayor's office in d-cass, about operations remotely and during this crisis, one of the items they determined there was that if there is no regulations in our bylaws for voting remotely, we need to vote to permit that.
He accepted the nomination, as stated in the minutes from last month's meeting, and there was no opposition, so he was unanimously elected for first vice chair walter sanchez was nominated for the position.
You got the top four okay, so I would like someone to make a motion to accept the voting.
Okay, ken has his hand up peggy first motion, but I will second richie's motion that we accept the vote is transmitted by gary.
Yes, the committee: the board, has already voted on the issue.
Okay, please state what we're voting on the people that we elected?
Okay, because we couldn't, but that's what you that's, what you seconded right back, no, but the way you spoke it sounded as though we were voting on the methodology rather than the actual candidates.
Okay, so we received a statement from the mayor's office saying the annual tax lien sale is postponed until september 2020, as the city continues, its recovery from the cobot 19 pandemic property owners who are facing hardships, making their property tax payments can take advantage of several existing department of finance programs.
The administration will continue to advocate for support for borrowing authority from albany and a stimulus from washington, most notably, the budget includes 1 billion in cuts and cost shifts to the new york city police department, while maintaining patrol strength to protect the safety of all communities.
9 00 am to 5 p.m, with its full complement of team members returning to work, I am thankful that my team worked at keeping the office open throughout the pandemics so that we were able to address virus related issues such as unemployment claims, food availability and assistance for our local small businesses.
We will call you right back, thank you and be well from assembly member brian bondwell, and that's what I have as far as elected official statements, where we might as well give your report.
I think marianne latanzio is going to give a public safety report, but I'm certainly concerned about a lot of the violence that has taken place, especially with regard to the tremendous increase in shootings in the city of new york that have resulted in numerous murders.
The city numbers for crime are up dramatically in the past month, related to violent crime, and that needs to change and that's a more complicated issue than we can talk about this evening.
We also thanked all the officers of the 104th for keeping our community safe during this difficult time.
It was stated and agreed upon that no officer knows how they were going to act in a difficult situation and at times this whole decision needs to be made.
The committee voted in favor of sending a letter both to mayor de blasio and to the head of the new york city council, corey johnson, explaining why we are where we are against the funds in the police department and what is needed to is better training of police officers to dis-escalate situations.
This month after the public safety committee met, it was learned that 104th received seven new offices from the academy crime stats in the 104.
The committee must discuss fireworks being out of control both in 104th in new york city officer.
okay, homeless, shelter, resident, 7816, cooper, amy was discussed or was very stated.
Officially better stated, there are a lot of criminals who know they're going to get a slap on the wrist, which is an increase in crime.
We talked about the fact that they do allow level one and live a tool, sex offenders in the building to live there, and we questioned the fact that you know there are a lot of problems now there have been, I believe, 424 911 calls regarding the shelter and there's a percentage that are unfounded, but there were a couple of arrests, a few assault arrests and we discussed the men wandering and not social distancing, not wearing masks, and their answer is well.
Yes, that's the other, the okay, I was told we were told that they were going to move everyone into hotels.
Let's not continue with committee work, but thank you for your report.
Yes, no okay, chairman brian dooley, was not able to attend this evening's meeting.
There was also some discussion during the meeting of the mta new york city, transit steps to safety for trains, buses and commuter rail, which is a changing environment.
I don't know if the board or john or if anybody heard about the accident on 80th avenue and 62nd street saturday evening at 10 o'clock, no a vehicle driving west on 80th avenue hit the speed bump flew into the air, and that's where 80th avenue turns a little bit took out a couple cars and then rolled over three times.
If I could say something who's that fred yeah, I don't know how to raise my hand on the bottom right hand corner no, it's not there.
So it's just crazy people all right, any other committees we have to report discuss if not any old business, any new business motion to adjourn to jerry, hey walter.
