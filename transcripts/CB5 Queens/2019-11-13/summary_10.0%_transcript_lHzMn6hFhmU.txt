Welcome to the regularly scheduled meeting of community board five Queens, just a reminder and no one else will be permitted to sign it to speak under the public forum.
I added starts tonight, so we have Denise Esposito speaking to us on certain training from the New York City office of emergency management, wherever you want to be there's a microphone on the table or the one back there Donald cheese, yellow.
Every night is a different topic and we're trying to do it here in Queens, five community board, five and also in the Bronx, but we're looking to get some signups tonight just to find out more information about the program.
Cert members go out and they help their communities to prepare for emergencies, and they do that through the ready, New York program.
Everyone who lives at your address on a bill first, the data can be used to inform funding for services like fire stations, schools, clinics and representation that affect your community.
It's also used by nonprofits to inform services by businesses to create jobs and even by students for school projects, understanding how the population changes helps us shape communities across the country for the better.
Thank you thank you and crystal where I crystal is had taken my place on the census committee for the borough president since I've been a little busy I want to thank you for that.
I will thank all the participants at the next month's meeting after I have a complete total of items collected community Ward 5 is kindly extending drop-offs to their office until this Friday November, 15th I.
While it is important to hear from the community on their concerns and opinions on any given topic, the bylaws of our board meetings clearly state no cursing slander, shouting disruptions, etc.
Five members of volunteers who donate their time to serving and improving the community, Vinny and Gary are two of the most wonderful and caring men.
Thank you for your time, service, generosity and kindness that everyone on the board and the community has shown me and I present the CV 5 I brought flowers to show you how much I appreciate your kindness and your service.
My name is Danielle Rivera and I'm, a constituent of City, Council, district, 30 and I'm here this evening to advocate for City Council bill, one four, one: six, which prioritizes environmental, health and public health by addressing the needs of lessen the amount of single-use plastic waste produced by New, York City, single-use plastics, our products that are made to be used once so things like plastic cups, straws utensils and the overconsumption of these products is concerning because they often do not make it to a landfill or recycling unit and about 500 billion disposable cups are consumed annually across the country.
Plastic waste is also an issue in New York City, because our garbage is carried out on diesel trucks and these trucks drive about seven point: eight million miles each year, which impacts air pollution.
Organizing committee, so for the past two years, I and a growing group of people have been advocating for our borough to be participating along with Manhattan and Brooklyn in a citywide effort, that's called a swab, their solid waste advisory boards, they're required in the Administrative Code and Queens used to have one and it fell out of favor at a certain point when people retired and moved away.
We know that Melinda Katz is going to be leaving, and so we need everyone's support to ensure that the next borough president is on board with a swab as soon as possible.
Some of you may know that last year, I worked with Ted runs from the Myrtle Avenue bid and Bob Monahan from the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, on a project that was funded, a national grant that was funded by Enterprise Community Partners, to activate vacant storefronts in Ridgewood, in partnership with local artists.
Who'd like to see some money going to a local nonprofit to work on this issue of activating storefronts activating public spaces in collaboration with artists and community people to step up, raise your hand, talk to Bob Holden, make it known that that's an issue you care about and again I'm happy to talk with anyone about it, because it's something I still care about my life to be involved in Thanks.
Isn't it yeah so I'd like to introduce some people at a present tonight, Gary Giordano and district manager, Kathy O'leary office associate Jonah Sereno from the borough president, it's office Joe. If you step up please [Applause], hi.
Yes, during the week, they can get hours which they flip for credits, but we're also taking high school kids, who need community service hours and though they can't get to the office during the week, we're booking them at events on the weekend, and this way they can get their community service hours so either give to Geary reach out to me or Borough Hall and Happy Thanksgiving.
It was a very informative, very nice meeting where the community got to ask questions.
As a member on the Subcommittee on finance over and over in the House of Representatives, one of the things that's coming up is the CRA Community Reinvestment Act and one of the ones some of the proposals.
So what we want to do moving forward on what the members going to prioritize is that, as the regulator's continue to look at the CRA that we strengthened those requirements that banks continue to reinvest that they don't get waivers to skip that threshold.
We need to provide them with some sort of security, so those are two pieces again Happy Thanksgiving to CB 5, all the board members again phone numbers, seven, one, eight five, nine 36:58, please feel free to reach out with any questions.
So there's so many people that need text to 9 1 and for this city not to have it is ridiculous, especially when, like I said, Rockland County and many other counties around New, York State have it so apparently it's a big deal for the city to do it, and so I was on them.
You have or issues that you have, they will already have that in the computer, your address and so forth and they'll be able to not ask you a million questions which delays response, emergency response, so we're on that as the City Council, but certainly my committee, it's a top priority because I I've spoken to 9-1-1 many times during by the way member, the it was an attack at juniper, Valley Parkway back on July 4th.
I, have you know, as you've heard about great Ford and I've been at the forefront of it there and we great for it is we have a number of situations and it's not only a mess with high school if you heard, but it's some whistleblowers came to me during the summer former teachers of Nance with high school, telling us in my office that we have a number of individuals that they were actually teaches.
They still had an interview, the individuals so that I didn't like and I, went to the Queens da and now I've gone to the feds, because I think this needs actually bigger a bigger investigation because we're not only cheating, you know the students and that's a definite but we're cheating, the taxpayers and again when these students, when students go on to graduate from and it's not every student.
So we put in legislation, along with uphold the law and council member of the loan I put in legislation to double the fines, so from 100 to 200 it's a good hit and it looks like it's getting a lot of support in the City Council and we'll see when it has a hearing.
Was it November, 7th I think it was right and Gary did a great job and we had a number of individuals come down and testify and I said my staff, and we also had a member of this board, go down and review the contract and we had a couple.
Thank that we had very good turnouts, not only at the public cv5 hearing, but also at my town hall meeting at 119, PS 119 and certainly with the demonstration so I want to thank the community for coming out in force and telling the mayor that we're serious about this and smaller shelters are fine.
It is called, do Department of Information Technology, so they're in the process of converting us at the community board and anyone who is a faction ATO of weapons, try to renew your license or get a new one online, because you're not allowed to do it by paper anymore.
106 should make Avenue in Woodhaven it's a good time for people who are normally working 9:00 to 5:00 to come.
But if anybody has any issues with not great going forward or any kind of utility service being provided to them, please let me know so I do think of it as a civil right.
Once we address those issues as a city state in federal government, we can see that number decline, and so that is gonna be one of my focuses are I going to the 2020 session as a member, the Veterans Committee, to address those issues at the veterans face, so that we can start to reduce that number of the suicide rate.
So, if you're interested in seeing what we are collecting I will be leaving some flyers in the back and third I just want to wish everybody a very happy safe and warm Thanksgiving Thanks.
I know you worked with a lot of different offices, but we're also gonna have a turkey Drive.
So if anybody I think Brian mentioned last time when he was here, if you can donate a frozen turkey a few days before Thanksgiving we're accepting them until the 26th, if you could drop one off or if you know anyone, that's in need of one, please let us know we're also having a toy drive until December 20th.
Member of Noland is Allison Cummings I, don't have any announcements and I'm just sure, but thank everyone for coming out and the Assemblywoman like to wish you all happy, Thanksgiving and safe travels and we'll see you next month.
We've talked about it many times that all of the meetings around no police agency will call you asking you for money to donate, to anything so know right off the bat that that's a scam.
I know a lot of with the order and you could actually narrow down to when you want to deliver to when you're going to be home.
Okay, thank you all right, please, good evening.
Meeting on December 5th at 7 o'clock, 94 Hale Street at the church I will send out some more information to the community board into the parks committee, especially to make sure that's good for people's calendars on and that's it st.
Don't know how you say whether it's people or hits 50 to 100 are out there watching us and these meetings I think they're watching I, don't know how it works personally, but you know okay, so I we have the reminder for the Christmas holiday toy drive that goes to Ridgewood wick, so unwrap the wrap -.
The mayor's office of contracts had a hearing with regard to the proposed contract for 7816 Cooper Avenue, for it to be a homeless, shelter, residence and on the dais for the mayor's office of contracts was one man and one woman I think the woman actually worked for the mayor's office of contract services, but not in any very high capacity.
The man who was there I believe actually worked for the human resources administration or the Department of Social Services or for the department of homeless services, so he's actually chairing the meeting, not a nonpartisan person from the mayor's office of contracts, but somebody actually from the agency that is looking to contract with West had to operate.
It's the only person I saw at homeless services until I saw the lady who was going to mind me when I was looking at the contract, and this is the same guy who was chairing the meeting seemed like a real good guy, but on the opposite side of life, from where our opinion with regard to this matter, so you talk about the phox mind and the chicken coop or the equivalent thereof so anyway.
They want shelters that are much larger than most communities can cope with at a single site and, as I think Demetriou pointed out in the recommendation last month.
You know it accorded a one and hopefully not too noisily so put your stuff out the night before your collection day, just to make sure sewer projects I probably talked about in virtually every month, they're going to finally install the rest of the sewer line in 74th Street between Pleasant View, Street and juniper, Boulevard, south I think the contractor and the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of design and construction have been working out, cost estimates or what they're willing to pay for the rest of that project, some of which wasn't in the original contract, and they want to be done by the end of the year.
The first item we spoke about was the most recent enrollment numbers and capacity numbers at the public schools within the community board five area.
It's currently operating at 1775 students, we're Maspeth high school, has a capacity of 905 students and currently has almost 1200 students, we're hoping at our next meeting in early next year that the members from CEC are there, as well as someone from the superintendent's office that can speak to the data.
Members Carmen had sent an article regarding the homeless students in the New York City public school system.
You had something Bob yeah, it just got a question: did you get any input on the doing away with the gifted and talented program and I know parents want it, but there was some debate in the news and the radio about doing away with that.
You have anything to show us or no okay, so on October 16th that we had a Park Service community meeting recommendation use of capital budget funding for the Ridgewood reservoir in Highland Park, the Park Service Committee met on Monday September 16th at 6:00 p.m. at the Ridgewood reservoir at Highland Park.
At the September 16th meeting, several committee members questioned the use of such a large amount of funding, 5.3 million just to stabilize the gatehouse building and said that the funding would much better be used for improvement to the Ridgid reservoir property.
It was agreed by committee members that the community we tried to meet again soon at the Seabee office to further discuss whether recommendations should be made to the New York City Parks, Department and Recreation, stating at the 5.3 million earmarked by the parks department for stabilization of the East Gate house at the Ridgid reservoir should be used for other purposes.
The committee discussed that to our knowledge and that of New York City h2o representative in attendance, the eastern gate house, building gate house 27 has a 1,000 square foot footprint committee members unanimously voted in favor of a recommendation to request that Department of Parks and Recreation put the design stabilization of gate house 27 on hold and work with the community, CB 5 and C B for the community and elected officials to consider using the 5.3 million earmarked for the building stabilization for the following recommendation.
Don't know a couple: a couple hundred thousand dollars of the design to stabilize the building and use this money to do the causeway between 1 & 2, which would show the community that right away, we got something out of the money rather than stabilize a building for 5.3 million and we're not going to do nothing for it in another 10 years.
It was way more than 5 million Paul in actually the folks from NYC h2o kind of pushed back on that and said that they would rather look at how to do it at a more cost effective way and where they're doing things in Prospect Park in Brooklyn and there's some tests going on there that they'd like to look at, and they didn't want to see the expenditure of money in that regard.
Well, we would like to see the designs put on hold okay and use the 5.3 first for the causeway, a second to look at entrances into the pathway if it can be entrances into the one and three basins if it can be done without disturbing the nature and if there's a balance of money to be allocated to help remove the Phragmites in Basin.
You want to do that please, but from here the Transportation Services Committee met in board five office on Tuesday October 22nd.
We discussed first transport transit services issues right now, we're looking at the work that doesn't seem to be getting done on the M train structure, the repainting, which was started this summer and was supposed to be through to the end of Fresh Pond Station.
When we have our next meeting the 19th of November at 7:30 in the board office like Wyckoff Avenue, reconstruction is still in design.
I've been here 12 years and I noticed that it happens a lot the people have come here.
If the public is expected, you know when we go out, go out in public, where it's expected there's some kind of societal norms that are expected of us and as a member of this board, we sign up for this and we are served on his board, even though we're volunteers at the pleasure of the borough president and so I wanted to speak about that under the old business.
Any new business, yes pick up the microphone with the renewal of the liquor license with the abbeys bar I would recommend that the board take a look at that place at 10:00 p.m. on Friday and 10:00 p.m. on Saturdays.
There I just wanted you to take a look at that at 10:00 p.m. thank you 6:00, 81, Senate, okay, Kathy!
