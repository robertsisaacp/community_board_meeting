If you're concerned, by a positive, all possible exposure, including spending time in large crowds and explore there, someone with a confirmed or positive :, 19 or breaches and wearing a face covering or new team distancing.
If you want to find the location near you and the city is also launching mobile testing drops this week, New York City, antibody testing will reopen in July your doctor's office, City, MD or other urgent care facilities may offer antibody testing.
All New Yorkers must wear a face covering and stores can now refuse entry to individuals to not have face coverings so but people who are less than 2 years of age and people with breathing problems or another health issue that makes them unable to tolerate face covering do not need to wear a face covering that they mean to provide documentation.
Let's see as for the dressing connecting disparities, the top 10 zip codes with new : 19 hospitalizations are in communities of color in the Bronx Brooklyn and Queens, and New York City is prioritizing resources for these impacted, zip codes.
So when we find that information out I'll give that to you quick Jay, do you know any city locations as for this community for CB 5 I do not have a list of locations at hand, but let me see if I can pull it up right now.
Ok, any other questions, while he's looking at up Fred hold on hold on hold on Fred heavily first good Fred speak Fred, yeah, New, York, State DMV is engaging in limited services that are only a little drop-off starting June 1st and June 4th.
Thank you one thing: if everybody would press on participants- and it comes up on the right-hand side and on the bottom, it says raise hand if you want to speak hit.
You know word on that being that you know, we've had thousands of people when we came down from the curb now walking the street since yelling, and that can cause the disease to spread among other protesters concerning matter, especially for someone who is elderly and going to come in contact with some of these protesters and not even know it.
There was a question asked about testing, so the New York State Department of Health will test you at their locations by appointment.
Roughly within three to five days after you're tested going back to che, you had said that it's unclear whether people can contact or get Cobra a second time, and that is understandable because the virus is so knew.
What the question is now there any records kept to identify people who have gotten it twice since the outbreak, and if not, is the city prepare to monitor that so that we know whether or not it is or can be contracted a second time, I believe that HIPAA laws on hospitals and medical providers are supposed to retain this information for seven years yeah.
So they stated they retain the case information for the individual for seven years and considering that Cove in nineteen is a reportable disease, we would have information, but it would not be open to any other parties, except for the medical provider and the patient themselves and yeah.
That's all I'm, saying I, don't think it's necessary to know who had it a second time but I think it's important that we identify that and publish that information so that people all people will be concerned and take the right, the forces of social distancing and everything else.
Yes, I'm really thankful for your commentary because know no one is perfectly safe from this, and people should take all the appropriate precautions and we're trying to push the messaging out.
Who can we can't hear you must have a problem with your microphone because you're not muted, all right, we'll get back to you when you figure that out Mary Ann, a Plan, C, Oh, Mary, Ann, hello, yeah, the parts and social distancing not being enforced and, as you all know, like a plane's about juniper Valley pas about how people are on top of each other and the police.
Who is to enforce it and to how we're gonna get a handle on covert 19 if we're not enforcing social distancing in all public places in our parks, okay, I.
Currently we have 4 testing locations, unfortunately, they're closed, because it's a p.m. but they'll be open tomorrow on they have the phone number addresses and different technical details about whether they require appointments or screening, but we can definitely check that out and also per elements with the Metro.
Okay super rung present I'm here, Thank You, Fred, Heller, Fred, Haller, and up there we was there read Harper Lee I know he was there.
Okay, kinga charisma, present, Marianne, Lattanzi, Oh, ed littell, present Mike Lee and Oh John Mayer, yeah, Patricia, multicells, Cathy I, know you're there Eileen Maloney I leave was that Eileen Maloney's everybody else.
Last year, almost a year ago, today, I've got a three year old and a three month old and since 2000 20 years, I've been working for the department education right now, I work with the UFT training, new teachers and supporting them and yeah I just want to do whatever I can to make things better for everybody's kids.
So two members have elected not to renew pepper dates in hand Connie Santos, so that will eventually get you all the listings of the members and everything else and in new members, your beginning of package describing different things and asking what you're interested in and at some point in time the executive committee will appoint you to committees with that I'd like to go continue with the public forum.
G, all right, so we got something from the American Red Cross, stating the American Red Cross across the regions of New York State have developed a program in response to Cobra 19 to support individuals and families who have lost family members to death as a result of COBIT 19.
They may also include linkage to leave legal resources for state custody, immigration or other issues related to the death, and then they say the following links to an online intake form can be submitted by a family member, a friend who thinks someone needs help or an agency on behalf of the family for those without access to the needed online technology.
No, but I'm, saying I have a few things that were received today that look like they wanted to have them as part of the public forum.
Actually, when they're going to reinstitute curbside recycling or composting anything else, yeah from Kelly Mancuso owns a small salon in Ridgewood used to be a reporter for the river times, but not being able to open since Cove in nineteen she's having trouble with her landlord yeah, well I'm trying to evict her and is looking for better protection.
As far as the public forum goes, you know we do have several things from people asking for cuts to the police budget.
Okay, well, I know to the Public Safety Committee right.
Sorry, it forgot to mention that we're live-streaming and invite thank everyone who is participating, paying attention to what we're doing we trying to continue the business of the city and community board v as we go along so under the chair person to report before I, introduce some people what and board members what about the minutes.
Jordano, do you want to read the elected official statement, so you want me to do that, starting with the statement announcements from the mayor's office, great New, York City care will be expanding to Queens four months ahead of schedule.
First, on June 18th, our office will be partnering with and yl AG I don't have the flier so I'm, not sure who, that is legal assistance group, or something like that Yeah right to provide free legal consultation over the phone.
Okay, I think it's the last one councilmember hold right: councilmember Holden, and this is signed by the councilmember, hello, neighbors community board, five members and fellow elected officials.
I know last time it was like 47% and we go further I, don't think it's much better!
The response in Queens and in portions of the board five area has been below 50%: okay, Fred Halla, Fred aller, yes, up, Fred I got it.
Reaching your hand is up yes, I, just like to say, I've been saying for the last few meetings that we're going to lose two congressional seats and I have a friend who just got a job with a moving company.
March is the reconstruction of the turf soccer field, slash football field and the running track at juniper, Valley Park, so I did some inquiring and Dennis Stefan was good enough to keep after me about this, and the response I got today from the Queen's team leader for capital projects is that they're saying that the parks department will likely be pushing the order to work date.
Apparently, they've got a couple of projects that construction has continued on if, for some reason they were deemed emergency projects, I don't know how many I think seven and then, as far as the local sewer projects goes, one of the board members said I think it was Walter.
Five area is on calamus Avenue, which is our border with Woodside and boy too, and it's not too much of it is on calamus from like 69th Street, -, 7, th, Street and then they're going up, 7 th Street, with a very big new sewer line, some of which is going to be micro, tunneled up to 60 feet down, I believe at least, and it's going to go along 70th Street into 71st Street to the Li e they're moving along quite well with that project put in a new sewer line and calamus and/or this week are working on that and they need to make a very big connection along 69th Street to go from calamus Avenue into Queens Boulevard, so that projects moving along real good beef, water, main project and Troutman Street and surrounding streets in Ridgewood.
Yes, very I know he lives up on today and I just wanted to ask you: is there anything that you can do to push the opening of the turf fields that Maurice, because we've been close, that just increases about the volume of people at the other parks like tonight running field is Walton Roy well, I have a question that I thought all the box of clothes.
Yes, okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna, take myself out of you, because I have notes and I don't want to be rude and not and look out while talking to you so give me a second to stop the video wait.
As you know, we went into phase one beginning Monday and we were in the office today, because Gary also mentioned we got ten and mass delivered to us on Friday we've already doled out about 2,000 about half a tows actually came from other businesses since we're on a list.
Think restaurants, like stomp fish, the diner unbend it e-square, the restaurants on 71st, Plaza and even TRO and John's across the street, should be allowed to use parts of that Plaza for their exclusive seating and I sort of got the impression that and I had conversations with d-o-t and they told me they are on board with this and there they're going to be flexible about this, because I think it's very important to help our restaurants in this regard.
You know: we've worked for the last 15 20 years to get rid of roll-down gates and to open up our commercial districts as not only Ridgewood and our board, but citywide I fear that something like this might, you know backtrack and that we're gonna have a we're.
Gonna have people wanting to keep their golden rules on gates, although there is that city rule that past five years ago that when you put a new gate up, it has to be 75 percent, lattice and clear so I think that's basically it we're looking forward to phase two and we're looking forward to you know getting out of this mess that we're in and coming into some kind of normalcy.
So I'm gonna put myself back in if, as anybody wants to have any questions or have issues Paul, but one more thing during this time, Department of small business services engaged many of the bids into what we may do.
Okay, all right, Richard I, just like to say yeah for this interim I, agree with Kathy, but let us not get a get into this idea of everything being virtual, because having a true face-to-face conversation and having the control of a live in presence meeting is the best way to discuss these issues so that, once this whole blue flu thing is over, that we can get back to normalcy of having those who are show up for the community board meeting.
Well, okay, anything else, yeah you gotta push the button to raise your hand, look at what button I mean by it, so just to finalize some more thoughts about what I said.
The area will look like and how many businesses we may lose I mean there's already chains that are filed for bankruptcy, major chains in the in the country, that file for bankruptcy, and we may lose a lot of our mom-and-pop stores and we need to help them because they are the backbone of our neighborhoods and of the economic climate that we have thanks anyway.
Okay, so are there any other nominations for chairperson of community board five Queens going once going twice: Peggy, okay, now secretary?
If there are no other nominations and you accepted yeah, then you are once again the chairperson, so I want to clap for you all right so for first person for first vice chairperson, the incumbent is Walter.
Are there any other nominees for first vice chairperson of community board five Queens any other nominees for first vice chair going once going twice, Peggy okay secretary cast one vote to elect Walter Sanchez.
Are there any other nominations for the position of second buy share of Community Board five Queens going once going twice.
Five Queens Doan, once going twice Peggy secretary cast one vote to elect Kathryn Mathias treasurer of community board five Thank You Peggy Cathy.

Are there any other nominations for the position of Secretary of Community Board five Queens going once going twice: Peggy Secretary cast one vote to elect Margaret O'kane secretary of community board: five: okay, double Thank, You, Peggy, okay.
5 god bless her she's gone through a lot and she did a lot for the community for a lot of years, so she's resigned and the other current, never large person or executive committee member for board five Queens is John.
So we have four member at large positions and as of the meeting last month, six people had been nominated, including Patricia Grayson, so Ted rands was nominated to serve another year term.
As an at-large executive committee member, he accepted the nomination at last month's meeting.
I, don't think we're gonna, do it by paper ballot as anymore nominations, Gary I'm going to say that now are there any other nominees for large positions on the executive committee of community board five, any other nominations ken has his hand up Gary.
So we are the governing body so to speak, of the community board and everyone has an equal vote in equal participation at the executive committee meetings at lodge is just the goal of that lodge was to have someone representing every part every part of the district, so we have Glendale middle village, Maspeth Ridgewood.
We would hope that when the election occurs, that its people are voted by and there's equal representation from all the areas of the district, so that at the executive committee there's fair judgment and meeting and decisions made, the me chair has a Santa.
G. Okay, so are there any other nominations for Executive Committee at large positions of the community board?
Is John Mayer I'd like to ask if Mary Ann, Lattanzi Oh would be willing to be a member at large I would like to recommend that she is nominated, but I don't want to do that without her and she would need to accept I, don't know if she'd like to do that or not Marianna at unmute.
Speak up, I did too Mendel, Edgar I think he's on the phone Edgar he accepted Vinnie, yes, yeah are there any other nominations for at-large position on the executive committee going once going twice Peggy the nominations explain hold on Walter has his hand up yeah.
Here's what we spoke about yeah you wanted them to be mailed to everyone correct and that would have to return it by mail or in person to the board office.
our Curie, if you want to go from there yeah, so they we will send out and it's actually it's going to be one ballot, because all the others were nominated but you'll have to sign for those anyway, we always have this signature, so we'll send out the ballot, those that were elected by acclamation and the six nominees for four positions.
We would expect you to fill it out and turn it around immediately, either by mail or delivery to the office mailbox in case no one's there still and that we would do the tabulation and if we have to have another vote because of ties or things like that, we'll follow up with that, so that we will then announce some time before or at the July meeting the results of the election to suggest that we email the ballots, because the mail is very I me email, the balance to us and let us print them out and fill them out.
That's going to take a lot of time, because you know people who are not getting mail, I agree, but I can't print anything here.
Okay and Richard I just like to say it's kind of tough, because now that we have eight candidates, looking for four positions, I remember in years past, where we've had to go through, probably six or eight ballots till we had a 51% for the four open position, so yeah I agree that we should get email and that I would thank the board for staying on top of this to try and get this resolved before our next meeting.
Okay hold on hold on I'll call the Eric yeah just stop because I know what everyone's talking about potential free email I just wanted to bring up.
Moving for you, I know, I, wouldn't wait for the next board meeting and I would do this as soon as possible start the voting you send the email out, get it back, we'll try to get to you.
Okay, thank you here we go yeah!
Gary I did I, don't know if I have it real handy I'll tell you what I, so you see that everything's boarded up over there or barricaded along Metropolitan Avenue and still from what I'm gathering they're putting in new sidewalks and they are going to put in at least two garages I believe they I think they've taken down the canopy where the entrance was for the pedestrians and I'm still quite sure, but I'm.
Is there a second thank you Tony, all in favor, okay, again we'll try and keep everyone informed and get the balance out as quickly as possible.
