I've written on visible neighbors I speak on a weekly basis at public meetings and Arthur talks to advocate for the homeless and educate thousands of people in the community on common misconceptions of homelessness, which keep us divided.
I am continuing to work to alleviate the community's concerns so that we can work together to help our less fortunate neighbors catering for the homeless has provided services and education for most 100,000 people throughout Queens in New, York City in the past three years this year, I project that catering for the homeless will serve a hundred to two hundred thousand people in September of 2017 Senator Joseph Addabbo passed a food law that all schools from the pre-k to the university level must donate their food access to organizations like mine who can distribute it to those in need.
Each year, my goal is to feed millions of people every year and end hunger by utilizing what we have been wasting for those who have not I'm the author of several books in different genres, and my latest slaver of love will be released on February 14th in the origin of time.
Lamp is elected official arrow in the mid to end of 1990s I, along with other community members advocated for greater entry, Youth Council in support of funding for after-school programs.
I then, in 2001 brought the parents concerns to all elected officials and Bob Monaghan director of gry, see that was almost 20 years ago in December 2019 CB, v Portland meeting I provided a copy of New York state controllers and a police order regarding their findings of the UIC d and g ry c New York State Controller DiNapoli's findings were very disturbing and scathing.
After sharing copies of New York state controllers in our Police June 2019, ordered at the December 2019 CB 5, but monthly board meeting I have been slandered as well as my family.
Monahan has emailed elected officials slandering and defaming my son, then stating that I was retaliating for the wrongful termination of my son when employed at GL YC in 2017, which, by the way, no final time she was provided at that time in 2017, either by Jerry wisely to my son, know that, mr.
Let me say it again: it's a distraction to take the focus away from the 2019 ordered by New York State Controller DiNapoli's office, which, by the way, I did not write.
The next speaker is Tony D Piazza good evening to all, and thank you again for considering our annual street vessel just for the benefit, maybe of the new ones.
The festival has been important because, thanks to your support, we were able to reopen the federal sea only office which provides assistance to the seniors and would like to continue to do that.
It's a way to bring the whole community together, but also show that the people outside the community that come to the festival, what Fresh Pond Road has to offer, and certainly in that way, not only help the community to help the Federation but I help the store owners, because last year was a highly successful again with no incidents.
We got a letter from the 100 4th precinct, which was sent to the community assistance office, supporting the festival again, stating that there were zero incidents in the last year's festival.
So I beg you again to please approve it and let's continue a 25 year old tradition and bring the whole community together and not breaking apart, like some people would like it to happen.
Some of the board members know me: I also volunteer up at Europa Park as it relates to the festival and what it means to the people in the community.
Just recently I was with the Monsignor a lady, miraculous medal, and we have we have a church gathering there and we also do an international food line, and one of the things he said to me and I quote- is bringing people together through activities and festivities only makes a community stronger.
But thank you so much and please consider what a great festival that is, for the whole community [Applause] we'll try to give you the same attention you gave the last speaker.
The railroad is in the way the people who come to the festival there's no of no applause at the festival, but they feel free to use traffic avenue as a vomitorium and peace walk and garbage them and to park in all our driveways.
Thank you good evening, I'm speaking as a member of the board of cures, civics United for railroad environmental solutions.
As you know, a couple months ago, one of our fellow board members here, Brian Julie, came to you with an issue we are still advocating for that in New York state legislature.
It did not get out of the assembly committee this year, Assemblyman Brian Barnwell has submitted it again, reintroduced it and is working with some of our fellow assembly members.
Bur good evening, everybody Ritchie, you burp, a member of this great board: hey how's, that bail reform thing working out for everyone under New York's justice reform prosecutors have to hand over all evidence to criminals in 15 days or its gets dismissed, including names addresses in contact in for victims and witnesses.
We thank you for your support for a new capital improvement project from Myrtle Avenue in Ridgewood, which was community board fives number five priority for FY 2011 ooh in Ridgewood, between Wyckoff and palmetto and Fresh Pond Road, was included in a major capital project was 1983 1984.
Most of you know that our family business is there in this community 71 years, I now teach automotive technology at CUNY in Bronx, Community College, which is the only automotive program offered by CUNY I'm here tonight, to inform everybody that we're running out of mechanics rapidly and when we run out of mechanics everything's gonna stop working, we'll have no cars, no trains, no buses, no way to get around and no lights.
Several articles that I sent over that the board office today, promoting especially automotive education as really a very good career for young people to get into they can get high-paying jobs.
Most of my friends that own shops are paying people one two three thousand dollars a week to fix cars and it's a career that somebody can get into with just one or two years of training.
So just keep in mind anybody in your family, any friends, relatives young people that need to decide if what kind of career they want to have look into the Technical Trades.
That's committee work though, so it's going to say everything I say is committee work, but that's a dangerous piece, especially on the Americans with disability, I'm, just going to say that we'll turn this over to the commit land-use services committee for review, we usually don't get too much involved in a landmark area, but for everyone that doesn't know a large portion of ridgewood who was called the landmark receive landmark designation and most of this dupes are brown stones and many of the alterations have been changing them by adding granite stainless steel.
No ok, so the committee reviewed it and recommends not approving the Fresh Pond Road street festival, as presented on the question.
Unfortunately, in order to comment on this, I need to know and I understand that there were five presentations for accepted, and only this one rejected and the basis of the rejection, the length of the all the others are one-day festivals, understood.
There was also the no votes were concerned that not all of the paperwork that the board has asked for has been submitted to the board, as the other events have done, with full expense reports, full accounting for the money, we're just very much given brief numbers, but not any official documents.
Okay, so do you think that it would make a difference to the committee if it was four days like it shows here?
I, don't think we're supposed to be doing that kind of work here, all right, I'm, just I'm just concerned okay, that was the committee's now.
The board could take a position for against whatever our visit, the committee reported we're not going to redo committee work at this meeting.

Sorry, just don't let no one on no one in and to avoid anybody coming in period, try to answer it over the phone or email or the question here.
So things like this after 5 o'clock is nice for members of the community to go talk to him directly when he's here in the district, - Ritchie's point earlier, my boss, let me know just a couple minutes before that the state Senate is working currently on bail reform.
This budget problem that we encountered last year, but you know we had to pass a budget in order to make sure that our senior centers and our schools and our veterans make sure that they got the funding from the state.
So it's time now to fix that problem and we're working on it so just wanted to pass that along and just so.
So, there's more in here, aside from that, just want to wish everybody a good night and as always a few questions or concerns, you know where to find us Thanks.
So we want to keep having people take advantage of the things that they qualify for under the city and state, as I announced last time.
So, if you know anybody that needs to fulfill service hours, please send them our way or if you want to donate PB&J, that'd be great too and lastly, brian is working on scheduling and that's Pat's Mt meeting I know there's one on the 9th of March which councilman Holden's office has been helping with as well we're trying to get ones all across our district and Woodside and asketh.
Otherwise we have mobile district office hours scheduled for the Ridgewood library on Thursday March 19th, that's from noon to 2:00 p.m. if you'd, like a flower I can send it over to you and I'm gonna leave some with the board.
Thank you for letting people know what we do: Jenny Gomez from Queens College.
It doesn't even address the issues we brought up, so we have filed a notice of appeal on that and the second group going before BSA the letter to revoke is based on the objections that have been filed and we're expecting in another 20 days to be in front of the board of standard at appeal, and there has been an audit on the property and requested on the property next door where that artistic stitches, so we're hoping that these things start to fall in place, and maybe there's a possibility that we can delay these projects at least get them legal, because they're not and that's all I can tell you at this point question without a contract.
Therefore, we recommend and reinforce that no heavy equipment be used for any reason in a basin one in three for the contract to remove invasive species, this contract states, no heavy equipment, will be used in the basin, but we need to reinforce the board's position on this very important contract like to make a motion for a vote on this place.
Public Safety Committee met on Wednesday January 22nd at the community board office meeting came to order at 7:35 p.m. only police officer.
The first ended times in the street in the hundred and fourth was discussed police officers and agitated that there are two companies that are doing roto within one hundred and fourth Precinct.
A police officer tonight stated that in the past month, in the Liberty Park area of Glendale, one hundred and fourth Precinct officers were allowed.
The concern about the new bail reform was addressed and police officer sanad stated that since the bail reform just went into effect in January 2020, it is too soon to tell if there has been a crime increasing.
Yes, my neighbor had documented proof that a car was parked on traffic avenue for over a year because she would Google Street and from the year previous, and it was in the exact same position: we've been working with go Holden's office.
We were told last year that they would hopefully get to the northern end just at the part of the system that ends after the Fresh Pond Road station, where it becomes a grade level would be painted all the way down towards Seneca and that they would be moving down by the end of the summer fall time into Brooklyn, and at this point, there's been so much structural steel work that the painting has really only happened under the forest Avenue Station.
We're gonna have our next meeting in this space here at the last Tuesday of February, and it's going to start at 6:30 and it will involve the bus redesign people from the MTA presenting and getting our feedback.
Work as well, but next month might be for the committee members a slightly longer meeting if we do get to our usual street safety improvements, the other things we just reviewed, the normal capital projects, our biggest advocate in the city, I, would say, and possibly in the state for the Myrtle Avenue improve moral Avenue.
The last thing, I'd like to say is: if you have recommendations for roadway resurfacing, please write them into the board, get them in, because we want to compile a list in a timely fashion to get that to do T.
So we can get on the calendar for the year, like I, said the next meeting, 6:30 Christ, the King cafeteria on Tuesday, February, 25th, I, believe yep.
Sorry I like to ask councilmember and also to give us an update report on the next meeting on Wyckoff Avenue reconstruction, because, as John said, we can't get any answers and it's seven or eight years now.
