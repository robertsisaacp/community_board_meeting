So the first order of business tonight is a presentation regarding composting and trash, and we have a leguminous the outreach coordinator for the Bureau of recycling and sustainability for New York City Department of Sanitation Allie.
We want everybody who has one- that's still sitting in their back yard, untouched to investigate a little bit and start setting it out with their neighbors, and we want to make sure everybody in this district knows that you can put meat bones.
At the end of the day, you'll need somebody like a building manager, a superintendent, a board member somebody with decision-making capabilities to sign off on it, but anyone even a resident can make their initial request we'll reach out to whatever contact information you give us we'll conduct a site visit, determine how many bins you need anywhere from 2 to 100 if need be, and then we'll get you added to a row and you'll be good to go composting with the rest of your district.
We want contacts, we want to be doing more cleanups, we want to be doing more streets, we care events where we remove litter and apply compost, teach residents how to apply compost, because it's one thing to say: put the material in the brown bin and it's another to show you what it looks like a few months later with what you've done, because you made the choice to separate it.
Rakes come spring, we'll be doing the same thing in parks all over the place, we'll be doing part cleanups same thing, removing litter, taking care of those trees and applying compost, and we also do really fun events because we're trying to make sure that people are as interested in what we're doing.
We also do compost happy hours where you'll be able to talk and chat with people about our work about other people in the field and about some of the issues you might be having with your Brown bins and if you're interested in volunteering but you're not quite sure, you're capable we've been doing major volunteer trainings, we offer them in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and even Manhattan.
If you work in Manhattan and can't make it to some of our Queens based events that start at 6:00, so we are really trying to reach as many people as possible we're trying to teach you how to answer pretty common questions that we get.
Single-Use, like you, get at the grocery store and a garbage pail liner and that's a concern people have is what are we gonna put our waste in, so you will still be able to purchase those thick plastic liners at a grocery store that are intentionally made for garbage the clear ones that you put your recycling in the black ones that you put your refuse in those will still be available for purchase and then whatever stores you're currently buying them in this mainly targets supermarkets and other large retail stores that are giving you a single-use bag.
We have a commercial team with about a dozen people who does a lot of outreach at major chains and smaller stores, as well all over the city, making sure that this message is getting out there and then it would be on the store themselves to advertise that, in fact, on the train ride today, I saw a Subway ad about it.
We are in the process of reaching out to elected officials, community boards to start distributing those bags, along with this flyer, to make sure that everybody knows they're, not just getting a free bag they're getting something that they should and could use at.
Yes, I just want to know if that orange thing lists all the things that you could put in the year and those brown pills that I have that I never use these stickers do have good telling of meat bones dairy.
That's the dream: it works, yeah, there's still those green bags, so you can line your brown bin with a plastic clear liner, the same you use for recycling.
We've got plenty of stuff to give out new recycling stickers if your bin is looking a little grungy and information if you live in apartment building, so please follow up with us.
Yes, everybody I was in a meeting last month and they were talking about the census and they told me it'd, be a good idea to speak to you guys about the census and give you some bulletins about it, because it's coming up very soon.
When you could get this data, some people pay for this data, but they don't realize you could actually get it from the Census Bureau, and this data can be important if you open up a new business is something like that.
So you know you want federal funds when you have the population here, a lot of populations are going to be afraid to actually do the census.
They actually got pictures of houses and streets and again they're having people right now go out and actually check these things.
If you devote this much time it's, this is really a labor of love and so I really respect all the work that you do and I'm eager to learn from you and hear about the issues of concern and let you know that I'm always here eager to work with you, I, have read the annual report with great interest that the board has put out and I follow all your committee reports and I so respect the level of detail, granular, detail and expertise that you have on all these issues.
I know there are so many issues tonight, so I don't really want to take up much time, but I just wanted to introduce myself I look forward to hearing what everyone says and please come talk to me if you're interested in working on issues or sharing information and I'm gonna leave my Flyers here so that if you want to get in touch, you can do that.
The next speaker is John Ortiz I could evening everybody happy new year, I'm the owner of sundown, Barn, Forest Avenue in catalpa and I'm here to answer any concerns and questions regarding our expansions with the cellar space I have all our gob approved plans and I'll be in the back table to address any of that.
We are also recruiting heavily right now for field operations, and if anyone is interested or knows, anyone who might be interested I have a lot of people that come to me and just ask you know what I have a full-time job, but I just want to do something to help out with the census and I.
So the store is losing money and it's costing them employee time and energy, so what they even participate- I'm, not totally sure about that, but from my understanding, the two cents from it are going back to buying those bags for the stores.
Okay, so we'll leave that aside, and so they get nothing for handling the bags, putting them out collecting the money and sending it back to the city and state I'm, not sure about that I, don't think it's gonna work.
We just asked that if you could educate your friends and family, if you don't know the number don't pick up the phone, if it's the IRS they're not going to contact us me for money that way, Social Security will only contact you by the mail, if you're not sure, and you want a double check- don't pull the number that they're leaving you on your voicemail go down in person and talk to them in person.
Gonna continue to push forward the new concerns that she's hearing from some of the advocates from community members on the subcommittee and if there's any updates as to what the final plan is and what the final reforms will be.
All, of course share that with the board, either through an email through an announcement or here in hearing at the at the community board meeting, but other than that again happy New Year to everyone we're located over at 260 Broadway phone number is seven one, eight, six, four five one, four nine!
Now that we're rolling back in I just wanted to let you know there were 400 bills passed in the House of Representatives 275 of those were bipartisan support, so that's good.
That's it for me, Happy New, Year again and have a great night thank you representing councilmember, Bob, Holden and charlief of risk.
Although the councilmember Holden wanted me to tell all of you that there's going to be a street renaming for Jack Horan's on 82nd Avenue and Myrtle Avenue, this Saturday January 11th at 2 p.m. and everybody is invited to attend that the councilmember also wanted me to tell you that he's looked at a bus plan redesign and he feels that on committee is lost time to many buses and he's upset also that they're not coming to Maspeth or middle village for a meeting with the community about these loss of transportation, and if the bus plan stays the way it is right now and they don't make any changes.
If you guys have any questions, comments or concerns about any legislation that might be up in Albany, this coming session feel free to contact my office I can give you my phone number, it's seven, one, eight four, nine seven one, six, three zero other than that I'll be hanging out in the back for a while.
First of all, Brian and myself, our entire office wants to wish everybody a happy, a safe and prosperous new year, as always feel free to reach out to us with any questions or concerns about anything.
So if you want to come volunteer and help make food for the needy, or if you have anyone that you know that needs to fulfill any service hours from school or in general, we always have service projects so helping shovel snow for seniors, we're often out till 6 a.m. which is the three of us, so send anyone our way and we're wrapping up the coatrack that we were having.
First of all, just want to wish you all Happy New Year session did start today.
Thank you very much happy New, Year and I look forward to speaking and working with you second I'd like to present you with an official community board five lapel pin [Applause] for the record.
All right so don't shoot the messenger here, but I resent it the board at the borough board meeting last week and they went over primarily the plan that the MTA and the d-o-t, the new bus network, the redesign and the narrative they'd like us to use, and it took a tip a little while for us to get used to it.
They feel that will and bus is not really going down side streets that might not have meant for buses like J Avenue.
The tabletop exercises to provide input, we're having a meeting here, we're the first meeting and that's at the greater in Youth Council on January 21st from 6 to 8 p.m. and our committee will be there, our transportation committee, but there we could make comments and look at it and see what we think, but the idea is to get to the Train the subways faster, whether it's the there's a route, there's an express bus route that goes up to the Bronx up to the Bronx Zoo. That's very is supposed to save 10 minutes from what it what it was now.
That's out good thing that it's no longer going through yeah Atlas, which was a waste of time.
You know simple things that can be done: I understand that they don't want to stop every block, but we have buses express buses blowing by Glendale coming from Howard Beach, which, if they just add, stopped at Metropolitan and Woodhaven for the 16 like think the 17, the 18 they all come down.
What we got from it is that I think the community board's recommendations are going to be very important to this process and they took us seriously.
But you got to really talk about like specific lines, with the new terminology when you're giving them feedback and for the next two months, they're going to be looking at these workshops and then they're gonna come back with a final draft, which will then take some more feedback.
My office, you could you know, people are shooting bus line, concerns into me, making sure it's in front of them.
It is a longer process, it is a draft and there will be they will be taking a lot of input so, but I wanted you guys to know that the electives are in and involved very early on again.
You know gave me no choice that pushed me back in a car, so I really would like to see this work, and so the cars are off the street and we are able to take a bus or a train and what I see happening right now.
One of the things that we really do need to look at is speeding buses up to make them more desirable and one of the that those points is kind of repositioning the stops which I think they very well addressed.
Okay, so we have to advise them right now, we're doing committee work again things we need to hear from every okay, so little business and we didn't take care of the minutes.
Negative I had an MRI and it's showing some damage so I'm wearing a full cam boot for the next three weeks, I'm three weeks in so maybe you go a lot slower when you're in this thing, so you have to kind of try to stay off your feet and for most of you, as you may realize, easier said than done so I'm, hopefully I'm healing, okay, so happy New Year to all of you.
As far as our budget goes for this year, you know we got an extra forty, two thousand five hundred dollars from the city council and we can't use it to hire regular staff and we can't use it to give staff increases.
Not only do I want to focus on you know, respect and respect for women, but also respect for the environment and I, see too much of an influence in media with regard to promoting bad behavior and there's things I, don't even see so if this gets approved, I would like to implement it in that I ran into a lot of bureaucracy.
Last year you know previously we had used board money for a graffiti removal program and it was very successful, but a damper was put on that as far as the bureaucracy of it goes.
We might be able to get one for less, but we want something: that's going to last a good amount of time, because we have no assurance that we'll get this money.
So the point is a lot of community boys are having difficulty figuring out how to spend the money without just buying more things that they really don't need.
We had a lot of work done in the streets this year.
Just gonna see construction all over the city and you know a lot of money's being poured into New York.
Think that can be an OK thing and I think that can be a real problem, but the economy here is doing quite well and that's why we're able to you know see a lot of these improvements so right now we have another big sewer project in Kalymnos Avenue, going up 70th Street for the Li II.
Any questions yeah how even more important as house flooding is right because a lot of people's basements.
So that's one thing: I wanted to speak to the 1:04 about and I know.
We were Bandidos on the street at six o'clock in the mornin painting, whatever we pleased essentially yeah, whether you liked it or not, so we were in counting, you know what I mean.
What are they gonna say my building was tagged and then the report gets where I don't know.
Tell you what, if you don't report it I know the police are not gonna.
So that's little things and we see more and more of that every day you make me feel better now, okay, so we could talk forever, but do we have any committee reports?
Everyone knows if you read carefully: everybody understands what went on and I think Jerry's respect, Gary's respect, we have to respect each other, and if we have something to discuss- and you can't reach that person or organization, we would be most happy to be the intermediary or, as he used to say in the old movies, the interlock I could be the interlock okay, so anything else to come before us any old business.
