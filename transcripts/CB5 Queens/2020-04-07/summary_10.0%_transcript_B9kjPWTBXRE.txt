So what's going on right now, this : 19 situation is it's taken, I mean it was like this in March -, but it has become more serious, - point where we have instituted several measures so right now there is a white spot community transmission in New, York, City, all New Yorkers, who do not work - essential services should remain home.
These terms expire on March 31st, will continue serving for an additional 60 days and it's pursuant to the New York City Charter I gave Vinny and Gary and Laura the numbers in case.
Okay, do you want to the control statement before being let out of jail, because we because of the violence and I guess, for other reasons, councilmember Holden said last month at the meeting that something like forty percent of those who are released from jail if I recall correctly wind up in the shelter system?
Our response and relief efforts must consider impacts of these widening divisions, which is why I think it is so important for the city to fully assess the role played by races and ethnicity in this outbreak.
Okay, so congresswoman Maine puts forth good evening, CD 5, dear community board members and staff, congresswoman mang and her team hope you and your families are all healthy and well.

Lastly, I've attached a few of our guides that we've been circulating with constituents to help better explain, programs and resources available for those experiencing hardship due to cold in nineteen and there's a resource list is information regarding senior meals, New York, City, Department of Education grab-and-go meal service, other food assistance, small business and employee resources application.
He told us he told me basically approximately you know how much staff were out at any one time without getting too specific and those foster workers had to work real hard to make up the fact that others were out sick and we're working much longer shifts.
Hopefully, those problems Vinny brought to my attention that some of those problems started when some of the senior citizens who do not get direct deposit were expecting their Social Security check toward the end of March, so those postal workers and a lot of these other essential workers really had their work cut out for them and I tried to thank them in some correspondence that I think I sent to you when we sent you the meeting notice, but everyone from god bless those health care workers who were working those very long shifts in those very dangerous conditions.
The sanitation workers have done a yeoman's job, picking everything up it's the first time, I've seen them with masks on the police department, the fire department, the food service workers, the people in the grocery stores of the supermarket's, who are making sure that we have provisions and in the pharmacies so I'm thankful to all of them, and then some of the Transit Authority workers I spoke to Lucille Songhai.
Ok, community, particularly restaurants, and the pharmacies and special service place instead of remained open, and we should do all we can to support these businesses and, when I know, Patricia's on the line and she's doing good work at touchin square and rolls on all my big colleagues and in the city so we'll get through this and hopefully be stronger people.
When you go to the butcher store shopping locally, because when I try to go to Gaspar the butcher, the line is around the corner, and if you go to some days, you have to wait outside to get in Wow. Anybody expressed concern will not recover and come back in with now over six million nationwide out of work that when with relief, that's some of these places and some of these businesses realistic need, are not going to recover and come back.
The big concern in New York City as a whole, is that we have I believe it's six hundred thousand service type businesses, restaurants, grocery stores, bars places like that they're trying to stay alive by it's like a forty five percent failure.
