You have a microphone John where you need one okay, so I'm gonna turn the meeting over to the co-chairs of the public transit services committee and you could watch us work.
I know, personally, a lot of my natural use of the bus routes and Queens are turning from a one seat: ride into a multi seat.
Ride I think you've also heard some elements of being a little too trained specific, getting buses just kind of staying on grid, getting people to trains, but that's not the way buses have historically been used in Queens, but in that let's hear what you guys have to say about the plan.
My name is Howie Lavine I'm from New York, City, Transit government, community relations department here to talk about the Queen's bus Network redesigned tonight.
You know what works, what people like, and also what people don't like in this plan and that's what we're here tonight to get so with that I'll start the presentation and I'm joined tonight by Eric and durian members of our bus planning team, as well as Kate from government relations and who is right there.
So this process began in May with public outreach, we did open houses asking people what they liked, what they didn't like about bus routes in Queens.
We have a number of those throughout the borough, there's a picture of one right up there and we combined from what we heard there and a lot of data into the existing conditions report, which was released in September, which was kind of where we laid out exactly what was what we were seeing with the bus network in Queens.
We were at over 60 different meetings throughout the borough, looking into different public input, whether that's workshops or presentations like this one, we've been doing that now we're doing that in the coming months.
So like how I said my name's Eric bird I'm on the planning team for both the Queen's Network redesigned and also the Brooklyn redesign, we got both of those going on at the same time right now, so how he gave a brief mention about all of our outreach that we've done so far and really with the initial part of our outreach, the open houses that we held back previous of last year.
This is just a stage in the process, so this is really introducing people to what this new network could look like and really trying to walk people through that.
It has to wait to make a left turn and things like that all cascades throughout the network, and it really makes our buses unreliable and it slows down your trip as well.
Now this is really sort of a balance, because a lot of people obviously rely on a stop, that's right near to them, and that's great, but also the more steps that you have along a route.
Generators like colleges and universities really tried to make sure that we were beefing up frequency to key locations like that and, like I, said, providing new connections to Brooklyn and Queens.
It's a tangled mess, I think somebody referred to as dumping a bowl of spaghetti on the ground and that's essentially what the best network looks like right now.
Another limitation, the network right now, is that most of the routes go to the same three places: they go to downtown flushing, downtown Jamaica and Long Island City, the Queens Plaza area.
So we want to make sure that we're providing access not just to those three areas, because we know that people are trying to get to many different destinations throughout the borough.
Another thing that just touched down was the bus stops making sure that they're the correct distance to provide the access and also speed up trips where possible.
So the first thing is simplifying that network and really providing that reliable service by having these routes that are as straight as possible, so they're not getting caught in traffic they're, not getting caught congestion, they're just able to stay in a straight line and move as reliably as possible and then another way to help speed up those trips like I talked about is the balanced bus stops fewer turns and also working with our folks at d-o-t to implement better bus priority throughout the borough as well, and then sort of the better connections was another thing.
We want to make sure that in areas where we're, where we're focusing our frequency that we're giving our buses the best chance to really move people as quickly as possible, so it's things like the red bus lanes transit signal priority which gives buses a head start at intersections, there's a lot of different items in the toolbox that we can use to help speed buses up.
So as we as we release next iterations of the of the plan you'll be seeing, those will be a lot more fleshed out a lot more detailed and this graphic right here it shows do those fewer lines on a map mean less service and that's not necessarily the case.
They actually mean something now, so we have blue route, which blue routes, which are sort of like current SBS routes, where those stops are pretty far spaced apart, they're connecting key destinations so that way, people that these are built for those really long trips to get people to and from as quickly as possible.
Broadly you'll see, yellow means, that's actually new locations that were running service blue indicates areas that we've maintained service, that buses are still running along those corridors and then gray shows routes that we've moved off of that corridor to help straighten out routes and provide more direct connections.
So the proposed local routes in this area that we heard that we wanted to touch on today, where the q11 queue 18q, 21, 29, 38, 39, 47, 52 and 53 SBS, 55, 58, 59 and 67, so, like I, said I'll, be going over a certain route profiles and those are routes that have taken up Porsche that have not necessarily replaced overall but have taken up portions of those routes, and this is a route conversion chart that we have online as well.
So as you as you look online and you see that route conversion chart take a look and see the new routes that are listen, you can try and figure out what your new trip would look like in the new network, so this route is going from downtown Brooklyn up to Jackson Heights, the 74th Street Station.
This is one of those blue routes that again it doesn't have many stops in between, but it's really just geared towards getting people from Brooklyn to Queens as quickly as possible.
This is one of those red routes that are very frequent a little bit more, a few more stops in between the new blue route, but still it's about moving people as quickly as possible, with these straight routes and with the added frequency as well, and that's taking up portions of the queue 23 and the queue 33.
This one is red so or excuse me this one is green I believe so this one is a little bit more, a few more stops in between the blue route as fewer stops, and it's just getting people from A to B as quickly as possible.
This is previously the cue 59, so this one is running from Rego Park Queens Boulevard out to Williamsburg Bridge, and this is one of those green routes, so you're, seeing a few more stops in between to provide that access in between any of these red and blue routes that are leaving some gaps in the network.
Excuse me down to Rego Park Queens Boulevard, so you're, making you're connecting with the cutie 52 right there to still provide that access along that portion of the cue 53 that we're not serving with that same route.
So right now, I'm going to talk to you about our website and sort of ways to provide feedback.
So that's our website right there, new MTA info, /, queen's bus redesign, that's where we have everything that I've been talking about tonight, you'll see we have this link right there that allows you to review these route profiles that I've been showing.
So that's a really great resource to figure out, and you can see you know on the screen right there you can see where your new route would be going.
I'm gonna turn this back over to how we know thanks so much area, so just lastly, we're just talking about resources for our riders, so we've been doing public workshops which are different than the presentation we're giving here tonight where we sit down.
That's something we need to know, because if you're going to be shifting parking, especially at Ted Scott is a Business Improvement District, it could harm business and the other question was if the running tandem buses on certain routes.
It's good to know that you're on both plans, because this area, especially our southern portion, and if you look at the proposed route now, it seems like nothing, goes below Myrtle Avenue, even though our community board goes far below Myrtle Avenue.
But we do need to have you come back with the Brooklyn plan as it moves forward to talk to us about how it's impacting not only our members of our communities, but also the depots that we house, because we have two of them in this community board and we're going to want to know I mean right now.
It might come out of this somehow, but we definitely want to see that speaking of Jamaica I think there are some really good things and I emphasized a few more the hard things earlier that the people are having problems with the spacing of stops great opportunity to speed buses up.
We might lose that I think we got to figure out how to live with some of that, because we know every time a bus pulls to the curb it gets harder to pull out.
The split for the cue 58 into a very fast line with very few stops and one that's a more local serving various parts of the route and changed at certain points is a great idea, and we really I personally, like that.
But now it's been taken away in this proposal, so I just want to emphasize that too, because I think also the 55 going to Jamaica is a great thing.
That would be a possible future thing to try to figure out, because it would be an infrastructural thing because you'd have to get different buses, but right now the changes of the cue 38 and how it serves local communities in Middle Village.
That's lost in a large degree that a circulator might help right to kind of serve some of these inner residential areas and get people, because, as soon as you'd make it harder for people to get to the bus, you're gonna turn them either to uber or lyft or their own car.
Are we gonna, though these are things that we want to get to them, but we need to have them -, yep, I'll, look through them any other committee.
So I'd, like you to look at the 65th place area and maybe possibly have a bus, goes straight down, 65th place or at least along the expressway, because we're like we're left without buses for a big distance and one reason some people bought their homes and I never ears, because you know buses were only a block away.
Of course, we'll tell you that early at that, okay, it looks like so the Brooklyn and the Queens timelines are very I, know that they're skewed they're, not necessarily mashing up, so we started only because when they redid when they did work on Cyprus Illustrated few years back, you know eliminated a bus stop at on Cypress Hills Street at 80th Avenue, which is at the top of the hill for Liberty Park area, a lot of senior citizens a lot of people with disabilities with strollers.
Just a second before I address these your route plans, which are great and you can look at them, I think people should know.
You really want to look at which I found health helpful, but I also know that some of the way that the map is working line sit over top of each other and it's not very easy to find them.
We have three Express busses right now, that's great to see your numbers I'm like: where are they getting these other two and now I see them more clearly, but the route map doesn't let you get at the layers very easily, so I didn't even find two of them, but to go back to them.
I mean there are more options, so I think we I personally want to go back in and look and see what's coming where so just to see that we haven't lost too much, but those routes that are going to certain places that are currently served are they gonna be serve to get to the west side or get to the east side or get to downtown from the same place in a similar manner in similar time, and that takes me back to your Jane and I'm, just wondering if there's enough time or enough energy or wherewithal to do a Jane for the current existing conditions, I mean Google kind of does that, but not as not as visually but like if I can easily toggle Jane between now and the future, I can say: oh you know what you are doing a better job if I toggle Jane between now and the future- and it doesn't look as good to me for my usual route.
I have heard a couple times in different meetings and I think it needs to be mentioned that there might be the 24/7 service.
So every committee member- don't just once you do feedback on the web- also send it in to the community board and send it and send it saying to get this to the to the transportation public transit committee, because you know my pet thing is: when are we gonna see Brooklyn?
So I should say this is the Queen's team here today, but so that's something that we can look at, but generally any kind of major changes that are happening to the Brooklyn network would be part of the redesign you're saying we won't be able to get that bus stop for five years.
You mentioned the one on the ninth right and there's gonna, be one at PS 49 in April, Mark Moss provided a list of questions, concerns regarding bus redesign, we're going to incorporate that into our feedback and there's been some back-and-forth on some of those issues, and people do agree with them and want to see them included.
