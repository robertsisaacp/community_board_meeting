At this point we have approval from the Department of City Planning, and the application now goes to the community board and, as it makes its way down and he'll, go to the Department of Buildings, already we'll be looking at all plans to make sure everything's legal and it may be changes by them and we're here to talk about the cafe with Joseph.
Don't know the exact date, but it's true that we had was that we didn't close, that with bad weather or has it got colder, and we realized that we didn't for the right permit at that moment.
It couldn't be raised because we have to keep it quiet like a great yeah, okay and it has more openings more water to get in as the tree grows with the roots.
If you want to yeah how recent the picture is and not you know, obviously we have issues with parking.
Pretty much like a trifold window looks like this closed drops down to street level creates like sort of a barrier also in between the restaurant and the sidewalk, but gotta be open.
They're gonna be looking for a safe first, but if it's necessary, we don't have that exactly and how far out is the thing they enclosure comes out seven feet: four inches: okay, using the hand raised Oh using a hammer I how much concrete sidewalk is there between the outside face of the cafe and the edge of the actual concrete, not paver is not tree bed flat, concrete, yes, partition to the to the well of the tree.
Okay, so yeah I do recall that we were working with the outdoor cafe from previous restaurant 101.
That was what made it was what made it illegal since then, we've had this meeting and we rectified it by applying the proper way to get the outdoor cafe realizing now that we applied for the wrong permit, because we'd like to keep a year round.
So if the weather is permitting, you would see chairs and they'll be there were tables, they would be there within the law within the, but while you applied for it, you continued to operate it despite the fact that you advised that you should not so my question again is that since you didn't listen to us the second time, why would we believe that you're now going to operate properly?
That makes it an enclosed cafe, which would make it illegal, but on the what an enclosed cafe really is a solid flame resistant structure, meaning glass and metal, but you know once he puts the canvas around it technically, he would be operating him in closed cafe, so he was breaking the law at that time.
We haven't had any issues regarding anything you know with the community board, so I would use that as the barometer of my credibility as opposed to what my partner has done as the managing member previous to me, we obviously have our differences.
Okay, I just wanted to say that I think the despite the fact that I'm a little bit concerned about the past I'm likely to vote for this, but I am concerned about the latter has to be passed through the department that ladder is crucial to the people who live above mr.
Are there any issues with that with buildings or other departments, key cell doors, for where we get deliveries in yes, so they're gonna be finding a new way to come up and down in the inside?
Then one thing you know this is a while ago we submitted this I, believe that was the idea not used during operating hours.
Yes, everything would be done before, whatever prep they do that, the basement would be done before the cafe open, yeah access or egress.
So, if you'd be knowing down there well during the hours where the cafe is not operating, then the door would be open into the cafe.
The workers would look whatever they're doing downstairs and then they closed it down when people started sitting in the cafe, like you know, until there's a problem, yes, Joe saying there is access out of that basement through the building.
Besides our closed cafe Joseph I'm, just thinking is it possible to let's say, put a door on that part of the enclosure, my floor, I'm, saying on the under on the enclosure that you have yes, so we could use it during non operating hours, but if, for some reason we just you know it becomes a situation that we have to use during operating hours, how could how can we do that?
Think if we're gonna look favorably on this application, it needs to highlight that it's pending Building Department approval yeah.
You know both from the upper floors and for two means from the cellar level not either to be extracted yeah first, even though the practicality of having a table on top in the cellar door, I, don't even think it's possible and supported during hours of operation, but okay, yeah I would just go there to get rid of that table.
Okay, when I left the doors and went through Buildings Department, you know we'd be ready for motion, it's Steve I would move yes, I would move approval subject to the two things were talking about: the fire escape and the and the door being approved by the Department of Buildings.
We are the first thanks mark right coming to the end of his fellowship here, a community board- and you know- we've been talking about you- know, sort of vision for the 65th Street corridor.
We know that there's all sorts of development going on there potentially and initiative notes at the meeting and put together a presentation that sort of summarizes some of the ideas that we came up with and some of his own independent study of the area to give us an idea of what we may want to see there on 60th Street, so I'll leave it to initiative to go over some of his findings that he has and yes present to us.
Earnings from sixth Avenue to forty Milton Parkway, the first option, I think which could be useful as if we zone all the Lord's before the seventh Avenue, that is, from the sixth Avenue to the seventh Avenue as m12 zoning, with a kind of insane incentive zoning that is currently proposed in North Philly imper Williamsburg, we'll talk about it in a bit and the Lords after the seventh Avenue till the Fort Hamilton Parkway could be zoned as one of the zoning types of c4 districts.
So, for example, with the current zoning, a certain kind of commercial uses are also permitted and for every square feet of light manufacturing use in the building.
The developers get an additional 2.5 square feet of commercial uses, so it is a way to up zone the area permit more types of uses, but also to house the light manufacturing uses and the c4 zonings are to serve a larger needs of a larger region than the local retail stores we find on, say 5th, Avenue or 4th Avenue, and the pictures here on the next page shows some building forms that are present in sorry.
If it is a commercial building, it requires a set back from the street, and if it is a contextual zoning, it also requires a setback after the seat wall height, if it is a mixed-use building, the residential portion is treated differently than the commercial portion, and it would result in a building form that we discussed that day.
When we look at the area surrounding the 65th Street, most of it is zoned for residential uses.
This could be another option for the area permitting eight to nine storey high buildings over the street.
The third option could be if we keep the area as it is, that is, to keep the area zone for uses which are currently present on the street.
All right well, thank you is that is that the full presentation in ich yeah I think that was it also I had some suggestions for sweet scaping, but because the zoning changes also require a kind of street treatment from the new buildings.
You know that essentially uses on the blocks, because the four okay I can pull up.
So it's a new tool which is currently being proposed in industry city and in like there's a building called 225 Genta when you, if I recall correctly, Michael told me about it and so that would permit an fer of let's say, 3.5 for every square feet of manufacturing uses if we are getting 2.5 square feet of commercial uses, so you can expect up to also height of the building is also determined by how wide and how deep the lot is.
Maybe four maximum of four stories or five stories in this area and for a CA de state I think it's the same because a commercial fer yeah I'll recheck for the CA district, but I guess for these two kinds of options, the maximum building height could be four to five stories.
So, with both those options, a maximum of eight stories can be permitted on the block, and if it is a non conditional zoning, then the Builder can use the height factor or the tower kind of development, but that is generally not encouraged because they also get a higher fer, make a more fer if they align their building next to the street.
If I am NOT I guess it also comes under the beer, if districts, which limits the height and second thing, is most of the buildings which are like low-rise I, checked on the zoning and land use map.
There I have another question: I think it was an option number three: you talked about after the zoning, the new kind of zoning I'd be in the corridor and it would I think it was the ca3 c84 yeah, which I think you said excludes manufacturing uses.
Think it'll be interesting to with these new times or in what development it's gonna start to look like in the next six months to a year.
If things do sort of trying to get back to normal, we have the data to be able to consider the area again that thoughtful way and yeah I would look.
