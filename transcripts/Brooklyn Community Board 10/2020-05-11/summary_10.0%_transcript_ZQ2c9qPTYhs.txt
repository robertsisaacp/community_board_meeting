Richard, okay, good evening, everyone welcome to our community for 10 clocks, a mini department of committee, meeting I'm glad that you were all able to join us and I would like to introduce the members of the parks department who will be making a presentation this evening regarding the Shore Road Park dog run construction.
Thanks for having this meeting it's great that we can do this via zoom and move this project forward, and my name is Mike Madden I work for the New York City Parks, Department I'm, a designer and I worked on this project in conjunction with Zoe Chen, who is currently out on maternity leave.
These are our goals on this slide, but we also have a couple of other goals that are based on community input and those are to have softer surfaces, so less concrete, for example, and on top of that, we wanted to think about correcting some of the drainage issues that are currently happening on site.
Oh and sorry, one last thing: we also want to make sure it's a be a accessible, which is just a general goal for parks, but especially here, I think that's very important and you all likely know a lot about this park.
John, Paul, Jones and David promenade are more passive parks, and then we have John Jake Rd, which offers some of the same features as Shore Road are, but none of these parks have a dedicated dog run space, and here I just want to talk about the existing conditions on the site.
So we have some playground features in here that we'll see in some of the site photos later in the presentation, and we've got three great light posts and a currently empty planting bed on the outside of the site and just beyond this 8-foot fence.
So you can see we have this fence, that's not in great condition and some old play equipment and these little tree pits here in terms of accessing the site.
So it's a panorama and you can see that 10-foot high fence, that's not an excellent condition and you can see through the trees because it's fall, the Verrazano in the background and between the park site and the view point we have the path and then we have our little planting bed outside of the fence.
Next, it's a view of the paths very similar to the last photo in terms of content, but this is just a view of those planting beds, a view of the path and then some of those light posts here are two views from inside the park or the future dog run, and you can see the remains of former sandpit in the playground and by and large, the site is mostly just covered with asphalt.
So we have this double door: double gate entry here off of the main path which is aligned with the stairs and within that vestibule we have a trash bin and a dog bag dispenser, of course, and from there the path there's a concrete path that leads to either side of the dog run and that's an ata, accessible path which will have companion, seating and bench seating and the site is divided by a four foot.
Here's the fence diagram- and this is pretty important, because it's really changing the way this space will feel to people both using the dog run and people walking by it so based on the site, requirements and also kind of in line with the parks.
So, while we haven't worked out the exact detail for what we're going to use there, we're gonna make sure that we run it by our maintenance and operations and just make sure that everything is really readily able to be cleaned because, of course, we don't want dog bags or refuse or leaf litter or anything to accumulate in there and that'll be a big part of how we design them.
However, in terms of being realistic, I think that some of these benches here are likely to get some Sun, so we're trying to offer some shaded seating on the northern side here in the water dog run great.
