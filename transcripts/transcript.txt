("The neighborhood's not doing well yeah you're, aware of what's going on in "
 "36 right now, I'm sure what well you know that DHS has moved over 515 "
 'shelter residents in to the two hotel two of the hotels on West 36th Street, '
 'and it is overwhelmed the neighborhood considering you know we already have '
 'substantial supportive housing and social services, and so our block is to '
 "send it into complete chaos, and it's spread out on to 8th and 9th, "
 'unfortunately, yeah first Street as well, but the police are doing a great '
 'job of protecting their precinct buildings.\n'
 "Now, okay and like I, said they're 515 on my block and on 37th there's "
 "another I can't get the answers right if it's one or two hotels on 37th "
 'Street, but overall its overwhelmed the capacity of the neighbourhood to to '
 'handle it.\n'
 "This meeting, our monthly meeting I, have to say a few words I'm JD Noland "
 "I'm, the chair of the health kitchen, Clinton Land Use Committee of "
 'Manhattan Community Board before, as you all know, according to the '
 'executive order by the governor two, oh two point one or something like '
 'that.\n'
 'First of all, thank you all for coming for attending this meeting the '
 "basically we have to talk about, or we don't have to talk about, but what's "
 "on the agenda is the Western railyards infrastructure project, they're, "
 'doing I think you all looked at that scoping video is about 17 minutes '
 'long.\n'
 'Those are two different issues that same individual, but is this committee '
 'also in the habit of asking constantly for local hiring on all projects, I '
 "mean I, think that's something we do across the board of them.\n"
 'The main thing is the impact on the environment, the built environment and '
 "the natural environment, our archaeological or historical, but I think we're "
 'gonna exactly want to ask and certainly throw it here so bite, -, WWE, arts '
 'infrastructure, calm with any concerns you have.\n'
 "Normally, the scope doesn't cover those things, but as of now, my "
 "understanding is we're late in the unions they're having an issue, they were "
 "suing each other, but they resolve their issues and I'm no longer suing so "
 'that and have an agreement through the building Congress and going forward '
 "on the west and Mario's be the case a year or so from now, when yeah "
 "they're, discussing and and maybe we've talked about before and funk "
 'forgetting I apologize.\n'
 "If you were gonna put a park in and there's a lot of soil, that's going on "
 "there and then it's being watered and then it needs to drain somewhere that "
 "I, just I would be concerned that you know if it's being optimized for "
 'structures.\n'
 "So so, if there's some motion right, an administrative letter too [Music] "
 "say that we've had a hearing and we're concerned about the staging area and "
 "the traffic, and we want to make sure, there's good communication, something "
 'like that.\n'
 'Yes, yes, so if there is one block from the south between 30th and 31st, '
 'which is clearly in Chelsea and the transportation issues of Moynihan '
 'station are concerned to the transportation committee, so we are actually '
 'going to do a joint meeting with transportation and Chelsea land use on the '
 '15th, which is when transportation was already scheduled, because Chelsea '
 "land use would typically be scheduled on the 20th, but that's the night of "
 'the ESD hearing itself.\n'
 '5 had the opportunity for community board Ford to have a Kim structure, '
 'opinion on it and then have people have the opportunity to attend the public '
 'hearing at ESD on the 20th, so Chelsea menus and transportation committees '
 'of cb4 will be holding a joint meeting on the 15th, so people, okay, it '
 "won't come to that and Bob. This was traditionally Hell's Kitchen, because "
 'yeah the house kitchen but affects Chelsea, so Lee always was the person who '
 'went to the cv5 meetings.\n'
 "That's true, but but a committee would is to get notice if a place is gonna, "
 "become permanent I'm in the wreck, but we're talking about its actual change "
 'of use and commercial services.\n'
 "This is silly for many reasons, but one of the things that's really going to "
 'be a problem for this community overall is, as we are, witnessing the '
 'quality of life issues here, even though this is temporary, when folks could '
 'move back to their permanent shelters once the emergency is lifted.\n'
 "They've now made new contacts within our area, which means most of these "
 "folks will have a reason to come back and we've now made our streets "
 'uncomfortable because there are folks here that may not be able to get '
 'access to services they need in order to help them not be frightening to to '
 "other citizens, and it's as much as we are tolerant and we want to be "
 "helpful, there'll be more people who will just say no, and then we don't "
 'have solutions for these problems overall, I think what we all need to do '
 'and again.\n'
 'This is not, as maybe the community board, because the community board has '
 'been very vocal and written letters, but we could need to continue to press '
 'upon the electives that are there now to say they need to hear the voices of '
 'every single citizen that is impacting from both the social services side, '
 'the folks that will not speak for themselves, not realizing what what they '
 'do not have in this move, but for the folks that also are not living on safe '
 'streets, because some of our blocks really at this time are not safe.\n'
 'North was able to get him a courtesy ride back to his home in Spanish '
 'Harlem, but like this, you know like these guys are busy with a lot of qol '
 "calls that we haven't seen in this volume in a generation and in like it "
 'calls the question whether or not we as residents of the neighborhood, not '
 'as members of a community board, should be looking to actively be present '
 'safely in the streets to make sure that our NCOs in Midtown, north and other '
 'precincts are are aware where we are and what is going on.\n'
 'There were 30 participants on it, so I are interested I think it I know that '
 "we're talking to shelter providers in the 30th but I know that a lot of "
 'people were referencing issues that were occurring all off.\n'
 "Dolores is very concerning, as he said, that we've now moved shelter "
 'residents to our need of social services.\n'
 'We should be channeling that energy to whatever that initiative is, but we '
 'need some sort of strong statement from the full board for immediate action '
 "by the electeds and Chris to your point, I understand that it's a executive "
 "issue, but at the same it doesn't mean that you know Cory's powerless.\n"
 "It is so frustrating and I, don't feel I think we should express the Land "
 'Use. Committee cannot write a letter, obviously, but each of us should go to '
 'our block meetings and just raise hell and we should defund the polls '
 'defund.\n'
 'The fact that that this and DHS is down the fact that this has had a great '
 'impact, and until that happens, because when I go to the meeting, even a lot '
 'of conversation, everyone brings up on there all these other pre-existing '
 'issues, and there are all these other issues pandemic and the economy, and '
 'all that is true, but noticeable change occurred when the shelters arrived '
 'them are our three and you know III, think you know our three already is '
 'compassionate our our neighborhood has existing supportive housing on our '
 'block.\n'
 'We have, you know, experienced down the street gifts of a methadone clinic '
 "within a two-block radius, so we're aware of social services and the issues "
 "that they present, but this is at a whole other level, and it's "
 'heartbreaking that the city has done this and that the neighborhood is has, '
 'as the Laura said, reached the point of no return in the span of like it '
 'feels almost like a month from up here.\n'
 'People in the 1980s that have been working on block associations on the '
 'community board to try to turn things around and I.\n'
 "Dhs I appreciate that you've allowed the conversation to go to what's really "
 'important for the community, because the truth is is this is what the '
 'community is concerned about right now and obviously this land use issue is '
 'a non-event, but I think that for each of us on the call and JD, if you '
 "don't mind, if I just make a suggestion again, the board is voicing very, "
 'very strong opposition and trying to work with our electeds on a solution.\n'
 "So I know that personally, I'm gonna put pressure on not wearing the "
 'community board hat but as resident of 55th Street to say that this is an '
 'issue.\n'
 'Yes, there, anyway, the Land Use Committee after this discussion to draft '
 "any kind of a letter expressing some of these concerns, even though it's not "
 'primarily a laughs.\n'
 'We make it a letter specifically about the EULA process required to change a '
 'hotel from its usage of a hotel to a shelter and that we want to notify the '
 'city in advance of any when the emergency order is lifted, that this should '
 'go through Euler process, and this committee should be active in that '
 'decision process.')
