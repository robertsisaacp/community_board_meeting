We have regional manager, denise palmer on the on the call denise is in charge of the whole western part of Brooklyn Then we also have the director of capital, projects, Christian, dolly and so, So Chris is going to run through the capital status in a little bit, But, I'm, the chief of staff for operations here in Brooklyn at the New York City, Parks, Department, Chris, Denise, and I all work for Commissioner, Marty, Marr.
Skate parks are open, grilling, areas, dog runs, basketball, courts are open, basketball courts are open, but You know we are asking people not to play.
We do not really have the personnel to look into it fully, but you know we ask that people just kind of practice and try to stay as socially distant as possible.
You know does not help that DOE is redoing all the sidewalks around the center at the moment, but we are getting by so that kind of I'm, trying.
That stuff has since resumed everything that was in procurement if it got far enough along those project has moved forward, but everything else, that's in the procurement phase, is currently on hold due to the budget office kind of waiting to see what the city is fiscally able to do.
Dole, I'm, the director of capital projects for New York city parks in Brooklyn.
We knew that you know this was a very important project to the community So brand new playground, basketball, court, small synthetic turf, lawn.
We hope that this one can start fall of 21 as well, and then everybody's favorite topic, You know for a couple years now, But some of the dates have kind of changed, and some of it is related to Covid-19.
But I can ask the people from our planning office to see if there is any update on that project, I'm going to just unmute Mac. What's, going on, I, live in Gowanus around Smith and ninth street and have become involved with public place through a group, but I've started with a few other people called Gowanuslands.
Org that is advocating for a park on public place, and one thing we found is just that: there's a tremendous amount of local community interest in having a park on the place, which is actually consistent with the current zoned protections for the for the site which were put in place in the 70s My question to you guys is given that there have been a few different proposals for the site, including like the recent DCP proposal, to have some kind of development.
We can't take on a site without staffing, The second thing: is: If we're going to be given land, it has to be remediated to the point where you know all the bad stuff under the soil, whether it's metals And, then the third thing is going to be money to actually renovate it.
Planning, determines what parks's involvement with the site is But, happy to run through all that stuff with you in person and see how we can both advocate for better open, space.
It is a capital project of sorts Then, since you showed Anna's playground, I'm wondering if you'd had any contact with the neighbors immediately east of the playground, because they had reached out to me after the park was opened to say that you know they wanted some sort of privacy screen put on that fence.
But I'm, just concerned, because skate parks are a place where people come and linger for hours and hours and given its proximity to the high traffic area, there I was thinking.
I know where we are making it much more of a park- like setting so green Anything like that, just to direct the right, fresh air fountains next to the water fountains.
Just it's just a general concern of mine is that so much of our park land is near As. My ways we're increasing the permeability of the site for sure it's going to be much more of a park- Like setting we're going to add a lot of planting There's in addition to the skate, park, there's sort of a pedestrian plaza that'll have a lot of planting, so I won't just be a concrete jungle.
You asked that because I passed by there, the other day, I'm, always very aware when I started, seeing a lot of cars parking, so they've stayed awful on top of the space Actually the city came and put in, I.
I pushed them as much as I could, but they did not seem terribly interested, but it seems a shame to just leave that this is the unmarked the paper street between the storage, Borings to see you know what the what the ground soil is like, but no word on whether somebody's going to step up D.O.T clean it up, turn it over for public use.
Can you put in a work order for Chris until Chris Mcmillan to look at You know normally cracks on the ground is caused by something else, whether it's water moving or underground If there's a way, we can patch it or smooth it over, or at least maybe feather it down, so you can at least play on it.
You know the developer, or the contractor at NYCHA was trying to do something with it, but He wanted to kind of chip in somehow, but there was not a way to make it.
While he's unmuting he's going to be talking about Brooklyn heat, smart, cool, smart and It's, a program that is focused on electrifying, our heating , all right Let me just open this up.
I live on 15th street, although I'm a lifelong new yorker from downtown Manhattan and uptown Manhattan other parts of the city, but my roots are in Brooklyn and now I'm back I, hope to improving the environment and addressing climate change in New, York City, and particularly in Brooklyn, I'm, going to try very quickly to present this project to you so that we have some time for conversation.
Super, tight, envelopes, you're talking about just improving existing building envelopes, so that you can really reduce the heat loss or the loss of energy in the summer from losing cooling so making the buildings more comfortable, more energy efficient is something people do not pay a lot attention.
Unfortunately, there's not a lot of incentives to work, but we're promoting it, because it's the way to save money and create a healthier and and more energy, efficient, building, air, source, heat pumps or mini splits, which many of you may be familiar.
The advance in the last few years has been that these Air Source heat pumps, which used to be primarily for cooling, can now also provide heating down to below zero very efficiently again because they do not burn fuel.
This is the way that the city and the state very much want us to move to heat with electricity and use this type of technology, which is improving.
This kind of technology can be applied to a much larger installation, say a big commercial space or school, or an institutional use or a multi- family use where the central system can distribute heating and cooling to individual units and that can be monitored.
We actually just had the last round of the the best practices for installation of the air Source heat pumps.
You can access those sign up to see those we have sales sales trainings coming up and those will also be posted we'll make sure to let everybody in CB6 know about those one of our commercial projects.
So, they really have a demand for a good heating, cooling system, we're actually working with a contractor and with the program, people that content and will down to make that happen.
You, know, small retail, small office and medium and large commercial, as well as multi- family projects.
Heaters, heat pump, hot water heaters also are available so different categories and with different levels of incentives, either for the capacity of the unit or the energy savings.
How, much energy you're saving by taking an old boiler or an old, inefficient HVAC system out of service, replacing it with an efficient air heat pump, installation, and so there are various levels of incentive.
We also have an option for lease, so a multi- family or commercial application can install airsource heat pumps as a service with no upfront capital cost of the operations and maintenance of the systems are included in the lease and the leases calculated, so that the energy savings will cover the cost of the lease.
If you know what you're doing it can be as enjoyable and effective a way to cook, Then as natural gas, I think it's going to get there.
You know oil and gas boilers and other HVAC work to transition over to Air Source heat pumps.
In conjunction with an air source, heat pump, installation, And, then we can monitor how how that affects the electric usage.
But if that's coming, then there may be an opportunity to really have a level of resilience as well heating and hot water power, and you know a level of flexibility and how you use that in New, York City.
