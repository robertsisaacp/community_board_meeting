And, since we want to get to people's questions and get to the presentation, I will introduce you all quickly, so I think Mark unmuted himself from office of environmental remediation from HPD Lin introduced herself.
Allow people to raise their hand in a first come first serve manner and they can ask their questions on Mike, and so you know as a reminder that we have now 220 folks that have joined us tonight.
Thank you to community board six for hosting and to both department of City planning and the Gowanus green team.
Storm water participate in making sure csos don't flow into the canal and prepare for sea level rise that there be a public school on the site to meet the needs of a growing community and one that's working so hard to achieve school integration.
The plan that we saw over the years was 75, affordable and 25 market rate and many people in the community who care deeply about affordable housing, said on the one significant publicly owned site in the neighborhood.
And, it was announced earlier, a hundred percent affordable with 50 of those units for low income and very low income families making under 50 of the area median we'll look at later on what that means, with supportive housing for seniors and formerly homeless, families with affordable, homeownership opportunities for working-class families as well and with a site design that I think is really promising for the future of our community in all kinds of ways.
Both those who have shown up saying I really want to see affordable housing on the site and folks who show up in the community in the chat and say I, don't want any development at all.
They were very encouraged by the affordability numbers that seemed you know, because we just like I, think anyone who's involved in the affordable housing discussion in the city, the affordable, for whom question is always very important, and you know what was put out today is encouraging, but you know being encouraged and approving are not necessarily the same.
The proposed, affordable housing plan and some timing and next steps and first up from the agency team, is Mark.
The state DEC will also use the site management plan to direct any further remediation of shallow soil at public place.
Gowanus green will study soil conditions at public place to satisfy the city environmental requirements.
The study shows further remediation is necessary, such as installation of a vapor control system beneath the buildings, Gowanus green will have to complete this work to the satisfaction of the state and city before it can build and occupy a building's own public place.
While those plants of the cleanup plans for the site and the canal were happening, and you know, continue to be put in place, the city has been actively working with this designated development.
The project today has evolved and we believe it reflects the growing needs of affordable housing in this city and I.
It will continue to be a problem for the city and especially in a neighborhood like Gowanus, where it's near transit, it's near schools, and it offers so many rich community.
We believe this site represents a tremendous potential to create affordable homes for individuals and families who couldn't afford to live in this neighborhood, otherwise, so I also want to just quickly I feel, like the council member did such a great job.
The, total number of units has also increased and that increase reflects the growing need for housing in the city and now that it is a hundred percent affordable.
It may seem like I'm just talking about housing, but the proposal that the development team will run through tonight includes additional community amenities and infrastructure on the site that complement the housing.
Oh, my screen, sorry shared streets that are thoughtfully designed to connect planned green spaces at the site.
You know these six goals that we have creating a sustainable, resilient, environmentally healthy community, supporting cleanup and remediation, creating and preserving, affordable housing for all people, but especially those who are at the lowest income brackets building network of parks and open spaces in the Gowanus, creating an inclusive neighborhood that is integrated and accessible for all and to support community and economic development for a thriving neighborhood.
This is often the question we get when we go to any community in the city with the affordable housing projects affordable, for whom, so that is, it is relative.
Households and HPD programs are finance programs which the Gowanus green project will use aimed to provide housing for individuals and families at varying ranges.
And I want to recognize Uriah Naren at HPD for putting this together, because I think it really it's very effective in showing how the city's, affordable housing programs compares to market rates housing in the area.
It shows the example: households we're looking at so in the column on the left, where they're you know, studio, apartments, someone who is a single person making about a little bit over or just under 24,000, that's.
These are what rents are looking like today for a studio under 2000 for one bedroom a little bit over two thousand, and you know a three bedroom would be three thousand, so even Anadoly we are hearing the rents and housing prices are coming down, but certainly in this neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods, it's not coming down enough to serve the people.
So, and it's you know, families who are making 60 and 70,000 dollars a year would not be able to really afford an apartment in this neighborhood.
In addition to the allocation space for a new public school and new infrastructure, this project, Gowanus grain will be 100, affordable.
We are also looking to include buildings that would be dedicated to low-income seniors, as well as supportive housing with supportive, services, on-site and affordable home ownership, as well.
I'm, going to run through, hopefully very quick, some slides about you, know our plan components and the zoning proposal, since it is pretty important to how the development project will be.
We have been looking at an 80 block area for appropriate changes to zoning and land use, and we've studied particularly and propose specific zoning along the canal that responds to its unique conditions to foster a vibrant, accessible resilient and active waterfront with a mix of uses, new housing, permanently, affordable housing and commercial artists and maker space, and a centerpiece of the vision that we have, and that was created over the years of process and engagement with the community, is the waterfront access plan that will provide a public open space along the canal and a key part of that waterfront access plan is Gowanus.
This is necessary because public places do not allow housing to be built and at the same time we are proposing new public streets to reconnect the community to the waterfront and also a new public park.
At this, from a bird's eye, view, Gowanus green sits adjacent to the Covid-19 elevated line that cuts the site off from the adjacent Carroll Gardens neighborhood, there's also a sewer easement that bifurcates the private site to the south and crosses the future public park.
The plan and the zoning will help facilitate space for our future new public school on the site between the park and new streets and the space for the school.
Four developers have been deeply committed to building affordable housing in this community for a very long time.
We are very excited to be presenting some updates to our plan, which we first embarked on before my time of 12 years ago or more and we're excited at this moment, and the updates will take you through quickly will show that our project is building more affordable housing at deeper levels of affordability, more publicly accessible, open space, providing a site for a future public school and building a more resilient and sustainable project than what we proposed back in you, know, 2007.
Updates, we'll talk a bit about the open, spaces, we're going to get into resiliency and sustainability, particularly focusing on the approaches on stormwater and wastewater, and then I'll turn it over to my colleague, Aaron Kaufman at Hudson companies to take you through our affordable housing plan.
You know the you know, from public input and thinking through the site with our really tremendous design team at Marvel Architects, we zeroed in on a strategy of putting height in the middle of the site, so that is keeping heights along Smith, Street and fifth low.
Those are residential, ground floor units that act that help activate the street and build a sense of community, and then lastly, you'll see the site for the potential school here next slide.
You know we strive to create a poorest site that connects to the existing street grid and invites residents to come through our site through publicly accessible, open space and visit this beautiful amazing park and shore public walkway.
You, know defined by our shared street, running through the site from Smith to Hoyt, and then rain gardens kind of dividing the site about at the roughly at the midpoint that are pedestrian-only passages and then a canal view plaza along the canal, which we'll talk a little bit more about next slide.
So there's not going to be a lot of through traffic in this area, so we think it's a really great opportunity to put pedestrians first here next slide.
We think this could be a really great place to have an active community area next slide and just quickly on resiliency.
Our project, you know, New, York City, has done some additional study to study resiliency and we all know, with climate change and sea level, rise that we need to be anticipating of flood events to get higher and higher.
You know during a heavy rain event, our green roof will absorb water, we'll collect water and cisterns to use for our rain gardens, and our swale trail will be doing a lot of work to capture and filter water, but there's this hydrodynamic separator, which would be sub service installed on our site below ground.
You know we're looking to bring in you know on the Smith Street side of roughly 260 apartments again with a mix of incomes and permanently supportive housing, and then we will, you know, move to the taller buildings as we go down towards the water.
I, think we were part designated because of our rather progressive stance on bringing affordable housing to the Gowanus.
My second question: is: does the development team also pay for and build the school and the park, or is that something the city would pay for and build.
You know we'll make sure that any place that we're going to be digging and, in addition, we'll be doing additional testing all around the site on in a testing.
That's been designed here and has been used many times in the city and across I believe across the country, but I know in this state and in the city it's been used on many sites, thanks.
You know what shallow contamination is left is going to be addressed by presumably by the development team, so that two feet of clean soil and two feet of clean soil is a standard remedial element in a residential cleanup across the state.
I also know just looking at the presentation tonight that most all of the site is going to be built.
If I heard correctly, my question is just it sounds like there's an ongoing piece as well right that the city will continue to make sure that the site is appropriate for so many new homes and the city will continue to monitor the safety of the property.
The site has remained vacant for the for those decades, and we see ourselves here now where we're proposing a number of different uses along with streets in a public park in a public school housing is not allowed on public places.
I. Think in the presentation, I kind of highlighted some of those major changes, because the Gowanus canal was designated as a super fun site, and we know there was a need for cleanup and a plan for these cleanups.
We continue to work with the team on it and on this site in this project, so that what we have today reflects on the greater need we have for housing and and working with city planning in the last few years.
You know we are mapping this 1.5 acre of this public place property city, land.
Knowing that you know, Gowanus is being rezoned and if there's more housing and residents coming to this neighborhood, we are going to need more school.
When the property does get to the hands of the developer, there will be an e-designation placed on the property, in which case our office will determine when the conditions on the site and the developers plans for them have been adequately studied, shown to be safe and protective of public health, and until we in because this work is going to be overseen by the state as well.
There will be no building permits available to Gowanus green, so the city plays a critical role after the rezoning when the property is actually moves forward in pre-development.
Those units are you know those units remain affordable to them, when, because their income actually does not grow, sometimes as fast as rent does, which I think we've all seen has occurred in the last 20 years, both in the city and nationally, but I.
I think you know a really important part of the overall plan, and not just for Gowanus green has been the need to catalyze development to remediate land.
You know the community has been advocating for a cleanup of the neighborhood for decades and the advocacy has resulted in the Superfund designation that just started dredging, but the upland sites are also part of that contamination and without spurring development there will be no remediation of those upland.
People do not remediate land without some value that will be created from that development, and so the development is really pretty key to actually cleaning up the land here and the rezoning will cause, as we've noted elsewhere, e-designations, to be placed on development sites that will have city jurisdiction and oversight.
You know really forward thinking and understanding that this will be needed and making sure there is space for the city to build a public school when that space is needed.
I know you've talked about that in detail, but just a synopsis of what the site's going to do.
I think the maintenance piece is something that I think is wrapped up with a lot of the funding questions around the park, which we're still looking into as a agency and development team, broader team, and we know that people want answers.
The distribution of the AMI percentages were clarified for public place, but where are they going to be for the rest of the affordable housing units that council member is contemplating will take place in the entire rezoning thanks.
Will the city be in a new RFP so that developers who specialize in 100, affordable housing would have an opportunity to apply.
This team, in involves developers that have done 100, affordable projects on city-owned land and some of them.
The reason that the 2008 proposal never moved forward was no fault of this developer and the fact that you know we are able the city is able to still push for the 100 affordable.
We are keeping with the developer and the you know the designers that they have on their team and to work through this, because they have been working very actively with the city to try to improve this project and also to keep it.
The developer is not designing the school that you know that would be on the city.
So there will be other touch points where the community come in and provide input, but we do not see a need to to put out a new RFP when we have a very good team and who is able to deliver a project that you know.
It's 8:14 through the people who have their hands up right now and make sure I think we can probably keep going to 8:30, maybe a little bit after that.
My question is: If anyone is still hesitant about this project, if they've considered the public health aspect of creating affordable housing thanks Tim Timothy, it seemed like a question for people other than the panelists I.
I'm thrilled to see the Gowanus green project going to 100, affordable, I, think it's.
