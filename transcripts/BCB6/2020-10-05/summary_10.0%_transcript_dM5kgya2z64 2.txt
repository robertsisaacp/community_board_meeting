Our primary goal, really is to provide fair and impartial hearings for individuals and businesses that receive summonses from the various enforcement agencies throughout New, York, City and As. There are numerous enforcement agencies from department of transportation, to parks, to sanitation, to consumer affairs, to health, to buildings, etc, and we are the place you come.
I actually served on community board six for a couple years, so this type of work was always interesting to me and for better or worse , Covid-19 gave us the opportunity to expand the work the center was doing, and so one of the programs we just launched is called Mend, as Arielle mentioned, and we'll put a link into the chat for Marissa already put the link in.
We are available to offer landlord tenant mediations because we know how difficult it's been for small businesses during this time, and you probably saw the New York Hospitality Alliance survey, which found that 80 87 of businesses were unable to make their full August rent.
Could use mediation to renegotiate rents, mediate waiver of rent arrears, help parties bargain for various creative solutions around those landlord- tenant, challenges, and I can talk a little bit more about it if there are questions, but I want Ariel too, to just talk a little bit about our collaboration and what she's been doing over the last year to help get this project off the ground.
It was established only two and a half years ago by the mayor and City Council member Raphael Espinal, to create this brand new office of Nightlife to help represent and be a liaison for the nightlife industry and the entire ecosystem.
That means owners, operators, workers, performers residents as well, to really make sure that we're representing the industry and figuring out how we can best support the industry as well as address the quality of life issues that come with coexisting in this great city of ours.
When Joni became commissioner of Oath to have this conversation, And it really has been a seamless partnership where oath and the center for creative conflict resolution has these neutral, mediators, professional mediators and I understand that community boards, as well as the NCO officers at the police department, are really in a position to help mediate and solve issues within the community and the venues.
We would encourage the community board if you know of a venue and a resident that could benefit from this, to refer them to the men program or speak to them about it for consideration once it goes into that process within two weeks mend is able to organize a meeting, so it could be quite expeditious in establishing the immediate relief people No matter.
And we just want immediate relief, so mend- is able to coordinate these meetings via zoom now within two weeks, and then the Office of Nightlife is able to continue the relationship with the venue to make sure that things are on the right track, that they have all the information that they need and then the community boards, for example.
So this is a very collaborative process that we see can work to help these really vital businesses get back on track and get there's so much enforcement going on right now in regards to Covid-19 and safety, and these quality of life issues really can really be best addressed through personalized relationship and communication and keeping the enforcement out of it.
I mean this would be situations where there's you know the city's not going to be able to offer a grant or anything else, we're really simply trying to get the two parties to the table together to work out whether the lease any overdue amounts in arrears can be somehow waived or the rent itself could be renegotiated.
This is really a free opportunity for tenants and landlords that are just sort of like having a communication breakdown and possibly to be able to restart that conversation and establish maybe some preliminary agreements which could then be reviewed by their attorneys.
I. Think that being able to use the mend program to incentivize communication and compromise between the residents and the venue might be able to be incorporated in the licensing or renewal processes, because very often the community boards will get the complaints from the residents and now that there's this opportunity to recommend amend program that if a venue is able to find resolution with their neighbors that it should be also seen in their favor versus if they were not against them.
I do not know how your particular committees operate, but I, do think if there is a way to incorporate the men program and to educate people even when they're getting a brand new license that, and also maybe the to the opposing people in the audience that might be speaking against more bars in their neighborhood and so forth.
The existing operators, as well as the regular audience of neighborhood block associations and so forth, to really start thinking about ways to mend the relationship rather than enforce, or to hold back new licenses.
I'll put my email and the website for the Office of Nightlife into the chat, and you can just say: Could you possibly reach out to this venue and let them know we're having so and so a problem, and we can help to navigate them into compliance and have a better understanding of what the impact is that they're having on the community and sometimes that's all they need.
Recently we distributed your the sorry about that, the article that you wrote for gothamist, so everyone should have gotten a handle to read that You know citywide issues around affordable housing and coming from a very different set of circumstances in your district in the Bronx.
I think I've attended more than 100 community board meetings, but it never gets old and I enjoy attending them, especially the committee meetings, And I'm, looking forward to a great conversation, tonight.
I want to thank Brooklyn community board, six, So I think Mike, the chairs of the economic Waterfront Community housing development thank all of the respective chairs, and I just want to give a perspective from the Bronx and also a perspective on what I think our city is facing, especially now, and we're going to talk about how Bronx community board six and Brooklyn community board six have some similarities.
We have Fordham university, we have the botanical garden and we have the Bronx zoo, which I think is the best zoo in the country have to throw that plug in there So about 30,000, less people in the in the neighborhood, so Brooklyn community, board.
You look at Community, Board 6 on the right, we have about 2,600, affordable units.
Have our president, who said I am happy to inform all the people living their suburban lifestyle, dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood.
I want to just talk about the General New York City housing issue like what's going on city.
There's multiple ways to do it and remember: there's already 114,000 units in New, York City that just are not regulated right, now, so New, York City was looking into this pre- pandemic And they were looking at East New York, which is community board five in Brooklyn, and The city ended that program due to the pandemic, but our board- We think we should expand this pilot program, because if there are homeowners that want to earn extra income and provide homes to people, we should be promoting that.
I am a small business owner, as I was saying, earlier, and I think pretty much all the time, non- stop around issues of commercial affordability and how much that tracks, along with residential, I, often find it comes kind of after we've seen some unfortunate matters occur in the residential sphere, but from CB6 and the Bronx perspective are you or pre- covet or during cove?
The thing that I found most just the biggest disconnect is that in CB6 and Brooklyn there's a huge concern that you know: there's a bringing in affordable housing, as you said, helps to create a greater mix of housing types in the in CB6, and certainly CB6 can well stand to take on more the concerns around that, and this goes a little bit to what Natasha was saying- Is, that the way that most of that affordable housing will be built will be on the heels of market rate?
You know there are neighborhoods that can have more market rate apartments, yours and several others throughout the city and the reason why I wrote If we have more market rate units in wealthier areas.
I know some people never want market rate housing, but with limited funds and limited resources, which is what we're facing Now you need the market rate units to pay for the lower income units.
We should be adding more units, I mean, I mean think about it, like we have 8.6 million people in the city.
If you could talk a little bit about going off your book recommendation, the connection between some of these rules that prevent the creation of affordable housing and some of the Legacy of express or systemic racism that you know help create some of these rules.
This committee has said in the past that we know that there's an affordable housing crisis and that our community, like other communities, has a responsibility to address that crisis, and maybe the going off your recommendation.
That would be a big help, because I think it's something that impacts every neighborhood in the city If we can have more housing units and also help homeowners, out.
If I may, I I'd like to suggest that we that we are resolved, that we are in favor of the expansion and continuation and financing of the mend program to help mediate, various disputes between communities and but nightlife establishments and landlords and tenants in this difficult time of closings.
We urge the city to refund and expand the basement pilot program to end rules that ban apartments in single family neighborhoods and to explore the legalization of accessory dwelling units citywide.
