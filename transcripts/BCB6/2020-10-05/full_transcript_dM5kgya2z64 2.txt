This hi Johnny. How are you? How are you good? Typically, we have a very good turnout for this committee. It's a pretty devoted committee, but I'm a little as it's sparse at the moment. So thank you for doing that. Go back. I know our Arielle Palettes and Marissa Sinaigo will probably join with the Presenter Link too. Okay, the panelist as panelists yeah there. She is, although you have my name Marissa, I do not know. If that's intentional, oh right, can I change that yeah. If you go to the top right of your box, you see the three dots yeah rename. Were you pretending to be me at something? I just followed the link you sent all right. I will probably have the same it you you're an imposter. We look so much alike. I know I'm a little bit few shades lighter. I would say: oh there she is hello. You have to change your name, though, because you have my name who me in the top right of your box. You see where the three dots are. Yes, rename. Yes, okay, Voila, hello, Marisa! You look lovely this evening. Thank you. I got some vitamin d today, that's nice and another ariel. I see how lovely how are you can never have too many. I chose that name myself. Actually, it's a nickname. Really, that's cool! Oh here we go. We have a munchkin hello munchkin. Are you ready to help some people tonight solve all the world's problems? Oh look at that sweetie. That's all right! Lovely! Well, thank you for having me come sit with daddy a little angel. I have a weird light streak. Let me make it stop. Ugh things. Never that's a lot, give it another two to three minutes since we're coming on now. At this point, everyone who told me they were coming on is on, but we'll wait for another minute or two- and this is this- is the maiden voyage of our webinar based Zoom, for at least for this committee. I do not know if it's for CB6, but so we have the attendees and our panelists and the panelists, who will some of whom I think you'll have to introduce yourselves but the committee. Anyone who's on the panel is either presenting, or is a committee member and I'll just start now, by introducing myself I'm Ariel Krasnow, I'm the housing chair of the economic Waterfront, community development and Housing committee mark. Do you want to introduce yourself sure, I'll unmute myself, I'm Mark Shames, I'm the co- chair of this committee on the Waterfront development side and I'm the chair of the land use committee at CB6 and I'm Rick Loughlass, and I am the economic development chair and co- chair of the Ewcdh committee to those in the right. So so thank you. We have two different presentations for tonight and I think I see John Sanchez is on he'll, be our second presenter, but what I would like and I'll probably have to say this again later on to committee members, we're going to have the two presentations and then we have a little bit of business to take care of just as a committee in terms of our next meeting. Natasha Ahmad would like to talk a little bit about the Small business subcommittee. We have there's some information that went out about the Waterfront development, which is on Mark's end and then just to touch base about. You know upcoming Gowanus rezoning. So we just want to keep people from on the committee to stick around after our two presentations. So our first presentation and I will introduce Joni clutter from who is the commissioner for the oath, otherwise known as office of administrative trials and hearings and she's here to present the the Mend Initiative mediating, establishment and neighbor disputes so I'll hand it over to you and you can introduce your panel yeah well. Thank you so much for inviting us to be here. I'm joined by Arielle palettes, who is the executive director for the Office of Nightlife, but she's, also known as the nightlife mayor as the mayor likes to call her and she's. She does bill signings, you know after midnight and towards the town and then Marissa Sinaigo who's. My deputy commissioner for communications and press is also with me, and I just want to talk a little bit first about oath, because many people do not know about us and do not know what we do. We, our primary goal, really is to provide fair and impartial hearings for individuals and businesses that receive summonses from the various enforcement agencies throughout New York City and as many of you know, there are numerous enforcement agencies from department of transportation, to parks, to sanitation, to consumer affairs, to health, to buildings, etc, and we are the place you come if you want to challenge that summons and we are essentially a check on the agencies. We are independent and our goal is to provide a fair opportunity for anyone who wants to challenge that summons to have the summons, dismissed or have the fine reduced and we process. You know there are over 800,000 summonses issued by city agencies every year close to 300,000 end up coming to oath for a hearing. We are now doing fully remote hearings. We actually transitioned immediately right when Covid-19 happened, which was happened to be the same time that I started as commissioner. So it was a very intense time, but we immediately transitioned from in- person, hearings to telephonic and remote hearings, which has been very successful and we've done close to 40,000 remote hearings since Mid- march. So we're really proud of everything. We've been able to do during this crisis because we, it is a difficult time for so many people, and we want to make it as easy and convenient as possible to challenge a summons. In addition to our hearings, division and, I should add, as part of the hearings division, we have a very robust help center. So if you ever have a question about your summons or you want help on how to prepare for your hearing or what documents to bring, I highly encourage you to reach out to our help center. Who can assist you in addition to our help center, we have a trials division which is mostly for city, employee disciplinary cases and more complicated contract cases involving the city and other outside entities for our purposes. Tonight, I'm not really going to talk much about the trials division. Additionally, we have what we call the center for creative conflict resolution and the center was started five years ago by one of our administrative law judges. His name is Ray Kramer and he started the center as a way to resolve disputes among city employees because he was hearing so many of those city, disciplinary cases and he wanted to find creative ways for managers and their employees or co- workers to mediate their disputes and find ways to continue working together. He also provided conflict, coaching and management training and when I came to oath one of my goals was to expand the work that the center was doing, because I had I was working in the mayor's office and was very familiar with the center, and I wanted to really find ways to bring that mediation, mentality and success to the public and really use it to facilitate communication between opposing parties and just figure out creative ways that we could use mediation to resolve disputes, and I had also I live in Brooklyn. I live in park slope. I had been a part of Brad Lander's participatory budgeting project for many years, so I was familiar with how to use like this facilitative dialogues. You know to come up with solutions and I was always very interested in Civic engagement. I actually served on community board six for a couple years, so this type of work was always interesting to me and for better or worse, Covid-19 gave us the opportunity to expand the work the center was doing, and so one of the programs we just launched is called Mend, as Arielle mentioned, and we'll put a link into the chat for Marissa already put the link in so you can go to our website and get some more information about mend, but the goal- and this was launched with Ariel pallets who's, the director of nightlife. It was actually, I think, originally her idea because she had seen so many complaints coming through 3- 1- 1 regarding nightlife and venues, and restaurants and bars, who were getting complaints from neighbors regarding noise and garbage and other types of complaints, as they were starting to open and particularly now with the outdoor dining. And so we wanted to come up with a creative way to use mediation to resolve some of those disputes and we have taken on the project at oath. We have both the in- house mediators, as well as a number of pro bono mediators that are offering their services to help the restaurants and neighbors come to creative solutions. Additionally, we are available to offer landlord tenant mediations because we know how difficult it's been for small businesses during this time, and you probably saw the New York Hospitality Alliance survey, which found that 80 87 of businesses were unable to make their full August rent. So we know there's a lot of businesses struggling right now and we've talked about ways. We could use mediation to renegotiate rents, mediate waiver of rent arrears, help parties bargain for various creative solutions around those landlord- tenant challenges, and I can talk a little bit more about it if there are questions, but I want Ariel too to just talk a little bit about our collaboration and what she's been doing over the last year to help get this project off the ground. Thank you, Commissioner. Thank you all for having me today, I'm happy to have the opportunity first to just very briefly share with you about the Office of Nightlife. Many of you may have heard about it peripherally and not really know what or who we are so very quickly. It was established only two and a half years ago by the mayor and City Council member Raphael Espinal, to create this brand new office of Nightlife to help represent and be a liaison for the nightlife industry and the entire ecosystem. So that means owners, operators, workers, performers residents as well, to really make sure that we're representing the industry and figuring out how we can best support the industry as well as address the quality of life issues that come with coexisting in this great city of ours. I'm a former bar owner I used to own a bar in the east village for 10 years and simultaneously served on the liquor, Licensing Committee of Community Board 3 in the East village and lower east side for almost seven years, and so you really can't have a thriving nightlife industry which, for the record, includes bars clubs. Restaurants, live music venues as well as dj dance clubs. You can't have that with figuring out a way to co- exist with the neighbors around you and so from the very beginning. It was a priority and we piloted a mediation program which we found great success. The 3- 1- 1 system, where it's good to record complaints, was not necessarily helping to resolve the issues in a more human way, humanizing the relationship between the neighbor and the venue and finding a way where they can communicate and compromise, and so understanding through this pilot program. How really successful it was. It was an absolutely natural fit when Joni became commissioner of Oath to have this conversation together, and she was already on that path and it really has been a seamless partnership where oath and the center for creative conflict resolution has these neutral mediators, professional mediators and I understand that community boards, as well as the NCO officers at the police department, are really in a position to help mediate and solve issues within the community and the venues. But this is meant also to be another tool in the tool belt, especially with chronic cases where maybe you've seen issues with a particular neighbor and venue that were pre- covered and having trouble with sound or crowding and complaints that have remained unresolved. There are certain cases that rise to the level where a neutral party, not an office of nightlife and not a police officer, not a community board, can sit and listen to both parties and help them really feel each other's pain and figure out a way to get out of the 3- 1- 1 system and not through enforcement, but through reinforcement try to figure out how they can establish a communicative relationship because it's not about, I told him to turn it down. Now, it's loud again, it's always going to get loud. Again, it's going to get high and it's going to be low and it's about how do we put the power into their hands to create a relationship where they can communicate with each other and say hey? Could you turn it down instead of calling a 3-, 1- 1 or a 9- 1- 1? So after this the recommendations are made, we can get referrals from community boards from elected officials from venues themselves from the 3- 1- 1 call system. Anyone can approach the mend program and make a recommendation say we need help here. So we would encourage the community board if you know of a venue and a resident that could benefit from this, to refer them to the men program or speak to them about it for consideration once it goes into that process within two weeks mend is able to organize a meeting, so it could be quite expeditious in establishing the immediate relief people want, I always say, there's a fine line between torture and tolerance, and we all have one, no matter how cool we are, and we just want immediate relief, so mend is able to coordinate these meetings via zoom now within two weeks, and then the Office of Nightlife is able to continue the relationship with the venue to make sure that things are on the right track, that they have all the information that they need and then the community boards, for example, if it came through, you could also be in constant communication with the neighbor and say: how are things going? Are they doing better and if you feel like, maybe they could use another opportunity to mend? Maybe re- refer them to the program if it was going well and maybe it's gone off track, and so this is a very collaborative process that we see can work to help these really vital businesses get back on track and get there's so much enforcement going on right now in regards to Covid-19 and safety, and these quality of life issues really can really be best addressed through personalized relationship and communication and keeping the enforcement out of it if at all possible. So thank you. That's the program. Thank you, honey, great. So we're happy to take a few questions. I think everyone on the on the committee can take their unmute themselves and go ahead. Natasha. Thank you. Thank you guys so much, I'm a small business owner myself, not in hospitality in retail, but I was interested in what you're saying around the landlord versus Tenant Mediation Joni. Could you perhaps it sounds like it's quite new, but would you be able to give a little bit more of an example? I do not know if you've actually had the opportunity yet to experience a renegotiation. Obviously, I'm party to a lot of folks going through tough times, I've been very lucky with my landlady, but if you could speak to any example, it is very new and we're still like in you know this strategizing phase. We actually, I actually have a call with small business services tomorrow to see how we can get plugged into their commercial lease assistance program and use our mediation services, along with the legal representation that they're providing to certain folks. But yeah I mean this would be situations where there's you know the city's not going to be able to offer a grant or anything else, we're really simply trying to get the two parties to the table together to work out whether the lease any overdue amounts in arrears can be somehow waived or the rent itself could be renegotiated and there's also potentially a way for parties to bargain so that the landlord could maybe engage in profit sharing in order and in exchange for reductions in rent or a waiver of arrears. You know there's just a lot of creative solutions that are, I think, could potentially work here and we're still in the strategizing phase. But if you, if anyone came to us right now and said hey, could you potentially mediate this dispute? We do have lawyers as well as non- lawyers who can act as mediators in these cases, so we're willing to take it on if the parties themselves are willing to engage in the process got it. So would that be in conjunction with the community lease assistance program or will oath start to oversee the community lease assistance program, we're definitely not overseeing the program. In fact, cranes wrote an article that was inaccurate, which sort of implied that, but the good thing that came out of it was that the commercial lease assistance got refunded once that article came out, so it was actually a benefit that happened because of it. So we will just be working in negotiation with them as part of the men program yeah, my dad, I feel the lawyers and all the negotiations that the tenants and the landlords usually have to employ to help negotiate. This is really a free opportunity for tenants and landlords that are just sort of like having a communication breakdown and possibly to be able to restart that conversation and establish maybe some preliminary agreements which could then be reviewed by their attorneys once they've managed through the preliminary communication problem. So it's meant to help with the burden of the costs of getting lawyers involved right away and just sort of getting people back to the table, whether they be landlords or residents. Just two quick questions, if I can to follow up so would this be only for hospitality, related businesses who would be in need of such help? I would be open to expanding it for the landlord tenant mediations yeah, I mean. Let me I want to continue the conversations with SBS and with my team, but certainly again, if two parties came to us and said hey we're interested in mediation. Can you help us here, I'm not going to turn anyone away, got it, and I think that answers my second other final question, which is if a tenant said. I really need help my landlord's, not returning my calls. That might not be the place to come to men because you need both parties saying yeah. We we're just at an impasse. We need help well yeah, although I'll say that we can help assist in that as well. I mean Marissa's team versa, who's on the panel right now they do reach out proactively to one side. Once we get the complaint we reach out to the business, to see if there's interest in mediation- and we explain the benefits, so we could potentially be open to doing that as well. I think there are other existing programs with tenants and landlords that the city provides some guidance. So if it's something that oath probably is not doing, I, there are so many resources to be able to point to. If it's a mediation issue, there's it's a good conduit for to find more information or the right location to get the help. That's necessary. I assume yeah. No, I think that's right. This is Mark yeah. Are you going to talk Ariel, or should I hi Aaron all right? Listen. I was once the chair of the permits and licensing committee, as was our district manager once the chair of the permits and licensing committee on the Community Board and all during all that time we had. We worked very hard to try to get the community and the owners of establishments to work well together, and I think we were very successful, except in two particular instances, and one of them went out of business and the other one lost their license. At least I at last I heard, and it would have been very useful for us to have the kind of mediation that's available through mend at that time, and I'm really terribly pleased that you have adopted this and that Raphael got involved with the nightlife, and so thank you now. The next thing. The next thing is there are two things one that I'll deal with. Second, is that I want to know- and you can think about whether there is any resolution that we can offer in our committee. That would be helpful to you in your process and then before. I ask that I have a good friend who used to work over at oath. Her name was Deb Scotto, you know her Joni and at the time she was there. She found that the biggest problem she saw was the lack of integration between the fire department and the rest of the process, and I was wondering if you had found any solutions to that issue. That's interesting, I mean Arielle. Do you want to talk a little bit about the community boards because you have more of a, I think, direct relationship with the community board she's been in more contact with them over the last couple years, so you may be best to speak to that sure thanks. You know, especially based on my time on the SLA committee and seeing how venues with a history of complaint might affect a renewal or for future stipulations. I think that being able to use the mend program to incentivize communication and compromise between the residents and the venue might be able to be incorporated in the licensing or renewal processes, because very often the community boards will get the complaints from the residents and now that there's this opportunity to recommend amend program that if a venue is able to find resolution with their neighbors that it should be also seen in their favor versus if they were not against them. So I do not know how your particular committees operate, but I do think if there is a way to incorporate the men program and to educate people even when they're getting a brand new license that and also maybe the to the opposing people in the audience that might be speaking against more bars in their neighborhood and so forth. To really begin to educate the new operators, the existing operators, as well as the regular audience of neighborhood block associations and so forth, to really start thinking about ways to mend the relationship rather than enforce, or to hold back new licenses. Yeah I mean just to piggyback on that. We really want men to happen before the enforcement agencies go out and oath is kind of in a unique position where we see the impact that over enforcement can have on small businesses and individuals, given that there are so many enforcement agencies and many of them are siloed. We are really in that unique position to see that devastating, sometimes impact that over enforcement can have, and so the goal here is to actually resolve these problems more quickly and in a more constructive manner versus going to 3- 1- 1, multiple times waiting for the enforcement agency going to a hearing having an appeal. This can actually be much faster and more productive than going to an enforcement agency. So you know last time I smoked, I spoke to a community board. They were like wait a minute you're telling us to do something very different than what we used to tell people. This is like the opposite of what we were telling people we told them call 3-, 1- 1 and we're like yeah no. This is this is different. This is a different approach in order to avoid enforcement and try to come up with mutually agreeable solutions. So in terms of Fdny, I'm not sure what you're referring to and Marissa is not either. Regarding fdny issues, I will say that most fdny summonses that are issued in allow for cure periods, which I think is very helpful. It gives people an opportunity, usually 60 to 90 days to fix the problem before they actually get a fine, so I've. Actually, I have not had any problems working with fdny since I've been at all okay. I'm glad I'm glad to hear that. The problem that I was told about and had numerous discussions about, was that the notices did not get to the owners in a timely manner for them to be able to intercede in the in the process, and I hope that's been corrected and, if not I'll, be happy to talk to somebody not on this call. Okay and then the other thing that I was and by the way on in terms of trying to get people to cooperate and not have the enforcement process, our community. What really goes out of the way to try to do that and we've been very successful at doing that and having a mechanism in place to do. That is extremely helpful, and I really am grateful that you've done this and then the other thing is to go back. Is there some sort of resolution we can do today? That would be useful to you in your process to give you either more visibility or leverage in things that you're doing you mean to like make it mandatory to. We can't make anything mandatory, but I mean I think right now. We would love to promote it more. That's really my number one goal, because we do not, as you know, the city budget does not leave much room right now for spending, and so we do not have a budget, or at least a big budget to spend on promotional materials or promotions, and so I I'm just trying to get the word out as to how effective this can be. So a simple resolution of support might be somewhat useful. Sure, okay and I appreciate your enthusiasm because, like I said, we've spoken to other community boards and have not necessarily gotten the same reaction, so I really appreciate it well you're at home. Now that's right! I would also just like to take the opportunity to say that on Thursday at 12 noon to 1:30, the Office of Nightlife is convening a multi- agency town Hall. To help go over the guidelines for indoor and outdoor dining. We will have Joanie there, as well as the office of special enforcement fdny DOB DOT DOH, I'm not great at adding. I can do links but not attachments in the chat. Maybe marissa you can. I can email it to you. Maybe you can drop it in or Ariel I can. We can email it to you to send out to. I was going to say Mike sent out regular, that's his regular daily updates on what's going on. I think that would certainly want to do that and also, I think you know if there is a res. If we do a resolution, I think, as you already pointed out, Mark the permits and licenses is they're, the ones who often I hear that's where I always hear about any of these issues, so I think making sure that our that committee knows about it is important great. I think you know as much information as we can get to everyone. I think the easier it'll be to get through this. Thank you where there are there. Okay, what time are we? I just want to make sure that there are a number of people who are attendees and I think they can write into the chat box if they have questions and if not, are there any other arisa can put in her email. If anyone else has questions that they did not get to ask and they're welcome to send us an email right. Okay, I wanted to ask really quickly. So I know you said perhaps I just missed this time: Samara, I'm a community board member. You said that you know it's early on in this sort of process. Is there a date after which you sort of expect to be the time when there will be will be able to tell people who what the phone number to call is if there was anything or sort of start publicizing that yeah? We have all that it's in the link that Marissa sent. Okay, that numbers emails and as soon as someone puts in a complaint, we will reach out to them and proactively reach out to the business and try to get both sides to agree awesome. We have a bar going in next door and we're on very good terms with the owners. So I hope I won't need to use it, but very good to know, and also sometimes not all, issues rise to the level of the need for mediation. Sometimes, if there are issues that you might be having with particular establishments that are having maybe chronic issues and not really getting the message, you can also feel free. I'll put my email and the website for the Office of Nightlife into the chat, and you can just say: could you possibly reach out to this venue and let them know we're having so and so a problem, and we can help to navigate them into compliance and have a better understanding of what the impact is that they're having on the community and sometimes that's all they need. You know so I'll. Do that now you're welcome to stay around. I think we're. If there's no other questions we can move on to our second presentation, I wrote thank you again so much this is. You know it's really exciting to know this exists and, as you said most of us know, there was a problem there, but did not know that this office existed to help out. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So much John I saw your face pop up there. We are okay. Next up, we have thank you Ariel. Thank you. Ariel bye, keep jumping around there. Okay, John Sanchez is district manager for Bronx community board. Six, as I said in my email to you, we got the b. You had to go out with a full Bronx, I'm not sure which is you know better, but I recently we distributed your the sorry about that, the article that you wrote for gothamist, so everyone should have gotten a handle to read that and we're excited to hear what you have to say about. You know citywide issues around affordable housing and coming from a very different set of circumstances in your district in the Bronx. Yes good evening. Thank you for having me it's good to be here at my counterpart in Brooklyn as a district manager of a community board. I think I've attended more than 100 community board meetings, but it never gets old and I enjoy attending them, especially the committee meetings and I'm looking forward to a great conversation tonight. I know we have a slide that prepared ariel. Will you be sharing it or will Mike be sharing it two slides from mend, but I do not have one from you. Do you email it to me? Can you share it? Do you do you have the capability to share from your screen? It says: host disabled screen, sharing, I'm not the host either. So I can, if you email it to me, I can certainly put it up. I think, because it looks oh no, I can't either hold on I'm going to get. I got a way to do this. Just wait a second we have you have get. Let me get this going here. Ty! Okay, oh he's got it he's on it already ty's on it all right. Thank you all right, we're in business and you can just do the presenter mode. Is everyone able to see this? Yes? Okay, do you want to just say the for me, yeah, okay, all right! Well! Thank you again. I want to thank Brooklyn community board six, so I think Mike, the chairs of the economic Waterfront Community housing development thank all of the respective chairs, and I just want to give a perspective from the Bronx and also a perspective on what I think our city is facing, especially now, and we're going to talk about how Bronx community board six and Brooklyn community board six have some similarities. Then I'm going to talk about affordable housing in the media, then I'm going to talk about the larger New York City issue. Then I'm going to propose two policy ideas that my board has been thinking about recently. Then I'm going to close with a book recommendation that goes more into depth on what we're discussing today and I'm also putting it in the chat right now. So Brooklyn community board six. You know your neighborhood red hook, Gowanus park, slope, Carol, Gardens, orom, Hill, it's about 3.1 square miles, which is about double the area of community Board. Six. You have about 120,000 residents, so Bronx community board six. We have Fordham university, we have the botanical garden and we have the Bronx zoo, which I think is the best zoo in the country have to throw that plug in there we're a smaller community board, we're 1.5 square miles, we're about half the size of your community board and we have about 90,000 residents compared to your 120,000 residents, so about 30,000, less people in the in the neighborhood, so Brooklyn community board. Six median income is about 122,000 and if you look at the how the incomes are dispersed, you see that it's pretty evenly split among all the all. The income ranges you know, 42 percent make less than 100,000 58 make more. What's interesting is that nearly a third of residents in your neighborhood are rent burdened, so they're spending more than a third of their income on rent. Now compare that graph with the which is Bronx community board. Six, it's nearly the opposite. 80 90 percent of our residents make less than a hundred thousand less than ten percent make more than a hundred thousand. Fifty percent of households in our district are rent burdened, so I have a general salary at the Community board, I'm actually in the top 10 in the neighborhood that I live in. If I was in Brooklyn I'd just be at the median. This is important because I just think it speaks to the fact that, regardless of the disparities and income, we both were impacted by Covid-19. You know Bronx community board. Six, we had 11 positive rate case. Brooklyn was 3.7, but even if you look at the death rates, I mean Brooklyn. Cb6 was still about 80 per thousand people. Community Board six was a lot higher, but both numbers were high and it just shows that both of our neighborhoods were impacted by this terrible pandemic. Now I'm going to go into the actual, affordable housing stock now I know this is a little bit hard to read so I'll just run through it a little bit so in your community board. There's about 448, affordable units- and you can see most of them are catered towards middle income. If you look at Community Board 6 on the right, we have about 2,600, affordable units. Most of them are skewed towards the low income, very low income and extremely low income. We have very few middle income or moderate income units housing units created. This was in 2017.. You see Brooklyn community board, six about a thousand new total units made and community Board six in the Bronx about a thousand units. So, even though our neighborhoods are slightly different size, different population, we created about the same amount of units in terms of affordable, you know just general housing units and the op- ed. It really centers on the need for there to be more affordable housing and when I'm talking about affordable housing, I'm talking about more towards the extremely low and low income housing in higher income neighborhoods. So my op- Ed was telling the neighborhood of Soho Community board 2 to pull their weight and have affordable housing in their neighborhood. It was well received the Deputy Mayor Vicky, Bean retweeted it, and we had a few other people retweet it mayoral candidates, Eric, Adams and Scott Stringer. Both said upzoning makes sense in Soho. It looks like people are coming around. I do not want to claim any credit for that. I just think it added to the conversation. Now I want to talk about someone who is an opponent of affordable housing. We have our president, who said I am happy to inform all the people living their suburban lifestyle, dream that you will no longer be bothered or financially hurt by having low income housing built in your neighborhood. Then he responds your housing. Prices will go up based on the market, and crime will go down. The notion behind that is that low- income people make crime go up, so that's who's, an opponent of affordable housing and I won't get too political. This is a community board meeting, but I do not agree with that sentiment now. I want to just talk about the General New York City housing issue like what's going on city. Why, like we compared our neighborhoods? What's going on citywide? Well, one big issue is that we have outdated rules that prevent housing from being built in the first place. If you look at the graph 15 of New York City only allow single family homes, so you can't build anything. You can't build a two family. You can't build a three family, then, if you also look at the next chart this one's important, because it shows that you know a third of go back, a third of all the apartment buildings in the city have more than 50 units, so most of our buildings in New York City have less than 50 units which would be considered an average sized building. So a lot of people have this notion in their head: New, York, City. There's all these big buildings. That's not really the case based on the stats. Another big issue with housing citywide is that pre- pandemic, we had big employment growth economy was booming. City government was spending a lot more on this administration, but our housing growth was not matching this job growth. Do you have more people employed in the city? That's what we want, but you have less housing available for them. So that's not good! That causes a crunch throughout the city, whether you're in the Bronx, Brooklyn or Manhattan, there's less housing for you. It's more competition. Oh skip ahead. All right! So one thing that we want to push that the community boards have been interested in is that we want to just legalize apartments. So if you look at this map, those pink areas are where you can't have more than a single family home. So you see a lot of it's concentrated in Staten island, southeast Queens, north West, Bronx Riverdale. You have pockets in Brooklyn and your neighborhood, not so much, but still I mean these are areas where some of them are close to the train and literally because of outdated rules. We can't even have a duplex or three family home which limits who can live there. Now you can go to the previous slide. Another idea that we have is taking advantage of something called adus which are pretty much just attic or basement apartments. You know I do not know how it is in Brooklyn, but in the Bronx there are several basement units where people are living they're, often not regulated, they're, often not safe, they can be a fire hazard. Well, this is a cheap way to create more housing, because we understand the big budget crisis we're facing. So it's a good way to have housing at a lower cost, but it also helps homeowners that want to have an extra tenant. You have an accessory unit, you get more income and you're providing someone a home. We think that's a win- win two slides ahead. Show you another example. Just so you can visually see what an adu is and when I say adu, just think of a garage or basement apartment. So you look at the right. There's multiple ways to do it. You could have a home over a garage. You could have a garage conversion, you could have a standalone unit or you could have it in your basement or attic. So there's multiple ways to do it and remember: there's already 114,000 units in New, York City that just are not regulated right now, so New York City was looking into this pre- pandemic and they were looking at East New York, which is community board five in Brooklyn, and the program would have helped homeowners, get interest- free loans, convert their units and provide homes for people, which is what we all want. Unfortunately, the city ended that program due to the pandemic, but our board- and I hope your board feels the same way. We think we should expand this pilot program, because if there are homeowners that want to earn extra income and provide homes to people, we should be promoting that, instead of ending a program before it even got off the ground next, so I really want to engage in conversation. This is the book recommendation. I have it's called the color of laws by Richard Rosstein and it talks a little bit on zoning, but it also just talks about how a lot of these outdated rules they're called zoning. I just call them outdated rules because zoning tends to scare people. A lot of these rules were dictated by government agencies from the federal level on down and now with any rhyme or reason behind it. The rhyme or reason behind it was to segregate and have exclusionary parts of this city, and I think New York City is still the greatest city in the world. It's a city of immigrants, a city from people from all over the world. We should be inviting people to want to live here, rather than closing their doors and telling them to live elsewhere, and with that I'll be glad to have some conversation with you. Thank you John. That was that was a great presentation and you touched on a lot of different issues, and I appreciate that you made the comparison between you know. The two two different districts in the city, which are you know, are quite different and face somewhat different struggles as well. I have some questions, but I'm happy to open it up. If somebody wants to start and once again we can start with the community with the committee, and then people can put questions into the chat if they have any. Thank you John. That was so helpful and interesting, and I remember Ariel reminded me of your article the other day and I was like, sounds familiar. Then I went back and I remember reading it when it first came out in Gotham Gazette, and it was a great little piece. So thank you. So I guess my question, for you is whether or not you have any thoughts or comments around the interplay between residential affordability and commercial affordability. I am a small business owner, as I was saying earlier, and I think pretty much all the time non- stop around issues of commercial affordability and how much that tracks, along with residential, I often find it comes kind of after we've seen some unfortunate matters occur in the residential sphere, but from CB6 and the Bronx perspective are you or pre- covet or during cove? What are you seeing when it comes to that linkage between residential displacement, lack of affordability in the commercial end? So we have two business improvement districts on our community board. We have the Fordham road business improvement district, which is the largest in the Bronx. Then we also have the Belmont bid, which is the Arthur Avenue restaurants, etc. So the Belmont bid has really weathered the storm even throughout the pandemic, and that's largely because a lot of those businesses have been around for 60 70 years and they own their building. So they were able to that they're not worried about. You know. Evictions, things of that sort, Fordham road similar in that way- is that, because there were more chain stores on Fordham road, no one has really been displaced on forum Road. I think the area where this placement has been happening is Tremont, Avenue, Shmont Avenue does not have a merchant's association does not have a business improvement district. There were vacant storefronts pre- pandemic and they are they're vacant storefronts now and I do not even think it's a matter of because of the housing issue. I just think we're different in the sense that most places in the district are 20-minute, walk from the train. So just because we're not near we're trained, we have some obstacles for people wanting to start a business on each tremont or east Fordham road. The challenges in Brooklyn may be different. I mean the big concern all businesses have is. How can I pay my rent? We were closed for three or four months. I just think that's universal, but I would not link it to the residential piece in our neighborhood. Specifically, oh, I see a question how many potential housing units could be created in cv6 for more support for adus, so the city has not released district by district guidelines, but the rough estimate is 200 to 300,000 additional units city- wide if adus were expanded. How that is broken down by district really depends on how many homes are in a district but 300,000 more homes in New, York City at a cheaper cost than new construction. I think that's great samara. I can jump in John. Thank you so much for this presentation, hey alec! How are you? How are you I'm good? You know I've thought about the opportunities in CB6 and if you walk around many of our neighborhoods you'll, see old carriage house style buildings that are usually near the corner blocks because of how zoning rules work and currently they can only be used as parking, often they're, not even used for cars, because cars now are too big to fit in some of these old narrow carriage houses, but with some modifications, they'd be 200 to 250 foot micro apartments, which could be much more affordable than what is already offered. I go on jogs, not exactly through CB6, but through, like Windsor, terrace and Kensington, especially and in those neighborhoods. There are many detached garages and backyards and and front- facing street- facing garage properties that could be converted. So even in our neck of the woods, I think there's a substantial opportunity, but I think the most acute opportunities in the citywide in the city and John. I wonder if you agree, are in those areas that are currently zoned single- family because they have large lot sizes and so more akin to the sort of Ditmas Park historic district. In our neck of the woods I so I have a question which is kind of based on a little bit off of your original the article, but in looking at the numbers there. The thing that I found most just the biggest disconnect is that in CB6 and Brooklyn there's a huge concern that you know: there's a bringing in affordable housing, as you said, helps to create a greater mix of housing types in the in CB6, and certainly CB6 can well stand to take on more the concerns around that, and this goes a little bit to what Natasha was saying- is that the way that most of that affordable housing will be built will be on the heels of market rate? That's one thing outside of public place, which is one large, hopefully all affordable. So that's one question, because that's something that in neighborhoods like that, while it's great to be able to have a mix that is of great concern in your district, I would imagine, there's the hope and the intent to bring more market rate, whereas in our district we want less market rate more affordable. Generally, that's sort of so just wondering your if you, if there's been initiatives on your end, to try to bring more market rate or is that still a fear, even in a location where there's a heavier abundance of affordable? Well, we're a 20-minute walk from the train. So that's going to be an impediment for market rate apartments in general. I probably live in one of three market rate apartments in the entire community board and my building was built two years ago. So with that said, I mean we have Fordham university, so I mean I live with a lot of students in my building. I'm sure those students that graduate would probably want to live in a market rate building and even my community board members they'll say. Yes, we need low- income housing, but we do not want to just be all low- income, housing and usually the finances, as all of you can attest to when you're meeting with developers, the finance the finances work out, that you can't just have all low- income housing without a deep subsidy which and because we're facing a five billion dollar deficit, there's a lot more capital money. Now, in response to your question, you know there are neighborhoods that can have more market rate apartments, yours and several others throughout the city and the reason why I wrote the op- ed was because it was also based on the numbers. If we have more market rate units in wealthier areas, they require less subsidies for the lower income units, so the small amount of subsidy dollars we do have can be invested in the poor areas that really want the extremely low income housing 20:30 AMI. I know some people never want market rate housing, but with limited funds and limited resources, which is what we're facing right now you need the market rate units to pay for the lower income units. Maybe if we were in a different financial position, you could have all low- income housing, but we're facing a dire financial crisis and we need to say if we only have 400 million for affordable housing in the city. Where are we going to put those dollars best to use? So I it sounds to me, like your transportation committee, needs to get to work and get some rapid transit in there with like the direct bus routes or something that seems to be the most important. I support bike lanes and bus ways, but I mean the real tragedy of our district not being close to the subway is because we had an elevated train line, but it was tore down in the 70s and the city never gave us a suitable replacement for that we've been pushing to have a bus way a dedicated bus busway on Third Avenue, but yeah they tore down a train line dedicated bus lane. Like that's, you know, that's proven across the world around the world to be incredibly useful. I do not know why we can't you know the few that I do know in the city like West 86Th street. It's amazing like work. Any other questions. Are there? Oh, I see a question from David. Yes, an 80, you may be fine for singles or couples. Maybe raise a potential conflict with the city. If a unit becomes too small for a family, I think we need to think post pandemic and plan long term. I think everyone I mean we're hoping we get a vaccine soon, but this Adu project this would be a five to ten year plan. So I hope we're not dealing with this for five to ten years and with that said, the city can take steps to start planning afterwards. The next question is estimating the increased tax income for our area through Adus. So that would be the question you know: how will the state, how will the city determine how property taxes are assessed? I'm guessing they would tax the rental income you receive from renting out your unit, but it can be figured out. That's what the legislators are there for yeah this mark the Adu program. You say it has been halted. I assume it has some financial basis for halting it, but I was, it does not seem to me to be the most expensive way to create units, and I was wondering your thoughts on that and in our area. Unfortunately, instead of creating units, many of our multi- family, smaller multi- families with three and four apartments, have been converted into single families, so we're actually losing units yeah. I do not agree with that. We should not be taking away units at all. We should be adding more units, I mean, I mean think about it, like we have 8.6 million people in the city and we're seeing a lot of doom and gloom from outlets that people are leaving, but most people are still here. You know in the next 10 years we may be at nine and a half million people and right now we do not have enough housing to accommodate another million people in New, York City in the next 10 years. So what does our plan have to be for that? We have limited space in the city. I think Adus are a cost- effective way to be a part of that. Oh, I think that Tiffany Brown has a question. Do you want to use? Are you looking at that, because I was just going to point to that question. Come on a majority of these units sit empty. I think in at least in our district here, or I think it's I think it may be in Cp6. I know a number of the the affordable which was not at the low, very low income, but at the you know like 100 and 120, you know AMI are not I'm not we're not moving at least around Atlantic yards. If I'm correct, I know that was more yeah, I mean. Ideally, if you have a vacant unit, the landlord would lower the rent, so he could get filled. I mean some landlords just want to have vacant units, but that seems odd to me, especially now and then Vilma had a question. How do non- profit organizations deal with the difficulty of collecting rents as a result of the eviction moratorium? So that's a big question. I think everyone's waiting to see what happens in January I mean we have a few big nonprofits in our district and they've, been working out payment plans for residents and because the rents are lower to begin with, they're able to make it work. But this is kind of a question that I can't answer until to see how January shakes out, I think everyone's holding their breath until January to see if there's going to be relief for landlords and renters, because, as most of you know, half of New York City's tax revenue comes from property taxes, and if we do not have property taxes paid, we have a lot bigger problems on our hand. John. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about going off your book recommendation, the connection between some of these rules that prevent the creation of affordable housing and some of the Legacy of express or systemic racism that you know help create some of these rules. I'm thinking in particular of Donald Trump's Father Fred Trump loudly supporting New York City's 1961 zoning ordinance, which probably created the fundamental zoning rules that govern most of the neighborhoods in Brooklyn yeah. So if you look at the map of the single family areas in New, York City they align with the historical red lining maps for those that do not know areas were shaded and ran if they were seemed undesirable and the city was told to disinvest in them. The areas in blue were considered desirable, neighborhoods, that's why you see Riverdale there staten island and, as a result, the idea was to keep those neighborhoods segregated. So they passed these single- family zoning laws to keep them the way they were to prevent more housing there. But, yes, this is not by accident that there are certain parts of the city that are single- family only and most are not. And of course you have the reverse of that in our district, which is a lot of red around the Gowanus, which is why we have concentrations of the nature developments there. So that's something you also deal with well John. I going off of Mark's question to our prior panelists. I wonder, would it be useful or a good idea to for the committee to propose a resolution of some kind? You know I could imagine a resolution that builds on things. This committee has said in the past that we know that there's an affordable housing crisis and that our community, like other communities, has a responsibility to address that crisis and maybe the going off your recommendation. The resolution could say that we encourage the city to expand the basement pilot to refund the basement pilot, expand it and to consider ways to allow for accessory dwelling units. Citywide 100 we're actually submitting that in our budget request to the city this month. So that would be a big help, because I think it's something that impacts every neighborhood in the city and if we can have more housing units and also help homeowners out. I feel like it's a win- win. Well, procedurally Ariel. I do not know I'd be happy to draft such an. I mean I do not see. I do not. I think Mark and Rick are better on the rules than I am, but we have you know two resolutions and I know we have a general meeting coming up. I do not know that we have a quorum here tonight, but we have a general board meeting coming up next week and you know I'd be happy to help to draft with you tomorrow. If you want the the resolution around the adus. That's I know, there's been a lot of other studies and I can certainly circulate some of those from citizens. Chpc has done an awful lot of study into that, and so has there's another group out in Queens. That's done a tremendous amount of study, so I know it's very and I did not realize I see you have something in there. So I guess you have a lot of information. If I may, we may not have a quorum, but we can make recommendations and it would be, I think, useful, since we are starting up with general meetings again to actually have something to put on the agenda for the general meeting. So what I would ask that the committee members stay after the presentation is done on I'd love to thank our guests to I read what he wrote. I actually support everything that he wrote and more, and I think if our committee members stay around after the presentation we can we can craft the resolutions that Alex suggested and that I suggest thank you all for having me tonight. I appreciate what you do especially volunteering, your time on a Monday night. So I appreciate what you do. Thank you very much. John all right have a good night. Everyone bye! Thank you. You'll, get your we'll get the the your presentation, so we can circulate that yeah. It's public information feel free to share it. Okay, we will, and we will thank you hey. So, if I may, I I'd like to suggest that we that we are resolved, that we are in favor of the expansion and continuation and financing of the mend program to help mediate, various disputes between communities and but nightlife establishments and landlords and tenants in this difficult time of closings due to the Covid-19 situation. Is there a Sec if people are in favor of this recommendation, could you use the the raise your hand function on this thing? I think that's it. I do not see the raise the hand on this okay. Well, then, we can raise our hands. Then I think we lost some functionality when we went to the Webinar version. Okay. Well, in that case, if you can't do that, I have a raise my hand function, but if anybody has an objection or has or says no, why do not you unmute and let us know and we'll wait a minute for that? The only thing mark- it's not objection, but the only thing is. I would say that it's critical during Covid-19, but that this is, I think this is though they're looking to do a long. This is for long term and to continue to help ongoing. So I accept I accept your friendly amendment and Eldonia. Is there any other? Are we discussing it now or did we agree to just do it? That's what happened as the vote happened? Well, do you mean as to the second or are we still on the first? The first I just because I find the first I'm I sort of took some notes on this, but I'm wondering we have a resolution it'll be from the Community Board and we'll go to the mayor's office to the which, where does this? Where do we send it? Well, it basically goes to the administration and so that they know that we support it. We can add on our local council members as well, but I think it's mainly to the administration that we are supporting the the long- term, continuation and funding of this as useful to the community. Okay and two alec, you wanna, okay, well I'll, do my best I'll, take notes, well, yeah, so Community board. Six is on record recognizing the need for affordable housing, citywide and our own responsibility as a community board to create affordable housing. To that end, we urge the city to refund and expand the basement pilot program to end rules that ban apartments in single family neighborhoods and to explore the legalization of accessory dwelling units citywide. Okay, so is number one. My in my one of three parts, you have to expand the Basement housing program fund and expand the basement pilot program pilot program, but is that not part of the ad the accessory Dell rolling unit? Here's my understanding of how fast breaks down the city has not legalized adus citywide and has never explored doing so. What it did was in a particular area in cypress, hills, Queens and East New York. It said: let's try this out and see how it works and they put a million dollars in and they got a cypress hills, neighborhood Community Development organization to spearhead the program they found about 40 candidates and in the process. While they were in the process of helping low and moderate income. Homeowners build these Adus, the mayor cut all the funding, and so that's the state of play there. I think that was that was its own pilot program out in Cyprus Hills for Adus and legalizing them right, and this hap I did not. I did not realize that the basement pilot program he was talking about was different. I thought they were one of the same. I did not so here's the way to think about it. Legalizing Adus could mean just the like you as a homeowner could create a basement apartment and rent it out. The basement pilot program was to help low and moderate income homeowners, who would face special difficulties, financing these units and creating them to get special technical assistance and financing to make it happen so yeah, okay, so that's critical right, because a lot of low and moderate income homeowners are not going to be able to go to the bank to get these things financed, especially if they're going to be affordable. Housing and they'll also be capital costs if they have to do that, because they're going to have egress issues fire issues, but you do not have to. I do not know if that's part of that plan or not but yeah, okay, so and then the accessory dwelling unit pilot and so maybe okay and then the third thing you mentioned was to end the ban on single family on apartments and single family units. That's that seems to be a is that is there any kind of pilot program out there I mean? Is that a bigger lift? No, it's certainly a bigger lift, but, as John talked about you know, a substantial part of the city is zoned single family. Only. I think it's 25 of Queens and in those areas, it's illegal to, for instance, created a like for an older homeowner to create an apartment on the first floor, to get supplemental income, and so this would be tied in potentially as potentially, but it could be called accessory because I think yeah. Otherwise, it's a it's a whole you're changing the zoning, and that seems to me to that might dilute the other. Two are ongoing programs right. Well, I mean 80 users are, would require zoning changes as well. So I mean I think, the these ideas are related and we could drop that proportion of the thing I proposed it just it seemed to speak. It was one of the two recommendations that John had right. I'm happy to list the three of them. As I mean these are just. This is just a these are just recommendations for the city to keep going on looking at them and supporting them. I just you know we might Wanna. I do not know if I feel like we might Wanna. I do not know if there's more value in focusing on ones that we think they is the most productive and they actually might bring to the fort. I do not know which of those three it would be, which is the furthest one. I think that's wise and I'll stop talking in a moment, but if to that end, I think folk if we did the basement apartments and adus. That is a sort of not as ambitious a request. Any other comments. Yeah I'd, be supportive of limiting it to the first twon't that I'm against the third, because I'm actually for the third. But there are plenty of places out in Queens where these kinds of units already exist illegally, and it would, it would be to the best interest of public safety if units that are already being used in opposition to the zoning were to be legalized, and that applies to the first two. But it also applies to the third. But since we do not want to get people too riled up as we get back into the process, I would be supportive of just limiting it to the first two. When you see the first two you mean the basement pilot program and the allowing apartments and single family existing apartments to be legalized in the single family, yeah legal, so legalization, that's really! That's not that's a legalization of the apartments in single- family homes in single family, okay, David, all three. Yes, so we want to have samaras in favor of all three David David asked if the pilot was cut off because over 19, I think that's what that is what John said and Tiffany asked about. If we're going to do this, should there be a cap on what they can charge on those units, which is a good question? So that's well with regard to the programs where you're getting public assistance to legalize those units, then I think in return for that, you could ask for accommodations on the rents, and that is how the program works. I believe the or at least would have worked had it been implemented. Okay, all right we'll work, we'll work on this. Just these notes are here so and is it okay? Can we do we just what's the next step in terms of these? We do not have a quorum which we do not well. We make a recommendation which we just did and we sent that recommendation to the full board where we may or may not have a quorum. Hopefully we will. We have probably enough people to realize that we're actually meeting again and will have a quorum and then we can get these things over to the government. The other part of the government, where things are not where things are not just recommendations, make them real, yeah, okay, so any other. So I think is there any opposition to the second, oh yeah any. I know the only we have include all three, so we could still do that which I'm happy to do. I think we agreed we'll start with all three battle over in the general meeting and David's second set David. Are you not on a picture because you went through the regular other route? Is that what happened film? I think that I think we have up. We have a pretty full slate, so I could pull it up, but I think we only have nine and I think we have over 20 on the committee now but yeah you need half plus one yeah, okay, okay, so just briefly now I just wanted to the four little items that we talked about for the. I think this is a nice segue, because our next our next meeting, which will probably be in its regular time slot November 13th third Monday of the month, is going to be a focus on housing unless we need to switch that for another reason. But that's something: Alec had gotten in touch with me to look at the where we live, which is an interesting segue to John's piece, because it comes right out of their fair housing act and the issues around around that which are to me are very interesting within our neighbor. And how do we? How do we how we going to deal with that with an influx of new housing, so the zoning pass for Gowanus and other rezonings in the in our district? So I think that's something that will be good for us to get a get a better handle on and have a discussion about next month and then we'll send you more information around that before that meeting the other thing. The next item with we wanted to talk about, I'm going to turn it over to Natasha. If anybody had looked at the meeting notes from our last two meetings, which focused on small businesses, the second meeting was really was actually moderated by Natasha and Natasha and Guy had who could not be here tonight. They had really got that panel going and I think, there's a lot of things that are coming out of that you'd like to talk about and also just to let people know that subcommittee exists and that can be part of it yeah. So I mean just very quickly for anybody who, like me, sees the link between residential affordability and commercial affordability and really cares to kind of understand the trajectory that we might be under in these crazy times. You know I would welcome hearing from you. We feel a couple of us a few of us that it would be great to have a small subcommittee focused on small business matters and we would meet you know. Maybe once a month already, a couple of us do talk quite a bit, be just because we're constantly working on these issues, but I'm a huge sharer and I would love to get the input and thoughts from anybody who is watching what's happening in our community, which is a lot of for rent signs, and I know personally business owners who are going through bankruptcy. They are walking away from hundreds of thousands of dollars, literally they're, leaving the city because they can't afford to stay any longer. Some are willing to take any new job that they can find, including you know, being a customer service person. They may have used to own their own business, but they need a job, so the tensions are just so strong and palpable, and I think, as a community board, I would be interested in having this subcommittee. I think, for two reasons: one to make sure that we're not forgetting what is going on making sure that we're not forgetting how much again, it's really tied into affordability generally and then I think, secondly, to help add weight to anything that we can similar to what we're talking about with mend or with John Sanchez and adding weight to any resolutions, and two specific examples are that we do not have to get into it now. I think this would be another topic of conversation at a subcommittee meeting, but right now our council member Brad Lander, is working on a small business recovery lease program. It requires property tax that not requires it would allow the city to create some level of property tax abatement to incentivize the landlord to come to the table and create a fair lease. There are for me a lot of unanswered questions in how this bill is currently drafted, but there's a lot of interesting conversation I think to be had in there and then the bid, our Park Slope bid, certainly- and I think generally, the New York Association of Bids is looking into permitting. That would allow businesses to open up on the sidewalk to a you know, to a small degree where they can, and so that would certainly be a very community board related Matter, I'm sure to weigh into so. I would just throw that out. You can always email me I'll put it in the chat right now and if you're interested to talk about these issues, we can do that and I do not think formally mark or Ariel do we need to do anything formally to we know we just say: there's a subcommittee that exists, I think we created the subcommittee in July in July got it. So that's that if anybody has any questions, let me know, but my email's in the chat the subcommittee does exist great Morgan and Rick. We should make sure that subcommittee and you do not have to be on our committee to be on the subcommittee right anybody from actually you need to be on our on our committee. You do not have to be a community board member. You have to be on the committee, but you know there may be room to add people to the committee who are very active in this effort so right, because I think I have to talk to my talk to my crafty hobo about that. That's not my belly. Wig, okay, oh unmute yourself! Ariel are you? Are you done Natasha, then well yeah. I'm done follow up on that two other items one mark sent around some information about the waterfront development. Unfortunately they have a lot of planning sessions, but the one for our area was last week or early yeah last week, so but there's a lot of opportunity in that to still dive in there and give your some input as well. As you know, Mark said that I think he said you like to bring some of some people and I do not know who what people do not that's. Yes, I would like to bring one of those people from the Department of City planning, who was at that meeting to the Community Board to speak at one of our future meetings, and I assume they will and this process is a long term process. It's not it's not. You know something that has imminent in terms of what they're going to decide so that we do have time to consider it and at them at the meeting that the Zoom meeting I attended there were that Dan Wiley from Nydia Velasquez Office was there and Carlos Munchak is a land use person was there and the portside was there and a tremendous amount of interest, particularly in the red hook area, but some in Gowanus as well- and my question was just that with the extent and a particularness with which city planning identified the waterfront along the rezoning area, is there room for any? I mean any of the discussion that happened there to be included in our region. It probably can inform some of our discussion at the Community board, although it's a separate process and the, and if the rezoning is in fact certified for January how to deal with our waterfront will be much more immediately important right. That's what I figured so that would be good to get that happening. Hope, maybe even before January as soon as we can and then yeah. And then the last item I had on here was just the fact that there has been some movement on the rezoning, and I know that a few people have reached out to me about how this committee- you know what we have done, and I know we've circulated some of that information and what the next steps are. So I I've heard that there will be potentially hopefully coming up soon, a presentation from city planning, but am within the next few weeks. So there will be a sort of kickstart to the to the getting back on the on the rezoning curve and all the information that needs to be brought back to us, because there was just there's a ton of information and I think it's going to be hard. This is going to be hard to do remotely, but you know how we, you know, and things have changed so we've also in some conditions have changed. So I think we need to sort of either certainly at the community board level we're going to do that. But the question was whether or not we want to do it at our committee level as well. That's kind of out there for discussion. Anyone wants to comment well in terms of the land Use committee. They are certainly city planning is always invited to do a pre- certification meeting with us and give us more details before the finalized product is presented to us, although one always suspects that, when they're ready to certify, they pretty have a pretty damn good idea what they actually do want to do, but that does not mean we can't try to depose ourselves in the process to some degree and at least give our opinion as to what's better or worse for the community. Do we I mean? Is there any reason for us? As a committee I mean I presumably if they, if they do some pre- certification presentation again within the next few weeks, to convene just to discuss that and to see you know we have our. We have our talking points, but maybe some we have new people on our committee. There's also things have changed. Maybe we feel stronger about certain things. Let's talk about others, so I just just want to know. Well, certainly our committee has a couple of aspects. Three aspects with regard to this. In terms of economic development, in the Ibc, in terms of housing, with the NYCHA projects and in terms of the waterfront, so obviously this community committee has an interest in it, whether we the whether they do their presentations before this committee or land use, probably will, in part be dictated by the timing of when the committees meet and when they're available and what so that we do that with whatever is appropriate, and we could also have joint meetings if necessary, or I was actually referring not so much to getting a. I think after I'm, assuming that presentation will be at land news. I'm thinking that our conversation is Midi conversation. We do not. You know whether or not there's a any of the agencies there or not, that they're. How we, how you know just have a conversation about the critical points that we're going to weigh in on and also if the other part of that was getting back information on the gis, which also impacts all three of those items so Rick and you and I we can discuss how we want to do that. I really have not thought about that. In more detail than the fact that our committee should be involved in the process and how exactly to do that, I'm really open to suggestions all right. Well, that was my age. That's everything I had on my list. Anybody else have any other business they want to bring up. You know, I know that's actually tie behind that masked Bandana and it's not Mike. Thank you to Ty and Mike for putting this together for helping out problem. Thank you. I really appreciate it. I appreciate you hanging in there and take care of business thanks. Everyone bye! Thank you. Everyone! Thank you.
