Wait hold on wait. Let me just you need a minute: go ahead, yeah. I know you're waiting on Food Rachel's, waiting on food, so no problem. Well, this is taking so long. Welcome back everybody! Hey we've got. We've got some new people on the committee, too yeah it's nice to meet everyone. I do not think I wish we had met in person by now, but good reason not to be, but I'm michaela, it's nice to meet everyone. So maybe, after the review, the new folks can introduce themselves yeah, please hi, I'm rebecca thanks for having me and zoom in yeah I'll, just go hello, I'll, just kind of sit back for this one and see how it works. Good, call and hi. As I mentioned, I'm michaela it's nice to meet everyone nice to meet you all right. Did we get an answer on the who? The observer is? Oh, I have not yet okay, I sent them a message, but they have not responded all right. Okay, so we get to take minutes or because it's recorded we're like it's. That's enough. We can it's only one item, so we can pretty easily handle it. Okay, so it's 6:43 and with the meeting is called to order. Welcome I'm my name is Rachel Freeman, I'm the committee chair for the permits and licenses Committee, and it's been many months since we've had a meeting, so we have the one applicant terrace, something else: okay, all right. So why do not you start good evening? Everybody! It's nice to we're getting an echo on your audio. You have a real bad echo Anthony yeah. Why? Let me do this. Let me get out of that. Okay! Is this better? Yes, oh yeah, awesome I had you on the computer screen and the phone. So that was the reason so good evening everybody Anthony Carabao, I'm the representative for this applicant. This is cesar Vendon. He is the owner of this particular premises at 5Th Avenue. This was formerly blue ribbon Brooklyn, since 2000 might be a good referee guys, so they recently closed down. Spacer took the spot over. He has several licenses. He has two active licenses on the downtown Brooklyn area, one on Montague Street, Grand Canyon, and then he has an establishment on Skimmer Horn. So he has two active licenses. He also had a prior license, ola bar, which closed down a few years ago. So here's about 30 years extensive experience in the industry started as a dishwasher, so he's taking over this premises the there's no outside seating outside of the provisional Covid-19 feeding. If he opens up in time he would obviously take advantage of that. But outside of that seating, there's no outside seating planned the hours of operation will be 8 A.M to midnight seven days a week and we'd be glad to address any questions you might have. Who did get extensive signatures? There's over 100 petition signatures, so they went in the area. They were pretty well received and again he's a very experienced operator. He has several businesses that do not have any blemishes on them. He's a good operator where's, the Skirmer horn, one he's in the hotel he's at 300: oh yeah, okay. I know I know that, but he has that place also, and he has the place on Montague Street as well. Yes, Glenn. Sorry, I have to unmute him regarding the outside seating. There was some mention in the application of applying for a sidewalk cafe, but I'm guessing. That is referring to the possibility of the Covid-19 outdoor seating yeah. I believe so correct, yeah, that's the provisional seating. We do not know. Obviously, all of us we do not know where that's going in the future. Everything is up in the air with that. Okay yeah, because we, you know it said that you were applying for it, but then there was no further details. So that's my only question. We have a lot of silence. Should I sing a song or something if anyone else has questions, if you know how to use the ray's hand function, please do that. Otherwise you can send me a message directly in the chat, we'll just give them a few minutes, anthony yeah. Absolutely right! I do not. Okay, I'm just going to unmute everybody. It seems a little easier blend, your hands up again yeah because I'm not hearing anyone else. So I would make a motion to approve this application, as submitted second motion by Glenn seconded by leroy. Any discussion on this motion hearing none all in favor wait. Why did that Glenn get muted again, because I'm because I have to quick a finger all right. Oh my kiss Mike is joining us. Hello, Mike, hello, yeah, okay, so you can you you're joining us right in time to we'd like to vote, we're voting to approve the license for terrace, I'm sorry, it's terrace bakery restaurant and bakery restaurant and bakery. So the motion was made by Glenn seconded by Leroy, as stated with no changes, so all in favor say aye any opposed any abstentions. Hearing none the motion passes, hi, Mike, hi, Mike and there's echoes, but yeah. So the motion passes. Congratulations great! Well! Thank you! So much everybody have a great evening and stay safe. Thank you. Thank you. Bye- bye. Thank you anything else on the agenda no, not formally, but with a couple of new members. I think we should let them introduce themselves, give a little background and then maybe everybody can chime in on. Basically what this committee does give them a little a little bit of an idea of what we're doing here. That's a swell idea right thanks, Joe Hardy. So who wants to go first of the new members. I can go first, okay, hi, I'm Rebecca! I live in park slope. I lived in Brooklyn for five- ish years. I went to barnard before that, so I've been in the city for almost a decade. I currently work as a team manager at a real estate company, so that's kind of my entry into this, but I'm hoping to do something that serves more of the community than those of our clientele. So that's kind of the main reason to be here and yeah. I back when things were open, went to comedy venues, a lot and especially in our District Union Hall and little field and Bell House, and all of that and I'm a big food person. So I dine out a lot and that's all I think, do you know who appointed you to the board? Rebecca Eric Adams did okay yeah. Have you attended any board meetings before any committee meetings? Yeah? I attended the general meeting last week and I also attended the landmarks meeting with the office. So none of the live meetings pre- covered huh, no yeah, one of my really good friends. Just these. Just these facsimiles of meetings, pretty much yeah, I mean they're much more convenient. I have to say yeah. One of my good friends is on the committee and she encouraged me to apply so I got in right before this all started. Well welcome, hi, I'm michaela! I live in park. Slope we've lived here for about two and a half years now used to live in the East village, and I was an active member of my community board there and then, since I moved here kind of wanted to get the community get to know the community a little bit better and then was appointed by Eric Adams in the spring. So I've been attending all the meetings did a bun a few of the breakouts, the landmarks and stuff, but ultimately really want to be a part of this committee and I'm glad to be one in my day job. I work at a political, consulting firm, I'm also on the Board of Eleanor's legacy, which helps elect progressive female candidates in New York state, and I look forward to meeting all of you and working with you and learning from you. So thank you for kind of taking the time to introduce us tonight Michaela what why this committee in particular I my boyfriend, is in restaurants, and things like that, so I just was interested in kind of knowing where what the new restaurants were, and things like that, I think they're, an important part of the community, because you spend a lot of time there and they reflect, I think, a lot of the flavor of who lives there. So that's why I wanted to be part of it: okay, yeah cool! What do you think should we introduce ourselves yeah? That would be helpful. I'd love to know how long people have been on this committee as well, and if you have any tips, I think that would that would be helpful. If there's like questions, you tend to ask a lot or research sure so I'm my name is Rachel. I've been the chair. I actually do not. I do not know how long two years ago, a couple of years, yeah few years, I think two years and I I've been the chair for two years- I've been on the community board for two years. I was a public member for a number of years before that, I'm I am, and I am an administrative law judge for unemployment in my day, job, and so I my day, job sometimes overlaps with this in weird ways but- and I also was interested in just the places that were opening in the area- and I also live in park slope, and it fascinated me to see the places that were coming in and places that we're closing and things like that, and I I've learned a lot about the state, Liquor Authority and the different rules and what we, what we can focus on and what we can't focus on with applications. And it's I mean we've we're very narrow with what we're allowed to ask questions about with regard to people's business models, and sometimes that can get a little tricky depending on a business's history, but we're very specific with what we're what our focus is, and we kind of have to keep to that. So and I think it'll be interesting going into this new world of Covid-19 and what just even like hearing this, what the sidewalk cafe temporary idea. You know what that's going to look like, because we have not had that. That's new and I do not really know a lot of the details on that and we have not been given any jurisdiction over it right. No and I do not think we're going to, but but it, but it is said, no we're not going to, but it it is. It's still it's part of their it's not going to be something that we can ask questions about, but it's something that we're going to. We just have to be aware of Covid-19. Where was this committee in charge of granting outdoor permits? The sidewalk cafe like if you wanted to have outdoor seating? No that's entirely handled by department of Transportation. I think we have someone here who can say something about that if you want, but he does not have to be right well, my name is Leroy and I work for DOT. So no, actually the only the only entity that had any jurisdiction over outdoor restaurants as well as open streets outdoor streets is D.O.T. We just started the outdoor learning streets for schools, it started with D.O.T, but we pushed it on to d.o.e. So, although we created the rules for the outdoor learning does responsible for you skipped out on the work. Yes, so if you have a problem with it, you got to go so just a very brief overview of it. Everything has been extended indefinitely. Okay, the only thing that's not extended indefinitely is outdoor learning, which ends November 30th, it's supposed to end November 30th, but the open streets and the open restaurants that's extended, and definitely actually the city Council passed a bill that made it official. Now the question becomes, how does that become? Official? No one has the answer, because no one tried. No one has figured that out. Yet the mayor said: let make it happen. We made it happen, they voted on it. They voted on the concept, but not on the details. So it's probably going to go to a number of agencies. You have to have the department of transportation, consumer affairs, the fire department, just Department of Health. They all have to play a role in how we're going to allow our restaurants to utilize the sidewalk and street indefinitely. So until that happens, there's no answers to your questions other than it's indefinite. At this point and leroy you might as well introduce yourself tell us where you've been how you got here all right: well, Leroy, Branch, I'm a baby of CB6. I've lived in every district of CB6, except for park, slope wow location I have not lived in. I currently live in red hook. I am a teenager of CB6. I started working in CB6 when I was 15 years old and then I left and came back, and I worked there for almost 15 years as the assistant district manager and then about five years ago. I went over to D.O.T, so I've been working for the Brooklyn broad commissioner's office for the last five years, and you know in terms of the permits and licenses Committee. I always was very intrigued by it and I really got involved with Glenn. Actually Glenn is the one who really got me involved in a permits and license committee as the assistant district manager, because I remember when the bar came to your block in the backyard usage. Oh, do not remind me yes, and so you know there are different things and I know ty can attest to this you're involved in all the committees, but I took an interest in permanent license because of Glenn and his wife because of the backyard usage. So from that from that we created. Remember we used to have that meeting every year in which we used to get all the agencies together for the community to ask questions as far as well as restaurant bar owners. So that's why I'm here I love it. I love doing this. The state liquor Authority is great to have, but when it comes to city ordinances, they do not really enforce them. They only enforce their rules over underage drinking. You know, and- and that's about it really, because you know violence, fights or anything of that nature is handled by the NYPD. So really the only thing that the state liquor. Third, I mean they can enforce other things, but the only thing in my experience that they really enforce is under age drinking, and you know that's really, I think, over the last, what glenn, maybe five years. They have really started to listen to community boards at the beginning when it comes to permits, I'm not sure you know when we have conditions, they add that to the license, whereas before it would not get added to the license, but now it does ty. Am I correct in saying that yeah they've been doing that for a few years? Now we as long as we catch it early before they start operating, then we can base. We can really stipulate almost anything right. So that's it! That's who I am nice to meet you nice to meet all of you. Well we're back the caleb. Is it a Michelle Rachel pick somebody else Michaela. I got it right. Okay, not many people do we'll go reg good evening. Everyone, my name, is Reginald Ferguson. I've been a member of this committee, for I believe a year now I was advised by the district manager to choose this. As a committee, I also like to drink so that's helpful, but I've had a great involvement with the community oh way to go Glenn, so I've enjoyed serving under rachel for the past year. I look forward to seeing what happens this year. Obviously you know it's understood that with Covid-19 you know everything is altered and everything has changed to the advice of the newcomers. As a relative comer, myself keep your ear to the ground watch the elders you'll learn something and welcome. Thank you yeah all right pauline are you there. I just unmuted her she's still listed as mute and as muted on mine hi pauline all right. Can you hear me yeah? Yes, Ms blake. Ah you do not want to hear my history, I'm one of those old- timers on every committee of this community Board former chair of this committee and former chair of landmarks, your safety committee. So I've done all and I'm on there, because I'm an activist and I like to fight for the rights of the little guys in the community you're here nice to meet you Aladdia, yes, hi everybody you hear me like. I could not hear well on my phone, I do not know it's a very the reception or that good, but I'm Elaria Cassie Rodriguez and I'm being the part of the community voice, six since Marie Marco, which was the borough president, that's a long time, but I've been almost in all the committees and then I stick with the two: the license for a license and transportation been part of the park slow community. For a long time. I lived for the last 40 years in park, slope and I have schools almost three boroughs. I have a school's on Park Slope. I have it on green point. I have in Cabo Hill and I have over there in proper high and that's how I in touch with the community, because I I deal with parents, children and school now when Lyra was talking about the Department of Health, that's the one that I deal with every single day and you're right. That's what in charge of everything about the food about children and now the coffee and the new normal that we are dealing right now, which is goes to me. You know I'm in school. I have to deal with a lot the changes of how children come into the school. How parties drop all the kids? You know one party at the time they had to have times and as it's a lot, it's like food. It's like restaurants, the same thing with children, but that's what I've been doing all these years of participating in the community. I'm part of the also I'm sitting on the board of the Chamber of Commerce. I participate with them, especially now in the coffee that we go to every business that have been closed and as a lot of business. That close, I was one of them. I got shut down since March, and then I opened up only for the children or the people, like doctors or nurses, and all that team for two months, the rest of the time I just opened in September. Hopefully, everything goes well and we do not have to be close again because the spike of the virus- you know local New York- is doing very well due to the the governor that follow was really took on and we all follow, the you know, wear the mask. Everybody wear mask people and the eyes you actually keep the distance food that we have to do that in the school yeah. That's the you know what I do anything for the community, everything for children, some parents and keep us going, and this pandemic really hit a heart: every single, a small business, and now we are there to support with the chamber of Commerce to support any vendor. That needs help could contact. You know Randy pierce, and he will be there for you guys, and I will be there too and yeah. That's what I I I'm just glad to see everybody that we never, I think, for six months. We have to see each other, but we see an hour and less soon. That's what I did. I had to do some classes for the school for a while, and now we see each other and everybody is okay, everybody's good. You know I'm still at home, but I had to visit my school once in a while, because you know we are in that kind of you know not getting sick or everything, but I wish that we soon we get with vassin and the world will come back to the normal, hopefully yeah, all right, mike yeah you're, the only guy with a liquor license on the committee, the only guy with a liquor license on the committee. Okay, that makes him unique. That's great. My name is Mike Vasheras and I've been on the board. I think three years or the committee for about three years and I own travel bar on court street, and so I went ahead. I went before the board six years ago to obtain my liquor license long before I ever thought of joining the committee, but I live in Carroll gardens. I run a business in Carol Gardens, I'm raising my family here, it's important for me to bring my children around and show them community activism. I make them go to every other meeting and even though they're sitting there on their ipads at least they're watching me, you know, be a part of the community which I like, and I find my role in the community meetings is to try to help the new businesses try to make sure they're covering all of the things they need to cover so that they have longer longevity. If you come in without knowing what pitfalls you're going to hit, you know, I want to try to stop those and try to help the community obviously, but also help the new businesses and make sure they're set up to do it right. So that's me. It's very helpful to have your perspective, absolutely understatement. Thank you and welcome new members. Thank you that leaves Glenn. Does it yeah? Well here I am so Glenn Kelly. I am Brooklyn born a 43-year resident of Carroll gardens and have served on community board 6 for 15 years. I agitated four and have served on this committee, the permits and licenses since it began I'm going to guess eight ten years now. I also serve well as Leroy mentioned because of my experience with a bar opening and using the backyard which they should not have been allowed to, and then I shot myself in the foot by helping to get cowell gardens rezoned, which then gave them the necessary leeway to use the backyard. So I suffer still with that, but regardless I'm trying to bring my concern about noise and business use of residential backyards and its effect on the community. I also serve on the landmark land Use Committee and I chair the parks and recreation committee. I've suggested on several occasions that the community board provides some sort of mentoring service that the you know the old- timers be available to help the newcomers. So if that's of interest to our new members welcome Rebecca and Mikhaila, if that's of interest, I suggest that you either ask any permits and licenses questions, maybe through the email server to our committee and any or all of us can weigh in try to answer those questions reach out individually to have a fuller discussion. You can also go to the board office Mike our Chairperson Peter, to ask questions of other committees. If you like so there, that's all. I have to say I have a question: is there an email server? I do not I or a server. I do not know. I do not think I've been getting it from Mike but yeah. So there is a a list serve for each committee, which allows us to sort of discuss within each committee issues or make suggestions for agenda items. Perfect, hey Mike! Are you still here yeah? Oh I, when I heard Mike I just assumed it was Mike Rossiopo yeah. So but ty are we still on top of our committee list? Serves our board list serve yeah. They should all be if they're not completely up to date, they're in the work. I think this one is. I can share that. I think it also exposes, when I send out a an email to the whole committee, like the initial invite for this for this meeting that goes to the listserv, so you might be able to see it there, but if not, I'm happy to send out an email to the whole committee with the actual email address that it goes to. Okay, yeah that'd be super helpful. Thank you ty. I have a question. Can you hear me yeah? I can hear you how long are liquor licenses taking right now? That's that's actually difficult for me to answer, because we really have not gotten many yeah. I mean that's why we have not had a meeting. This is the first one. This is the first new one we've had since February. That has gone. You know from the beginning all the way to the end. There have been a few close calls over the course of the summer where we got 30 day notices and I got in contact and then either they dropped off entirely or they. You know it was too risky to venture yeah. So that's really difficult to tell. I would imagine the SLA is trying to help out and make them as quick as possible, but I think the greater issue for your question is there. It does not seem like many are many people are applying. Okay, I do have something else to add which might be helpful for the new members to get their bearings. This application was very simple, not a problem straight up restaurant reasonable hours, no outdoor space. We, I guess mostly see these type of applications. There's no question about what type of business it is does not appear likely to have any kind of negative impacts on the community and they're easy to vote on. Sometimes there's some confusion about hours. Perhaps mistakes on the application Mike has suggested. We try to advise them to increase chance of success, and you know it's pretty straightforward. Sometimes we'll have a half a dozen of these in a committee meeting but of course, times are hard where we really, I think, make a difference for the community is looking at the. I should not say questionable, but we have questions for applicants who bring us businesses that do not add up. You know that they want to have 400 seats and they're going to stay open until four o'clock in the morning and they're, claiming to be a restaurant, but they're going to have live music, and so we want. We want to know what we're dealing with. So it's the it's the bars and longer hours and the music and the outdoor space that we're really more concerned with. So there you go great. That makes a lot of sense and the mend program that was mentioned in the last general meeting that I think everyone approved to continue funding. Do we have any connection with that program? I can answer that a little bit. We obviously the board supported it rhetorically with the motion, and we have had them at two different committee meetings and I think we're planning on having them come to the next permits meeting. They could not make tonight's schedule they could not make last night or tonight we're trying to make them fit. That's why this is on a Tuesday in the first place, instead of a Monday but yeah we're going to we're going to have them, come and talk about their conflict resolution processes and everything, because that's something frankly that I have to deal with and Leroy has dealt with when he had my job and it's nice to have an agency that is more or less fully committed to that now and it will actually make our. I think, it'll help us tremendously honestly, if we can tap into it yeah. Okay, thanks is Leroy still on the call yep. Yes, I am leroy. The SLA is not out there checking for underage drink in the SLA or out there taking on liquor license my friend. They are in full force yeah. Well. What I was trying to make clear is that most of the issues that we have are city audiences ordinances and what happens is people want us to say, shut the bar down because they're, making too much noise, but the SLA really that has no bearing to them unless it becomes a point of contention with the NYPD. Who then request the SLA to take their license, but even that the likelihood of that happening is very unlikely? Yes, so you know we I'm glad to hear about this new program, because I think it's going to be very beneficial throughout the city for residents and business owners to be able to come together and to work out the differences. As long as everybody comes to the table with an open mind, as you know how that works, sometimes it might go. You know some constituents come to the table. We just want to shut down, there's nothing. They can do to make it better. I just do not want it here. You know, but unfortunately, that's not possible, so I'm going to have to leave guys because I have a birthday party to go to hey. Well, if Leroy is leaving, I'm leaving too, all our formal business is done so right, I think we're I think, we're good. I think this was. It was really nice to get an opportunity for everyone to just have a chance to talk to each other for a little bit sure for sure we're so lonely and actually just to see all you guys right, yeah, I miss seeing your pretty faces. Thank you. I appreciate it all right all right take care. Everyone see you next time. Thanks.
