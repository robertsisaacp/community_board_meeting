Some work on the Riverside with some replacement of windows. The project is complete during construction. The contractor and the owner made some modifications to the third floor and second floor windows, reducing the size in the existing opening, and that's pretty much what we're here to discuss when we're closing out the job we let landmarks know about this change and since we originally had a staff approval, we had to go back through the process to present it to you, the community board and then once we present it to you. We go to landmarks to present this change, so we can close out the job, so I'll go ahead and share our screen. One second, okay, so 473 9th street Brooklyn legalization third floor, rear windows. This is the historic context, district and location. So it's in the park, slope, historic district extension, 473, 9th street here between 8th Avenue and 7th Avenue. This is the block view from above, showing that the rear facade is not visible from either along 9th street or 8th street, and then we have some street views so again a view from 9th street showing that there's no visibility of the rear yard and then the equivalent for the project on eighth street. Again, the rear yard is not visible aerial view just to give a little bit more context. The block it's in the center no breaks along eighth street to get any views to the rear yard or the rear facade existing block context along the block. There are several other buildings that have this very same window configuration. So this is just kind of locating those out the blacks, rectangle or yeah. The black rectangle is the project, and then the pink colored ones are the other similar buildings with the same kind of window configuration. So this elevation on the left shows. This is what we had to prove with landmarks at a staff level and the department of buildings. We were we're going to only originally replace this one window on the second floor and then these large, this group of windows in the rear, this elevation on the right is the as built rear, elevation and during construction. These changes happened. The client was concerned about privacy, the each one of these has a bathroom is behind each one of these windows, so they wanted a smaller window to get a little more privacy, and they also had concerns about safety for like their kids bathroom with like a that large window. So those changes happened during construction and then you know, obviously they should have been brought before landmarks before that happened, but they weren't aware of that and they didn't. Let me be aware of until after has already been done again. This is the as built facade, so these are the two window locations that were reduced in size and then a view from actually from 470 to 9th street. Looking across again there's more context or similar window configurations on the block, and then these are just some existing photos, also showing that these buildings are shorter, they're kind of recessed in making them even less visible, even though they're not really visible from any public right of ways, but they're even less, because they're slightly reduced and that's pretty much. The presentation I had again landmarks wanted us to present it for the community board before they would look at it. So that's why we're here showing this to you guys? Okay, so first we'll start with questions from the committee and then we can open it up to the floor. I know by the way I just want to say I know. Some of you are chatting that you would like to know who's at the meeting. I, don't know how to control that ty I know there's a way we can share that I clicked on grid, because someone suggested that I don't know. If that helped. I'm looking at the same thing, I'm working on a solution to that. We might not have it for this meeting, but I'll talk to I. Think I see Brad talking about it. I'll talk to him right, okay, so any questions from the committee. You can raise your hand or you can put your or try to send me a chat or do whatever so Allison go ahead. You can unmute yourself. Thank you. Yeah, I'm muting, myself, hi. Everyone I just had a question about. If you could flip back to the photos of what was installed, it just seemed a little odd with the you left. They left the window cells in with I. Don't know, I'm just trying to understand what was actually done. Can you hear me yeah? So essentially they infilled. So these are the masonry openings. They infilled with the masonry to reduce the size of the window. They kept the windows still I, don't know if that was a specific aesthetic reason for that, but yeah. The main purpose was to get a smaller window for privacy for the showers, because the showers are on the other side of these windows on both floors and what are those small rectangular? They look like I, don't know what they are like little yeah, those things. These are the vents for the bathroom, the exhaust vents I, don't know, I mean the sills bother me but I. You know it's that's an aesthetic thing for me. I. You know I understand why they wanted smaller windows, but you know I, don't know we can talk to them and see if it's, if that's something, that's going to prevent us to get this to move forward, I'm sure it wouldn't be the worst case scenario for them to paint them the same color as the wall. So they don't stand out as much I mean I. Think yeah I just want to acknowledge. Glenn I, see your hand up. I will call you yeah, like that's, and that was my only question. That's fine! Okay, go ahead, Glenn sure I, like the idea of painting the sills and eyebrows I. Don't really have any comments or questions unless we hear from the community, and so I'd like to know. If there's anyone here from the community, any neighbors you could unmute Joanna I see your name, I'm just looking to see. If anybody is identifying, if you're from the community, you can unmute yourself and just say I'm from the community with an opinion on this project, did you hear my question? Yeah I did okay yeah! That's why I'm asking that's why I'm reinforcing it doesn't seem like there is so, but I'll keep an eye it's hard to tie or Nicholas. While this drawing is up, I can't see the grid, so I can't see everybody yeah, that's better! Thank you. We could keep pulling it up Joanna. Why don't you go ahead with your question? Hi all curious about whether the vents were in the drawing that was presented to preservation. Originally I. Don't know they look kind of awkward, and why are there two on one level and one on the other and then another question? It might be the angle of the photo, but it looks like the new windows are oriented to the existing windows differently on each floor. One of them looks like inset higher than the other, which is a little jarring. Oh, so Nicholas. Why don't you go ahead and bring that back up, so we can see that there yeah hold on one? Second, it is actually the angle. They are they're, both in the top right corner on each floor. Well, sorry, this one's in the top right corner. That line is still the same, but this one is a little bit more centralized. Yeah I, don't know that's just yet another disruption, I, don't know why it's that way, but and then it's because inside the shower on each level, they're at the same like a windowsill height, which is, you know, 34 inches since the ceiling heights on the second floor are taller than the ceiling height on the third floor with the way the roof pitches. So that is why, if they were at the same height, then the third floor window would be like at your waist level, which kind of defeated the purpose of the privacy I see and then the vent question. That is correct. Yes, the vents as well the vents weren't shown on the original drawing so those were those are also a deviation that would need to be used and why two on the middle floor and one above I'd have to confirm that actually with the builder, why they had two there and those also don't seem flush with each other. So thank you. Okay. Can you close the drawing? Thank you other questions from the committee or from the public on this project. Okay, I. Don't think we need to crack the motion because we don't have quorum. I will share my opinion and I'm open to others. Right. Excuse me, you're gonna say something yeah. Even if we don't have quorum, we usually do recommendations to the full board, since this does go to the full board, so sure, so all right so I'll my recommendation, but I, don't like the rear, facade I, think it's kind of ugly. It doesn't sound like it was the architect's fault. I'm just shout out to architects. It is in the rear, facade, it's not visible. I think. What annoys me more is that they didn't follow the landmark approval process. So I'm not making a recommendation yet I'm just sharing my opinion and I'd like to hear others. Yeah I mean David I agree. Of course you know awesome as an architect. You know these. Those things you know are annoying, but you know that you know also. I've also been in you know in the architects shoes where you know the client and the contractor does things without telling you know and it's you're and then you're stuck. You know. So you know, while I don't particularly like it either and I. Think that was weird decision to leave the sales in and paint them. Brown I think you know, yeah I, think if they painted them and kind of you know made all of the vents and the sills go away as much as possible like it would be more acceptable. Okay, any other opinions, recommendations, Glenn I, don't really have a problem with this. If I look out my back window in a landmark district, I see a bunch of buildings that have done just this, for the same reason that there's a bathroom there there's a photo where we page seven, showing two buildings directly behind this property that have the same window configuration I'm glad that they still have the sill there I expect at some point in the future. Somebody will probably put this window back in any other opinions from the committee. I was I'm with Glenn on the aesthetics and the context here. I would just say: I, I'm also. If I have any concern, it is on the process, so I would say, I would suggest I don't have the craft that Jerry does, but that we accept the new window. Layout. I actually I understand what you're saying Allison about painting the cells, I guess to Glenn's point. If the windows go back in then the paint has to be stripped so I did. Do you feel strongly one way or another on that I mean not particularly, but you know it's not that hard to strip the paint off or paint a different color. You know to go with the new windows or you know whatever they want to do. All right is everybody else. Okay with that paint the windowsill, so they match the facade, otherwise accept the new window layout, and perhaps we chastise the owner for not adhering to the approved, landmark application approval with a slap on the wrist okay. Let me just give me a second to write this down. Nicholas. Thank you. Yes, thank you. I think you're all set okay and Tom Winner. Just give me one second here before the motion is made. I would just like to put in a plug for proper construction like it's just really shoddy to not line things up and make it look as good as you can so I. Don't know if there's a way to include that, but just attention there's no motion, we're done. The recommendation is that we're gonna accept the layout, we're going to paint the cells and we're going to admonish the owner for I'll phrase it better, I'm just writing and talking, which is never a good idea for not following the approved following the LPC approval process or adhering to it. Okay, Mr winter, you may proceed okay, great hello, everybody. My name is Tom Winter, I'm the architect for 282, Garfield plays and I think it would be best if I just shared my screen ties. Everything set up can I just share my screen. Yeah. You should be able to share your screen now. Okay, I'll, give it a try all right. Can everybody see my screen? Yep, okay, great so 282 Garfield plays we're in the park. Slope historic district, it's right here! This is the landmarks district map. We are the building with a little black DOT here and to make this look a little bit more real. This is a live street view from Google, so we're so there's a larger building here on the corner. There's another larger building on the other corner, see this in a minute and with the second building in this is the top view. So we are at 282, which is oops numbering with the third building in this is so don't look at this one here, so we're the third building in and visibility for so we're talking about the real facade. Today we do certain or propose certain modifications to the rear, facade and the visibility of the rear facade can be seen here. So there's no visibility. It's like a full cohesive coverage along first street cohesive buildings on Garfield place. There are no there's like this gap here, but this gap does not and I think it's maybe even filled in here, but there's no visibility around the corner here and on the other side there are also a few gaps, but they don't allow to actually see the inside of the block, so we're completely covered here and there's no visibility from any public road. So let me jump to the actual presentation so just to give you like a full picture, so we filed a previously staff level approvals for the front facade. So there's some repair work that we're doing the building is sagging, which is like it looks like the picture was distorted, but it's actually the facade is sagging, so we found an application to remediate that to make this front facade, look more original and all plumb and straight so this is not. What we're discussing right now is only to give a little introduction about this project, so we're working on the front facade, and then we filed an application for the rear facade, and this is the presentation that was actually sent to you also. So you I don't know how you do this internally, but this was communicated to the board. So this is basically our rear. Facade. This to the left is the existing condition. Then, in the middle, is the previously approved staff level condition. So we have a three-story building we're putting a penthouse on top. The penthouse is, of course, penthouse always looks large in these elevation drawings, but in real life the penthouse is a very small addition. It's very far set back from the front, so there's zero visibility from the street, and it's also set back from the back so that there is so that we carry this roof line. The original roofline and don't interfere with that. So the modification that we're now discussing is essentially to enlarge the windows on the second and third floor, there's a very marginal modification on the first floor and then we're talking about reusing a stained glass window on the penthouse level. So, let's start from the bottom up, so this was previously approved as masonry opening there's a double height space. Behind this, where the floor slab is pulled back by four feet to allow for light into the basement and into the first floor, it's a very nice large window which allows for a lot of visual communication between the indoors and the backyard, which is quite nice, there's a very beautiful tree in the backyard, and so this allows like full visibility from inside to outside, hey Tom can I jump in yeah, sure I think you're presenting something that was previously approved yeah. This only okay sets the stage for the modification that we're asking for in this application. Okay, so I would just ask hold on I. Would just ask that you present what the what you're asking for about this time? We don't need to go through the history, got it: okay, let's previously approve okay great. So what we're asking for is to turn these fixed windows into operable windows. So these six, the six glass panes, would be operable glass panes, as opposed to fixed glass planes. Then, on the second floor, we asking for an enlargement of these existing window openings, so the one on the left gets wider and the one in the middle is actually a larger sliding door that there's a pretty substantial patio here on this first floor bump out. So we want to create a bit more of a of an indoor outdoor communication, visual communication. So we want to make this opening larger. On the third floor, we are also asking to enlarge the existing window openings. We want to make all these windows the same height. So this is one of the windows which has actually one glass, one pane with stained glass, and so we want to keep that pain and we match all the mullions here and have the lower opera sash, basically the same height. So we want to drop the sill here and make this uniform, and then there is an existing sand glass window here and we want to it's a beautiful window. We want to reuse that window up here in the new Penthouse edition, so these are essentially the items that we're discussing and we looked at this in context. This is the existing condition and you see so here is this large building on the corner, and these buildings also are quite different. So we only have three buildings. We see how this real extension bumps out on all floors. They have much larger windows here as well, so they have much larger windows here. This is kind of a curved bump out with different windows. So there's not really that cohesiveness that you find sometimes in park, slope where the entire row has the exact same window configuration so we are proposing to do this. Is these are the existing buildings next door and then this is our building, and so we think that by keeping this all uniform, keeping the rhythm of two larger windows and one narrow window actually integrates quite well with the existing condition, and then these are the adjacent buildings that I just showed you. So this we don't really need to discuss, and then these are photographs of the existing condition with the overlay of the proposed window. Openings there's this chimney here, which we maintain so there's a larger window to the left and right of the chimney and then a narrow window here and then this is on the second floor. Basically the access to the roof terrace. These are the stained glass windows. You see that this is only the upper sash that is actually historic. The lower sash was already replaced, doesn't have any historic details and then this is the window that is intact, which we want to reuse on the penthouse level. Yeah and that's my presentation. Thank you so Tom, I'm sorry, I just have a process question here. I went back and looked at the application and it says it's a post-approval application yeah, so we have so I'm going back to this sheet here, so we're showing the previously approved application and overlaid. Basically, the changes that we're proposing with this post approval application. So this was previously so what you see less the red dashed lines is what we, what landmarks already approved and we're in the process now of applying or we applied for this modification, which is this red overlay, so, okay, so you're amending the previous application. That's correct! Okay, all right! That's fine! Okay! First again, another process thing someone. Thank you. Owen, Texas, sent me a quick comment. Ty is this true that the community can not unmute themselves they'll be unmuted if they raise their hand and we select them? Yes, okay, all right. So when I should stop this Tom hold on just if anybody wants to is having trouble doing that. Please send me a just a text message and we'll certainly try to do our best to get you on muted, so yeah tom, if you could close the screen for a second, so I can see everybody all right. Questions for the com from the committee on this presentation. None! Oh thank you! Joanna yeah, go ahead. I always have questions curious about the change in the shape of the top of the windows. In addition to enlarging, it looks like they have a new, more italian, maybe look to the top and then it's hard to say from the rendering, but I'm not a usually a fan of taking a historical element and incorporating it in a modern edition. I'm not sure what others think about that like to hear discussion thanks Alison. Were you gonna? Ask a question? Well, I just had a comment, I think also about the process, and I'm just wondering it's like he's, they've already gone through and gotten approval for design, and now it seems to be, you know, fairly significantly changing the rear facade after it's already been improved. So I'm just wondering what why you've gone through redesign at this point? Are we collecting questions first or you can answer that? Okay, great yeah, so we start the process to essentially get can I share the screen again, which makes my presentation a little bit easier. Okay, so we went through this is a possible solution, but we try to improve on the solution. There's one bedroom behind these two windows and in the process we found that this is not really a satisfying solution to have like two windows with different cell heights in one bedroom, and we also found in the process that a better communication between this library behind this wall and this patio would be actually very beneficial to the overall quality of the renovation. So that's basically it's a process. You know, so we started this to basically get this whole process started, but we're now improving on it- and this is the this is what this project is really calling for, and so that's why we're in this process and that's why we're asking for that's why we filed this amendment with the LPC. So previously you did get approval for a door and for access onto that the additions roof correct. Yes, okay, Tom! Could you close it again? Please yeah, of course. Thank you any other questions either from none of the committee. Does any anybody for the community here wants to comment on this. Sorry, just to interject I didn't get an answer on my window shape! Oh right! Well, it's Joanna! I'm not sure you asked a question. You said you didn't like it is there. No I was curious. What manifest that, why the need to change the architectural look of it? Okay, yeah! So as a matter of fact, we did yeah, we didn't change it. Let me just go into my screen again, sorry for jumping back and forth so many times, but so you see that we have this. The original arch a brick arc on top of the window, and then this is what we do in our modification. So we have the exact same detail. We have this arch here, except that the window gets a little bit wider. So we want to we're well aware that this is a that. This is a detail that basically carries over from other buildings also, and we didn't want to disrupt that. So it's exactly the same detail. Okay, yeah I'd like comments, I'd like to make something clear: David, we are free to put conditions on the amendment. We are free to reject the amendment. We are free to accept the amendment, but the amendment is not the same as a legalization. They have not done the work yet and the process is a perfectly legitimate process right. Okay, all right, I'm getting something in the chat, Dave, Karkacci, I, don't know if I'm saying your name right. Is this a question for this application triple glaze for energy efficiency? Yes, okay! Tom! Do you want to answer that? Yeah? It's a regular standard, double glazed window, so we did not entertain triple glaze I mean it's like thanks for bringing this up. It's really like up to the developer, where we are having a U factor of a point. If that helps so it's like it's a typical new factor for wood window, it's a good U factor. So it's a good insulating glass, but it's not triple glazed. As of now, okay- thank you looks other I'm sorry, there's other chats here, but Paul Bessela you're chatting oh I, see you're agreeing with mark shames. Okay got it. Sorry, I'm just trying to decipher what everybody's saying: David I mean Allison yeah I mean I, don't like yeah I mean it's important to distinguish between this application, the previous one and that it's not you know we're not legalizing something that was done. This is just an amendment to you know the design that was submitted but not constructed yet so you know that's an important distinction to note, and you know, I don't essentially or I. Don't really have an issue with what the new proposed you know. Fenestration is, and the larger windows I think you know will make for a much nicer. You know space for that on the interior, obviously, and it doesn't seem to really you know- depart drastically from a lot of the other existing. You know, adjacent buildings, okay, I agree. Any other comments. I think. The sense here is that we're okay with it then I will mark it down. That is our recommendation to approve, as submitted. Okay. Thank you, everybody thank you. Tom have a nice evening. Okay, thanks! You too, and I will now turn the meeting over to my distinguished colleague, Mr shames. I'm looking for the distinguished colleague, but I'll. Take I'll speak now. Do we have anybody from DCP here yet or not? Yeah, Jonah and I are present. Are we okay? Might then my apologies to Nick, not limbo, and but we're gonna take DCP first and I hope you have the patience Nick and so, let's go DCP sure. Thank you for sharing your own screen here. Joni will be sharing the screen right. Okay! Yes, if you want to pull it up, I'll just intro, so thank you for having us. My name is Katie Ferrara Ainito, I'm here with my colleague, Jonah Rogoff, and we are presenting this evening on the citywide proposal. Zoning for coastal flood resiliency and I want to thank many members of this committee in this community for the years of work that many of you have helped us with since Hurricane Sandy. So as you'll hear as Jonah presents this very detailed and again citywide applicable proposal for about 30 minutes. Many of these provisions are essentially making permanent things that are already in the zoning today, so facilitating relief to help property owners elevate spaces within their building out of flood risk and make other measures that can reduce flood risk and, in many cases reduce a flood insurance cost but in other cases we're expanding the applicability and also, you know, updating items that we knew kind of didn't work the first time around when we had emergency provisions after Sandy- and you all have been a great part of that, including a very early workshop and I believe 2016 in red hook. That helped us understand how zoning applies and zoning and Appendix G flood regulations apply in specific conditions of red hook conditions and we'll go through that. We'll take questions we'll follow up if needed, but I want to make clear what we're asking for this is currently out in public review. It's referred out for 60 days since late October, so we're looking for a recommendation from the community board to the city planning commission by December 28th of this year. So I can answer questions on that if needed as well. But for now thank you again for having us I will turn it over to Jonah Thanks Katie. Can everybody see the presentation? Yes great so good evening again, I'd just like to quickly introduce myself. My name is Jonah, I'm a planner with the Brooklyn office. We're really happy to be here to share zoning for coastal flood resiliency. As Katie said, this is a zoning update. That applies citywide and the primary goal is to support resilient building construction in the floodplain and better prepare for major storms, not just Hurricane Sandy, but also future sea level rise. So before we start I just want to quickly preface everything that we know. Coastal flood protection is a major issue in community board six, especially in red hook, Gowanus and the Columbia Street Waterfront. Given that your local, your you have a very strong local expertise and you've, many of you have been deeply involved in this issue. So we'd like to give a quick intro for background, but really dive into the proposal and as much as possible, we will be showing how the proposal applies in community board six and at the end we hope to leave plenty of time for questions and comments. So as a quick refresher on why we're here, while there are many sources of flooding, coastal storms really present the most significant flood risks, citywide, not only damaging homes and property, but also compromising basic safety and health. When we analyze flood risks, we typically focus on the area FEMA designates as the high risk flood zone, which is a one percent annual chance of being flooded. Every year, however, in 2012 Hurricane Sandy highlighted a larger risk that far extended far beyond that area. Close to half of all properties that were inundated are classified as being a moderate risk of flooding or having a 0.2 annual chance of flooding every year and with climate change. We know that the flood plain will continue to expand so by the 2050s. It's projected that today's moderate risk flood zone will likely be high risk for flooding an area- that's currently home to what we I believe almost a million New Yorkers. So this proposal really builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly. But these zoning rules, as Katie mentioned, were passed on a temporary emergency basis and they're now expiring. So after extensive outreach and research we're now asking to or we're seeking to make these temporary provisions permanent and to expand them to a larger geography. It's our hope that many of these provisions will also help property owners save on flood insurance and help recovery efforts for future disasters, including the current pandemic. So based on our past work, we're able to. We really have four goals for the proposal to help us move from recovery to a longer-term resiliency strategy. First, we know that communities want to be able to protect buildings located in the area. Fema designates for moderate risk of flooding, not just those in the high risk flood zone. Second, we heard people want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood levels to better prepare for future storms and sea level rise. Retrofitting a building takes an enormous amount of effort and cost and time that's really challenging for owners to do many times in the future. Third, when in these investments are made, residents and business owners want more options to invest incrementally and affordably, such as being able to just do basic improvements like elevating mechanical equipment. Lastly, after undertaking two city-wide zoning updates, the fourth goal is to improve how zoning can be nimbler and more efficient in responding to future disasters and other types of recovery before jumping into the proposal. I just want to take a step back to emphasize that, while the focus today is how zoning can promote resilient building construction, we really view this as part of what we call a multiple lines of defense approach that works together with other cities, state and federal initiatives or programs. We also want to complement projects happening at the local level, such as the red hook, interim flood protection and the area's longer term coastal resiliency plan, while also working in tandem with the Gowanus neighborhood plan. So the first goal of zoning for coastal flood resiliency speaks to just where the proposal would apply. The proposal would expand the applicability of the current text to a larger geography affected by coastal flooding. The current text only applies in the high risk one percent annual chance floodplain, while the proposal would seek to allow buildings in the moderate risk, 0.2 percent chance flood plain to utilize, these zoning options and in community board 6 this would it really expand coverage in the areas highlighted in red hook, Gowanus and parts of the Columbia Street Waterfront. The second goal is to support resilient building design that meets and exceeds the requirements of the building codes, Appendix G, so starting with building envelopes. These option optional rules would allow building owners to physically elevate habitable space and other building support features above expected, flood elevations. Currently, zoning only allows or zoning allows maximum height to be measured from the design. Flood elevation or DFE, which is also called the flood resistant construction elevation or frce in zoning. However, this is only available for buildings in the one percent flood plain, with a designated DFE in the building code to allow buildings in the 0.2 chance flood plain to take advantage of this rule. We want to set a standard flood elevation of two Fifa buildings in that area. The current rules also allow extra height for buildings in areas with high excuse me, certain high flood elevations in an effort to have a more functional ground floor. This extra height we also learn, helps with long-term resiliency. Today, building heights can be bumped to 9:10 or 12 feet, depending on the building's use and zoning, which often makes these rules highly complicated. The proposal would make these height allowances more consistent across the board by allowing building heights to be measured from a new reference plane that can be placed up to ten feet above grade in the one percent flood plane and up to five feet in the 0.2% flood plain and then just for a reference. I want to show a map where the current rules apply and where the proposed changes would, and I've also just included a photo on the left of a few homes located in an R5 zoning district in red hook. Just to help illustrate this issue, you can see that the park game was provided outside, but the first floor was raised to the DFE, but that floor is not really that functional, so we're really trying to think of ways that can make improve the functionality of the buildings, but also you know in a way that kind of fits within the context of a neighborhood. So next well we'd like to also update ground floor rules to strengthen the design of streetscapes and encourage. Oh excuse, me, sorry and encourage active uses and also promote accessibility. The current rules allow ground floors and existing buildings that are retrofitted to be wet, floodproofed and exempt from floor area which helps buildings become resilient, while also compensating the owner for the inability to use the wet floodproof portion of the ground floor. The proposal would extend the exemption to both existing and new buildings with the goal of allowing new buildings to better adapt in the future. The current rules also include floor area exemptions for spaces that are dry flood proofed to promote active uses at the street level. Now there are two sets of rules on your left. You can see a provision that applies to existing buildings only which could exempt the dry floodproof space. But often these buildings have a hard time relocating the floor area to make the building dry, floodproof or watertight, and then on the right. You can see a rule that applies to both new and existing buildings, which allowed any space to be exempt from floor area. If more than half of the floor is below the flood level, we often call these spaces sellers. The problem with the seller exemption is that it often, or sometimes it resulted in squished ground floors with shallow ceilings and sunken levels, and ultimately, these two exemptions ended up promoting unattractive streetscapes that really didn't function well for ground floor uses. The proposal would modify these rules to allow dry, floodproof spaces to now only exempt the first 30 feet of space from floor area, provided that the space is used for non-residential use only and also complies with certain design standards, such as minimum transparency or windows, as well as internal clearance. This would help encourage active uses close to the sidewalk level to promote a safe and more attractive pedestrian environment. Meanwhile, when ground floor of commercial buildings are elevated, higher we'd also like to have streetscape rules to mitigate the effects of blank wall conditions and then in community board. Six, this rule would mostly apply in certain corridors, then Brunch, Street and Lorraine Street and also parts of Columbia Street. Additionally, the proposal would mandate a set of streetscape requirements to improve the ground floor of resilient buildings, so in an effort to make these existing requirements more consistent and provide more options for buildings to fit within their context, the proposal would create a system of either one or three points, depending on the elevation of the first floor for floors between zero and five feet above grade. One point of mitigation would have to be satisfied while floors more than five feet above grade would have to satisfy two categories of mitigation and then to meet these points and also illustrate how this would work there were. Holes will provide options for a range of building types from lower density buildings, all the way to higher density and commercial buildings, and these items are split into access themes and also ground floor design categories, and they would include more options for what we have today, which are highlighted in orange. Now, we'd like to talk about existing buildings that don't comply with zoning, which we found to be a real obstacle for making resiliency improvements. The 2013 flood techs did not include specific provisions for small lots and when those were constructed, these homes often were built really tall and narrow, with bad internal layouts. To help address this issue in 2015, we created a set of rules known as the cottage envelope that offered side and rear yard relief in exchange for shorter heights, but it was only limited to certain neighborhoods. This proposal would make the quote-unquote the cottage envelope available across the floodplain. Further we're proposing more flexibility for buildings that legally do not comply with the current bulk regulations. The 2013 flood techs included some flexibility for the first floor above grade to be raised to the DFE and allow the home to increase non-compliances in the process of elevation. However, it did not account for living spaces below grade, and the proposal would allow such spaces to also be relocated above flood levels, provided that certain height block coverage and yard requirements are met. Another issue is that it greatly affects community board. 6 is many residential buildings in manufacturing. Districts built before 1961 do not conform to the current use regulations and they can't take advantage of zoning rules to build resiliency resiliently. The 2013 flood techs allowed some non-conforming homes to be reconstructed, while the 2015 text allowed homes to be retrofitted, but only in certain areas. The this proposal would expand this allowance across the flood plain provided again that certain height and floor area standards are met. Lastly, to account for special situations where buildings are really challenged and they're unable to meet unable to do these retrofits. As of right, we're proposing a new board of standards and appeals or BSA special permit a discretionary action where owners can apply for relief in order to better meet the appendix G standards for construction. The third goal of the proposal is to really support what we call partial resiliency strategies that help building owners take incremental steps towards resiliency, without necessarily requiring the building to fully comply. One lesson we learned was raising. Mechanical equipment is often the first and most cost effective step towards resiliency, so we really want to offer more options to place mechanical equipment above the flood level, whether it's on the top of the roofs or a separate structure or within available open areas. People often choose to move this equipment from their cellar to an open area on their lot due to the heavy load of this equipment. While we do have some flexibility, zoning requires the equipment to be very close to the building wall, which can sometimes block windows or access points. So, as a result, the proposal would allow more flexibility for locating this equipment in the rear yard, provided that it's not too close to the lot line and also doesn't exceed a certain height and then for buildings that have large open areas or like thinking of the red hook, houses or other NYCHA properties. We would allow mechanical equipment to be located in open areas, provided again that certain bulk and streetscape rules are met, a big portion of the floodplain again that really affects community board. Six is it contains. You know core industrial uses and commercial buildings that really have trouble elevating or dry flood proofing, either due to the high cost or just general physical constraints, but many of these business owners really want to raise their equipment and supplies and really protect against major damage or loss in the future. During our outreach, we heard that many businesses rely on below-grade spaces, specifically especially when they're in mixed-use buildings. However, zoning often prohibits mixed-use buildings from using more than the first story for non-residential uses. So if a building owner decides to fill in their seller space that's vulnerable to flooding. Many are just unable to recruit that lost seller space. Consequently, the proposal would allow all commercial corridors in the flood plain to use the first two stories for non-residential use, provided that there aren't sub-grade spaces in the building and then for existing industrial buildings that have high lot coverage and have difficulty again elevating we're proposing a small floor area exemption to encourage the construction of mezzanine spaces that can elevate critical equipment, inventory and office space. The proposal would also enable many types of flood protection measures to be implemented, including allowances for flood panels and landscape berms to be considered permitted obstructions in open areas. It would also allow storage spaces for panels to be exempt from floor area to enable on-site storage. Lastly, when looking at larger waterfront sites, zoning generally does not allow waterfront yards or visual corridors to be raised to account for flood risk. Many sites at the water's edge are required to provide public access using very specific design standards, and often they don't have enough flexibility to accommodate the latest best practices for resiliency. This proposal would offer a bit more flexibility specifically for the location of grading. In a way that it helps support resiliency improvements, while also allowing a bi-level or different levels of the waterfront that promotes the public's experience near the waterfront water's edge. The final goal we'd like to speak about is how the proposal would apply, not just in the flood plain but across the city. Hurricane Sandy really showed us how a storm's effect can go well beyond the floodplain and even affect the larger energy grid to help us prepare for the future. The proposal will allow power systems, meaning generators, solar energy systems, fuel cells, batteries to be permitted obstructions in open areas across all zoning districts. In addition to ensure that all parts of the city can easily provide ADA access, the proposal would classify ramps and lifts as permitted obstructions, to also help better facilitate these and a bit more flexibility in their location. Another key issue the proposal is considering are the effects of vulnerable populations in the floodplain hurricane Sandy and other storms really exposed the challenges facing nursing homes and their residents in areas with high flood risk, due to the specific care needs that they have and in circumstances that require evacuation. Accordingly, we're proposing to limit the growth of nursing homes in the one percent, chance, floodplain and other high-risk areas in an effort to really improve the health and safety of these residents in the future, and then lastly, Sandy showed that the process itself being very lengthy to update zoning can slow down our response. This proposal would make certain recovery provisions available to be activated quickly following future disasters, some of which would be implemented now to address the current pandemic particular related to the pandemic. First, we propose that property owners who hold special permits or authorizations be given an additional term, so they have more time to complete their plan, and second businesses that don't conform to zoning use regulations would be allowed more than two years to return to operation, and currently the limit is two years based on the limit of discontinuance, as we near the end of our presentation. I just want to stress that zoning for coastal flood resiliency is designed to work in tandem with the Gowanus neighborhood plan. Both myself and Katie were deeply involved with Gowanus, as many of you I know, and we're really hoping that it can complement the public realm shoreline improvements and other resiliency improvements by really focusing on how resiliency can occur at the building scale and we'll be planning to go over this in much greater detail once Gowanus is certified for public review, but just wanted to highlight that we are examining specific grading measures and elevations for developments along the canal to meet resiliency standards, while also thinking about street ends adjacent to public access areas in an effort to improve drainage and reduce flood risk. So as far as the next steps, as Katie mentioned at the beginning, we're really asking for your review on the text amendment. It was referred out in October on to all community boards, borough boards and borough presidents for 60 days, and then it will then go to the city, Planning Commission. Finally, the City council, before adoption and a city text amendment, it's not exactly the same as a Euler process. It follows a similar calendar and process, but it is slightly different. So that actually concludes our presentation. I want to again thank the board for the opportunity to speak, and if you want to learn more about the proposal, I would strongly encourage everyone to check out our website. It contains a wealth of information on everything from past outreach materials to the full text and annotated form, and with that I guess, I'll turn it over to the board through the committee. Thank you so much. Thank you Jonah. We appreciate you coming down to talk to us from wherever you are and I want to note that the has already heard this presentation at the time. We weren't aware that there was a need to comment on a text amendment, so that's why it's also come to the land, Use Committee, so Ariel and Alec and I, and a couple other people have already heard this presentation. One of the things I want to know before we actually get started is with regard to the special permit that you've talked about. Does that come to the community board or doesn't it come to the community board? It does special permits are a full Euler action, so it follows the typical process, so it'll go to the community board for 60 days. Thank you. Also. I had seen that council member lander had been here and, if he's still here and if he wants to speak, I would like to acknowledge him and yes, I, see you Glenn I. Think the council member left mark I, don't see him on here anymore. Okay, I'm sorry, we didn't get to acknowledge his presence, so Glenn Kelly the floor is yours. Thank you. Mark I have a question and then I'd like to follow up with a comment. I'm looking at page five of your online materials which you presented I, couldn't tell you what page it is in your deck, but it shows three maps one showing the FEMA flood plains, one showing Hurricane Sandy, Storm surge and then the 2050s one percent annual. There you go so I'm wondering if you've looked out past the 2050s, because that's only 30 years away won't be my problem, but it's going to be somebody's problem. Katie. Do you want to take that yeah? For sure I mean the city is working closely with New York City panel and climate change and others, and is you know well aware of the need to prepare and offer support to more extensive floodplain over the coming decades? The part of the reason we present this slide is to really show the very close overlap and to send a kind of conservativeness of the proposal to you know, use the 0.2 percent chance plain as the extent of the applicability it's an area that we are able to regulate, because it is mapped by FEMA externally and but also matches very closely. The 2050s projected floodplain I want to also make clear that the nature of this text, as is currently written in the 2013 flood text, is that the provisions would apply wherever FEMA has mapped its one percent chance and 0.2 chance. Flood plain, which does get updated over time and, in fact, as many are rare, is in the process of being updated now. So this the zoning text is flexible to match where FEMA is projecting flood risk to change over time, as that will change okay. So my comment, then, is, first of all, I think you've done a remarkable job, reacting to the damage created by Superstorm Sandy, and you know I'm hoping that this these boundaries, this map will continue to follow. Fema and I think what you've come up with helps people to protect their property and I wonder why we are helping people to protect their property in these zones and, at the same time, in Gowanus and elsewhere, we are promoting higher density, which runs contrary to protecting people's property, we're putting more property at risk, more people at risk, which just doesn't make sense to me and then I would encourage you to consider what damage is going to be is going to result from this pandemic that we're in now it within a year. You were dealing with the damage from sandy, and here we are, you know, approaching a year with this coronavirus pandemic, which is going to have far-reaching effects. I mean we've lost 50 times the number of people from this pandemic and we're going to probably have far greater financial damage as a result of it. I encourage you to maybe consider that in your planning. That's all thank you. Glenn I know that Allison and David would like to speak since David is the co-chair, I'll call him first and then Allison after that? Okay, thank you mark Katie. You mentioned this December 28th deadline and I thought you mentioned something about New York state. Is it did I get that wrong or you just look at the recommendations. One of the comments in the chat that maybe wasn't clear nothing to do with the state, but as Jonah mentioned, this is a public. This is in referral. It's for public review. It's not technically a euler, because it is a text amendment not a for example, but December 28th is the end of the technically and the end of the referral period for community words. After that, after you know, comments and recommendations are collected. This will be. This is also being discussed at Burro Board across the whole city. As you're aware all 59 community boards, all five borough boards, several borough presidents- are opting to take it up. It will then go back to the city Planning Commission, who will consider, among other things, the boards that provide recommendations, and it will also go to city Council, essentially like Euler process, but that December 28th is when we're seeking to get con. Your recommendation to the safe Planning Commission, okay, so my comment: it's not really a question. Just a comment is I. Well, I! Guess there is a question, then a comment is: did you approach the Kag with this presentation and if you didn't it sounds like the Cag's. Not gonna have a chance to review it, because we just had our meeting Tuesday night I, don't believe we have we're happy to reach out to them, though well you can reach out to them, but the next meeting is I. Think there's some tag. Members on this call as far as I understand until January I realize the Kag is not. We've had plenty of our on our agenda. The last two meetings, but the Cag is trying hard for all its faults to tie things together and try to see how they impact the Superfund site, and this seems to have a pretty big impact on a Superfund site. So I'm surprised you didn't even include them in the community vetting process, so you know we've as a department. We've engaged with the cag I recognize that we have not yet offered a specific presentation during this referral period, but we are happy to come out and you know answer questions or if they want to provide questions, we can have that discussion. It doesn't necessarily need to be prior to that December 28th. The public review process is going to go on for several months past that we can follow up if there are questions from the Cad or a request yeah before it goes before, Houston goes. Let me ask you whether or not people individuals are permitted to comment outside of the community board process. Well, anybody will be able to weigh in at a public hearing by the Cpc as an individual, including in writing, while the Cpc conducts their review and as well as I mentioned. This goes to City Council, so engaging with your city, council member is also a way to get involved. Thank you, Allison. So yeah hi I mean my questions were similar to David's in that I just wanted to I guess understand a little bit more about the input process for the neighborhoods that are affected. For you know the general public. So I, you know, I, don't know if anyone you know if you've presented this to any of the community groups than red hook, which was you know, was significantly affected by Sandy. Obviously you know such as resilient red hook and I'm a member of resilient red hook. I, don't think we've you know had any contact from DCP on this yet and I'm sure that you know the committee would really like to see the plan and discuss it and have comments. I mean, as is now is the December 28th deadline. Is that for any input- or you know, are you going to be going to community groups and the general public at another time to get their feedback? I think we'd be delighted to go to the resilient red hook. Group I also I just want to say that the you know this period up to the 28th is really focused on the community board's review. Okay, so we're accepting comments, we're glad to work with groups. You know throughout the process and just to quickly I guess putting on my other hat from past work in zoning, for quality and for the Zqa MIH period. We actually did accept many community board recommendations after their deadline, so we're it's a slightly different process than typical Euler, but we do as much as possible. We do want to get the boards reviewed by the 28th. Okay, I mean yeah I just wanted to make sure that there will be time for a broader. You know community input and you know also given that I mean it's already the first week in December. You know, and you want our comments back for in three weeks. That's you know if it's just the community board, I guess that's doable, but you know for a larger public review and comment period. I think you're going to need more time and to spend more time you know interacting with local groups like such as the Cag or resilient red hook and other community groups agreed. Thank you yeah. One of the reasons we put it on the community boards land use calendar for this meeting was so that we could get something to tcp prior to the deadline, which means it has to go to our general Board at our December meeting, which is next week. So that was the constraint. Next up is Ariel Krasnow, hi I. You know, I saw this last week and I guess my two thoughts, because it's there's so much information in here and it's clearly you're trying to make amends for issues that have come about since sandy and looking ahead but I. It strikes me, especially in a couple of years, slides where you show the progression of how you come to where some of your recommendations, I'm I, would like to assume that this is not. This is a something that is coming to us this year, but this is likely going to change as people start building this out you're going to find, it seems pretty clear to me from a lot of the photographs that you showed that building out at this at some of these recommendations just may not create terrific street edges and environments at the ground plane, so to speak, which is hopefully most of the time other than doing a flood. So I guess so. One of my questions is and I my question last time when I was around materials and how we build this stuff, because and as I watched it again, this time around I, I'm even more concerned about some of the ways in which, for lack of a better term, you know the sense of space at the environment at the ground plane is not has not been addressed. This is really a matter of helping out people who live in buildings and make them habitable, but not for the rest of people around, and so even where you did where some of your drawings do show a lovely interface. Some of that, for instance, along the Gowanus canal, which already is getting you know these very hard bulkheads in and so I guess. My question is I'm hoping this is something that is still is not being voted on and will be assumed to be held for a while. But it's going to be worked with other teams up around the city that will help to make actually incorporate some of the nicer sketches that you showed, which I didn't see in the actual criteria like along the Gowanus canal. Where you know the actual building levels are higher, where we can actually get down to the water things like that which are not happening now as construction is happening, so that so I guess. My question is your sense of this as something within a time a longer time frame and also I. Think it's been spoken about before in terms of I love the idea that we continue to live where we are, but connecting to other agencies. Other like how we evacuate how you know I was very much in favor of a nursing home that is in red hook. That might have been in the flood plain I thought. That was a shame that didn't happen. Yet it worries me that you say that shouldn't be there, but other people can because there could be similarly people who might be living in a nursing home in a regular home there. So I want to make sure that where we are going to be living is good for everybody, and that worries me so I think it should be good for everybody and it can be good for everybody. This seems to me to be a somewhat of a band-aid, so I'm hoping that it's something that we need to do now in order to continue to develop, to continue to grow, but that you're looking at this as not an end, but something that's part of a process, just wondering how your thinking is on that yeah. Thank you. That's very good perspective. I will say you know it has been eight years since Hurricane Sandy, and that means we've been working on this for seven years, and this has been part, and many of you have. Many of you have been part of a very extensive community engagement process, including, as I mentioned a workshop specifically in red hook, and to talk about the facade conditions, and you know potential zoning relief needed to help the that particular stock of buildings. The department holds that kind of workshop and that kind of engagement over the years across the diverse waterfront landscapes of the city, and so we do believe that we have captured a large range of options and incentives, particularly on, as you mentioned, the streetscape. So you know it is a very prime goal of ours to not only to you know when we get these buildings that are designed to a high resilient standard to not sacrifice our streetscape and in particular, as Jonah, went through there's several provisions not just for residential, but also for commercial corridors, to make it so that it's more likely. We still have entrances, for example, at grade or at least inviting spaces. And you know, we should make clear that all of these new buildings and renovations are still gonna have to comply with ADA access, even if on the interior, they are elevated and we're trying to make that easier as well, by adding flexibility for where ramps can be placed. For example, you mentioned that the nursing home as a particular set of regulations for a particularly vulnerable population. It was identified that nursing homes, the facilities themselves and the community members that they serve do have a very unique and critical dependency. That is exacerbated both in circumstances of evacuation, a need for evacuation as well as shelter in place, so it is kind of the particular constraint of those facilities and those populations grouped within them that led to that element of the proposal for that vulnerable part of our community I know you addressed a range of things in there I will you know open it up for Jonah if he recognizes that I missed anything or if we want to go back? If there was anything I missed, maybe I could just okay can I ask one more question quickly, so, for instance, on the use spaces at the ground floors in the larger buildings. This would be a perfect place in which time to coordinate with your colleagues at DCP in terms of Gowanus, where you know perhaps large, open spaces that might need it could be I. Don't I'm not I, don't know exactly what those use cases might be, but let's say performance, spaces or art spaces that could easily that could be used in that sense, is there any way in which that's being coordinated at the honest rezoning, for instance, in terms of those open, large open ground, floor spaces and possibly different incentives related around that? Definitely to answer your question short, yes and we'll take that back and take a closer look at how you know we're making sure that we're accommodating for those uses I also I just want to say that you know the focus of the flood text is really twofold. You know making a lot of the temporary measures permanent and really focusing on the buildings scale. Improvements to the waterfront and resiliency require almost every single agent. It's a very complex system that we know, and we really want to do our part at city planning to really make sure that zoning is as best as possible aligned with the strongest resiliency practices and enables that when buildings are reconstructed or rehabbed within the floodplain, so I just wanted to emphasize that. Thank you. Yes, I do know you had a workshop in red hook, because I attended the workshop in red hook and it lasted for quite some time, and it was very interesting. Joanna Smith wanted to speak, hi a wonderful overview of all the work you guys have been putting in, and I'm especially excited about. The focus on keeping the streetscape active I think that's such a priority for everyone at CB6 curious. If there are any plans to it might be the getting ahead of things, but to incentivize property owners to do the dry flood proofing approach, as opposed to raising just in terms of all those ADA issues and the active street front. If there's anything that can be done on the planning side to show some preference towards that treatment, wondering if you guys have coordinated with DEP about noise issues around the mechanicals moving them, you know to different parts of the lot and impacts on adjoining properties. Noise mitigation, curious about the nursing home, Venn diagram of that seniors, and that's people who need medical care. So should we also be talking about senior housing? Should we be talking about medical facilities also having these exemptions? For the same reasons, and oh, you know, it would be very useful and I think it would come out of planning is some kind of map or visualization of how many properties in CB6? Are you know what the different usage cases are and what the different income brackets are of the owners of those properties, because I could see there being a big. You know spread between a residential owner, low income being able to make any of these good suggestions happen in reality, as opposed to like a large commercial owner, someone with deeper pockets. You know it would be helpful to kind of see what our mix is. I, guess, yeah, I think those are my questions. Thank you, I think I captured all of them I'll go through what I think's one by one I apologize if I missed something you asked about incentivization for dry flood proofing, so just to clear make sure everybody's on the same page dry. Flood proofing is one of the a more costly methods of floodproofing a building. It often involves like very thick aquarium, glass or other materials that can withstand the force of a flood and still have uses on that ground floor. It is not permitted for an all residential building and all residential building needs to wet floodproof or elevate, but where it is permitted is like our commercial, storefronts and Jonah went through one slide. We can bring it back up if needed, but essentially the proposal is to refine an a floor area exemption that is already in place in today's one percent chance flood zone through the temporary 2013 text that exempts part of a ground floor that takes on dry flood proofing, so the property owner could locate that floor area elsewhere in the building, and so that's a form of incentive, and so hopefully that's that answered that question great in terms of a noise mitigation question I would I know. Maybe we wouldn't actually mention this in our presentation. This project has gone through or is going through an EIS, and so noise has been noise. Risk has been evaluated. It's my recollection. That is not an item that came up as a potential. I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the word. Sorry, I'm just completely blanking. It didn't require mitigation yeah that that's my understanding, yeah. So just it wouldn't come up as a potential impact through the Deis that can get you more information on that, but it has been evaluated with each of the agencies that help us. With that analysis, the question about nursing homes- and you know the kind of question of does that mean there are other vulnerable populations that we should have specific regulations for I did mention I, think in the previous response, but I want to take the opportunity to clarify nursing homes were identified through research on our part and others as a particular as a facility that essentially is home to our most vulnerable residents under conditions of evacuation or shelter in place because of their need for continuous medical care, and so it's not like other medical or different types of care facilities that are more likely to have a more easily effective evacuation plan, for example. So at this time the proposal is limited to nursing homes in scope. You know just because of the acute need. We would welcome feedback if the board has other thoughts on that, of course, and in terms of question on incomes, you know, I'm not quite sure we can get the map that you were describing, but I will note that we can, if anybody's interested point to a few other resources that are available through HPD and others. That may help property owners of limited incomes make these kinds of investments to retrofit a part of the property, and that is called the home fix program. If anybody wants to look into it before I can get any more info. Thank you very much. I, don't know of any further questions. I hope there aren't any, because we have one more item to get to, and I'd like to finish by eight o'clock for our participants. Two things one thing is I would with regard to nursing homes, I'm perfectly happy that we'd be prudent and not put nursing homes in areas where there can be difficulties. We have traditionally put them there because that's where property has been cheap, so if, as an alternative to having nursing homes in these kinds of areas, you put higher subsidies in so that we have sufficient number of nursing homes in other areas. That would be fine as an alternative to me next. So what I'm going to suggest now is that we approve of the text amendment with a caveat that we want the Department of City planning to continuously update the effects of all of this and therefore, if there are need for further text amendments to create a situation that is even more friendly to the various communities that they will do so and if there's no objection that would be the recommendation. I would make mark I have questions from the community. We have some questions from the community mark. Oh we do. I didn't know that okay didn't see come across my screen go ahead. Owen Foote has had his hand up for a while. So I'm going to allow him to speak now, oh and you have to unmute yourself now, can you hear me now? Yeah, great and I did not chat to myself. I, don't know how that worked, but anyway there was a comment in the chat. Could city planning please to slide 13? So it's like 13 of your presentation and for the community board's consideration. I. Think it's important to note the expansion of the opportunity area by which property owners will be able to build taller buildings within the confines of this proposed text amendment it allows 13, sir, please so it allows for an increase of height within the areas that are now expounded on the proposed optional rules that will include a substantial portion of the cow gardens, historic districts as well as properties outside the district. That I believe some members on the community board have argued to have expanded. It also includes the Summit Street rezoning, which the community board advised for rejection just over a year and a half ago, the borough president advised for rejection city planning approved despite the out of context height and then at City Council. It was withdrawn by the applicant. The reason why I'm bringing this up is I think it's very important for community board six members to understand the impact on the increase of height of properties that are outside the boundaries of the flood zone and have been added to these optional rules and so sorry for very long introduction. But my question for city planning is: could you please provide a scenario analysis, or at least a bulk massing to community board six so that they can understand the impact? If and when the Summit Street rezoning came back to the community board, as they had potentially attended said that they would with the R6B, but R6B will be substantially higher with your proposed text amendment due to the opportunity to increase height. Thank you very much thanks Owen. So I do you mentioned the call gardens historic district, so I do before I get into a specific rezoning. Perhaps I, just I do want to make sure it's clear to everybody that any property that is going to go through any process at LPC will still be able to make limitations kind of beyond the flexibility of zoning, so that those procedures will still be in place to you know: honor the process of historic district in terms of a specific rezoning. If it's in the point two chance flood zone I, do want to make clear that the reference plane is only going to be set at five feet. That said, of course, when that, when a proposal comes through for rezoning, I encourage the community board to ask the applicant to illustrate what they are proposing and what they you know and to make clear which will be clear in their application. What the kind of scope of the zoning envelope that they're asking for would be allowed. So we don't have any drawings of that just yet. The last time that was before DCP was prior to the you know, level detail in that five-foot proposal being finalized, but with any specific rezoning, the applicant should be able to describe how zoning for coastal flood resiliency would impact their proposal. My question was whether or not city planning would be willing to show community board 6 the 99th street, somewhat rezoning proposal under these new rules. All of the other aspects of the as of right, extra hype that the I guess, cow, gardens and North Gowanus area will be able to achieve that will not come before the community Board. But I'm trying to educate the community board member. They full stand. The increase of height that will be allowable in an R6B property and Summit. Street is the case study because it's already gone through Euler. So if city planning is not willing to provide that massing, that's fine. I'm not aware of what the exact status of that project is right now, but I would say it does need to come from the applicant DCP can't provide additional materials that the private applicant for rezoning. Can you provide any example of any site in the expanded proposed optional rule area that would further inform Community board 6 members to understand the increase of height of a new r6b building that exceeds the heights of all of the other buildings, so they can make an informed decision on this expansion area. I don't have an r6b example in front of me, but it is definitely something that we can get you more information on. Thank you ty. How many more questions do we have? As far as I know mark we have one. I'm gonna allow Brad Vogel to speak right now: okay, fine one more is good great. Thank you very much. I simply wanted to note that it you can tinker with buildings to try to make them more resilient, but the act of building large-scale residential towers in the flood plain in Gowanus is inherently not a resilient step, and so I do think that needs to be considered when people are looking at the proposed Gowanus rezoning I, don't think that the bulk of the large buildings that would be permitted under that rezoning would be resilient. Thank you, Brad and I'm sure Glenn won't. Let us forget that either yeah okay. So thank you very much now I made a recommendation for us to approve of this with the request that the process of examining what goes on be continuing, so that, if there are problems emerge, those can be corrected by a further amendment of the text. Men. So is there a second and this I'll second that mark? Thank you any objections. Let me know ty if people I'll assume you're saying yes, unless you raise your hand, no, so if there are no's, please raise your hand and tie you'll. Let me know I, don't see any hands being raised mark okay. So then we have our recommendation. Thank you very much to DCP. Thank you, everybody for their time and now we're going to move on to the Huntington Street request for Euler change, which has to do I think mainly to reduce the parking requirement for the building they're going to put up there and if I know Nick is was here, I, don't know if he's presenting for himself or if somebody's presenting for him terrific thanks, see I'll be emceeing. The presentation thanks for sticking around with us, I'm going to share my screen and here with Eric Bath from Goldman Harris yeah I was about to get to introduction. So my name is Eric. I'm Eric bath from planning and development specialist from Goldman Harris, that is the esteemed managing partner of Goldman Harris Carolina Harris, we're also joined by Nick Lembo, who will be saying words he's chairman and founder of Monadnock Construction Bill Stein is also joining us, he's the Arc senior principal at Datner architects, and we also have Gina Wirth design principal from Scape landscaping, so a lot of good faces. So let me advance this and we'll get started by way of introduction. This is an application to change the zoning district from an m21 to an m23, we're also concurrently getting a certification for a waterfront public access area, along with several authorizations for minor changes to waterfront requirements. You know the ultimate goal is to provide a beautiful esplanade on the Gowanus canal and we'd like to show you some images. So the proposed rezoning is, actually you know, as was pointed out, is to eliminate parking requirements. The other bulk and use regulations are largely the same, we'll get into specifics in a few slides, but the other purpose of this at these actions are to allow monadnock construction to move their headquarters which are located on. Let me move forward. I'll show you a slide they're located in third street on the canal, and they would like to move their headquarters within the IBZ. This will provide not only jobs in the IBZ but, as I mentioned, it'll also provide a gateway esplanade to the future Gowanus waterfront access plan, which I know the board has seen so with that I'd like to pass it over to Nick, to say a few words about Manhattan. Thank you. Everyone, I'm Nick, Lembo I, hope you can hear me I, founded Monodnock 45 years ago in 1975, and it's been in community board six from the very beginning, starting with my apartment on third place. We are a construction and real estate development company that specializes in housing, we've built, 20,000 houses and apartments and 15,000 of those homes are affordable. Some of these projects are really transformative. We did New York's, first micro unit, building or Rml place in Manhattan, we've built entire neighborhoods Nehemiah Spring Creek in Brooklyn, Nehemiah, West of Pennsylvania and Brooklyn compass residences in the Bronx, the largest middle income development since co-op city hunters point south in Queens, and one project we're particularly proud of, is Columbia Terrace on Columbia Street in CB6. We currently employ about 250 people. 80 of them are based at our headquarters on third street at the Gowanus canal, also in cbd6 we're in dire need of more space, and we would really like to keep our headquarters in New York city in Brooklyn, and particularly like to keep them in Gowanus. I, really think that this is important for the culture of a company to have this kind of continuity. As I'm sure you know, this is not an easy thing to do. In New, York city, we were lucky enough to find this property on Huntington Street, which had been a concrete batch plant we've since taken the batch plant down and built a new bulkhead on the Gowanus canal and we're proposing a six-story hundred thousand square foot building. The Nadak would occupy about a third of the new building as headquarters for its offices and its shop and have construction yard in the back of the building. Besides mononok there'd be space for light manufacturing and a cross-section of other uses. The building would also have retail space on the ground floor and we hope that would include a restaurant, taking advantage of the waterfront esplanade along the canal, which you'll hear more about later great. Thank you, Nick, just a real, quick overview of the development site. It's shown in yellow on the map on your screen. The rezoning area is the Red dotted perimeter which takes up the entire block, you'll notice. It's also on that block adjacent to the elevated subway line. That's the Smith 9th Street Subway station on the Fg trains, which we understand is the tallest elevated station in the world. So that's pretty exciting at the edge. If you look and see the blue boundary line, you'll see that the southwest Brooklyn IBZ is delineated on this map. That's runs along Huntington Street to the north of the development site and, above that, in the white line. You'll notice is the Gowanus rezoning area, so this project is literally adjacent right next to the Gowanus region of the area. The we also wanted to point out that, of course, you know. The Gowanus canal is the subject of EPA Super fund, cleanup efforts and dredging, and, as we've just heard, it will also have some impact from the flood resiliency standards that city planning is being considered. We also note on this map that the monadnock's current headquarters- you can see them up in the upper right-hand corner at the third street bridge. So it's on third street in this canal, so the as Nick mentioned they are excited to keep their jobs here and add additional jobs into the Ibc. So you know we mentioned this is an extremely transit rich area. This in the surrounding area have subway. Obviously the subway line, the bus lines we have. You can see the 61 and the 57 bike routes, not to mention pedestrian and bike access and they'll, be improved by the future of Gowanus Explana Esplanade. You know these public and sustainable travel modes provide what we think is an opportunity to change the culture in this neighborhood towards a more green and Carlos neighborhood. Here's some photos to supplement what you've received in the application materials. The top left you see the in yellow, that's the development site, and you can see the elevated train line going up above there also happens to be in the foreground. Is the New York tartar company buildings, those are actually a historic resource, not landmark but eligible, and then I also want to point your attention to the photograph on the lower left. Monadnock has recently installed a new it's a sheet pile bulkhead, which it's a significant upgrade to what was there previously. So we wanted to make you give you an opportunity to see that and the you'll see. Also in that photograph there are buses. It's has been used for bus storage. Recently now, let's talk about the current zoning. Briefly, current zoning, it's an m21 medium manufacturing district with an far f2 pretty low, far and a maximum height of 110 feet. Maximum building height, a parking is currently required, based on square footage of the uses and the number of employees. What this leads to are actually very high parking requirements for manufacturing districts based on the program that Nick proposes 242 spaces would be required for this project and that would effectively make Monednock's use infeasible, because if you try to do below grade parking, it's prohibitively expensive due to the high water table at great parking, the area of 242 vehicles would practically take up the entire site, which is meant for not only Nick's building, but his construction yard, his construction business and then, if they as they've, explored in many early studies. If they tried to put the parking inside of the building, it would boost the height of the building and potentially put them up to where the bulk envelope requirements stop. So in this case the there's also, when you add in the waterfront public access area, which is 40 feet from the water line, you essentially have a huge planning challenge that no architect was able to overcome to sight all these parking spaces. So that takes us to what we're proposing and on the left. You see the existing site again in yellow the m21, extends to the west of the Gowanus canal. There we proposed then the M23 and that whole block. So you see the scope of the rezoning clearly on the zoning map. The current zoning, as we said, is far 2 maximum building height of 110 and very owners parking requirements. The proposed zoning isn't different in bulk and use regulations where it differs, is it relaxes parking requirements? Now it's also worth mentioning that M23 is a very historically it's a district that was used in waterfront areas, so it lends itself to this site. It was primarily used in Manhattan, but a Brooklyn office thought it was suitable to bring it into Brooklyn. So that is what is being proposed with that I'd like to pass it over to Bill Stein he's the architect of record for the building and he can walk you through the proposal. Thank you. Eric again, I'm Bill Stein with Dattner architects, we're the architects for the project in collaboration with Bernheimer architecture, we're proposing, as Nick mentioned, the six story, 100,000 square foot building, as you can see from this site plan. It's an l-shaped building that follows the line of Huntington Street. It does ca nt slightly to open up towards the canal and the Waterfront public access area. The three-story base of the building will be a red brick base. The setback upper three stories will be a dark gray. Brick. There are large window openings, extensive storefront along Huntington Street and along the waterfront to create a sense of visibility, transparency and activity and public access to these areas to really improve this end of Huntington Street and provide access to the waterfront. The building will include a green roof, which is shown schematically here as well as roof terraces for on the lower roofs for tenants of the building, the shape of the l-shape of the building encloses, the contractor's yard, which will be used for light construction vehicles and is accessed off of Huntington Street at the west end of the site and with that I'll turn it over to Gina Wirth from scape. Who will talk about the Waterfront public access area thanks bill yep? So here in front of you see the plan for the proposed Waterfront public access area. The zone of the wpaa is shown with the black dotted line on the map, and if you were a potential user of this landscape, a member of the public, you will be able to walk directly down Huntington Street through the public access area or through the street corridor itself and arrive directly to the esplanade. The goal of this public landscape is to create a open, welcoming and inviting space for all and to connect people back with the Gowanus canal. You can walk along the primary pathway, which is shown in gray here and walk along the edge of the water and encounter a number of different seating options which includes fixed seating, back seating, social seating. That's able to be organized as desired as well as companion, seating, that's ADA, compliant for people with disabilities. The another primary goal of the project is to create connectivity between different sites and parcels, so the project is aligned to connect with future sites to the north, to the greater esplanades that will be incorporated into the parcels that will be rezoned in the future and also to the south. There are many parties working to permit access through the MTA property adjacent to the site today, and while that access is not available today, we hope that will be there in the future and we have designed a connector pathway to the south of the project to enable that in the future, in the interim condition, we have temporary planters there to help green and create a kind of pleasing condition. Another important design element of this project is a lifted Grove the blue bubble. In this drawing on the screen. It provides a little vignette of the lifted grove. This is a place where there's lots of flexible bench seating as well as a constructed arbor, that's inspired by the industrial history of the Gowanus that will be planted with native vines and it's shaded by a large scale. Canopy planting of different native and adapted plant species, you can see a couple of areas like in blue, the retail space adjacent to the building frontage, and the goal is that the entire esplanade feels active, open and welcoming to all to speak a little bit about the planting for the esplanade, we're very focused on using a robust and resilient plant palette within this area that includes native and adapted species to the conditions of the Gowanus and we're looking for the planting beds to help manage storm water on the site. We've also proposed some interventions with the bulkhead wall that allow it to step down to the water at moments so that people can have visual access to the water and that you can have different layered resilient ecosystems embedded within the bulkhead itself. So if people have detailed questions about stormwater Sue is on the call to be able to answer questions, but I'll provide a very broad overview of the stormwater strategy. So, in addition to the green infrastructure, techniques of green roofs and stormwater planting beds, the site captures all of the storm water and does not connect back to the cso system. This is a fully separated stormwater system where there are two stormwater treatment units embedded within the contractor's yard that then outfall to a new outfall along the Gowanus that has been permitted with the EPA and then this image just shows this overall brazilian design proposal for the public espionage along the perimeter. You can see the stepped bulkhead in the foreground, that's cascading down to the water, permitting people to get closer and feel close to the water. You can also see how the entire publicly occupiable pieces of the project are lifted, so they are resilient to future flood and sea level rise events, and you can see also how there is a direct relationship with the retail storefront. So the space feels active and open and welcoming you also, if you're paying attention to Jonah's presentation, I think you can see we're using a lot of those same resilient design techniques proposed to create an inclusive and resilient waterfront within the Gowanus. The I believe just looks through a couple of different authorizations that were here today in front of this group to discuss so in terms all of these authorizations that relate to the Waterfront public access area. We are requesting these for a basically a superior design to enable some of these resilient design techniques that this site is proposing, as well as other sites along the Gowanus will need to propose in the future. The first one bulleted here is that we're proposing to modify the maximum grade change permitted on site in order to reduce flooding, enable a more resilient site design that aligns with the lot of the city guidance. That was in the previous presentation, we're looking to reduce the minimum planting area requirement, and this is directly to enable more active areas for public use and occupation and we've blended. The planting requirements with sites like the lifted grove, where we're having occupiable space and large planting beds, we're looking to wave the minimum dimensions for openings of single tree pits within the lifted Grove and that's again just an alternative design technique using structural soil that still allows for large soil volumes. That people can occupy above we're looking to modify the screening buffer requirements along a portion of the lifted Grove, and this is really to enable visual connectivity within the esplanade and finally, we're looking to increase maximum height fencing beyond the existing requirement. Just to ensure visitors, safety with the adjacent properties and the guardrail condition along the waterfront, and so with that I think I'll pass it back to Eric to speak on the requested rezoning right, so yeah thanks again Gina. So you see from the authorizations above that you know that the main purpose, too, of our application, is to rezone from m21 to M23, and you know we wanted to. Certainly this is to for the waiver of parking requirements which we think makes the project viable. So you know we'd love to hear your questions, but we ultimately would like you to you, know, approve and support this application and recommend that DCP approves it and that way we can allow Monadnock's building and this lovely esplanade is a as a gateway to Gowanus's renaissance. So thanks again for your time. Thank you very much. Of course. We all know Nick has been our neighbor for many years and is positively thought of in our neighborhood, but that doesn't mean the project is, although I've heard from Glenn Kelly and I've heard from Allison that they think this is a very good project and I of course also think this is a very good project and a boon to the community, but Julia Ehrman, who is here from Council Member, Lander's office and Council. Member lander, of course, is in fact an ex-officio member of every committee. So I would like to invite her to speak hi. Everyone thank you. Mark I am here to speak on behalf of Brad. He would have liked to join this meeting, but unfortunately he had a conflict starting at 7:45, so he was not able to speak, but we've talked a lot about this project, so I just I want to relay the only feedback that I think Brad is also excited about it and wants to have monadnock and Gowanus, and you know we we've been talking with the developer team, a lot as well as with Sbidc, since this is the first development that will be in the IBZ kind of with the rezoning and as I think. As most of you know, where city planning is working on a new framework for the Gowanus IBZ to incentivize industrial uses, and so the issue that we have been working with the developers on with monadnock is making sure that a portion of the space in this building is permanently reserved for industrial use. Obviously they will be occupying the building for the foreseeable future, and that is an industrial use and Brad is very happy about that. But we want to make sure that there's permanent industrial space and that the kind of industrial space that is available in the building is for the uses that we're trying to promote in the Ibc, so I Brad's kind of Brad's recommendation for the community board or what he would love for the community board to do is to vote yes with modification that there we need to come to a conclusion on the restrictive declaration that we're working on to reserve industrial space in this building. Thank you, and now anybody from the community board want to ask a question weigh in I know. Paul also said he thinks it's a good project. So beyond that anybody else, I was also looking at the mix in this building and right now the ratio is like 90 to some thousand square feet of office and maybe light based on what Nick said tonight and then like under 20 for industrial official, no, so I, just that was what was reported. Maybe there's some clarification the team could make, but I would like to see that higher too, like definitely make flexible space that can be used for medium to heavy industrial, not just light, and then I just wanted to sing Hallelujah Choir praise for getting rid of the parking. It's something I'm hoping we're going to be able to do throughout the Gowanus rezoning, given what a transit-rich environment is, how we're shooting for walkable bikeable neighborhoods, something just came out this week saying that the city is way behind in reaching our emissions reductions goals and every time you build a parking space you're encouraging someone to drive. So I'm excited for this project as a model. Thank you. Anyone else speak now or forever hold your peace. Well, I'd be curious. Mark. If I could to hear what the team thinks of the restrictive declaration proposal from the council member Kerry. Would you like to address that? Or should we open it up to Tom, oh you're, on mute mom? If you're available happy to have you speak or I can go ahead, so ty I? Don't suppose you could turn on Tom's microphone, Tom Mcmahon! He's, oh sure, okay I see him in the under attendees great thank you and Tom I think you'll have to unmute yourself as well: hello, Tom, Mcmahon, I'm mute! Yes, hi mark hi everybody thanks for staying so late to work on this. As Julius said, we've been going back and forth and working closely with the councilman I think we all agree. This is a great project, and so the question is, as we go through this: what's the right mix and I think the monarch team has been willing to work with the councilman on what would be a rider attached to the property that would set a level and we're just working on when we haven't been able to resolve yet on what that right level is so we're open to it. We're willing to work with the councilman and think we can get there to accomplish it. Okay, so I'm going to propose a recommendation which I hope it gets seconded. If not, then somebody else can make a motion, but I have a couple comments from the community a couple hands raised from the community: oh okay, I didn't see them. So you know me: I have no technical, Skills Owen Foote is first. Thank you and I. Second of the positive comments with regard to monadnock, as well as parking reduction. The main concern I have obviously is with regard to the so-called public amenities based for two and a half years. The community's been asking for vibrant spaces of community use, dog runs, destination areas play spaces, and once again we get a walking surface and some planting areas, so I would strongly encourage manadoc, at least to reconsider that with city planning I know there are probably strong players behind this as to what would be permissible. But what you've proposed is identical to the space in front of 363 bond street, which is just attracting graffiti drug use and teenage drinking. So I encourage you to stop by and take a look. But my question is really you show recreational boating in the waterway which is fabulous but there's zero opportunity for them to get on or off the water safely, and we have visiting kayakers from throughout the harbor. This will be a great destination for them to support your local retail, so I implore. I think it's community board six to in your proposed recommendation to the board tonight include the condition that the developer add safe access to and from the soon to be clean canal waters. So those recreational boaters actually have an opportunity to participate in this vibrant new development for the Kiwanis Community. Thank you, Vogel is next I want to could I clarify an a question that Joanna asks and answer one part of Joanna's question: please go right ahead. Caroline I can wait. I'm sorry! Thank you, I. Just the amount of space that Monadnock's going to be occupying at the very outset is about a third of the building, which is almost 30 about 30,000 square feet. It's which is more than I. Think you added up I just wanted to point that out. I actually have a follow-up question. I guess that use is that considered industrial because yeah building company, even if it's an officey-type use it's industrial, it's a construction company and their yard is a industrial use in this audience. Most uses now take place in offices even design. It's remarkable how industry has changed, but it's an industrial use under the zoning and Brad and Julia agree that use qualify. I just want to jump in really quickly because I think we you know, we do want to make sure that their uses in the building are that there is a space within the building, that's being used for industrial uses and so I think we do have some. We were not. We have not talked specifically about the breakdown between office and like the specific breakdown in the plan between office and industrial space. So I just want to say that we're still, we still need to continue those conversations and I think the understanding is that there would be space within the building. That is industrial space. Thank you, Julia, okay, so anybody else I don't want to cut anybody off. We have a few more Andrea, Parker, well ty. If I make it, he never got to Brad so Brad's. Next, then Andrea no problem. Thank you. So much no I just wanted to say as the captain of the Gowanus Rogers Canoe Club. Obviously we love the waterway and we love seeing canoes and kayaks in the renderings. I did want to echo, though Owens comment about the need for more places for safe access along the canal and I'm sure a lot of people on this call and on the project team have seen how you know we have increasingly steel, bulkheaded waterways, so it's getting more and more difficult for watercraft users to get in and out of the canal or people who happen to fall in from the bridge or from land. So that is what I would ask too, is that the committee would recommend to the board as a condition that there be some access for watercraft to get in and out of the water. My suggestion would be to try to replicate the dock at second street at the foot of Huntington Street. A second point is considering the use of mooring bollards interspersed along the edge of the waterfront, especially if this is going to be an industrial facility in part having the ability for vessels to dock along this waterway, even if only infrequently I think could actually enhance the value of this site. To a potential occupant or business and also permit other ways to activate the shoreline by bringing in educational, historical or even recreational vessels along this waterway, and it can be done in tandem with the type of shoreline that escape was envisioning, I, believe and then. Lastly, I just wanted to ask a question about what the small brick building at the corner of ninth and Smith. What's the intent for that building, because as far as I can tell from the site map, it is included in the site that would get that would go through Euler I just wanted to know about that. Thank you. So much I can respond to a couple of Brad's questions, and maybe someone else can respond to the brick building concern I, thanks, Brad and also Owen for those comments around water access. You know, I, think our team was looking at a wide variety of different potential programs and talked about different potential programs with the monadnock group. There are other sites along the canal that do provide water access and with the rezoning and other larger parcels, are available even sites just north of our project. That may provide water access in the future Brad. Your points about the bulkhead I think are quite interesting, and if you note, we are focused on not having one single tall bulkhead on the site. It does have some stepping to it to enable both visual access and ecological terraces down to the water, so that level of variability is embedded there and could it potentially be incorporated in the future to include other types of uses. So there is a inherent kind of flexibility to the design approach with that and I think. The idea about mooring bollards is quite interesting and something the team should discuss and with respect to the single story, brick building, that is part of the rezoned area, those buildings on the corner, but they're they are not part of the development site, so there are no plans for those buildings at this time. Thank you. Okay. Now we have Andrea. Okay, thank you all for this presentation. Monadnock and team I agree that this is a great project and I. I'd also respectfully disagree with Owen that this is the same as the Lightstone Esplanade I. Think, specifically, the having the active storefront on, or you know, an active commercial front that opens up to the esplanade is a huge difference, as well as more appropriate planting and occupiable space. The one thing that I, actually this isn't as much a comment on the proposal as it is on. You know, for the community board to think about as we move forward with the gowans3 zoning. Is this potential connection to the to a transit plaza in the south that would connect to the Smith 9th Street. Stop is something really critical that we should all be looking for in EIS as we see what the open space quotient is and then, as we look to capital asks to the city, it would not take much to make that space, occupiable and potentially even activated, and it would really increase the capacity for folks to get around the neighborhood. That's all. Thank you. Well, I have somebody who wants to make a motion. If we're finished with the comments, we have two more actually okay, a lot of folks want to talk on this one Celeste Lecomp, I'm here, I just plugged in my phone that was running out of juice and I'm here at midnight so go ahead. Hi. This is Celeste Lecompte and I'm also a member of the Gowanus radgers I. Won't since there are other people who want to speak, I won't say too much, but I wanted to just add my support for the idea that I'm not consider adding on water access from the site as a regular boater myself. I know that one of the real benefits down in red hook at Valentino Pier is that there is in fact actually a place for people to get out and if you spend any time there, you do actually see boaters from around the city coming in landing on the beach there visiting the local businesses, eating key lime pie, getting pizza having dinner and drinks and I think there's a real opportunity here, not just a safety benefit, but a real community improvement. So thanks just one more now mark Patrick Schnell, I'm gonna a lot of talk. Sure hi! Thank you. Can you hear me? Yeah I just want to briefly basically support what Owen said as well. The need for on water access is really there and I. Think more and more people get out on the water. It's also a good opportunity. You know for young people to become active in the neighborhood and you know just be on the water and be part of the community that way and yeah, and I'm a Gowanus dredgers, member and active kayaker and but I would also like to help really build a community of people that use the water in a productive manner. That's all. Thank you. Okay, I lied. Mark your esteemed co-chair, David Briggs has one more question to ask: I would never cut David off so go ahead, feel blessed. So this question is for Julia and Tom. Can you guys give us a sense of how far apart you are on this restrictive declaration regarding the industrial space, I mean I just want to get a sense of what are you this far apart you're that far apart I mean what's the what's? What are the two ends of the spectrum here? If you could share that sure, I'm happy to speak or Tom could go ahead either way you go Julia, I, think, from our perspective, we're getting closer. We've worked really hard together on it, and we are now going back and forth on actual agreement text and there's still some negotiation, but I think we feel like we're kind of within reach of a good agreement. Well, I'm sorry, let me be more specific. What's the range of industrial space that may wind up in this building? Well, I think we are between, what's been offered is 10 and what is in the 25 Kent Zoning text that is kind of like the benchmark for this, although 25 can obviously includes an far increase, is about 16 point, something so I think we're looking at something between those two numbers. In addition to what Monado is going to occupy, because that was that sounds like that was being considered industrial space well, that's kind of where I think we still need to talk, because we I think we have may have some I think we need to get to an agreement on that issue. Yeah and I think you know it's all in the hypothetical case that should someday not like have to leave the property or downsize. There would want to be some level of guarantee that the councilman wants that the space would be focused on industrial uses or some level of it, and you know we're going back and forth on it. We've had some good conversations with the south Brooklyn Econo Industrial Development Corporation, to work with us on coming up with a strategy and a standard. So you know I think we're cautiously optimistic that we'll get to an agreement, yeah and I believe that Ben is here so Ben. If Ben wants to say anything, I encourage that, but also I do just want to re repeat that we've talked about a bunch of. We had talked about kind of finding ways to do this in the zoning we kind of landed on a restrictive declaration, because it was kind of better more within reach of what seemed possible within the time frame, and we had talked about I think at an earlier time, Monadnock Monadnocks space in the building I think any I think I should just say it. This way that any industrial space that the nadnock is using in the building. You know we kind of had talked about that counting towards the industrial set-aside, but I think we will have to talk about I, don't think the council member is supportive of use of office space counting towards that amount. So I think that's something that we still have to discuss. Thank you, Julia, listen as a practical matter, although I totally disagree with local council people having a veto over Euler's, your local council people do have a veto over Euler So. If the council member is not satisfied with the ultimate result of the negotiation, there would be a problem for the developer. So in any event we will I would hope. We would make a resolution that supports the councilman's intent to have commercial use in perpetuity and on the site and also supports the reduced use of parking spaces and the rest of the application, and then I would suggest, and I'm going to. Let Glenn make the ultimate resolution that, if practical for the developer, that we have some way for people to get from the water to the to up to the esplanade and now I, throw it to Glenn can I add just very quickly. I know it's really late, but I. Just I do want to make sure that I say because I don't think. I said this before that. Brad is very supportive of the parking reduction and you know excited about the esplanade and excited to have Monet and like there's a lot. We really do want to make this work. So I just want to make sure that is that that's clear that was understood mark we do have one more question from a committee member Joanna. Smith would like to ask a question. Of course, I want to get out of here too, but I have a quick one for the team curious. What the relationship is like right now with the MTA and how your construction may or may not impact that big elevated thing over you don't knock it down. Everything has to be approved by the MTA. In fact, we've already gone through an approval process. There are lots of special measures we have to take when we're putting in, particularly when we're putting in our foundations and the use of a crane. Thank you Nick. He goes. This is an easy one. Thank you, Nick Glenn. Do you want to make the yes first I just want to comment that the comments, the questions? The discussion were all wonderful, so well done. Everyone. Second I served six years on the Brooklyn bridge, Park Community, Advisory Council, and repeatedly asked for some emergency egress from the water. Just in case you know, somebody falls in to my knowledge. They've never provided that so in all of Brooklyn bridge park, there's no way to get up out of the water and I think. The suggestion that we provide regular egress from the water is good for public safety, so I would encourage you to do that and now to my motion to approve of the project. The change request contingent upon the restrictive declaration being worked out with council member lander and with encouragement toward more creative public amenity as Owen suggested, is just becoming so blah, so a more creative public amenity that is perhaps a destination. If more people are attracted to it, it's less likely to result in destructive uses and attract. You know less likely to attract the wrong people and the wrong uses. It would be good for everyone I'll. Second, that any comments and again you certainly are free to comment. Please do I plugged in my phone, so I really can stay as long as necessary and if their comments, please make them we're, not cutting anybody off and at the end of the process. If you were against the recommendation, then raise your hand if you're for it, then we'll just assume that if you silent you for it, so thank you mark can I ask a point of order. Now that we have a motion on the floor, it's only committee members who can speak right. Absolutely only committee members I like it. Let's go home, although we're home already. Okay, so nobody's raised their hands ty, I'm not from the committee no well, that's only. We only do a committee vote thanks. Okay, thank you very much for the whole development team, giving us the rundown on this. Thank you for staying until 8:30. We appreciate it and have a good evening. Everybody! Thank you. Thanks. So much see you next week, some of you yeah all right and for those I, don't see happy holidays care.
