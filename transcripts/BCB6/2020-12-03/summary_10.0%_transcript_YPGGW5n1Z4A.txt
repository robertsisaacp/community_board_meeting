We let landmarks know about this change and since we originally had a staff approval, we had to go back through the process to present it to you, The community board.
You, know I understand why they wanted smaller, windows, but, You. Know I, don't know we can talk to them and see if it's, If that's something, that's going to prevent us to get this to move forward, I'm sure it wouldn't be the worst case scenario for them to paint them the same color as the wall.
It's, like a full cohesive coverage along first street cohesive buildings on Garfield, place, And I, think it's maybe even filled in here, but there's no visibility around the corner here and on the other side there are also a few gaps, but they don't allow to actually see the inside of the block, so we're completely covered here.
Then, on the second floor, we asking for an enlargement of these existing window openings, so the one on the left gets wider and the one in the middle is actually a larger sliding door that there's a pretty substantial patio here.
Well, I just had a comment, I think also about the process, and I'm just wondering it's like he's, they've already gone through and gotten approval for design, and now it seems to be, you know, fairly, significantly changing the rear facade after it's already been improved.
I want to thank many members of this committee in this community for the years of work that many of you have helped us with since Hurricane Sandy.
Many of these provisions are essentially making permanent things that are already in the zoning today, so facilitating relief to help property owners elevate spaces within their building out of flood risk and make other measures that can reduce flood risk.
And, in many cases reduce a flood insurance cost but in other cases we're expanding the applicability and also, you know, updating items that we knew kind of didn't work the first time around when we had emergency provisions after Sandy.
Coastal flood protection is a major issue in community board six, especially in red hook, Gowanus and the Columbia Street Waterfront.
This proposal really builds on two zoning text, amendments that were put in place shortly after Hurricane Sandy to help coastal neighborhoods recover and rebuild quickly.
First, We know that communities want to be able to protect buildings located in the area.
Second, We heard people want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood levels to better prepare for future storms and sea level.
I just want to take a step back to emphasize that, while the focus today is how zoning can promote resilient building construction, We really view this as part of what we call a multiple lines of defense approach that works together with other cities, state and federal initiatives or programs.
We also want to complement projects happening at the local level, such as the red, hook, interim flood protection and the area's longer term coastal resiliency plan, while also working in tandem with the Gowanus neighborhood plan.
One percent annual chance floodplain, While the proposal would seek to allow buildings in the moderate risk, 0.2 percent chance flood plain to utilize, these zoning options and in community board 6 this.
I want to show a map where the current rules apply and where the proposed changes, would, and I've also just included a photo on the left of a few homes located in an R5 zoning district in red hook.
To help illustrate this issue, you can see that the park game was provided outside, but the first floor was raised to the DFE, but that floor is not really that functional, So we're really trying to think of ways that can make improve the functionality of the buildings, but also you know in a way that kind of fits within the context of a neighborhood.
Meanwhile, when ground floor of commercial buildings are elevated, higher we'd also like to have streetscape rules to mitigate the effects of blank wall conditions and then in community board.
Now, we'd like to talk about existing buildings that don't comply with zoning, which we found to be a real obstacle for making resiliency improvements.
Mechanical equipment is often the first and most cost effective step towards resiliency, So we really want to offer more options to place mechanical equipment above the flood level, whether it's on the top of the roofs or a separate structure or within available open areas.
While, we do have some flexibility, Zoning requires the equipment to be very close to the building wall, which can sometimes block windows or access points.
So, as a result, The proposal would allow more flexibility for locating this equipment in the rear yard, provided that it's not too close to the lot line and also doesn't exceed a certain height and then for buildings that have large open areas or like thinking of the red, hook, houses or other NYCHA.
We would allow mechanical equipment to be located in open areas, provided again that certain bulk and streetscape rules are met, a big portion of the floodplain again that really affects community board.
You, know core industrial uses and commercial buildings that really have trouble elevating or dry flood proofing, either due to the high cost or just general physical constraints, But many of these business owners really want to raise their equipment and supplies and really protect against major damage or loss in the future.
Consequently, The proposal would allow all commercial corridors in the flood plain to use the first two stories for non-residential use, provided that there aren't sub-grade spaces in the building and then for existing industrial buildings that have high lot coverage and have difficulty again elevating we're proposing a small floor area exemption to encourage the construction of mezzanine spaces that can elevate, critical, equipment, inventory and office.
The proposal is considering are the effects of vulnerable populations in the floodplain hurricane Sandy and other storms really exposed the challenges facing nursing homes and their residents in areas with high flood risk, Due to the specific care needs that they have and in circumstances that require evacuation.
Accordingly, we're proposing to limit the growth of nursing homes in the one percent, chance, floodplain and other high-risk areas, in an effort to really improve the health and safety of these residents in the future, and then lastly, Sandy showed that the process itself being very lengthy to update zoning can slow down.
First, We propose that property owners who hold special permits or authorizations be given an additional term, so they have more time to complete their plan, and second businesses that don't conform to zoning use regulations would be allowed more than two years to return to operation, and currently the limit is two years based on the limit of discontinuance, As we near the end of our presentation.
I just want to stress that zoning for coastal flood resiliency is designed to work in tandem with the Gowanus neighborhood plan.
Once Gowanus is certified for public review, but just wanted to highlight that we are examining specific grading measures and elevations for developments along the canal to meet resiliency standards, while also thinking about street ends adjacent to public access areas in an effort to improve drainage and reduce flood risk.
One of the things I want to know before we actually get started is with regard to the special permit that you've talked about.
It will then go back to the city, Planning Commission, who will consider, among other things, the boards that provide recommendations, and it will also go to city Council, essentially like Euler process, but that December 28th is when we're seeking to get con.
And I'm sure that you know the committee would really like to see the plan and discuss it and have comments.
You know interacting with local groups like such as the Cag or resilient red hook and other community groups agreed.
You're going to find, It seems pretty clear to me from a lot of the photographs that you showed that building out at this at some of these recommendations just may not create terrific street edges and environments at the ground, plane, so to speak, which is hopefully most of the time other than doing a flood.
You know the actual building levels are higher, where we can actually get down to the water things like that which are not happening now, as construction is happening, so that so I guess.
Many of you have been part of a very extensive community engagement, process, including, as I mentioned a workshop specifically in red hook, and to talk about the facade conditions, and you know, potential zoning relief needed to help the that particular stock of buildings.
And you know, We should make clear that all of these new buildings and renovations are still gonna have to comply with ADA access, even if on the interior, they are elevated and we're trying to make that easier as well, by adding flexibility for where ramps can be placed.
Can I, ask one more question: quickly, so, for instance, on the use spaces at the ground floors in the larger buildings.
This would be a perfect place in which time to coordinate with your colleagues at DCP in terms of Gowanus, where you know perhaps large, open spaces that might need it could be.
It's, a very complex system that we know, and we really want to do our part at city planning to really make sure that zoning is as best as possible aligned with the strongest resiliency practices and enables that when buildings are reconstructed or rehabbed within the floodplain, so I just wanted to emphasize that.
There are any plans to it might be the getting ahead of things, but to incentivize property owners to do the dry flood proofing approach, as opposed to raising just in terms of all those ADA issues and the active street front.
For the same reasons, and oh, you know, it would be very useful and I think it would come out of planning is some kind of map or visualization of how many properties in CB6.
We can bring it back up if needed, but essentially the proposal is to refine an a floor area exemption that is already in place in today's one percent chance flood zone through the temporary 2013 text that exempts part of a ground floor that takes on dry flood proofing, So the property owner could locate that floor area elsewhere in the building, and so that's a form of incentive, and.
I, think in the previous response, but I want to take the opportunity to clarify nursing homes were identified through research on our part and others as a particular as a facility that essentially is home to our most vulnerable residents under conditions of evacuation or shelter in place because of their need for continuous medical care, and so it's not like other medical or different types of care facilities that are more likely to have a more easily effective evacuation plan, for example.
We would welcome feedback if the board has other thoughts on that, of course, and in terms of question on incomes, you know, I'm, not quite sure we can get the map that you were describing, but I will note that we can, if anybody's interested point to a few other resources that are available through HPD and others.
What I'm going to suggest now is that we approve of the text amendment with a caveat that we want the Department of City planning to continuously update the effects of all of this and therefore, If there are need for further text amendments to create a situation that is even more friendly to the various communities that they will do so and if there's no objection, that would be the recommendation.
It also includes the Summit Street rezoning, which the community board advised for rejection just over a year and a half ago, the borough president advised for rejection city planning approved despite the out of context height and then at City, Council.
The reason why I'm bringing this up is I think it's very important for community board six members to understand the impact on the increase of height of properties that are outside the boundaries of the flood zone and have been added to these optional rules and so sorry for very long introduction.
Perhaps I, just I do want to make sure it's clear to everybody that any property that is going to go through any process at LPC will still be able to make limitations kind of beyond the flexibility of zoning, so that those procedures will still be in place to you.
That said, of course, when that, when a proposal comes through for rezoning, I, encourage the community board to ask the applicant to illustrate what they are proposing and what they you know and to make clear which will be clear in their application.
Last time that was before DCP was prior to the you know, level detail in that five-foot proposal being finalized, but with any specific rezoning, The applicant should be able to describe how zoning for coastal flood resiliency would impact their proposal.
My question was whether or not city planning would be willing to show community board 6 the 99th street, somewhat rezoning proposal under these new rules.
You provide any example of any site in the expanded proposed optional rule area that would further inform Community board 6 members to understand the increase of height of a new r6b building that exceeds the heights of all of the other buildings, So they can make an informed decision on this expansion.
That needs to be considered when people are looking at the proposed Gowanus rezoning, I, Don't think that the bulk of the large buildings that would be permitted under that rezoning would be resilient, Thank, you, Brad and I'm.
The proposed rezoning is, Actually, you know, as was pointed out, is to eliminate parking requirements.
This will provide not only jobs in the IBZ but, as I mentioned, it'll also provide a gateway esplanade to the future Gowanus waterfront access, plan, which I know the board, has seen so with that I'd like to pass it over to Nick, to say a few words about Manhattan, Everyone, I'm, Nick, Lembo, I, hope you can hear me I, founded Monodnock 45 years ago in 1975, and it's been in community board.
242 spaces would be required for this project and that would effectively make Monednock's use infeasible, because if you try to do below grade parking, it's prohibitively expensive due to the high water table at great parking, the area of 242 vehicles would practically take up the entire site, which is meant for not only Nick's building, but his construction yard, his construction business.
So, in this case the there's also, When you add in the waterfront public access area, which is 40 feet from the water line, you essentially have a huge planning challenge that no architect was able to overcome to sight all these parking.
The current zoning, as we said, is far 2 maximum building height of 110 and very owners parking requirements.
There are large window openings, extensive storefront along Huntington Street and along the waterfront to create a sense of visibility, transparency and activity and public access to these areas.
Canopy planting of different native and adapted plant species, You can see a couple of areas like in blue, the retail space adjacent to the building frontage, and the goal is that the entire esplanade feels active, open and welcoming to all to speak a little bit about the planting for the esplanade, we're very focused on using a robust and resilient plant palette within this area that includes native and adapted species to the conditions of the Gowanus and we're looking for the planting beds to help manage storm water on the site.
The space feels active and open and welcoming you also, If you're paying attention to Jonah's presentation, I, think you can see we're using a lot of those same resilient design techniques proposed to create an inclusive and resilient waterfront within the Gowanus.
You know we'd love to hear your questions, but we ultimately would like you to you, know, approve and support this application and recommend that DCP approves it and that way we can allow Monadnock's building and this lovely esplanade is a as a gateway to Gowanus's, renaissance.
You know we we've been talking with the developer team, a lot as well as with Sbidc, since this is the first development that will be in the IBZ kind of with the rezoning and as I think.
Most of you know, where city planning is working on a new framework for the Gowanus IBZ to incentivize industrial uses, and so the issue that we have been working with the developers on with monadnock is making sure that a portion of the space in this building is permanently reserved for industrial use.
We want to make sure that there's permanent industrial space and that the kind of industrial space that is available in the building is for the uses that we're trying to promote in the Ibc, so I Brad's kind of Brad's recommendation for the community board or what he would love for.
The community board to do is to vote yes with modification that there we need to come to a conclusion on the restrictive declaration that we're working on to reserve industrial space in this building.
Thank you, and now anybody from the community board want to ask a question: weigh in I know.
I just want to jump in really quickly because I think we you know, we do want to make sure that their uses in the building are that there is a space within the building, that's being used for industrial uses.
So I just want to say that we're still, we still need to continue those conversations, And I, think the understanding is that there would be space within the building.
So much I can respond to a couple of Brad's questions, and maybe someone else can respond to the brick building, concern I, thanks, Brad and also Owen for those comments around water, access, You, know.
You know, for the community board to think about, as we move forward with the gowans3 zoning.
But I would also like to help really build a community of people that use the water in a productive, manner.
We've worked really hard together on it, and we are now going back and forth on actual agreement text and there's still some negotiation, but I think we feel like we're kind of within reach of a good agreement.
