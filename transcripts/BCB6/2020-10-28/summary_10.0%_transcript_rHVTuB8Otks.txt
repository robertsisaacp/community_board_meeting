Just tell just say something that you think everyone should know about you and most important, because Jason has remained chair of the youth part of the committee and I'm still chair of the education part of the committee, but Tiffany Reed Brown is now the new human services chair of the committee, so welcome Tiffany, hi Tiffany there.
In District 15., like everybody else in the city, we are talking about the policy of adjusting from blended to remote and vice versa that the chancellor came out with this past week and it went from being a series of opportunities to one more opportunity.
Parents will be able to complete a survey on November, 2nd from November, 2nd to November 15th, determining whether they want to move their child from remote to blended or vice versa, but most like, most importantly, we're looking at blended, because that means the children would be impacting the actual presence in school, and so principals are very eager to get this information and to figure out how they're going to support the children.
When we talk about assessment, because bridget can tell you and anybody who's worked in the school system can tell you that oftentimes assessment was used very heavy- handedly, basically to seek blame to seek a rationale for blaming people for things or to say that this made something unsuccessful.
It may take a while for them to adjust your medication or change your medication to get you where you need to be, but they are not going to give you too expert and tell you to take it for the a year and then come back, and so that's what we can not do with our children.
It is connected to the child's well- being Do. They need support It's more of a social emotional piece, just trying to make sure that we connect with all of our kids that they're safe, and there is no punishment for attendance in terms of grading.
Jason was talking about the census at the food banks and that's exactly what they did, which is very different than talking to people that they do not know from the department of education that they do not trust, and especially in communities that have been historically disenfranchised and redlined, where they feel that their voice is not counted.
We are going to be doing work in terms of supporting schools in terms of classroom , libraries in terms of parent workshops in terms of all working around culturally responsive curriculum integration, efforts, all kinds of work around that we're very excited about this, and because we have this three year, long, grant.
I, just want to like say in front of the committee in front of the guests that it's been I was at your high school on on Burm, the Burm Hill High School, and Thank you out loud and your PPES and the custodians were working well with the principals and the teachers and the teachers felt as part of the community, and it was just such a pleasure going into those schools.
They've been remarkable, they're very the chancellor came to one of our schools and they said, and the chancellor was like coming into 32.
They've changed the time frames a little bit, obviously because school started later, so he gave them a set of time frames and they're doing everything they need to do to make sure the kids are safe.
Yes, and answer your question: bridgette, the schools are clean, the kids are coming to school and we are working as a community, very tightly.
And, then the second question I had was The first one about the par process We do not know what's going on in terms of the timeline yet, but it is an expectation that they will come forward with some recommendations.
Obviously, we've been doing them fairly, frequently, I would say once a week since Covid-19 happened, because now that you can do it virtually it's not the same as asking principals to come out of school for a day.
This is especially true in the upper grades in high school and middle school, where teachers often say well, You did not come to my class enough times, you're, not getting the seat credit.
There is if a parent is concerned, or if there's an issue, please tell them to reach out to me and we will follow up, but our principals have shared with their teachers that this is the policy and that's where we're going, and it makes sense, because if a child can show mastery of the work, they should be able to get credit up for that work, and it also enables kids to do work that they're really interested in, and it also deals with mitigating circumstances.
One of the things that we're working with enrollment on is subtitles because we want to make sure that they are available in the languages of our district.
The principal of the high school for the arts is a musician and he plays a brass instrument He said you do not want kids in a room together when they are blowing into a brass, instrument.
It enables the teachers to kind of like take the temperature of what's going on This is when you're talking about trauma You're also talking about how do we support families?
You know which I'm very happy about our schools do, as I said, they're doing yoga The discussion is so important, but one of the things I'm most proud of my principals and my people is that they really care about their families, and When Covid-19 hit, we had a lot of families that had food crisis that did not have enough food and so especially in sunset, park, but also red hook.
This to me is super important, but another thing that happened that talks to the need for families is that principals were literally delivering food to families.
You know the atmosphere of coming to speak to your parent corner because see I work in the schools, too.
That makes a difference in a child's life and we have trained our teachers to be very cognizant of the needs of our children, and if there is a problem- And, it is not noticed and somebody in the school will notice, it, and hopefully that will happen- But I know that our district is very cognizant of the needs of children, because principals reach out to us teachers reach out to us and teachers reach out to principals, and they know their kids I have to ask you one question: why did the mayor change the policy for the Opt- in and opt out?
So, you want to go back to remote, And When you see that the curvature goes down, and then you want to go back to the school building And, it's not about the teachers It's about the fact that parents get nervous with the rise of culver cases, and he does things this mayor, and he just you had a big controversy at the Orange Zone School P.S 130, where they closed the school , I'm talking about city, I have to be honest with you and say that I do not know.
Million dollar So I recall the secret grant when we were It is exclusively to work on the diversity and integration initiative, and so we're able to do things like culturally, responsive libraries, training for families, training for school bias.
So many pieces, there's PA outreach to parents, we're going to be working with a variety of strong academic and social justice organizations to ensure that our schools are getting what they needed.
We thought that the award should be about is that we know that there are many students, either in the grade, schools or the middle schools or the high school who have been working to help during this crisis, either by doing more than just like volunteering at a food pantry, but actually organizing a food drive or some sort of something above and beyond, and we thought that the awards this year should recognize those efforts, we're not quite sure how many awards we want to do.
We, can reach everybody and suggest to the schools that they nominate students who have done amazing things, because some of them have I'm sure, and so we will spread the word for you no question and thank you.
Then that gives us a little more time to kind of like which shed this And really We probably need to start telling people about it right around December or January, Every January, great question.
Like another child, creating- You, know for doing something within the community, not something not something that was done in a school.
Then we should call this one like the borough, citizenship award or something like based upon what kind of recommendations are coming right, but I think it's just important to set the parameters so when they send it when they, when they send it out to the schools that they know exactly like the requirements that you had to have.
If there's any schools that we know of that has any ideas for Pb that they should reach out to Brad's office and same thing on other items, parks, items, etc.
