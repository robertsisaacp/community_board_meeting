Everyone remember, if you want to speak, remember you have to unmute, which means that you have to get rid of that red line through your microphone. You do that at the top or the bottom of your screen, or just hit the space bar okay, I'm on my ipad. So I can't do that. Then, no, I know we're going to wait till like 6:40 and then we'll get started. Is it just me or does anyone else feel like captain tom beautiful, unless you think I'm not paying attention I'm texting with Mike so that we can get through this? So why I said, lest you think I am I was not. I am. I am texting with Mike so that we know where we're going. Yeah, I'm just kidding, looks like it's time. I'm trying to get video work. This morning, we've been on two others. Here's our discussion, one of our discussion, 7a, do not worry. This is also listed in the discussion section and you have 20 minutes to complete. This dog is also very loud jerry long as we're waiting for anybody. What are they building next to ikea, these little square towers? The square towers are elevators, shafts and stairways. It's going to be a mile end last mile warehouse not sure where the final tenant will be. Okay. Thank you. I figured you'd know so. Okay, good evening everybody, hey Leroy, Hollywood hello, good, to see you Haley Roy good, to see you good to see everybody. Yes good evening, everybody. You can't see me and I do not know what I'm trying every possibility you may be logged in on the wrong link whoever's having trouble with their video, because I think, there's a general one and then a panelist one thinking, okay, it's 6:40, so we're going to get started, welcome everyone to the first and probably not last community Board six zoom meeting, unless you think that we've abrogated our responsibilities there, honestly up until now, has not really been anything to vote on. You know Mike, and I talk you know usually several times a week by phone or by chat. We've sent out some letters in support of you know a variety of things since since March things to do with the schools, with the the upcoming rezoning and Gowanus, and other issues usually pointed out to us by the chairs of those respective committees. So I encourage any committee chair. You know if you have an issue that you think the community board needs to take a position on to bring it up to Mike he'll bring it up to me, and I do not think I've turned him down yet on something that he that he wanted to do. On the subject of the rezoning, the city has informed us that they believe that it will be certified in January or at least that the process will begin. The department of city planning is coming to the landmarks and land Use committee meeting on October 22nd. I urge anyone who is interested in that to get on that. Zoom call and listen in you know, even if you, even if you do it, you know, while you're doing something else on you just to begin to refamiliarize yourself with what's going on. Obviously, a lot of time has passed. We have no idea how much the city has changed things so we're just going to have to sort of see what we're just going to have to sort of see what happens other things that are going on. We have some new board members we have had, since I do not know June or July. They are Michaela Balderson, Natasha, Ahmet, Rebecca, Colbert, Tiffany, Reed, Brown and Alec Sharon Beck. Some of those people have already participated in some of our meetings and things like that and we we welcome them. I also think it's appropriate that we take at least a minute to remember. You know you know, since we have not seen each other in quite some time. Many of us have lost loved ones. You know, over this period of time, Bob's wife passed away, bridget's, mom passed away and the entire community lost Buddy Scotto who passed away in September, and you know it's we're working with Brad Lander's office on a on a street co- naming. I think it's just a matter of figuring out what street it's going to be. So we hope to have more than on that, probably at our November meeting right with the phrase, because I get the feeling that it means that people do not care the consequences of how they manage water. I'm getting is somebody speaking to me. Okay, obviously not. We've also had, as some of you know, Kathy price, who was the chair of our Human services committee, left the community Board to take a position on a mayoral appointment on an education committee that you know gets input from parents and things like that on a whole wide variety of education issues. We wish her well in that new position, but unfortunately it required her to resign from the Community board. So I've asked Tiffany Reid Brown to be the new human services chair and she has agreed to do that. You know she's, you know she's eager to get started, and hopefully you know we'll be able to have more committee meetings. We've had some meetings of economic and waterfront development and landmarks and land use by zoom, and you know if committee chairs have issues that they want their committees to consider, let Mike and ty know and we'll try and set up a zoom call for you and we'll go from there. I ask if you're, not speaking, if you please make sure that you're muted, so that we do not hear your side conversations other than that. I think that's, oh well, and once again, Jason Reichel will do the election related stuff. We have an obligation, according to our bylaws, to appoint you know, suggest new members of the executive group and he'll make his report beginning tonight, so that we can complete the process in a timely manner. We expect, unless you hear otherwise, to continue to meet by zoom on a monthly basis, because you know, even though you know this is not over by a long shot. We expect more issues to come to our attention and, as I said, I encourage any committee chair that has an issue that they want to take up to, let Mike know and will, if you know we at the very least, we'll write a letter. You know, if not we'll, try and put it on an agenda and have a zoom committee meeting and we'll go from there. I know we're joined by a couple of elected officials, but I know Bobby Carroll is here so if he wants to to speak so that we can let him get on with his with his life, I would invite him to do so now. Thank you, Peter and good evening. Community Board sex, it's great to be back with all of you. I wish it was in person, but obviously we are still living through Covid-19 and I'd be remiss if I did not add to Peter's in Memoriam of all of those folks in the Greater Brownstone community that we lost my predecessor, somebody who I knew my whole life Joe Ferris, who I'm sure many of you knew and if you did not know him, you know help found the Park slope. Civic Council helped found the tour italian Road, Neighborhoods Association was served in the assembly representing Park, Slope, Windsor, Terrace parts of sunset park and Gowanus for a decade, and he passed away due to Covid-19 this summer. For many of you, if you live in district 15, it is possible that your son or daughter's school was closed last week due to the Covid-19 hot spots in parts of southern Brooklyn. This is a huge issue and I am not happy with how the governor or the mayor handled this issue. You know, I think, we're one large community here in Brooklyn and we need to either have precision based highly specific closures or we have to do broad- based closures. What the governor has done is neither he's closed lots of schools and businesses where there is no community spread, while also not drilling down, to try to identify the specific actors and institutions who are flouting social distancing guidelines, as well as other health guidelines and trying to remediate that situation, and so we kind of have a worst of both situations. We have lots and lots of folks who were flouting rules still flouting them, and we have lots and lots of folks whose schools and businesses had no cove, no detectable Covid-19 in them closed and not with any metrics to say when they'll reopen. So I've been talking to lots of parents, lots of businesses about this most of it. None of it currently is in community board six. It's mostly in community board. Seven, that's dealing with it, but obviously they are adjacent to one another. But if you do have an issue or a concern with your son or daughter's school or anything that's going on, if you have a small business, while we try to work through these Covid-19 guidelines, this fall. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me or my office. This is of the utmost importance, because, obviously this is going to be a long fall and winter and we need to get through this together and with cogent guidelines that we can all follow. And currently neither the governor nor the mayor are very cogent or forth with or forthright with their with their guidelines, so that businesses, schools and others can follow them and understand how to comply, and I find that very frustrating on a just very broad note. Obviously, the city and the state are under mass budget constraints. What we will need to raise revenue. I really hope that Joe Biden is president of the United States, and we have a working federal government that realizes they need to help bail out our state and local governments. After 9:11 New York City got upwards of 20 billion dollars of federal aid for our state, local governments and our small businesses. We need something similar to that, but that in and of itself will not close all of our gaps. We will need to raise revenue in places that can most afford it. We will also need to make some cuts. I think the gut. I do not think those revenue, raisers or cuts will come until the first quarter of next year. The way the governor has basically maneuvered, there is some borrowing that I believe he will do in the next few weeks after the election to see whether he thinks who is president and who will be the majority leader of the U.S Senate, and then he will act accordingly and then the legislature will follow. With that note, if anybody has any quick questions, I'd love to try to answer them, but I know you guys have a packed agenda. Anyone, okay, thank you! Bobby! Thank you guys have a great night. Thank you too. So one thing I forgot to mention is that if you're, if you've been down fourth avenue, you perhaps noticed that they expanded the bike lanes from they had stopped them at a certain point and added that extra lane for traffic purposes. I honestly can't recall and eric perhaps you know more about this than I do, but I had thought that was a commitment that the Department of Transportation had made to keep that extra lane, and I would have thought that they would have unless it's because of what's going on that they did not come to the community Board to tell them that was going to happen, but it's obviously happening it's already done in pretty much all of the so oh we asked them to continue it. Okay see there. I did not know that so. Okay, I've learned something very good. Okay, great, so we're going to do before we go on to the motions we have we're going to do the elections report from Jason hi, it's good to see everyone's face. It's been months. I do wish I'm looking forward to when we can start doing this in person and I'm really surprised that it's time for elections already so the current exec board is running for reelection. But if anybody else is interested in running over the next month, please drop an email to Mike and I'll put this in the chat as well. It's mike Bkcv6.Org and you can nominate someone else or nominate yourself and then next month we will have elections for the exact one. Well, the voice votes like you can nominate someone like voice and if there are no challengers, the current panel just stay. The current slate of officers stays on and if there is a contested race, that voting will be done in December and if that occurs, we will figure out how to do what need what needs to be done, because it needs a paper ballot. Sadly, a pre- covered yeah, I think we'll do a Google survey or something if that were to yeah we just need to have. We just need to have a record of how each person voted, so you know, but we'll figure that out, but you know we'll take it from we'll, take it from there. So we do actually have two motions from economic, waterfront, community development, housing. So Ariel, I think, is going to tell us about those. Would you want me to go? Remember you have to unmute Ariel Good Mike Mike's going to do his report. Do you want me to do me before? Oh I'm, sorry, I apologize. I apologize. That's great Mike. Let Mike go ahead. District manager's report, no problem, hi, everybody nice to see everyone in semi- person. I never thought I'd miss Meeting in like a school auditorium, but I do anyway just a few quick items. I've been talking with most people about committee assignments and things like that. You know any various shifts, especially our new members. I want to first congratulate Tiffany Brown for coming on. As our human services chair, I've been working with Tiffany has joan at her Warren Str at Warren Street in the tenant election she's fantastic, I think she'll, add a great perspective to the executive committee. So congratulations there and Peter mentioned the letters. We've been writing and things like that and taking positions. We took one just recently as recently as yesterday on red hook. Trucks. Please remember if you're, not muted, we can hear your cross conversations in the background. Thank you, hey Mike, can't you, everybody yeah. I think so, but or todd can you do it, whoever the host is, they should be able to mute yeah. I do not know thanks. Okay, now I'm the host officially. So now I think I can well. I can me okay good. I can mute everybody there. We sorry Suzanne. I just muted you to prove a point to see. If I could do it. Okay, all right think there we go. Okay, somebody still it's not me. I said to spread this information. Okay, we can hear someone's television in the background. Oh here we go mute all right. It's bridget, I'm, oh my god. Okay, so can you still hear me give me yes? Okay! Thank you. So speaking of things, we've written yesterday eric mcclure attended the resilient red hook, meeting on Cb6's behalf and Peter, and I talked about it prior and hildegard, our very own hildegard, who is our environmental protection. Chair co- chair with Angelica Ramdari asked for a comprehensive, a comprehensive traffic study for truck traffic and red hook because- and I think someone was mentioning it while we were not on mute all the various development sites that are going on in red hook and coming up, and you know like an Amazon site and ups and these things, and you know, while they're looking at them in isolation. These are going to come on line over the next. You know a few years, and you know the consequences are going to be tremendous and we, I think, as as red hook, is part of the larger Community Board. Six district certainly matters a great deal, and I want to thank, I think, that the people at brazilian red hook, including Hildegard and Alex and Jim Tim, Pakis, and so many others, have done a great job and they brought it to our attention. I think we're going to put it- and I was talking to tai about this earlier in our district needs assessment later this month. So thank you, I think Hildegard's on here, but I can't see everybody at once. So, thank you, and also, and just one other thing on the committee stuff. So I just I messaged with Glenn, who I know just recently returned from Europe that we'll have a parks meeting next week and I think we're going to try to get an environmental component to it, and a public safety transportation on October 29th I'll be sending out more notices. But again, this is the sixth time and it's happened under the raciopose fleming reign. If you will that every committee is going to meet this month once again, and that's actually in the time that CB6 has had these committees, it's only happened six times, and it's happened in the last year and a half so that, hopefully those meetings happen because I you know do not want to jinx anything, but because we were supposed to meet Morris as well, and that obviously did not happen so anyway. The other thing was that I know I've been getting a lot of questions about elections. Early voting starts October 24th and I did text with our new female district leader, Jesse Pierce, who was going to jump on to give us a heads up on some of the stuff regarding the board of elections and that she said that if you signed up for a class be sure to attend, but there was a big volume of people signing up so they're all full. So if you have not heard back it's because they're packed, but they are also offering online classes. I know Karen is actually teaching Karen Broughton our board secretary. I think he's attending and teaching one as we sit here. If you have an absentee ballot, you can drop it off at any site and any voting site. There's like a box for that and any board of election site in for Brooklyn. That is 345 Adam Street. I do not know. If you've ever been to the board of elections, it's a pretty, not fun place. It makes the dmv look great, but that's basically it and if you want to sign up again, thank you for everyone who signed up for the newsletter. It's actually I've felt a lot of appreciation doing it and it feels great. It's kept me at least closer to scene during this whole period. So thank you and if you want to sign up for it, bk text Bkcb622828 or go to Brooklyncb6.Org and sign up for it and that's my Spiel tonight and I'm going to try to unmute everybody now there I think it's all unmuted. Now that is Peter on I am now I hear you Peter, so I apologize one thing I forgot that I did, and I just did it yesterday- was that by merit of my position as Chair Community Board six, I am on the board of the Pacific park. Conservancy, for those of you who do not know Pacific park is the new or formal name for the Atlantic Yards projects, so it was just business as usual. We elected a new treasurer improved the budget for the coming year, and but you know there are two buildings under construction and as each building comes on, if there's another building next to it, the open areas are joined to each other. So they've got money plan. I was not aware that yeah I was on the you want to continue, but I was on the board where we are hearing you, I muted her. I think, okay, so you know, I was not aware that I was on there but live and learn. So it's apparently the first time they've invited me to the meeting. So that would explain why, but I will participate in the future and I'll bring you any I'll. Bring you any information that comes, but you know the group is functioning. You know they have a budget, they are taking care of the properties there have money for landscaping and for cleanup and they're going to be ordering some new furniture for next year. Some of them are not in community board six, but some of them are so. If you have an air, you know an inclination to wander over in that area. There is some public space and you know it. It will be growing as more buildings are developed. So now I guess we're going to go to Ariel and she's going to present the two motions that came out of economic development. Arrow you have to unmute Mike, do you have to do something for Ariel to unmute? All right, you're still muted should be something on your screen asking if you want to unmute I've gotten those, so I do not know if they were supposed to go to Ariel. Instead, I keep getting these people. I went to everybody got it, you got it there we go. Are you being selective in your choice? Not at all I I'm trying to be as democratic as possible about this hi everybody. Can you hear me everyone hear me, I guess a thumbs up if you can okay good, so we've had three economic waterfront community development and housing meetings in on by zoom and the last one in the beginning of October was what sort of came out of the earlier one in July, which was or actually in June. When there was a one of the letters that Peter was. You know he referred to a number of letters that went out. One of them was in support of the commercial lease assistance program prior to the budget getting passed. It was not including the budget, and then a number of things happened, an article in cranes. I do not exactly know what happened but Joni clutter, who is the commissioner of the Office of administrative trials and hearing otherwise known as oath was involved in that and Mike who's involved in everything, got a letter of thanks from her and she agreed to come to our committee and just as a side note. At the end, the cla commercial lease assistance program was reinstated in the budget. In fact, and what and the reason that's sort of a segue to our October meeting is that that had to do with mediation, between landlords and tenants and what what Joanie clutter came to speak to us about, and she brought her Deputy Commissioner Marissa Sanego and the director of the city's Office of Nightlife Arielle palettes. They were coming to promote the mend NYC, which is mend, stands for mediating, establishment and neighbor disputes, which is essentially through mostly about hospitality issues between neighbors and and a business or and they're starting to do between businesses and their landlords as well. So I think in some ways it would have been really great that have been a joint meeting with permits and licenses, because it was had a lot to do with some of the issues that permits and licenses deals with and essentially what they it's, a very new department that started right before we went into lockdown and they what they do. Is they, instead of just going straight to some sort of enforcement, because someone has called in a lot of complaints to 3- 1- 1. The idea is that they will mediate between the two parties who are unhappy, so I urge everyone to either watch. I think it looks like it's posted that the entire meeting was posted, but also there are notes that you can review. Joni did not have a presentation, but between the three of them it was quite a. It was an inspiring presentation about how we can do business differently, and I think, and at the end of their presentation mark, suggested that we do a resolution to support mend and to continue funding for it into the future. So it's a paragraph I do not know. Is it if I'm not sure if everyone has this was if the board members received it or not, or if I should read it any direction for me on that from go ahead and read it, we've got where you know it's not that late. So we still have some time. Brooklyn community board, six upon recommendation from the economic waterfront community development and housing committee, members and chairs would like to go on record in its support of Mend, NYC, mediating, establishment and neighbor disputes. This valuable new initiative from Oath center for creative conflict resolution is critically needed during this difficult time as restaurants and bars fill the streets and as long- term resources for future and as a long- term resource for future mediation. Brooklyn community board 6 regularly works to resolve disputes between hospitality, businesses and their nearby residential neighbors, and we are familiar with the strife that this can cause. The goals of mend to seek a genuinely conciliatory solution will be an enormous benefit to the Community board and will help to ease disputes between residents and businesses and improve the general quality of life in our neighborhood. We are in favor of the continued financing and expansion of this program and it's if it's approved it will be signed by Peter, Rick, Mark and myself. So let's try and do this the easy way we're going to assume that you're in favor of this motion, unless you signify by you, know either saying in the chat or on muting yourself and saying so that you're against it so I'll give you a minute or two to do that if you wish, but otherwise we're going to assume that everyone is in favor of the motion. God bless you thank you. So any objections, hello. This is Mark shames yeah. I have no objections, obviously, because I made the motion, but what I would like to do is give the chair of the permits and licensing committee an opportunity to indicate whether she wishes to sign on to the letter. Since men has a tremendous impact, particularly on those kinds of small businesses, we took it up in the economic Waterfront Development Committee, because it is a small business matter, but it is also very relevant to permits and licenses. So I would like to know if she would like to be or signatory on the letter as well Rachel you can just do thumbs up or you can amuse yourself still muted. Oh here we go there. We go that sort of counts. So again, this is a motion to this is a motion to state our support for this program and our desire to work with them. You know on anything where we can be of assistance for matters that occur in our community board, so again, no objections. So, let's move on to the next motion. Okay, our other. The other presenter was John Sanchez who's, the district manager for Bronx community board six, and he came to our attention because of a piece that he wrote: the gothamist about every district, carrying their weight in terms of affordable housing and particularly in terms of new development and affordable housing, and he came to us with a very thoughtful presentation that actually compared our community board. Six in Brooklyn, with his community board six in the Bronx, his board, being his district being much smaller with a significantly lower median income and far more affordable housing. In terms of the affordable housing that is, has been built through the city's affordable housing, you know program at HPD, so one of the things that he focused on was a number of ways in which additional, affordable housing could come to the city, but was particularly interested around a number the issue of accessory dwelling units, and so there are three different ways in which we could, in which the city could change some of its rules and regulations in order to allow for additional units to occur, and these would be units occurring primarily in existing buildings, with some amount of, as I said, to either the zoning to the right to the codes. And the rationale is for this to be to a be safe in some cases, to make what is already an existing condition, safe and regulated, and then also to allow for, in some cases, particularly out in the outer boroughs, there's the ability for homeowners to actually increase their. You know their income through doing this in a way that would be would be regulated and overseen by the city. So there's a lot of information around this and this at the end of his presentation, alec in our committee had suggested a motion, and the motion which he also helped me write was is to support three in particular three of these conditions, and it's a little bit more lengthy. So I could read the whole thing or I could just go to the three main pilot, the main programs that we're talking about. Yes, that would be a good idea, so these are strategies really and some, and so let me just read the three of them and if you have questions you can certainly ask so we support this is against the CB6. Through the recommendation of the Ewcdh committee. We support a range of ideas. The city has already considered, including the Basement apartment Conversion pilot program, which is one of the accessory dwelling unit programs, and we urge the city to study and implement the following approaches: to provide more housing for all new yorkers one. The first one is to renew funding and expand the basement apartment Conversion pilot program, this valuable program on the verge of assisting the creation of many units of badly needed, affordable apartments in a district that is deeply in need of affordable housing. The pilot program was specific to I believe it was queen CB5. It was one particular district and it was very coordinated through HPD, with a lot of a lot of rules and had a whole system of how you would go about getting your basement converted. So it was a pilot program, but when, under the pandemic it was defunded, so we are asking I'm going. That was a sideline. I'm going back to my the resolution in agreement with numerous community groups on the front line of housing assistance within their neighborhoods. We recommend that funding for this program be renewed and expanded. The second item was to legalize apartments. The city should reevaluate zoning and other regulations to first off allow for legalization of thousands of apartment units that already exist in New, York, City and which could and which should be regulated and made safer and b promote the creation of new, affordable housing options through reforms such as rescinding laws that currently ban apartments within single family zone areas, particularly when located near public transit. Obviously, that does not is not part of our district. I do not believe we do not have any single family zoned areas in our district. However, this is partly in reaction to because we as a part of the city, so this is in support of citywide initiatives as well. The third item is to promote accessory dwelling units. The city should investigate and institute legislation that would allow homeowners to create accessory dwelling units. These are small, affordable apartments in converted garages backyards and inside private homes within the existing context of their communities. Accessory dwelling units could impact our district, and there could be situations in which this could be beneficial to both homeowners and to renters and potential new tenants. So I'll I can I'll just finish. While I'm at it, these reforms have been adopted by other jurisdictions in recent years, other areas outside of across the country- I should add in recent years and provide a model to guide our own city's efforts, particularly at this time of tremendous increased stress on homeowners and renters. It is critical to reassess and redefine regulations that further stress the housing market, as the pilot program demonstrates, there are many modifications to zoning rules and other codes that could benefit new yorkers across the city. We have witnessed with recent emergency relief measures that allow businesses to operate outside that the city can move quickly and efficiently to alter long- held regulations previously accepted as being difficult to change. So these are. This is a request for the city to look into alternative means of allowing of getting more legal, affordable housing units. There's a lot more to be said about each of these initiatives, and I think Alec and I are putting together there's some of those we have links to certain con. Some studies that have been done and we can certainly send more information out of people are, would like to look further into these initiatives. Great any questions for Ariel. Remember: you have to unmute hi. Yes, I did have a question. I'm not sure if this is exactly the right form for it, but there was. I actually attended the Zoom meeting last time in regards to the basement conversion. It was supposed to be for affordable housing. Are they regulating how much the homeowners can charge for those basement apartments? Yeah? I saw you that was one of your questions. I saw that and I looked into, I did see that and I actually went to. I was not as familiar with that program, but it's heavily. It's regulated the way. Affordable housing is so they, but I will similarly to affordable housing. You can get. You know you are at a certain mandated income coming in, but your income then does not matter once you once you have a lease, so I believe that there were regulations around that. But let me let me confirm that I do not know if Alec I know who's also done some research in this. So if Alec has a definite confirmation on that feel free to chime in, because I have noted even on the affordable housing website, they tend to block off a majority of the apartments and decent neighborhoods would say for a certain economic group and it's usually over 80,000. So right, yeah. Let me I can I that's a. I I'm not sure how I know it was regulated. I know you could not do because part of the pilot program was you received funding to help actually do your conversion. You could receive funding. You could actually apply for funding to actually do all the legal work around it and as a result of that, like any affordable program, you are required to rent at a certain limit. I do not know what that limit is, though, okay, so I guess the thing to do will also any details that Ariel is able to get we'll, have Mike put them in his newsletter, but by the same token, you know if you're, we'll assume everyone is in favor of this motion, if you're against it, please either unmute and say so or put or post a comment to that effect, even though his hand up yeah. I just have a question. Thank you, sorry about the back and forth of Ty and Mike about unmuting me ariel. This is very specific, but in the first one you're mentioning basements and is that term being used generally or in the zoning sense, because there's a difference between a basement and a seller yeah not as no. These are basements that are legal by code. In you know, the department of buildings would be able to sign off on these apartments. They have light. They have the correct amount of light. Air and egress got it, so it is. It is the legal definition of a basement. Okay, perfect. Thank you any other comments or objections. If I could just wait David yet my understanding is that, with the basement pilot program they kept virtually all of the usual rules like a basement has to have half of its. You know, ceiling height above ground. They modified a couple with respect to like windows, and I think they might have lowered the requisite ceiling height, but it's not like a technical seller could be occupied. For example, great thank you Joanna you unmute or no. I was hoping that maybe the letter could include some mention of the climate reasons behind doing this as well. There's a there's, a mention about transportation, which is great, but just to be a little more explicit that it's not just about affordable housing. It's also about you know, increasing density for climate change reasons, actually a lot. A lot of the literature does speak to this. Okay, increasing density, and I can include that the highest score we have available great, so we'll say that we're in favor of that motion before we go on we've been joined by a couple of elected officials. First, if state Senator, Kevin Parker, wants to make any remarks. Please go ahead. Make sure you're unmuted, please I do not know if he's trying to unmute or if he's all right, I'm on I'm a music. Now, okay, great and good evening, everyone I'm state, Senator Kevin Parker represent the 21st district, I'm the majority whip in New York, State Senate, as well as the chairman of the energy and Telecommunications committee. My staff person, Peter Weiss, is also on the call as well, but let me just say a good evening and hope everybody finds themselves well and healthy and your family's, you know, in addition, oh there's so much kind of going on right. Now the sense is right now at one point there was a conversation about possibly going back into session. My sense is that we're probably not going to go back into the legislative session until the new legislative session in January. In part there was, you know we were kind of hopeful that there would be a federal response to the deficits that we're seeing on the same levels and that there would be some conversation about how we address those issues in the you know how we kind of figure out the budget stuff, but we think that most of the budget stuff can actually wait into the new budget season, and so, although the city and state are both in deficit they're things that are not going to cause major service interruptions between now and then now, this may in fact, change. But in this moment what I'm hearing is that we're? You know, generally, you know as okay as we can be kind of under the circumstances. Obviously, the Big News is the hot zones, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, and the fact that we really need to you know do a lot more about being vigilant around testing. You know people wearing masks about not congregating about social distancing and really kind of continuing to remind ourselves and our communities that we're still in the middle of a global pandemic, and that Brooklyn at one point was the literally the global epicenter of that pandemic, and we could easily be back at that place if we let our guard down until we get a working, viable vaccine, we're probably going to be kind of in this moment, and so we must continue to kind of again be vigilant about you know. You know all the things that we've been I've just talked about the things that you know we all have been doing in order to keep ourselves safe. My office is going to be doing, as you know, October's breast cancer, breast cancer awareness month we're going to be doing free mammograms coming up on next week, and then we also are going to be doing free flu shots as well, and I'll have more details about that. Coming up next week as well, and so my office is open. I only have one staff person in the office the best place best way to kind of reach me it's either by phone or by email and I'll put the number in the chat, but the number is 718- 629- 6401, my email is parker at NY Senate, DOT gov against Parker NY Senate, DOT Gov, and you can also find me on social media at Senator, Kevin, Parker and so good news that today, actually just this evening, the governor signed my bill into law that creates juneteenth as a state holiday, so very excited very proud about that, and it was a long time that we've been working on that legislation. So you know it's good to get it across the finish line, there's kind of so much more that we need to work on in the state and so looking forward to getting back into session during you know, you know past the holidays. I do not know if people are have questions or comments or concerns. I will actually obviously yield to the chair about whether he wants me to answer any questions but I'll be on the line. Everybody has one go ahead, just one or two okay hearing none. Thank you very much Kevin. I appreciate it. We're also joined by state Senator. Brian Cavanaugh. Is he still on? Remember you have to unmute yourself. Okay, I was saying host was not allowing me to unmute myself, but now apparently I've been allowed. So that's great everybody can hear me yeah. First of all, thank you to all the board members to Peter to Mike and everybody for you know coming together tonight and for giving me a few moments to interrupt your proceedings. I was on earlier, I guess, as a as a spectator, so I heard some of your conversation about accessory dwelling units just a few a few. You know sort of announcements and updates. First of all, you know the election is less than three weeks away. Of course, I am not going to comment on who one should vote for in this governmental nonpartisan setting, but just to note that there have been a lot of real, problematic issues with ballots. Many people got improper absentee ballots. If anyone who is any of the board members or anybody who's watching tonight did receive a ballot that was in incorrect in the wrong envelope addressed to the wrong person. The best instructions are not to return that and the board of elections should be pro actively mailing out corrected. Ballots we've been trying to you know, address the ongoing question of why that occurred, but for at this point, people should get a ballot that you should be getting a new ballot. Those were supposed to have begun going out by this past Friday October 9th. If you have any questions you know or concerns about that, you can contact your elected officials, my own office, or certainly Senator, Parker's or others that represent you and get some assistance, making sure that you get the proper response from the board of elections. Also, obviously, there's going to be expected high turnout and in difficult circumstances, because of Covid-19 because of lots of male ballots. Our system is not really designed to deal with high volumes of mailed ballots. We had just last year, amend and amended the constitution so that large- scale mail- in balloting would be permitted, but what we're doing is an emergency thing now that we passed just for the purpose of addressing Covid-19. The best advice is that if you can vote in person, if you are comfortable voting in person, that is probably preferable us and, of course, early voting is an option where you're voting in person and your ballot is counted, is fed into the machine on site when and where you vote that begins Saturday October 24th, so you know again, people should, you know, exercise their right to vote and again, preferably do it in person. Unless you're, you know, immune system is compromised and you're avoiding public spaces. Obviously, Covid-19 has caused a great. You know: hardships in many areas. One area is that small businesses really are suffering. One of we've got we're going to need a number of strategies for that on an ongoing basis, but one thing that we've been that my office has been pushing is called the small business recovery. The Lease act is a bill that we're working on with I've got assembly. Remember you lean as the assembly sponsor you lean new is the seminar sponsor and we have Keith powers and Brad lander of the council. We've been working on this and basically it would be. The state legislature would authorize the city to link long- term property tax abatements with long- term affordable leases, recognizing that many tenants are going to have trouble paying their rent and, at some point that's going to be reflected in property, values and ultimately in taxes. So, rather than waiting for that to happen and landlords and tenants and commercial tenants having to figure it out, we would create this opportunity again. It requires state authorization and then the city would adopt it and fill out. The specifics. We've been doing a lot of outreach and gaining a lot of support on both legislators in the state and the city council level and we're you know it's ongoing ongoing effort. I agree with Kevin Parker's assessment that we do not seem to be going back to the legislative session very soon, but we are, you know, continuing to work on this as an important tool. I'm happy to take any questions or comments about that. I chair the housing committee. We've been focused a lot on fair housing. You know housing discrimination. Last year, Newsday did an extraordinary set of investigative journalism around ongoing discriminatory practices in the long island housing market. We've had now two hearings on that topic and by all accounts it is not limited to long island and it is also not limited to the sale market. You know there's also a lot of issues in the rental market, so we've taken a lot of testimony. The Senate took the unusual step of subpoenaing everybody who declined to testify at the first hearing and actually went to. We went before a judge during the hearing to compel testimony from brokers and other participants in the real estate market who had been. You know on tape engaging in questionable practices. The second hearing is now done. We've got a broad legislative package that is intended to strengthen our state's laws against discrimination. Happy to talk about the details of that and the committee will be putting out the committees, I'm doing this jointly with two other committees, but we will be putting out a report on our findings and our recommendations soon. In the meantime, Covid-19 obviously has had a very large effect on. You know not only the commercial tenants that I talked about, but on residential tenants and landlords, so the biggest short- term tool we have to ensure the stability of housing has been the eviction moratorium. We began pushing for that immediately at the beginning of the pandemic, and we have had a comprehensive, thorough, complete blanket eviction. Moratorium statewide through September 30th, the governor had extended a an eviction, his some an executive order that enabled the victim moratorium. It was widely covered in the press as continuing the moratorium through December 31st. It does indeed extend to December 31st, but it is unclear from what is currently in place that it actually will have the effect of preventing any evictions. It does appear from the executive order and then from the court's interpretation of it, which came out just this past Friday that they will be resuming eviction matters and, although evictions may come slowly, especially for people who are represented by council, that there may be some evictions that we'll be able to get through in this system. That, from my perspective, is an enormous problem, we're still in the midst of a pandemic, and it is inappropriate, in my view, for anybody to be evicted from their home at this point. So we've got legislation that is intended to address that I've got a bill that I carry with the Assembly Judiciary Committee Chair Jeff Dinowicz, that and that would extend a blanket moratorium through January 20th, there's a broader bill by Senator Myrie and Assimilator Korean Israelis. That would extend the moratorium much further, I'm a co- sponsor of that bill and a supporter of it, but either way. I think you know the right thing would be for the governor to continue the strongest possible moratorium. But if not, I think the legislature really does need to step in and mandate that, if you or anybody who's contacting the board or anybody who's listening tonight is facing eviction. The city's helpline might be the best place to start 3-, 1- 1, and they still are referring. People to legal assistance, and many of the legal enterprises are waiving the normal income requirements that are usually restrict people from getting access to that and if you're in my district or we can be helpful, feel free to contact our office directly as well just law. I'm going to be brief on this, but the longer term thing is: we are going to need rent relief, so the eviction moratorium and a bill we've already passed called the tenant safe, Harbor Act should prevent most people from being evicted both now and in the future. The tenancy farbrecht says that no unpaid rent during this period can ever be the basis for an eviction, but we obviously do not want people with unpaid rent hanging over their head a long term. We do not want landlords not to have the resources to maintain their buildings, but so we pushed their two approaches on this again. I've been pushing an approach that would basically pay the rent of anybody. Who's had any difficulty paying their rent because of hardship during Covid-19 that requires that requires a very substantial amount of money. There is also the Cancel rent approach, which also the current version of that is intended to be funded with large amounts of money that would compensate landlords for lost rent, but in either way where it's going to be very difficult to do that without federal assistance. So we've pushed very hard for the next stimulus bill to include rental assistance. I have gotten some assurances that if there is in fact a rental assist a federal relief bill that rental assistance will be high on the list of things that are likely to be in it. But of course we know that the you know the negotiations on that really have started and stopped and are currently seem to be stalled, but it's very important that we continue to advocate for that. A couple. Other brief updates. Bqe has been an enormous issue, the last couple years, the repairs that are necessary, the you know, initial sort of repairs that are intended to shore the thing up until we can come up with a longer term solution are underway, we've been having conversations about the wall on Hicks Street and the effect of that on the local community. In the meantime, we're also working on a bill that comes out of one of the proposals that the the panel of experts came up with, which is to give New York City the necessary tools to enforce overweight truck restrictions. The best way to do that would be to have them be able to use sensors that are in the road and cameras to identify overweight trucks that are going over certain spans of the BQE and issue fines as they find them. So we've got a bill that we've worked on, we've been amending it and negotiating with the city and our colleagues about how to do that and again. This is something I hope we can get done upon returning to Albany whenever that may be, the Kevin Parker talked a lot about the need to continue to be vigilant about Covid-19. I do represent some communities that are in the kind of elevated level category, but none that have reached the point where we're doing proactive shutdowns of businesses and schools and other things, but we're modeling that closely and working with test and trace and news outlets and to get the word out and again, the community board can play an important role here. If you, if the board or any organization you know of needs additional PPE, you know sanitizer or masks. We can provide access to that directly. We can provide deliveries of that. We have a fairly good supply that we can access through the state. So again, that's something that if people still need it, we're happy to provide and we've been doing that regularly. I know you have a long meeting and obviously I could probably cover other issues, but I think I'll stop there and I'm happy to take questions. If you have them- or you know, go back to your previous agenda, thank you Brian. I appreciate it last, but certainly not least, we're joined by almost Senator Elect Jabari Brisport, who will be taking the seat currently occupied by state Senator, Prominent Montgomery everybody, and you know thank you, Mr Fleming and also you know Mr Recipient Raciopo, for you know having me here and letting me into the meeting and setting me up and hello to my colleagues, my future colleagues, Senator Parker and Senator Kavanagh. I'm excited to get to work with y', all and hello everybody so Jabari Brisport here we'll be taking over for the incredible center of montgomery in just a few months. I'm really honored and proud to be able to step into the shoes of this district and fight for this community. I'm born in bed- stuy. I grew up in Prospect heights and it's not from politics. I'm currently a public school teacher in Crown heights at a middle school called Meg, nervous Prep, and I love my kids and you know if anybody wants to talk about education and what's going on with school openings and the current situation with schools, I'm happy to probably not right now, because I'm sure we'll be here all night, because I'm sure many people have about comments and concerns to share but I'll open. My my email address in the chat to follow up in case you have any concerns. You know, I'm excited to be able to fight for things that I saw issues in my community being the incredible disinvestment in working- class people, the amount of money flowing into corporate elites and the richest people in this state, rather than funding our schools and hospitals, and you know good solid jobs and affordable housing. You know I'm excited to fight for a New York that truly works for all people, not just the wealthiest. You know a few political donors or real estate cronies that want to align our politics with their best interests. So again, I'll put my chat. Excuse me I'll put my email in the chat for y' all to reach out to I'm excited to represent you work with community Board, six and the various people of this district and I'm sure I'll, be seeing you all in the community soon, thanks again, thanks Jabari, I appreciate it so now we're going to hear from representative of elected officials and we're going to begin with Dan Wiley, who represents Congresswoman, Nydia Velazquez. Remember you have to unmute all right, hi, so yeah congressman Velasque has been pretty busy with going back and forth like a Yo- Yo to the hill being a conferee negotiator on relief packages, and it's been like whiplash trying to get another relief package through. She supports the district they're not called back to DC again yet, but you know, she's been pushing hard for getting real aid to folks and businesses and forgivable grants as well. Also, I know that the rezoning is coming up on the 22nd I'll I'll, attend that on the on the Gowanus, and you know we're going to be very interested to see how csos won't be coming back to Gowanus in a bigger way. With more development and there's a lot of talk of density to get affordable housing, but at the same time can't come at the expense of the Gowans cleanup, which we see a lot of work going on right now, and I know that the city is delayed in its plans for the sewer overflow tanks. So we have yet to see how well the city is going to address the existing combined sewer overflow, let alone what would happen with 18,000 more people put on the system. So we're going to be. The congressman is actually going to be meeting with elite regional administrator tomorrow to discuss what's coming up and we're going to be following it very carefully. Also, we we echo your need for a truck study, in fact, a need for more implementation of traffic safety measures for pedestrians and bicyclists throughout the Waterfront district, including to the north, through red hook and through sunset park. We've had some recent tragic crashes where bicyclists have died on third Avenue, just to South we're trying to expedite better crossing some of the connectors that connect the communities to the waterfront that crosses where the greenway is and, of course, we're glad to see some. You know improvements that have happened on fourth avenue, but we also have to extend those to other parts of the district. So with that, I just want to say it's good to see everybody and carry on thanks Dan. Next we have Megan Flynn from State Center feeding from Council member Brad Lander's office, hi everybody. It is very nice to zoom, see you all again for those of you who do not know me, I'm Megan Flynn, I'm the director of constituent services and community affairs for Council member lander, and I handle most of the constituent service ongoings and these meetings at CB6. So a couple updates we have for you with you know everything else going on. There are a couple just more district- wide updates. We are still doing pb this cycle, so this will be our 10th cycle, which is very exciting a little different. This time around than it has been in previous years, but if you have an idea you would like to submit for Pb, you can submit it at pbnyc39.com if you're interested in being a delegate a volunteer getting involved. Definitely let our office know we're definitely looking for more people to help and get it get involved. As Senator Kavanaugh mentioned, we have been hearing from a lot of people that their ballots have not been correct, addressed to the person to be received them correctly. If you're experiencing any issues with an incorrect ballot received, you do not know where to early vote. You do not know where your poll site is feel free to reach out to our office, and we can. We can direct you there and I can help you get the ballot you, the error, the ballot, that's an error cancelled and a new one. The BOE will overnight it to you, as the senator also mentioned, we're working with our colleagues at the state and council member powers office to get authorized at the state level, the small business recovery, lease program to incentivize landlords to renegotiate their leases with their commercial tenants, and we know this is sort of a longer term solution and there are a lot of very short- term problems coming up right now. We definitely are working to support the small businesses and if you have any other questions or any concerns in the district, I'll put my email in the chat and you can feel free to email me directly. It is lovely to see you all thanks, megan Oscar Jonas from state Senator at Montgomery's office. Can everyone hear me hi, Ken, okay, just a little quick report center, one make everyone aware that we have some newsletters coming out. Those of you who reside in her district we'll get them automatically anyone who's interested in it I'll be glad to send me an email, oh jonas, at NY, Senate.Gov I'll, be glad to forward it to you just spotlights on legislation of the past year. Some programs and information on earth and early voting that does not work with the green screen background. Additionally, we have this new pamphlet and the pamphlet is regarding New York, State, Human Services report and directory, which highlights various human services, be it youth services, housing and others. If anyone is interested in a copy of this booklet I'll be glad to make sure it's mailed to you, just contact Oscar at Senator, Montgomery's office and I'll be glad to, and thank you, everyone have a good night thanks Oscar, and then we have taika from Scott Stringer's office, hi, everyone, it's great to be back here at community Board. Six. For those who do not know me, my name is Taika Haraguchi. I am the Brooklyn bro liaison for the comptroller. I just want to give a few brief updates on some of the latest work that our office has been doing. This actually may not be widely known, but the comptroller's Bureau of Labor Law enforces prevailing wage and benefits for construction and building service workers employed by contractors on any city public work projects. So, while companies on these public contracts fail to pay the proper wages and benefits our office, enforces the law to recover the money owed to workers and ensures that they receive the money owed through outreach. So in light of Covid-19, we decided to take extra measures to ensure that these wages are returned. We hosted phone banks, know your right workshops with the results that since March, our office has returned over two million dollars in unclaimed wages to over 100 workers. You know we are still continuing our outreach efforts, so if you can think of a group or an organization that you would like for our office to link up with, so that we can actually give a presentation on prevailing wages. I will put my email in the chat and then you can just reach out to us the next two things I'll briefly. Mention will have to do with the school reopening. Obviously, the situation is a little bit touch and go right now to say the least, but we released a report called strong schools for all a plan forward for New York City, and it offers a set of recommendations to safely reopen New York City schools for fall 2020 amid the pandemic. So just an effort to accelerate the process. Our team at the controls office worked with experts in the field to develop this plan, which includes ensuring the safety for students and educators based on the latest scientific protocols, reopening schools with as much in- person instruction as possible, providing transparency about transmission status within the schools, as well as improving the quality of any remote instruction. That remains necessary and I will put that report in the chat as well. Another education- based proposal that we put forth was a its first-, of-, its- kind bike to school plan for New, York, City, high school students. Our office called on the city and philanthropic partners to provide free bikes and CitiBike memberships to lower income high school students and to build one and a half miles each of protected bike lanes around 50 New York City high school buildings. Within the next year, 18 of high school students walked our bike to school in 2015, down from 23 in 2009 and 40 of these high school students attend a heist attend to school within their home district and 83 percent within their own home borough. So with cuts to MTA transit services, school buses operating at limited capacities and the continued need for safe social distancing. Our bike to school proposal offers a sustainable, safe and healthy transportation option for the city's young people. And finally, today our office proposed a free tuition at all: cooney CUNY community colleges and overhaul of New York City's Workforce development strategy. So essentially, our office outlined a comprehensive plan that will leverage CUNY to upskill, New York, City's workforce and compete in the global economy and essentially create a jobs pipeline from CUNY to uplift communities in New, York City. So the Workforce development plan includes tuition- free community college, a universal paid internship program for CUNY students, more career and technical education and early college, high schools and expansion of certified apprenticeship, subsidized wage and bridge programs and more- and I will put that report also in the chat and really. Finally, the last thing: October 28th our office hosting a community board six round table at six P.M. Obviously there's you know, as was mentioned before, there's a lot to discuss in community board six with ongoing and upcoming issues. So, if you'd like to attend, please email me and I will put the email in the chat but we'd love to hear from you can pre- submit questions to our office, so we'll make sure that we get back to you, and this is a great forum in order for our office to get a good dialogue with the community. Thank you thanks very much and last but not least, Jason Shelley from the New York City Fire Department, hey guys good evening. My name is Jason Shelley from Fdny. I want to thank Mike and Peter for having me tonight on the occasion of October. Being fire prevention month, and so just a quick update on some things, we've got going on at the fire department. We've got something called the fire Safety education unit. You may have seen. These are folks who are out in the community, often tabling. Sometimes they do demonstrations for students for seniors things like giving away fire alarms and doing fire safety, education, obviously with Covid-19 a lot of that had to go online, and so we retooled and have created a digital portal with a lot of videos, some aimed at children, some aimed at adults and I'll just give this website and I'll drop it in the chat. Later too, it's called Fdny Smart.Org connect and there's a lot of different things on there from cooking safety to electric safety to things for children planning. You know, activities about planning have an escape plan. So if you're, a parent or you're around children and are looking for resources, it's generally bite size, short clips, eight to ten minutes, firefighters, giving instructions and talking people through fire safety. There's also some links on there. Where you can request a specific demonstration, you can get in touch with us. If you're in a school you can get in touch with us. I do not think we're doing school events yet, but that's something that once you know as we move forward, that may be something that's that we'll get back up online. You know: we've had great success over the last decade or two in New York City in terms of fire safety, fire deaths have trended down. We had 66 total fire deaths last year. That's the 14th year in a row, we've had under 100 deaths and we've really tried to target vulnerable communities, at- risk communities, the causes, that of for fire deaths in the city. Top three causes were electrical problems, cooking and smoking, and so we try to target those those issues and help people understand how to be safer. But again, that's Fdnysmart.Org, Connect and there's a an email address there that you can request a fire safety demonstration yourself I'll put both of those in the chat afterwards and then we'll just close it out with reminding you to when you change your clocks, change your batteries and coming up on. I think it's November 1st, when you, when you change your clocks, make sure you change the batteries and your smoke alarms we'll keep everybody safe. So thank you guys very much. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. We have two speakers for community sessions. The first is lauren Avelino from Methodist Hospital. Please remember! You have no more than three minutes: hi all hi Peter Hi Mike. Thank you guys for having me on icb6 just a couple of notes. My name is lauren Avelino, the manager of community affairs at Brooklyn, methodist hospital here in the neighborhood. I just want to say thank you to the community and to Community Board six and our neighbors for all the support, especially during the height of Covid-19.. In terms of you know, we've seen a resurgence of Covid-19. The hospital has not yet been hit with higher numbers of covet- positive patients, as we might expect from the resurgence in different areas in Brooklyn. A few updates that I wanted to give you all about the hospital we have the center for community health, the largest you know, construction center, that's the largest ambulatory center of its kind in Brooklyn is opening soon in February 2021. So thank you for community board success. Support on that. Thank you, Eric for chairing our construction task force. So there's I'm going to pop in the chat more information about the center for community Health. As Senator Parker mentioned, October is breast cancer awareness month we will be doing a breast cancer community zoom education session with Dr Vivian B who's, our chief of breast surgical oncology. I'm going to pop that in the chat there are other free community educational lectures via zoom that we're doing one on heart health tomorrow, in collaboration with good neighbors of park, slope and also heights and hills. So that will be in the chat. Also I do I do want to let you know hello pups of CB6. I do want to let you know that we have partnered with the Brooklyn chamber of Commerce to help fund small business grants and Mike has been good enough to put it in a CB6 newsletter. I am going to put the links to that in the chat. Businesses can apply to get free, deep cleaning services for up to six months and also personal protective equipment. We have not seen a lot of applications from par soap. We've only seen two businesses in Park Slope, we, I was actually canvassing the neighborhood with the chamber on Friday. So please spread the word again I'll put the links in the chat, and I think that's it. There's other plenty of other free events and support groups happening at the hospital, and if anybody has any questions, feel free to chat me I'll, be sticking around for a little while, and thank you for having me this by the way is monty who joined our family on Saturday. He is a 10 week old, havanese puppy that we picked up in Niagara falls on Saturday morning. He is, he is a bit of a handful, but he is learning what he can do where and what he can't. So I just wanted him to be able to to say hello to everyone and I'm now going to put him back out of the room and as I do that I'm going to introduce our second community session speaker, which is Heim gross from New York City 2030.. Did he leave he's back out? I'm not here hello. I do not know if I can be seen, but I hope I can be heard. You can be great. I put in the chat and I'll put in the chat again the link to our information. My name is time gross, I'm from the New York City, 2030 District and I'm campaign director for the heat cool, smart Brooklyn program. We are promoting green retrofits in community districts. Two and six were supported by Brooklyn borough, president funded by Nyserda, and what we are doing is confronting climate change house by house and building by building. There are plenty of incentives and opportunities to upgrade your building, remove those dirty fossil fuel, burning boilers and replace them with electrified medium cooling systems. We also want to insulate and air seal and make the buildings more energy efficient. We can offer free energy audits for wonderful family homes and low- cost audits for commercial spaces, multi- family buildings. There are tremendous incentives from Con, Edison and nicer to make the switch from dirty heating to clean heating and more efficient cooling. I see Angelica there who's a colleague of mine at Solar, one hello. We are also trying to how you doing we're trying to match you up with other technologies like solar. If you want to do a green roof, if you want to do passivhaus, we could talk to you about that, but our program is primarily to promote energy, efficient and clean heating and cooling. Let me see if I can put the there it is so you can reach us at heybrooklyn.org or contact us at Hcsb Nyc2030.Org. Thank you Michael and thank you CB6 for giving me a chance to speak, and I really hope that after we can defeat the pandemic, we can defeat climate change. Thank you very much. Did I miss any representatives of elected officials that are here that want to speak? It's not my dog. Okay. Does anybody have any other comments or questions to make before we adjourn the meeting, I will ask that you know this is obviously our first attempt at doing this. So if you have any suggestions for improvement, please let Ty and Mike know of anything that you can think of. I know Glenn Kelly had some problems with audio, but they appear, sadly, to have been for on his end and not ours, since everybody else was hearing fairly clearly and we do have one second, we do have Jesse Losch from Joanne Simon's office. Who would like to say a few words before we go. Remember you have to unmute yourself, we're still not hearing you. Sadly well hi, this is Joanne. Oh there you go so when you said Jessie, I thought she was going to say something so anyway, I just wanted to say hello and participate for a bit in your inaugural meeting on zoom and and just you know, tell everybody to get out and vote. That's there's nothing more important. This that we could do this month and next month, actually or starting on the 24th, is to get out and vote early vote by absentee get those absentee ballots in right away and certainly if you need anything to reach out to my office at 718-, 246- 4889 again. Thank you very much for participating. If you have any suggestions, you know people have different experiences with zoom and if you have anything from other groups that you're involved in that, you think might help us to a more efficient process. We'd love to hear from you. If not we will. This is leroy. Is it possible for our next meeting? I know because we do not have the the not able probably to get the minutes, but can we get at least the motions emailed to us, so we can have those. So we can read them because I know some people could not understand the motions that they were being said because of the audience. Well, we'll try to get those out the morning of the meeting. You know unless it's possible to get them out sooner, but we will absolutely do that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that suggestion, lira anyone else. I see the rest of the evening back to you all. Thank you very much for joining us stay safe, stay, healthy, be well and we'll see you all soon take care.
