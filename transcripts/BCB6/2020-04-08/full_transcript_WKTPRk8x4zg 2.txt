We can wait a few minutes. Those people join us and for those just joining us, we're going to get started soon and we're expecting around a hundred people and so far I see seventy. So we'll wait a few more minutes, oh wow inspector, it's good to see. You see everybody and see Marty in his office. There is definitely very comforting, like that, makes me feel like some things are still right in the world now I know what's wrong: Megan Flynn, this hundred people, are they going to all be on video, or are they just going to be able to watch us or just watch just watch we're the only ones on video, okay, here and I thought that but I wanted to double checks, but they can hear now they're in the room and if you, if you click the participants button down at the bottom and you can see who they are right, yeah that I know to do I just did not know if they were going to be at some point, opened up for a video all right. So how many sorry I'm this is my first zoom. So my part, when do we want to get not sure if I can't see everybody yeah? We have about 85 people here now. So that's a good attendance, so you know more people join, but Naomi. You agree we can should I get going or yes take it away. Sure! For those who do not know me, my name is Michael Restivo I'm, the district manager of Brooklyn Community, Board 6 thanks everyone joining us here and I think soon on to Facebook streaming. Looking forward to everyone on the panel, we have really wide range and even growing less I think we have MTA. A knock on wood think is joining us. Oh wait here, Mike yeah what it's and angles be I'm here, oh okay, great thanks, Andy I can't see the full list of everyone who's here so on that before I'm going to pass it off to our chair, Peter Fleming at CB, six I just wanted to say just two updates that I've heard today. Everyone, a lot of people, have been reaching out to me about some overcrowd. Please just I just want to reiterate that you know. Oh, that's! A less dense area of our district like running and stuff like that, please be extra careful about a social distancing and if you want to receive updates from CB six simply text be Kcv 6 to 2 to 8 to 8, and that sort of information is more localized. You know. Obviously we have the governor and the mayor and others giving more map updates from there to Mr. Fleming good evening. Everyone. Thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate it. You know. I do not have any. You know concrete information. You know it's deliver in terms of what's running and what's not, but I want to a make sure that you understand that the community board is here and we're operating and you know Mike is in the office periodically. He only lives a few blocks away and he's the only one there so we're answering phone calls we're answering emails. Well, we can't help you get through to unemployment. You know. If you have the typical kinds of problems you might call the community board about. You know the streetlights not working or that kind of thing we hope you'll contact us. You should know that, although we're not having meetings, the city is not referring issues to us either. So it's not there's a pile of things that we need to be acting on. That are that are that are sitting there. So you know once thing get a little bit better. We anticipate that they'll start referring issues to us for us to provide an advisory opinion and we'll decide at that time, whether or not necessary for us to have the meeting to consider a virtual meeting like this one of a committee, so that we can we can get back to business as quickly as possible, but we're not at that point. Yet you know in the meantime, you know I urge you to you know, as everyone says, practice the appropriate. You know social distancing, I, try and go for a walk every day or you know every day or every other day, I wear my mask I. You know I stand aside so that someone can pass by me so that you know we're not. You know passing you know within too close distance to each other. I went to Wegmans on Sunday and they were had people lined up outside and they were only letting a certain number of people in the store at a time again in an effort to make sure that the store did not get so crowded that you were forced to sort of violate those social distancing rules. So you know that we're here you know, Mike's is putting out his daily newsletter, which he just told you about, has lots of great information in there about. You know new services that the city is offering restaurants that are open, that you can order takeout from so you know, we need to try and support those businesses as best as we possibly can so that they're still there when we come out of all of this, so you know that's a really important thing for you to do so. We hope that you'll continue to do that. You know in the meantime, you know if there's anything that we can do for you know contact community board directly. You know using the email address. You have you're welcome to contact me as well I'm here I'm not doing the doing a whole lot, except watching Netflix and reading books and doing some cooking. So you know, if there's anything that we can do for you I hope. You'll ask do not be surprised if we tell you that we refer you somewhere else, but we'll try and help as many people as we possibly can you and that's what I have I think Brad was next as I understand: councilman, Brad Lander! Thank you. So much Peter and I appreciate your both convening this meeting and there's a lot of great people on it. So I'll be brief, because I think we want to hear from some of them. We'll just say you know. As everybody knows, these are just impossible times in so many different ways. We have folks on this call like John Jericho from New York Presbyterian from Methodist and the whole NYP system, trying to manage an institution that is overwhelmed on the very front lines and marshalling the resources of our doctors and nurses and health care workers to save lives in conditions. They have never been asked to do that in before when it's, you know difficult to get the supplies they need when they've had to massively expand their bag capacity, when people are risking their lives to save others and obviously we're so grateful just like beyond belief and then there's all these other essential workers. We've got. You know, Andy angles be from the MTA with that. You know the TWU workers, the transit workers, the subway workers and folks that we have not. You know. We've got our inspector Meagan O'malley on folks who are out there continuing to ensure Public Safety and we've got a lot of our officers. A lot of our transit workers themselves and I mean you might know the number, but there's already been a meaningful number of fatalities amongst our transit workers. We've got all these workers in jobs. I think we might have said before. We knew that transit jobs and the NYPD and the FDNY and sanitation were essential. A few have said had said before: well what about our bodega workers and our laundromat workers and the folks who do the food delivery? You know that's a set of work as we do not pay enough or given up in benefits or treat with enough respect and dignity to ask them, and yet that's what we're asking them to do and they're going out and doing it. We've got our teachers who are able to stay home so they're not putting themselves. In the same, you know health risk and yet they're being asked to like become virtual teachers and totally reposition their lessons. I Maggie could go on and on it's extraordinary what people are doing right now to try to step up together and then it just all of the rest of us trying to find the ways to stay home. That's you know so that we can bend this curve and save lives together when we're out whether it's in our parts are on our streets, trying to figure out how we do that in ways that keep us sane but also practice good practices. Thank you. Judy willing and meals done. Wheels delivers, there's so many more people that are absolutely essential in this time and then we're all trying to figure out where we fit in those of us who have the blessing the luxury, the privilege to do our job by staying at home. How do we be good citizens in this time and how do we contribute to the broader effort of building enough social solidarity? My office has been working really hard to try and I feel so grateful Naomi, Dannan and Julia Airmen and Megan Flynn, or all on this call and we're happy to offer our zoom account for this, we've been doing a lot to provide resources to people and I'm going to put a few things in the chat resources working with our wonderful intended and you just superintendent I need to stop for parents, a resource page for freelancers and independent contractors trying to navigate this world of all their lost income. You're definitely invited to sign up for our lists as well. We're just trying to get information out there get opportunities to help out there, just as much as we possibly can so. I just want to say: I really am grateful to be part of this community. It really is a community that I think cares about. Each other sees the ways in which a lot of us are blessed to have a fair amount of privilege in a city where this crisis is hitting on all our pre- existing inequalities, I love all the Pat's Felix, it's great to see your dog and all the pets and the kids in the zooms have been one lovely moment of this crisis. But you know we see the way is that pre-, existing inequalities of income and race and immigrant status and gender put people in harm's way right now, and we've got a responsibility to step up and I'll just end here. It's like our first responsibility for those of us that are not in one of those essential jobs is to stay home and practice social distancing, so we can save lives. Our second responsibility is to think about the things that we can do, whether we're able to make contributions to our food banks or order from our local businesses or into a domestic violence organization to try to help and then our third eye I think this will just pivot us as we go forward. How do we learn the lessons of this moment to build a society that could show up much better for everyone on both public health and economic and justice fronts than we have done in this time, so I'm honored to be in that work with you who want to say thank you to see b67 this up and I look forward to hearing from the Resource Partners on this call. I think Felix has to get somewhere pretty quickly. If he wants to jump on, I do not know if people can hear that or not yeah Felix. Are you okay turn to I know he said he had to get off free Felix. Can you unmute on your end, you're unmuted on in the system, but we still can't hear you. No, we still can hear you sorry buttons in the bottom. Left corner there's a microphone with a red slash through it, like Bruce McDonald's advice when in doubt call the kids for her tech help we'll go to the next speaker. Apparently they say it's the audio preferences in your computer that might need attention so we'll try to compare remarking on them. Oh, we got it all right. We can hear you now you can hear. Can you hear me now? Yes, take it away? Yes, Mazel Tov, beautiful okay, so you saw my your first tour before me. So let me just let me already thank all of you and thank CB 736 I'm, sorry for putting this together. I know the wonderful people that are on the line and on the front line. I also will echo everything that City Council blunders say: I, do not want to repeat myself, but I think it's very important to recognize those folks. Yes, I would like to bring a couple of thing that for us to think about it, I we need to. We need to think probably about how can we help people who are who have lost their ones, that they do not have the funds or the money to pay for the funerals? We have a lot of my funerals on home. They are already over booked. We have too many debts happening in the area and number two I think it's very important to continue to re- emphasize the issue of social distancing distances. I think that the supermarkets and the pharmacies word where we see a lot of the people and the naree, Nicest or I think you know I know the police department has been doing a wonderful job to do education or social distance it as well. You know it's too much burned on their shoulder, but I think we need to continue to re- emphasize to people that the only way that we are going to survive is know. Just by staying humble, it will go out to chopping to be protected, to be safe and to think about the safety nurse of all the people as well, by keeping distance, so I think it's very important to continue to bring further side that, from our perspective, with your finished up the budget, we put money for coronary virus. We also I also put a bill regarding to allow folks who need some kind of help, with their form a cost that they will be able not only have for 60. They lost in addition to that, just in case this continued to aggravate and the reason the rationale behind that is because you have some people who take psychotropic drugs that are only based on 30 days, that they will be able to have an extension that they do not have to worry about their prescription to come home. Other than that again, my office has been working behind the scene at home. We all been working behind the same way of killing a lot of working, helping people with unemployment, with section 8, as well as to continue to re- emphasize. That is very important for people to understand that we do have a 90 days, eviction moratorium in place, and you know we're working on legislation to see how to come up with a conclusion to help be after that, as well as to think. How can we help people with ranked as one of the mortgage also has been extended, so I'm going to stop there and I will be listening to the conversation and any question that the get address that you need. My answer that would be here and I. Always we are here to work with you know. Karen is I, can not say too much about Karen. She carry a lot of my load and in the air in their own area. We have managed to have a company to be higher by hard to clean, Red Hook and to get on the on the job, and also we work in to continue to supply mask out to the workers in Red, Hook and load the folks online and those who are not here online. Please may God bless, you keep the faith and we will prevail. Do we want my toaster to Marty I, know Marty's been at Litchfield, Ville I? Think since, like 5:00 a.m. today, so yeah right? That's me: I am more on the Brooklyn pops, commissioner, so first of all you're lucky to have elected officials like Felix Ortiz and Joann Simon, Bobby, Carroll and Brad Lander they've been a constant communication with the Parks Department for all the things we ever had to do. Let me start off with. We are not burying people in local parks and playgrounds. I can promise you that whole conversation came in because Hart island, which is in the Long Island Sound, which has been a burial ground for centuries, has become part of the parks Department if God forbid, if we have to in the future, that's a place that we can reopen to do burials, but there won't be any in your local parks and playgrounds. None of the decisions that were made of made solely by parks we're working with our partners in state and local government, with the Department of Health, of course, with our great friends at the police department, elected officials, and let me also shout out the committee- would six my computer again we're in constant communication. The closings we've had to do again with everybody's, promoting social distancing. It's so important and sort of in sequence. We've had to close more and more things so right now, recreation, centers and historic councils are closed. We tried to leave playgrounds open. It became just too crowded to promote social spacing so playgrounds are now closed. Courts are closed. We're in the process of removing some 600 basketball hoops in the borough because we closed them. It finds people do not always abide by the signs. Himmel court, tennis, courts, boccie courts, soccer fields where we've had problems effective yesterday dog runs had to be closed and effective. Today, skate parks had to be so again. This is the gist of this. Is you want to stay home, but there are opportunities. There are parks, larger parks that are open, Prospect Park, please go take a walk visit, a waterfall walk on the drive again, keep your social distancing, wash your hands. Keep your hands away from your face. Coffee park is open. Some of the other larger parks are open. We get it. People need to get outside. It really gives people an opportunity to appreciate you how important plots are to us and by going out and getting that our to a fresh air. Getting the kids out of the house go for a walk of the neighborhood come to a park agreement. Cemetery has been very gracious of opening their gates as well to get that outdoor experience. So please take advantage of that. There are also some great things you can do online. We have parks at home, which is a program that you can get on Facebook Twitter on Instagram. Basically, it's go to the Pops website. Wnyc Golf park, stop org slash, highlight slash pops at home, a lot of good programs for kids and adults to get fit at home and so on, but we we're New Yorkers we're very strong we're going to make it through this together. Please be considerate of other people. Please wash your hands, keep your hands away from your face. Please keep social distancing that six or more feet apart we're starting to introduce signs across the park of that. If you want some general information, the New York City website, Nyc.Gov, slash Coronavirus has some good background and back to you thank you. Mr. Moore, I, guess Joanne. If you want to jump in sure well, thank you I'm, so glad to see so many people on this call and I want to thank all of my colleagues and government, the elected officials as well as everybody's here from the agencies, because obviously this is a time where we're all going to need to work together and I feel very fortunate number one to be representing the 52nd Assembly District to be able to work with the colleagues that I have to work with. Who are all really caring and are involved and are really out there to serve the community? So I want to. Thank you all wish everybody. A Happy Passover in advance. I know that that's the next holiday that's up, and it's going to be a different kind of holiday for everybody. Easter will be very different because we're in these incredibly trying times- and nobody really knows exactly what to do. I- do want to make sure everybody knows that my office is working. You know we're all telecommuting and my office has been telecommuting now for a little over two weeks and but where we're getting all your emails and we are responding to them and we're taking phone calls as well trying to provide answers. A couple of things have been really big issues are obviously unemployment and the inability for people to get through either online or by phone, and one of the things that the state has been doing is working to beef added up. They have now gone to a program with Google, where they're really enhancing their website, so that will not be a problem anymore. So many people were getting through to two- thirds or three- quarters of the process and getting dropped off for their applications. That should not be happening, but it Bible East by the end of the week and they've also were losing about 80 percent of the calls that were coming in because they had this old Verizon system that has now gone to a call center system. It's on it's in the cloud, and so that's not going to be a problem going forward. So if there's a you know a number one problem: it's the application for unemployment, the which includes the availability of unemployment for people who previously were freelancers and not able to claim unemployment. So it's even more people calling, and it's a just, an astronomical number of people who are needing to access that system, so they're working very hard on that. The other issue, of course, is this need for a phone call which we have tried to find out and we believe, probably is regulatory at the federal level, but we're double checking that, because that seems to be a real problem. People have is needing to get that call back, but they can get that call back at any time. That is not necessarily connected with the days of the week that they should call based on their. You know their the alphabetical last name, they're, dividing up the days. If you have a certain last name, you call certain days. I want to also obviously thank everybody in the all the essential workers. You know, people in our communities have really risen up to help feed people in the hospitals to be there for our local small businesses, our restaurants, the people who are doing takeout and really looking to work with our small businesses and our restaurants and bodegas, and make sure that we support those small businesses. It's very important I know that there are some big issues, obviously, which we were not able to address in the budget in part, because we do not have money and we do not necessarily have all of the tools yet, but that's rent, obviously, but that rent is also for small businesses. They have commercial leases and they have penalties and for late fees and other penalties. If they're not paying their rent on time, so even though they may have a moratorium, for example, it does not matter because they can get socked with these fees at the end. So what we really need is subsidy. We need to find a way of funding rent for people, mortgage payments, for example, and those who are coops who have proprietary loans, so they're neither fish nor fowl in terms of the law, but we are working hard on that. The assembly I want to say that the assembly is still in business. We are right now on a two- week, break that we were supposed to have being in the district and not being in Albany, but we are not closing out session, and so that's something that the speaker's made clear that the session is not over. The budget may be over, but session is not we're going to continue to work on a variety of these issues and including all of the issues I mentioned before I'm, certainly happy to go over specifics on the budget. If people have questions about that, I do not think you need me to do that at this moment, and I just want to encourage everybody in the public to physically distance themselves. Make sure you wear a mask. There are lots of people now that are sewing, masks find a way to contribute to that effort or any other effort, whether it's helping to feed our healthcare workers or anything else that you can do one of the things I remember Doris, Kearns Goodwin talking about after she had written her book about Roosevelt, and that is that Roosevelt had all these things like, you would collect the tin cans and you would do all it would take the aluminum off the gum, wrappers and that would all be melted down and used to the war effort and half of that was wrong. Okay and half of that was just he just made it up. The reality was he got. Everybody involved we're really lucky here in that it's not really look but kind of a perverse way, and that you know we know our neighbors, the small businesses they're our neighbors they're, our friends they're the backbone of our economy. Our health care workers are our neighbors. Are our friends. We can really make a difference in their lives to all those people who are essential workers in a real way. So it's not like collecting cans that are not end going to end up going to the war effort. It's a very real direct connection that we can have with our neighbors to help everybody to get through this particular war. So I just want to say thank you and I'm. Looking forward to taking people's questions later on here might be 7 p.m. claps. You know thanking the essential workers, so I'm going to take like a minute here. All right! Well done. Okay, you want to throw it to Bobby, I, think he's on I'm on hi everyone good evening. I hope everyone's family is doing well during this very difficult time. I'll just echo very quickly. A couple of things Joanne said that my office is doing as well. Obviously, I think the number one call lots of us are getting are about unemployment insurance and you know kind of the absolute havoc that is going on right now. With that system, I talked to the Commissioner of the Department of Labor. Yesterday you know one of the things if you have, if you yourself or someone you know, is looking to apply for unemployment. You know it's so important that if, when they go online, they have their employers ein number, they have their employers address, they have their social security number they have. If they do have last year's w2 or 1099. You know they have all the pertinent documents, because the website is clunky and you know I'm told it's better to use a desktop or a laptop than your phone, because there are a bunch of people who won't need phone calls if they can verify all their information, but Joanne and I have been on a daily phone call with other assembly members, and this is an issue. That's coming up around the state and I think we're all trying to figure out a way to make it easier when, of course, we have record amounts of people applying for unemployment and I think we'll all keep working to try to clear that system up as best as possible. Noting that same vein, another thing that I'm working on and I have a bill for and I want to echo again with Joanne said: I really do hope that we are able to have the rest of section, be a virtual or be it when it is safer to all convene again and hope that sooner rather than later, that were able to get the state's work done and not just punt everything to next year, I have a business interruption bill. Many small business owners purchase business interruption, bars restaurants, small firms right now. The insurance companies are rejecting all claims for business interruption, which is very disconcerting, and there was an effort among a number of states, including New York, to try to require them to cover Cove in nineteen or other pandemics. Some business interruption contracts are silent. Some specifically excluded pandemics. After the SARS pandemic or SARS came about after in 2003, so we're working on that we're getting some information out there. I was on CNBC over the weekend talking about talking about that our office also his virtual. It's been virtual for the last two weeks, but if you do leave a message at seven one, eight seven, eight seven to twenty one- you will get a callback or an email back within 24 hours. You can always email me at Carol or at my assembly Gov. We are trying our best to make sure that folks are getting the constituent services that they need, and in that vein, we've been doing a lot of work in Kensington. That is not in CB six, but you know there have been some incidents of large gatherings that we have been trying to work with community residents, the six precinct to make sure that those stop and the same kind of thing, if something's going on, be it in Prospect Park, be it on seventh Avenue. You know, please feel free to reach out to my office and finally, I just want to thank all those people who have been the real heroes out there. The first responders, the folks at Methodist, the folks who are man, our supermarkets and drugstores and hardware stores and the FDNY NYPD EMS, who are doing an absolutely amazing job and putting themselves at risk, and so thank you and I'm glad to see all of you I hope to see all of you in the flesh sooner rather than later, and thank you all for all of your hard work and dedication to our neighborhoods thanks. Bobby I was going to toss it since it's so much there's so much focus on the unemployment issue. It's going to toss it to Rafael Aspen. All the executive director of the freelancers Union since I know that a lot of his members and things like that or having a lot of issues. Ralph are you there? Yes, I'm here all right, but yeah well great, thank good evening, everyone ski so many of you. So many of my friends on this call. Thank you Mike. Thank you. 20 boys. Six for having me on and for inviting me to speak on the issues that are affecting freelancers, that for those who are not over there, the freelancers Union was started in Brooklyn over 20 years ago, with the main mission of providing freelancers health insurance and also a form of advocacy, especially when we have issues like this come up. The union also worked with Verlander and myself every closely when I was in the council's to pass the nation's first freelances and free Act, which is insurers there, that the city will get involved in mediating any contractors, future issues between freelancers and their clients. You know, historically, freelancers I've had issues collecting payments from those they contracted with, and this law provides them with the extra protection to get paid on time and in that in and in that vein, when the Coburg pandemic hit New York and across the country, you know, freelancers were left out in the cold because they traditionally do not qualify for unemployment, insurance and other are the safety net programs that exist for traditional workers. So it was as soon as I started. My job I've only been here for a month, I was out advocating our members in Congress to make sure that the pandemic unemployment assistance that was passed to the stimulus includes freelance workers. So for the first time in history, the states across the country, including New York, are providing unemployment insurance for contract work for independent contract workers or freelancers, and they have been appliances last week. But, as was mentioned in this call, they're facing a lot of issues accessing those benefits. I do not think that there is one freelancer that I can point to that. I can tell us that they are. They are ready in the system to receive payment, so you know, as I mentioned other calls there. Brad has been part of you know it's important that I elected official and all of us continue pushing the state, the Department of Labor, to do everything they can to free up those lines and get and get those dollars to those workers. You know these are workers that have been a lot of them and worked been living paycheck to paycheck other, depending on his unemployment insurance. The votes in order for them to pay their bills. I know, there's a big conversation around suspending canceling rents. It's a it's a position that I'm supportive of and I and I hope that there's further conversations around that, but aside from an employment insurance, if there are any freelancers that you're in conversation with there's, also the payroll protection program that has been released for small businesses, this past Friday, but this Friday it will finally open up to freelance workers. And if freelance workers applied for that program, is they'll get up to eight weeks of a forgivable loan towards paying their own payroll, but also rent and other another cost that they have to run their- their run their self- employed business. So that's a program. They will get you on Friday, but we also expect to have issues with that program as well, only because of how we're seeing how unemployment insurance is not working- to date. So we'll continue advocating on behalf of freelancers and I hope. I can count on all of you to speak on behalf of these workers, our 1.3 million here in New, York, City Brad, correct me. If that number is wrong, it's over 30% of the city's workforce that I have reported South freelance. Our union has close to 200,000 members here in New York. So it's a lot of people that we're speaking of that are affecting that are really affected by the loss of them by a local loss of work and a lots of benefits. So I'm here advocating if I can be a bene, resource on information or voice on an any issues, you're working on as a community board or as my or as my former colleagues in office feel free to reach out. Thank you. Thanks, ruff, it's going to keep him with the small business theme I'm going to toss it over to Dan Wylie, who I think is now on the Cole on behalf of congresswoman last words: okay, just unmuted, you can hear me. Okay, I can hear it all right, great, no, so congresswoman Velasquez I just wanted everyone to know. First off that she's feeling better. Many of you probably know that she's presumed to have coronavirus by the Capitol office of the attending physician on Sunday to 29th. Her symptoms are relatively mild and she's, even talking about wanting to donate plasma at this point to try to help others and we've all been working from home telecommuting on our laptops and collaborating on a number of different things. Of course, the Congress passed the Kerr's Act, the congresswoman is the chair of the Small Business Committee she's tried for years to actually have a grant and out- and- out grant. Unfortunately, it was unfortunate. They took a pandemic to actually get to the point where we could have an SBA grant. That could be it's gotten by small businesses as well as nonprofits. There's. Also the what Espinel mentioned the PPP paycheck protection program, which you apply through your bank nonprofits as well as not as well as small businesses, can apply, and also the gig economy. Those freelancers can also apply. We have some issues the congressman has been and her small Business committee staff has been working on some issues in terms of implementation, where there's rulemaking and interpretation wanted to make sure that we have it as generous as possible. There have been some issues, certain banks and how they define certain things. The Carson has been reaching out and her staffs been reaching out and trying to make sure that there's clear enough guidance for the banks to be able to make these very important forgivable loans- and you know, there's a whole slew of things in that act. If folks want more, they can certainly go to the congresswoman's to Weds website Nydia Velazquez house gov and we've also sent out fairly recently a mailer with a lot of good links and explanations to things and I've sent out to my list. So if people are not on that, you can go to the congresswoman's website and sign up to get it or certainly share your email and I'm able we're able to send it out to you. Thank you, Dan sorry, I apologize again. This is my first zoom, so I was going to toss. It over to coming back to another big issue that we that was hit on earlier was the schools we have. The district, 15 Chancellor Sorry Superintendent need a Scott with us tonight and if she could jump in, that would be great hi. Everybody thank you for having me tonight and thank you for the work that you are all doing. I want to reiterate what everybody else has said very quickly. First of all, we honor our first responders, who are doing incredible work, but also the people who are the unsung heroes and, as Brad said it as many people on this call have said the people who are working in our laundromats, the people who are working in our grocery stores and bodegas, the people who are delivery, people who are still doing deliveries for people who can not get out themselves the parks, people who are keeping the parks clean and making sure that they are safe for children and families to use in this special time. I want to also give a shout out to people that you may not know about across New York City. There are what are called Rec centers, and these are unique in that they are providing childcare, actual childcare and learning to the children of first responders and the people Manning. The Rec centers are all volunteers. They are people who willingly are going to work when they do not have to. They are not getting extra money, they are not getting anything, they have volunteered to do this and they are doing an amazing job supporting our children in school. The other thing that I think is super important to say in this time of such financial need is that anybody, an adult or a child can go to one of the schools that are feeding sites and we have a significant number in district 15, the feeding sites around the district 15 website. They are on the CDC website. Anybody can go and get three meals a day. You get a breakfast and two lunches so that one serves as a breakfast lunch and one serves as a dinner, but it is adults, and children and I also want to reiterate that it is children of any age so that it does not have to be a school- aged child any child. Any adult is welcome to come and get food, and again these are being staffed by our kitchen people by school security. People who are not even people are thinking about, but they deserve recognition too. So I want to thank them. Most importantly, I have to thank our teachers, our parents, our principals, our powers, everybody connected with the school system and who is working from home. We have teachers every day. I am dazzled by the fact that they are putting out enormous numbers of videos of online lessons of working that are just brilliant. We have teachers who have turned their living rooms into Sesame Street. It's the only way I can describe it. We have teachers who are music. Teachers are teachers who are doing lessons with young children and with older children we have artwork that is being produced. That is phenomenal. We have songs that are being produced, that is phenomenal, but we also have academics that are being produced. That is phenomenal, and that is a tribute to the teachers who are working so hard, who are sometimes teaching with their dog in the room or their baby on their lap, but they are doing it and they are doing amazing work while at the same time helping their own children to learn. So we have to give them a lot of credit-. I can not begin to thank the principals in district 15 for the astonishing support that they give teachers and for the way that they care so passionately about their students and about their teachers and about everybody in their community in this community. You know that in district 15 we are not only dealing with CP 6, but we are also dealing with the children in Sunset Park in CB 7, and we have had a real food crisis and I want to give a shout out to Brad and to Felix, because when this first came to light I reached out to both of them and the response was instantaneous and, as I said on a previous webinar because of their work, we were able to expand the hours of the Center for family life's food pantry, which went from having four days a week, Monday through Thursday, now to being five days a week, Monday through Friday, so that there are more opportunities for people to go and get food. This is such a difficult time for people, but we are all in this together and I know. I know that it, if there's a lot, that we have no control over and that people are confused about and concerned about. Just today, it was officially announced that the Regents will no longer be given this year and that schools, the students, do not require the Regent to graduate. They will graduate if they pass their courses, so I want to reassure parents who are worried about this about what was going to happen with the Regents. What if my child was not prepared, this is going to be based on coursework as per New York State's requirements. Please know that we will be getting more information for the Chancellor, which will talk about grading policies, promotion and all of these other issues that were waiting to hear for the lower grades. I do want to reassure parents, your children are learning I want to reassure parents that this is not something we are going to penalize children for or penalize teachers for we are pulling together as a community as a district as a country, and we will keep doing that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Superintendent Scott I'm just going to shift it over to our the commanding officer over at the 76 precinct, Meagan O'malley, who has taken time out of her busy schedule to join us. So thank you anyway. Can you yeah? Yes, sorry also, first to I just want to say thank you to Mike and Peter and all the elected officials. We have a great network in this community in terms of munication on every day, and it's like one of those things you take care of the small things. It certainly helps to take care of the bigger things. Just an amazing community, like I, said the way that everyone's respondents take care of each other and also remember some of our less secure in the community as Anita was just saying. Please do not forget that we have the Rec centers for food. There is four of them in three of them in Red, Hook and two over near the Juanes. So please, if you have an organization- and you can get that out there open early morning to midday and anyone can walk in and grab food for later. So that's something that we're certainly happy to circulate. I just want to thank all of these small businesses and the big businesses in the area. The cooperation in terms of be the shuttering has been excellent since day. One every day we sort of have an issue somewhere, but for the amount of business that we have in this community, it certainly helps when we are understaffed. You know we have diminished resources as resources. We also have officers, you know that have illness. Fortunately, everybody here is doing well so far, but you know they have need to take care, but when we're understaffed, we can count on the community to sort of support us we're not chasing people around and begging them to close their businesses. That being said, we have had a few, so if you know them, please it's for everyone's safety. It's I understand that it's their livelihood, but it's also everyone's physical livelihood in the area. Our primary concerns right now is the public safety, which is always our primary concern and we're trying to do that and Reed everybody in a time of crippling anxiety that we're here, for you know so high visibility. You know where we're trying to. We won't want you when you come outside to take your walks to see us. We want you to feel secure if there's something that you're concerned about please reach out to us: we've gotten more social media interaction, since this started than ever, which I consider like super positive. You know I'm glad that people feel like they can reach out and receive a good response. If anyone does not have the pre six phone number, it's 7:28, three, four, three, two one now is not the time to come in and get that accent, report or complaint report that you've been like putting off for a while. You can call and we can sort of walk you through how to do it on the internet or, if there's an issue that you need to talk about, we could probably talk it through on the phone, so we are also sort of working in unorthodox methods. You know, usually we like to interact with people directly and make sure that we have the entire story, and here we're saying please you know we'll try to do it. My safe distance. We do not want anyone to believe their home unnecessarily in order to get to us, so we are still nothing exchanged available. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but one thing I can ask- is please check on your neighbors. I know it's hard, especially when we're saying stay in, but if there's somebody that used to see outside, maybe you can knock onto the door and knock through the window and just see how they're doing there's. Certainly a lot of elderly in this community there's sort of a lot of single residents. So this would be super helpful in terms of wellness checks and things like that for us, we've had a few months since ready. So please continue include us if you need to coming up we're just like to wish everybody a Happy Easter over a Happy Easter and a half B Passover. You know that it'll be a little sad, not doing it with the processions and obviously everything has changed and we think the houses of worship for their cooperation and that I know it's just different for everybody. Quite frankly and I. Just on a personal note, at a professional note, I'll never be able to thank the medical staff in the local hospital as an EMS for everything. You're doing I mean we're out here too, but the things that you're doing are just incredible and I am completely stunned and awed. So thank you for that. That's all I have inspector, thank you and thanks for that part at the end and we're going to hear from John from NYPD shortly. But there is one question for you in the Q&A, which is just Anna. You know I know: we've gotten this from our office as well, that when people see you know some group congregating in a park or you know in some way not engaging in the physical distance saying you know is that a time that it's appropriate to reach out to you know I, guess that's the question. Yeah sure absolutely I mean there's never an inappropriate time to reach out to us. That's something that we try to say. You know more often, or most often in terms of you know. I know especially now is a good 901, verse, 301 time everyone's getting the alert on their phones like phone call, not on one necessarily. The real one is actually the city added an option to sorts or social distancing assignments and they some of them, are being routed to us, but yeah. Absolutely again, we'd, like I, said: we've had incidents, we did have an impromptu wedding. Last week we had a bar today and that was serving people. You know so there's certainly things to report, and we appreciate that. Can you just maybe say one word about what you're doing, because I think people feel kind of both ways on about this like, on the one hand, it's like it's not like, we want you to go out there and arrest people and then they be like the unsocial II distanced you know. But how are you know? What are you doing to try to get people to obey these rules to keep us safe in this just impossible time? Like most things, we begin with education information. In this instance, let's show you Cole and someone's playing basketball in the best ball court. We're going to come and ask you to please stop playing basketball. We have not had any proof, I have not had anybody. Look me in the face and say we are absolutely going to disobey social distance in front of you. So usually a conversation is enough to quell it. Here, like I said in the recent bar thing, we in the bar the same afternoon, we did just a few summonses, but this is a business that has been warned once before. You know, and it's just with two weeks into those three weeks into this I- think the warnings were enough here, but those are the first summonses we've actually issued anywhere are in regards to this. Everything else has been just verbally sort of resolved. Thank you. Okay, Thank You, captain inspector O'malley, keeping with the public safety team I want to throw it over to FDNY, and my good friend and colleague and government Mr. Jason show hey my good now, thanks very much to Mike and to Peter for arranging this and I wanted to say. Thank you to superintendent Scott. You mentioned the Rec programs, that's something I helped work on at the FDNY. We've had quite a few of our members get enrolled in that our kids are taking parts, but that's been a really great thing during this time, so at FDNY things are extraordinarily busy. Our EMS runs in particular are as high as they've ever been. This is this is the busiest time for our EMS they've ever been, especially over a sustained period of time like this, thankfully, we've been able to work with partners, private hospitals that already participate in the program we've asked them to surge and help take more tours in the 9- 1- 1 system. We've also been very fortunate. We've called in the help from friends from around the country. You may have seen unusual looking ambulances on the street. We've got about a hundred and thirty different ambulances taking part in the 911 system. Right now, from places like Georgia places like the Carolinas they've come in at our time of need. A lot of these are places that the fire department has sent units to in the past whether it's for a hurricane or a flood or a tornado. We often send help around the country, and it's been really great- that they've been returning the favor and helping us out at this time. I would just touch on that. This very high volume of calls of people calling 9- 1- 1 we're running it almost twice what we usually get and it becomes very difficult to keep up with. So one of the things we've been really impressing upon. People is to only call 9- 1- 1. If you have an emergency and you need to get to the hospital, we have had some people calling with questions about Co vid, with perhaps help to find a physician or how some other kind of health care provider 3- 1- 1 has resources available for those sorts of calls, we're trying to make sure that the people who call and use the 9- 1- 1 system are experienced an emergency and learn actually needing to get to the hospital just so that we can get the people that need to help the most and keep the system functioning as best we can. The other thing I wanted to touch on. We also have been sending out a good number of teams to inspect areas for physical, distancing and social distancing. We get those lists and requests from the mayor's office. We go to particular neighborhoods, but we also respond to things that people have led. City Hall know about so three one one's a good place to do that, if you're, seeing sometimes in the stores, even if they're abiding by the policy people outside will be gathered too closely or just anywhere that you're seeing problems. If you let 3-, 1- 1, know you let the City Hall know there's teams from the fire department teams from DOB NYPD. Of course the Sheriff's Department's been involved. It's been a very big effort and I would just echo what inspector O'malley said, we're doing probably 650 to 700 inspections at night and the vast majority people are complying when we do run into issues where people are maybe packed up or bunched up a little bit too much. It usually just takes a quick explanation, quick intervention and the overwhelming majority of people are being very good about it. But so just keep that in mind. Please only call 9- 1- 1. If you need to- and you know I would say we feel very supported. I know our members feel very supported at this time by members of the community. That's been really wonderful and we're all just pulling in the same direction and we're all going to get through this. So thanks to everybody here for taking part- and we appreciate the support- thank you, Jason I'm, going to stick with the theme of Jason and switch it up to Jason Rachel over for the census, update, I, think he's still here. Yes, yeah hi, Mike Hayden, thanks for pulling this together has been very entertaining and informational, so the census is going on. We are about two weeks in right now: I'll just go over some numbers of how the country, the state and the City are doing this. The country is not doing very well on the census in comparison to 2010. Right now, there's a forty five point. Seven response rate New York State, is at 40 percent New York City's at thirty five percent and Brooklyn, which is one of the West, were in the worst counties in the entire country in 2010, is at 33 percent. The Good News is that the area of CB six is performing better than old Brooklyn and New York City Councilman Landers district. The 39th is at 39% at 39, some number giant Simon's the 50 seconds at 42%, some in Carroll 40 fourths, is at 38% I'm cinnamon Ortiz. The first is at 31% there's still a lot of work to do. They have extended door-, knocking was supposed to end by July 31st this year. Census Bureau has extended that to August 14. There is a really good chance that they're probably extended beyond. That being said, I do not think, and it, of course, things can change. I do not see them extending the census beyond September, because by law they have to deliver the numbers to the President of the United States by December 31st, and that has to can only be changed by an act of Congress. They do have algorithms where they can predict. They know through administrative records. 95% of the country as it is so I do not see them extending the census into 2021, but there is a chance that could happen with coronavirus. We have had to change a lot of our outreach strategies, just like everybody else were pretty much virtual or now so we're going to be doing a lot of Pellet Town, Hall's phone banking and Technik spanking, we're already reaching out to the council. Council manager's office is already spoken to us about hosting a text out the count on April 20th, so there will be opportunities for people that want to be engaged and reach out to their neighbors through traditional phone banks and to text out the counts. There is a very good map that I want to say the address right now. It's by History Street, which is an urban planning, designing community nonprofit that we partnered with, and if you are interested in just taking a look at the city, taking a look at the neighborhoods even down to the census tract level. The address is NYC 2020 census map, DOT, Hester, Street, DOT, org and I'll, send it to Mike Oh Mike. You can include it in your daily newsletter. I guess: there's a good time to pitch your newsletter. That's basically! What's going on for sentence right now, great thanks, Jason keeping with the theme of names with today. I guess at this point, we're going to go to janja Ranko at a New York presbyterian Brooklyn methodist. Thank you. John can hear you no still not you're unmuted on the system, but I think it's on your end. No still show up is unmuted here on the on the host screen. So I do not know what whether there's a volume issue on your end or the you can play with the settings in the little mic down in the left corner. I'm. Sorry, let's go to the next speaker and maybe Naomi. If you can chat John, some suggestions for how we might I was going to okay he's going to switch it up to UM, Haitian, teeth, Bray I! Think it's on and then go to Andy angles made from the MTA next I. Think Keith is here: I I see Andy, but I do not see. Okay, let's go to Andy, then I! Guess: okay, good! Can you hear me good yep thanks Andy, yeah, I, just I think I just saw a message that Keith left the meeting. So first of all, thanks to CB six and the elected officials for having this I really appreciate it and no transit is getting hit hard, but we hear so. We want to tell you that you know. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the MTA has designed the essential service plan to transport essential workers to their vital jobs. However, we are constrained by the number of train crews available on a daily basis, as our employees take precautions against the spread of Covid-19, but we are monitoring service on a day- to- day basis in real- time to make adjustments where possible, where possible, to maintain social distance and the MTA is doing everything possible to ensure the health and safety of our customers and employees. That being said, we really are recommending and reminding everyone that, if you are not an essential worker, please do everything you can to not travel on the subways or buses. This is really going to help us in our fight to keep social distancing on the subways and buses, and we are working very closely with the NYPD and the MTA PD to enforce proper social distancing officers are on the platforms and on board trains, encouraging riders to move to another car or train if there is visible crowding- and we want to thank our partners at the NYT or really coming to the forefront for that, we continue to disinfect stations twice a day and the subway and bus fleet every 72 hours. If I would say that if a customer observes an unsanitary condition, they should report it to the train, crew or the bus operator if they are, if they can do so within a safe distance or reported to our website at MTA, DOT info or call five. One I can tell you that the back of the bus boarding is still going still being implemented. We implemented back to the bus reporting in order to try to keep social distancing from our bus operators, so basically every local bus. We are still asking our customers to board at the rear of the bus. The select bus service and the express buses are still either boarding at the front or for the first select buses we're still asking our customers to get their tickets at the sidewalk kiosks as they usually have them, and as far as personal protective equipment is concerned, I can tell you that since March First, Transit employees or MTA employees have been distributed. Three hundred thousand and ninety- five masks: 160,000 surgical, masks, two million five hundred thousand pairs of gloves and we've also used twelve thousand five hundred gallons of hand, Sanitizer and 53 thousand gallons of cleaning solution so and Brad I know you mentioned before that. As far as fatalities. Unfortunately, transit has lost 33 employees since Dudek Covid-19, so I just said. We are getting hit hard, but you know we're here and thanks to all of our partners- and you know we really are looking to get all the essential workers to where they need to go on a Euan basis. So thanks very much for having us alright, thank you. Andy, so I think we're going to try to go back to John Durango from near Presbyterian Brooklyn Presbyterian Johnny there hi. Can you hear me yep good here? You got it: okay, hi I'm, John, ranked on the director of government affairs and grants for New York Presbyterian, which includes New York, Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist. Thank you to the community board to Peter and Micro, having me into our elected officials, for putting this on. I just want to spend a minute going over some of the resources that we have available to the public right now, as you can imagine, York Presbyterian is very busy at all of our sites. Elective procedures have been canceled, but we're still doing urgent and emergency procedures. Those are ongoing. We're doing a lot of work on remote, patient monitoring to things that we are offering right now to the public. One is that we have a Cove in 1907, firm ation as well, but that number is six four, six, nine, seven, four thousand six, four six, nine seven four thousand- and this is staffed by clinical staff. Can you can describe what you know? If you have any questions, they can walk you through things. We also have telehealth or virtual urgent care services that were promoting right now and again. Mike I'll send you with information on this that you can share with folks, but you can to get the app for this. You can text n Y P, as in New York, Presbyterian, NY, PE to six nine, six, nine seven and you can download the app for our virtual urgent care services and you can communicate with a board- certified emergency physician within a couple minutes on that. Also on our website, NYPD org. We have information for folks on Coronavirus. We also have an FAQ in multiple languages that has the hotline number and we have something called health matters which has information on Coronavirus, but also how to cope with this there's some information on if you're pregnant for behavioral health services. Things like that so I'm here to take questions. I can send folks out my email address, I'm, happy to help and happy to live in this district and have such great elected officials in the area. Thank you. Thank you. John I think I have that deadline. The hotline you refer to, but I need that information I'll share and going forward, but I think Lauren's been really on top of it with you guys we're just toss it over to the Department of Health I think we have on the line hi Teddy mighty idea, but some the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you so much for having me this evening, I'm going to just offer a quick and situational update, giving some numbers as to where we are currently with our count. These numbers for New, York State were updated. As of yesterday, their website has not been updated since I've been on there, but as of yesterday in New York, they had 138 thousand cases with five thousand four hundred and eighty nine deaths and within New York City. These numbers were updated. As of 5:00 p.m. this evening. There were 74 thousand six hundred and one cases and 3544 ducts and with in Brooklyn, 19 thousand four hundred and ninety nine cases, and as of yesterday 669 deaths, these numbers are continuing to rise, which is why we've been repeating our message urging people to please stay home. If you have symptoms, we ask that you monitor yourself for three to four days and if the symptoms do not go away within three to four days, contact your health care provider and you would make a decision with your health care provider as to whether or not you need to get tested right now, testing is being reserved or we're urging people to reserve testing for those who are already in the hospital or those who are severely ill. And this is because, as we know, there's been a huge shortage of the personal protective equipment and also there's a concern that the more that you leave your home there's a possibility of you not only getting infected but possibly infecting others. And if you do happen to test positive for code 19, you will be sent home. So that's why we're just saying unless you're severely ill? That's why we're saying that as much as possible, if you can stay home, and recently we've been told that there's a worldwide shortage of the nasal swabs that are used for testing, which is more reason to please stay home. It's unless you are severely ill and you feel you're not feeling well once again always contact your health care provider and make that decision with your healthcare provider. As for our parts within the Department of Health, we are continuing to work with our sister agencies to provide the most updated guidance and resources. Our website is updated on a regular basis with our uptime update and our resources and it's updated on a daily basis with the counts. We try to update it twice a day so usually in the morning around nine o'clock and in the evening around 5:00. We also have the demographic breakdown, age, sex, borough and zip code and we're working on being able to get the race and ethnic breakdown sometime in the near future. We asked that she visit our website for information. We have some update, use and a lot of guidance documents that are very helpful. Our website is nyc.gov for its class coronavirus, Nyc.Gov forward, slash Coronavirus. Thank you great. Thank you. We're going to try to go back to Brooklyn Borough Commissioner for do TT Rea, who I think is now on the line. Chief. Okay. Is he not on like I said? First room still see he's there and he I've unmuted him on our end, but a I do not know he's not. He does have his video on, so we can't see him Keith. Can you can hear us all right? Okay, who else do we is that indicative of something popping in my screen here? Okay, we have. Actually you know there was one question for the Department of Health. So there's a few questions in the chat, but since there's one that I think is specifically for the apartment, an attendee in the Q&A box asks about case numbers. You know we're reading are not there a lot more unreported cases, people who are dying in their homes and then are not getting counted. What can you tell us about how cases are being reported and logged? So we could. You know, be confident that we really have the as much the full picture as possible. Okay, so what normally happens is those numbers do eventually get counted. Their problem is, there's a bit of a lag and when the person dies and the number is reported out, so those numbers of people who passed away, unfortunately from Kovac 19, do eventually get reported out, but there's just a lag and when those never get reported out, and what about the question of just whether there be like if someone dies in their home and they are not tested, but you know, there's is there a presumption that it's a than it is a code related or how does that work? They're testing? That is done to confirm whether or not the person has passed from Kovac 19. So there is various testing that is done. We, those numbers, are something that we do have whether or not it's someone who passes away in the hospital or home there's just as I mentioned. There's a lot, but people who died from Kovac 19 those numbers are counted is just a bit of a delay. Thank you. I think we have Keith back, but just on audio at least that's what I was told baroque commissioner, keep breaking Diego- he's called in, but I can you know I've been? Oh he's DOT. He just text me he is dialing. Now this is an overload of communication, but we'll go to him. I'll, ask one more that Zack has typed in the box a couple of times now and I do not know whether this is for Kamata or for John, but Zack says that he'd like to know if there's a place that he can refer, people, I, guess, homeless, people in particular, but others as well, who need non Covid-19 medical attention in Brooklyn. If you have someone who does need medical attention for a non COBIT matter that you're trying to help whether they're someone who's almost sort of senior or just someone you're trying to refer I, can you hear me yes, yeah I would direct them to our website and my P DOT org to get information on where the closest location would be. The city also has resources that if he goes to three one, they can find resources for the nearest health in the hospital site for our resources right now, we'd be directing them. If this is not an urgent matter to use our telehealth services and he texted me offline and I'll follow up with him Offline to see what we might be able to do to help. That's great thank you, looks like we have teeth now. We do okay, great hello. Can you everyone hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, yeah all right good, so sorry about that, the teleworking has been somewhat of a new challenge. For me, everybody else so I apologize very fast. I just want to say thanks again for CB6 for inviting me here and I've been very informative for me as well. In this panel, two quick things: one do a lot of do T's. That agency has gone to telework and we are doing a lot of basic services still so you should reach out to me or my office and I'll leave an email message. I still have a message on a zoom webinar chat, so my email address and their office phone number, because we are checking messages, though we are not in the office actively, but there's certain things are still we're doing up checks on street lights. That's obvious! Central Services, that so, if you can see at night and also for safety also for safety, we are still checking. We may show some of the first people that got tail work at guilty or people check to see camera. So we are still issuing be camera violations, because that law has not been relaxed or stopped just because kids are not technically going school. Biopsy schools still open people getting meals. Therefore, symptoms earlier I'm, just Google Crossing guards to school. So we still want safety around the schools. So, yes, we are still enforcing speeding at schools, doing all the school hours that was their previous to this pandemic and then lastly, I want to say that no there's been a lot of interest in sort of opening streets for people in activities not only here but citywide. There was a the program that just sort of ended recently, but going to something else that may be happening up the summer months go on depend on how long do they stay at home order or pause New York on did not want to call that the government calling it is going to go long. There are some play streets that happen in the past for schools. Obviously, in the summertime there are a lot of block parties. We are probably going to have discussions with bill to NYPD and also street activities permit office that does all those block parties to see what, if those mechanisms can be appropriate. You know for this sort of activity depend on how long this lasts, but those conversations are just sort of starting and obviously with you know, we have to have a cooperation with a lot of departments to make sure at this time that something like that will come off so I can't say any promises or anything is going to have any time soon. But I can't say that there are discussions to see what, if anything, can be done if some months get warmer. If this New York State Parks continues with that speed, hunt I mean we are still filling potholes. Other sort of state of good repair thing vot is also different things. Great Thank You, commissioner I think we have someone on behalf of comptroller stringer that it's finding them like I, said I. Can't oh yeah, yes, hi hi, everyone I want you so much for having me on this call. My name is Tiger Gucci and I'm, be Brooklyn borough liaison for CB 6 from comptroller, stringer I'm sure the comptroller would have loved to been on this call, but unfortunately, last week some of you may know, but he lost his mother due to Co vid, so he's just taking his time grieving, but I'm very glad to be here and just to let you guys know how our office is navigating this Koba debbik, so our office is still open. All of our services are still running. Just all of us are working from home remotely like many of you, we are still processing claims and receiving them online. So if you have filed a claim with our office, you can still contact your assigned examiner. If you do not know who that person is, you can also call our community action center and they will connect you to the correct person and all that information is available on our website. I will link it to the chatbox later in terms of thinking about the fiscal health of our city. The Comptroller released an updated budget analysis which shows that tax revenues are expected to drop by about five billion dollars over the next 15 months. So accordingly, we have called on the mayor's office to require department heads of difference to the agencies, to identify savings equal to four percent of their city funds, budget, with exceptions for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, as well as any social service agencies in terms of contracts. The comptroller is sent a letter to City all asking that nonprofits be held harmless from missed contract deliverables if they are directly attributed to Covid-19. So after we did send them about letter. The mayor's office of contract services did issue guidance to human service providers, assuring them that they would be kept whole, and it's been mentioned so many times on this call, but in terms of you know, our frontline workers and the critical services that they provide our office did release a comprehensive demographic profile of all of these essential frontline workers. So these include people in the public, transit health care, child care, sanitation and janitorial utility in delivery industries who are helping us all battle and take on Covid-19. So we really put this report together so that the city state feds, can better address the needs of these workers and so that citizens can better appreciate. You know all the issues confronted by those who are on the frontlines. So a few statistics, 60% of all frontline workers, are women. 75% of all frontline workers are people of color. More than 50% of frontline workers are foreign- born and 19% of from my workers are non- citizens. So we did also a series of recommendations for the city for these workers. Things like we recommend they provide a pathway to citizenship naturalization. We also ask the cities to subsidize the bike: memberships, lower the speed limit and greatly expand pedestrian space to help. Finally, workers get around safely during this time. I'm and I will also link that report in the Chat box. So anyone can, you do not have like a read of it and lastly, our office right now is also working with the governor's office and the mayor's office to assess in real- time ways that our hospital systems can better work together to respond to this crisis. Great, thank you. I, think that is everyone. I do not know. I think it was supposed to be someone from OAM but I'm, not sure if they ever got on as a panelist, but other than that I think that's basically it I do not know if anyone else Brad or Peter or anyone has else to throw in I just want to I just wanted to thank everyone for participating. It's been great information and I know that you know we still have. You know most to the people that joined us, so hopefully they've benefited from it in they've, even if you've just learned one thing that will help you get through this crisis. That's the most important thing. So thank you to everyone for being here. Alright, I guess, happy, Easter and Passover. Everyone is celebrating, basically I've got and like I said in the beginning, just on self plug, if you for the CD six specific information, think I've seen a few things on the side here, but I can't see all of it.

So thank you, Brad as well. No I agree. The praise goes to Megan and to Naomi who have been doing all the work in the background and Megan has answered. So there were some questions in the Q&A box and Megan has been typing answers to those that had you know kind of answers that were more like objective, so most of them got answered and the others we can copy and give to Mike and theater, and the community board can respond to them in the next.
