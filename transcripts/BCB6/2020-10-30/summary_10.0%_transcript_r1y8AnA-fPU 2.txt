If I actually would ask if there's a member of the committee, who might not mind taking notes, because I think we'll need minutes as well, somebody willing to enable to do that, I can do it thanks, I'll turn it over to you and let you run the first part of the meeting.
That breaking point resulted in a resolution that our committee pass- And this is a resolution that asks to d- map a portion of Van Brown Street from the city's official truck route.
This resolution that I'll present to you from my neighbors here in red hook addresses the topic of trucks on our main thoroughfare, Van, Brown Street, so maybe that'll share the screen.
The city truck group is currently mapped in a in a way that includes Van Brunt Street as a shortcut to a more substantial route that works off of Hamilton Avenue Hamilton Avenue is an eight, lane, major thoroughfare, and it has through Delavan Street at the North and Bay Street at the south, two arms that come into red hook.
That allow, in fact encourage trucks to use Van grunt as a shortcut to the two arms coming off of Hamilton Avenue, Delavan and Bay Street in accessing both our own manufacturing areas, but also in short- circuiting and allowing people to avoid traffic on Hamilton Avenue and come through our neighborhood.
We believe that this is an unnecessary and redundant loop which encourages truck traffic through our neighborhood, and it is exacerbating both the harm to us and our houses physically through shaking through breathing, through the particulate matter that comes out here, but also through noise, and I'm, going to show you a little bit here about the noise that is out of the ordinary.
This is pretty scientific stuff, so we felt we needed some help here in red hook, and we talked to this group called sonic sounds of New York City They're, a group of professors at Nyu's center for urban science and progress here in Brooklyn.
You, know a good old, New, York, City Street, hey frankie, how you doing that kind of noise, but the part on the right that is when a truck passes and you can see there maximum decibels, 98.6 decibels, jet engine at 500, meters.
This city, environmental quality review table I'm an architect, so I work a lot with this sort of stuff too, and just to show you the you know the marginally unacceptable noise differences we are so far up over the scale.
Let's find alternative routes that do not go through our residential cores, either Van Brunt, Street or the houses, and then we can do a truck study.
When you're saying like that hazardous materials truck, let's say it's trying to go to the future ups site right now on the in the west of red hook as part of the remediation, which is I'm, guessing, might be one of its possible destinations.
Six has gone on record a great number of years, ago, trying to get to port authority to take Hanover Street through the container port and open it up for trucks.
Here I live in 56th street, but I wanted to listen to the meeting because of the last mile, trucking facilities, and I guess I'm trying to touch base on where the where people are at on this.
If the board, I am aware of the letter that Mike sent to DOT, but I'm just wondering if the board has any additional information pertaining to air quality or noise quality or anything else that is potentially being violated by the now been out for distribution centers in red hook, because I'm sure you've heard that 280 Richard Street is also going to be the site of an Amazon facility, as well.
As most of you, know, I work for D.O.T, but right now, I'm putting on my red, Hook resident, hat.
The best course of action would be to try to get Conover, Street or inlay street, and that would be going to the port authority in EDC and working from that perspective, and if we can get them to do that to at least open their eyes to the idea of doing that, then I can see how we can move the truck route, but borrowing that I do not see DOT, taking it off the truck route without having an alternative for it.
In turn concerning how you're presenting the the acoustic data I have I'm, also part of resilient red hook, and I have been speaking with with the EDC, and they told me that they were discussing the options that they have with ups And they're in conversation with ups, so which is very positive, and they are well aware of what we've been trying to push out of red hook to have the trucks come in at from Hamilton Avenue and then also have them go in through pier 10:11 12 and out on king and Ferris, Street, and This way.
Addition to that, I know that in the past, from the different access point of court street instead of having the trucks come down, Bay, Street.
To have him: do a land swap and have Herkimer Street, possibly be available, so that this way he would give up Herkimer Street for a piece of property and red hook, and this way that would avoid these trucks going by the parks on Bay Street as well.
And, like I, said I have been in talks with ups and with personally and with resilient red hook, and also with with the EDC and with poor authority Certainly.
As, a on the official New York City Truck Route Map. Ago, of opening up inlay street through the container port.
I attended a one team, meeting, Sorry Transportation Committee meeting all the way back in March,, I'm here with first I'll, be talking about 69, Van, Dijk Street, and what we suggest for that site.
It's, just like one more thing: with more traffic truck traffic coming down, Van, Brunt, Street, I mean this is getting absolutely crazy.
Maybe, they did themselves, but it seems to me that if the program's going to succeed, we have to find a way to keep those barriers in place and the streets actually closed.
It's just a matter of resources in terms of the specific barriers It is great when we have a partner to be able to open and close the street, and we would need especially at Reed.
Unfortunately, not unfortunately, fortunately, as you may know- And, some may not cars- can go down open streets, so you can't prevent them completely so that the barriers have to be able to be moved and put back That's when a lot of them get broken, because if I'm a delivery, car driver, I do not feel like getting out my truck to move the barrier, so I can drive down So I'll, try to squeeze past it and, unfortunately, that do not always work.
