I want to talk about the importance of parks in general, the current status of open space and Gowanus our view on public place, our vision for the park a little bit about organization funding for the park and then, lastly, some thoughts on the broader rezoning in affordable housing since that's important to consider, and then also some closing thoughts too Our group was founded in May of this year by several friends and residents of Gowanus.
Although views may be different, so that said, we're really looking forward to adding our voice to this discussion about the site and wanted to thank cv6 for the opportunity to engage with everyone and present.
Then you know the site was zoned really specifically with open space and recreation uses in mind again from that same city, Planning, Commission document.
, they're setting the site aside for future recreational uses by the community, so I think, really there's a unique opportunity to create a world- class piece of quality, open space in Gowanus.
With the parks Department, we would likely want to seek funding from a mix of city, state, film and Philanthropic sources, and potentially the National grid remediation funds that have been set aside for the remediation of the site.
We think that the need for quality, open space would likely increase with the proposed residential increase of the rezoning.
We feel that the scope of work proposals for open space are good, but also limited, and so we think that this is another reason why having a park on the site would be would be helpful to have for the neighborhood.
We also think that the scope of work falls a little bit short on presenting a plan to study the quality of open space in the eis.
That's, currently in Gowanus, and so we think that more attention should be paid to that to say: Hey. You know what is the quality of existing open space and go on us and really study that more and present a plan to study that in the eis, with respect to affordable, housing?
I think we just want to say first that we support stabilizing, existing, affordable housing and support the call for investment in the existing NYCHA units in Gowanus.
We had thought that if a site is specifically zoned for open space, that there was a state process that needed to be followed- It may just be helpful to just get clarification from Bcp, please.
We think that public place is the ideal site for a large public park and Gowanus, because the community has wanted for 50 years.
You know we think that maybe there might be potentially viable options that could both create affordable housing and also preserve the park.
We think that the scope of work we should potentially look at that to see if we need to revise it, to study the quality of open space in a little more detail, we'd like to propose seeking clarification from DCP on the status of the parkland alienation, process, and then overall, I think.
Irrespective of the end use, it seems like there are a lot of open questions about the chemicals and toxicity of the site, so we think that maybe potentially get another set of eyes on the work through some kind of like audit or someone looking into that could be helpful just to just to really ensure that community health and safety are protected.
Okay, I think you answered this already, but the in terms of the displacement of the affordable housing component of the development that's currently being contemplated by DCP on the site.
I. Think that you know it's not like a great position to be in to be advocating for a different use in affordable, housing.
I guess we're just saying that this site, you know, has had a plan in place to be to be a park for a long time and could be, and so maybe it makes sense to try to think about some options where you could keep the park and have affordable housing We do know that there is like a significant market rate component to the brazilian proposal.
I do not know if that's something that perhaps the committee can confirm and maybe more knowledgeable than I, but our thinking was that if there are significant funds set aside conceivably, perhaps national grid may be amenable to dedicating some of those funds for park.
You know, funds to develop the park at this point, but are looking around for ideas and potential ideas.
Someone wants to just ask a question for the public and wait first, wait till we go to the public session and then just do a text to me privately and just say: I'd like to ask a question : I think that Glenn pretty clearly stated the history of this location, and it was actually 25 or 30 years ago that there was a group in Carol gardens that actually tried getting it made into a recreation area.
My question to Mack is more like, since I do not see that your proposal is creating a area that would be designated as a park zoned as a park and thus alienated and would be there forever right.
And I think that the evidence really lends itself to the fact that it seems like the whole community and local elected officials really wanted this site to be used for open space and recreational space.
My understanding was if there was some kind of official zoning designation, that that dedicated a site for open space and recreational uses that had a bearing on its designation as parkland, and so I do not.
But I also think that their the balance between a park and affordable housing is a tough one.
What I'm, struggling with is that the very things that make this site an attractive space for a park are what make it an attractive space to build around 900 units of somewhere between 74 and 100, affordable housing, which is the proposal.
You know: there's publicly owned land in a site of this size, it's rare to come by It's the same thing that makes it a special place for a park, and I It's, difficult to say that we're not sure how this would impact the rest of the affordable housing proposal, because we know precisely how it would affect the rest of the affordable housing.
First I'd, say: second, you know the Gowanus for zoning proposal is very, is very imaginative in a lot of ways.
I think it's kind of important that people living in affordable housing be mixed in with everybody.
If you will, between a park and housing, should take into consideration the quality of the land there And, it happens to be the most polluted contaminated site along the Gowanus canal, which makes it less valuable for housing more risky for housing than for use as a park, and that should be a consideration here, especially since the state Department of environmental conservation has decided to do a lesser cleanup that was originally anticipated, which means more chemicals will be left on site and the proposed residents will be exposed to them over time, and we do not know what the effects are going to be, although they're not likely to be good.
It's, a city, Map street map, designation that has to go away to develop the site in certain ways the existing zoning that you have there when you have manufacturing districts when there's an M1 district that does allow park as use I, believe it's an m2 over there, so the zoning, the underlying zone right now allows for a wide range of retail to warehousing to actually making things industrial uses with a pretty suburban parking, requirement.
I. Think that you know the city should seriously be looking at this site in a way that can most mitigate the climate, disaster.
What sort of going off of what Alec was saying, like that's the attraction of the site, that it is publicly owned, land and obviously land is the most expensive asset that goes into any of these projects, and so I wonder like if there are other like publicly owned, lots, Even, if they're, not as large, like in the area, whether those could be used for affordable, housing, I'm, just not sure what you're understanding as a sort of the neighborhood I want to say.
Right that we need public, we need a lot of park space and that we need housing and as long as we're only talking about this particular plot, then it seems like the trade- off is kind of zero- sum.
The comm would Mac or you specifically, or would the committee in general be in favor of upzoning the broader neighborhood as a way to make up for the housing that we would lose if this site were to become a park?
I just wanted to echo some of the comments made by other people in support of affordable housing and this site.
I think we should pick affordable housing over a park and if you want to have both, I, strongly support.
Think Concur said it except it nicely about the need for affordable housing, but is in terms of process.
I'm on the committee, and I did have a question about the fenestration on the side of the extension to the rear, not the penthouse, and did we see a picture of what that's going to look like face on for the neighbor in the back?
