And Mac's voice cool. Thank you, hello, everybody! I'm Mac Thayer! I live at Smith 9th street in Gowanus and am going to be giving a presentation on the Gowanuslands.Org Park Initiative. Thank you very much CB6 for hosting this and giving us a chance to give the presentation. Ty can is my volume? Okay? Can people can people hear me? Do you think you sound good to me if anyone is having to sound good? Okay? Great! Thank you yes! Well, I will try to keep the presentation length at about 10 minutes. It may go over a little longer. I guess. If it's running too long or just let me know tai if there's anything, I should do, and I understand that there may be an opportunity for a Q&A after the presentation. Is that correct once the presentation's over then either? I believe, Mark or possibly David will then take questions we'll try to get everyone who has a question? Okay, great thanks a lot. Well, I'm ready to begin. I'm not sure where the presentation is. I do not see it, I'm going to share it on the screen. Now. Okay, thanks, okay, great! So this is a presentation for public place park, which is a community- led proposal for a world- class park in Gowanus. Our organization is Gowanuslands.Org, please I want to run just through a few agenda items I want to talk about our group. I want to talk about the importance of parks in general, the current status of open space and Gowanus our view on public place, our vision for the park a little bit about organization funding for the park and then, lastly, some thoughts on the broader rezoning in affordable housing since that's important to consider, and then also some closing thoughts too so I'll just jump into it please. So our group was founded in May of this year by several friends and residents of Gowanus. We started a petition on our website and, I think, actually about 800. Now people have signed the petition in support of having a park on public place. Our mission is to plan and advocate for a world- class park on vacant lands, that is on the west side of Gowanus between 5th street and 9Th Street, and we believe in the importance of quality, open space parks, grass, trees, light open space and equitable access to open space and Gowanus. We also really believe in the importance of the community input process in civil discourse and respect for other people and parties. Although views may be different, so that said, we're really looking forward to adding our voice to this discussion about the site and wanted to thank cv6 for the opportunity to engage with everyone and present. Please so parks are really important. You know they improve our physical health, they improve our psychological health. I love this quote by Maya Angelou. That says, each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us. So true. I think they also are really important in terms of equitable access to open space. This quote by Bruce Babbitt. I think it's really telling it says you know parks serve day in and day out as the primary green spaces. For the majority of Americans, that's really true, I think we should value parks, they also bring communities together. You know they're accessible to all, they promote joy, humanity, they also help with storm water, flooding and flood control. And, lastly, biodiversity may seem like a small consideration in the urban environment, but parks are actually really important for promoting urban biodiversity. Please, so I think, there's pretty wide agreement that Gowanus is underserved for open space. The overall quantity of open space is low overall in per capita. You know there are parks, but there are relatively few. I also think that the quality of open space is low, and this is comparative, but especially as compared to other neighborhoods, which have better park and open space resources. Gowanus parks are relatively small: they're paved over there's cars. There's traffic, there's noise: you know this is to some extent what you get in the city, but at the same time there are opportunities to provide more broader, open space that have grass trees, space and light. And lastly, I just say that this has been a recurring theme that at least I've heard in the community for years that the community has wanted and advocated for quality, open space and Gowanus. Please. This is just a map from the Parks Department, which shows parks and Gowanus, and then, if you go to the please, there's just a satellite image which shows the same thing, which I think is an interesting viewpoint and you can see there are really relatively few in small parks. There's a few adjacent to Gowanus, which arguably Gowanus residents can use, but there's not a lot in Gowanus itself, please. So we view public place, which is the vacant land located at Smith, Street and Fifth street as the ideal location for a large public park in Gowanus. It's a six acre site, it's really well situated with access for the surrounding community. The community has also wanted this site to become open space since the 1970s, just looking back at some of the documentation and quotes around the original zoning designation. The city Planning Commission cited an overwhelming demand throughout the community for available open space. This is in 1974., and then you know the site was zoned really specifically with open space and recreation uses in mind again from that same city, Planning, Commission document, you know, they're setting this up, they're setting the site aside for future recreational uses by the community, so I think, really there's a unique opportunity to create a world- class piece of quality open space in Gowanus. These kinds of spaces that are specifically designated to become open, space and zoned, for it are really rare, and we should think about that because it's just a unique asset to have. Lastly, pollution on the site and flooding pose challenges and a park is a great option to address both of those, and then you can look at the fresh kills park on Staten island as an example of a remediation done really well a site. That's really polluted! That's not being cleaned up for a park please. So our vision for the park is a comprehensive, publicly accessible world- class park on vacant, city- owned land at public place and adjacent private parcels. If practical, so we envision a natural parkscape with a field, trees, walk- in paths, waterfront access and natural plant species, we think that this is consistent with the historic intended use and high level of community of current community support and interest. I would note that the remediation of the brownfield site poses challenges, and I think that there are open questions on the chemicals and coal tar on the site that should probably be addressed before moving forward with the park. Please so here's a image of the site. Now you can see public place at the top there and then in the middle is the private site and below as well. If you go to the today, please you can see our proposal to basically create a large park on the public place site, as well as the adjacent private parcels. This would be a pretty large and green open space in the heart of Gowanus next side. Please so here's a view of the site now looking from across the canal, and you can see the shore front there and please and then here's our proposal a proposed rendering for what it could look like. If the whole space were to be developed into a park, we envisioned really a having a promenade there and providing access to the water, which you think is really important. Please, in terms of the organization and the funding we would advocate following a model similar to Prospect park, where you create organizations that can help advance the design and construction of the park, including potentially a friends of public place, Park organization to guide the development and then conceivably, there's just an idea, a development corporation or some kind of autonomous entity that could really help drive the development of the park. In partnership with the parks Department, we would likely want to seek funding from a mix of city, state, film and Philanthropic sources, and potentially the National grid remediation funds that have been set aside for the remediation of the site. We estimated a cost of approximately 100 million dollars, including acquisition of adjacent sites and development of the park. If adjacent sites were not included, this would likely be lower. But we settled on that number as a ballpark figure, not an insignificant cost to create a large- scale park on the site, and we would clearly want to engage with NYC parks to understand their thoughts on feasibility and further expertise in helping to guide the effort of developing the park. Please so just a few thoughts on the rezoning and affordable housing. Since it's pretty closely linked, you know. We think that the need for quality, open space would likely increase with the proposed residential increase of the rezoning there's a likely. I think it's a increase from about 20,000 to 40,000 people with the rezoning. We feel that the scope of work proposals for open space are good, but also limited, and so we think that this is another reason why having a park on the site would be would be helpful to have for the neighborhood. We also think that the scope of work falls a little bit short on presenting a plan to study the quality of open space in the eis. So you know as we're reading the eis. We know that there's a lot of attention to the quantity of open space and also future quality, but does not really provide a great baseline of the quality of existing open space. That's currently in Gowanus, and so we think that more attention should be paid to that to say: hey, you know what is the quality of existing open space and go on us and really study that more and present a plan to study that in the eis with respect to affordable housing? I think we just want to say first that we support stabilizing existing, affordable housing and support the call for investment in the existing NYCHA units in Gowanus. We also would advocate considering if there may be options to create affordable housing without losing the public place park. And, frankly, we do not. We do not know the answers to that. One thought we had you know is it: is it feasible to decrease the luxury and market rate housing components of the rezoning and build affordable housing? Instead? I think our thinking is just that. You know given there's such a high level of community interest and support in a park and for decades and that the park has been specifically zoned. This the site has been simply zoned for open space. Maybe it makes sense to think a little bit about if there are other options that could proceed without having to lose the park and then, lastly, we would just like to propose seeking clarity from DCP. I guess on the status of the parkland alienation process. We had thought that if a site is specifically zoned for open space, that there was a state process that needed to be followed- and we do not know the answer not either, it may just be helpful to just get clarification from Bcp, please. So, just in closing, you know, we feel that quality open space is important, valued and needed and go on us. We think that public place is the ideal site for a large public park and Gowanus, because the community has wanted for 50 years the site is zoned and protected, specifically for open space uses. It's really a rare opportunity to have that and a really unique opportunity to create a park. A park is feasible. It helps to address slight pollution and flooding, and it also enhances urban biodiversity. You know we think that maybe there might be potentially viable options that could both create affordable housing and also preserve the park. So we think that maybe we should at least be identified and considered before we lose the park. We think that the scope of work we should potentially look at that to see if we need to revise it, to study the quality of open space in a little more detail, we'd like to propose seeking clarification from DCP on the status of the parkland alienation process, and then overall, I think, irrespective of the end use, it seems like there are a lot of open questions about the chemicals and toxicity of the site, so we think that maybe potentially get another set of eyes on the work through some kind of like audit or someone looking into that could be helpful just to just to really ensure that community health and safety are protected. So that's it. I see him a little over on time as there's some contact info up there. If anyone has any further questions, please feel free to shoot us an email at the the gmail address there. But with that I'm happy to take any questions. Hi, I'm sorry! This is Bob Levine. I just want to make suggestion of putting the map back up. While questions come up, it might be easier for people to see the site. Okay, we can do that. I would suggest that who, if you have a question you should send it in a message to I'm guessing mark is not able to see messages because he's on his phone. Maybe David can receive chats on here, because if I'm going to share my screen, I can't receive the chats. I could see the chats mark yeah as some people. Okay. No, I would appreciate it if you can handle this. I'm on my phone. I have very little facility to deal with this properly. I did have questions that I forwarded to you and ty about where they are in this process. I suspect not that far along, but I still would like those questions presented even if they can't be answered now and would have to be answered at a later date and after I sign off here, I would be happy to listen to what goes on and I leave it in your capable hands. David. Okay, thank you! So I'll go back, I'm going to go ahead and ask you these questions that mark referred to and as he said, if you do not have questions or answers right now, that's okay and I think you might have actually answered a couple of these in your presentation and then I'm going to turn it over to the committee's questions and then we'll open up for public questions. The first questions first question is: have you had any discussions with the Parks Department concerning the disposition of the site? No, we have not with respect to disposition. Sorry. What does that refer to? Well, you know converting it to a part: okay, yeah. No, we have not yet at this point it's still just a concept that we've been discussing in the community, so we have not formally engaged or really reached out to Parks Department. Okay, are you working with any landscape, architects or engineers in terms of to establish your vision? Is not it so who are they? No, we have not gotten there yet we had an initial rendering prepared, but have not taken that next step of talking with landscape architecture, engineers we're really a grassroots organization. So we have not. We have not started spending money. For that sure, that's, okay! I think you had an estimate in there did you did you propose an estimate for the part in your presentation, yeah. You know we had heard that the private site adjacent to public place had been sold for approximately 50 million dollars, so assuming that the site would be acquired in order to add it to the public play site. We were anticipating approximately a market rate price of 50 million for that plus 50 million dollars to design and develop the park sort of completely across the three sites. So I'm sorry, what does that add up to 100 million or 150 million 100 million was our ballpark estimate? Okay, but I'm assuming you do not have any funding sources or commitments to funding right now. No, certainly not I mean, I think that we would. I think you know if you look at how other parks have been funded, such as like Brooklyn bridge park, there's a mix involved, you know of. Like I mean. Certainly there are different models. You know to fund parks. You could have like the city funded itself. I think that you know we know that there have been budget cuts to the to the Parks Department, so I've been trying to think creatively about how park could be developed and conceivably following some kind of hybrid model, where you seek city funds, state funds, potentially philanthropic funds, I think, could be a good outcome for raising the money for the park. Okay, I think you answered this already, but the in terms of the displacement of the affordable housing component of the development that's currently being contemplated by DCP on the site. Your solution to that is to decrease the amount of market rate housing elsewhere and make up the difference with affordable housing to offset the loss in this site. Is that am I saying that right? You know we do not really have a solution for that. That was one idea that we're throwing out there. I think that you know it's not like a great position to be in to be advocating for a different use in affordable housing. I think that you know we certainly feel that affordable housing is important and I think a lot of people in the community. You know feel that affordable house is important too. I guess we're just saying that this site, you know, has had a plan in place to be to be a park for a long time and could be, and so maybe it makes sense to try to think about some options where you could keep the park and have affordable housing, we're just not sure that it is mutually exclusive, so that was one idea that we threw out there. You know we do know that there is like a significant market rate component to the brazilian proposal. I thought hey. Is it actually possible to build more affordable and have less luxury housing? I do not. We do not know the answer to that, but that was just one idea: we're throwing out there. Okay, do you have any support of any local elected officials? We do not have explicit support at this point. No we've largely focused on seeking to understand how the local community feels about it so we're just starting to, I think, we're kind of just starting to do that. Local. What's it official engagement, okay- and I just want to add one other question to the list here- you mentioned in your funding that you could tap into national grids remediation funds, and I did not quite understand that if you could just link that like because you, I believe the coal Tar cleanup is a challenge, but I'm not sure there's anything in your presentation that speaks to that cleanup. That's part of it. It's part of the park solution. So how? Why do you think those funds would be available to build the park? Well, we're not sure, but my understanding is that there are significant funds that have been set aside by national grid, specifically for the clean up and remediation of the site. I do not know if that's something that perhaps the committee can confirm and maybe more knowledgeable than I, but our thinking was that if there are significant funds set aside conceivably, perhaps national grid may be amenable to dedicating some of those funds for park development as well, and I honestly am not sure how much those funds are there. I had heard that it was in the range of tens of millions of dollars, but I'm not sure is that is that something that maybe I would pose that to the committee as well? Is that something that you are aware of well national grid? And there are others on this call that could speak to. This is a prp, as is the city, and I think 30 other landowners around the canal and they are required to fund the Superfund cleanup, but it's not and that and that's what they will do with the EPA oversight. I'm just not clear how that money then becomes available for the development of the park, because that does not have anything to do with the cleanup unless we're taking money away from the cleanup to create the park, or you think that there might be extra money left over to create the park once the cleanup's done yeah. I think the latter version I mean I'm not aware of how much funds are available or how much are being used for the for the park. So I think well, there are not any funds available right now for a park. The funds are solely dedicated to the cleanup, but anyway we do not have to go down the rabbit hole on that one. I just. I was just trying to understand if you knew something that maybe I did so, oh yeah. No, I think you're totally right. I think that the point is that we have not identified. You know, funds to develop the park at this point, but are looking around for ideas and potential ideas. You know it seems like. Potentially, the national good funds could be one of several potential options. Okay committee members, any questions you can do a chat or you can raise your hand, I'm not seeing all everybody's face all right glenn. Can we unmute Glenn, ty or clint? Can you do it? I can unmute myself okay. I just want to say that I appreciate the effort here to assemble this presentation, because this is something that has come up over and over again in carroll gardens over the last I'd say: 30 years. This was originally intended as public space to be used for recreation for the local community, and then it was forgotten. This happened back in the 70s, there was no money and there were just dreams. There were suggestions, ideas floated over the years and then it was just forgotten. Maybe 15 years ago the city decided. Maybe we can cash in on this, but there was really no or not much of a public process regarding taking something that was intended as recreation space and using it for something else. It was just assumed that it was going to be converted to housing. So I think it's important that we consider this independently of the zoning, because it's not like all of the manufactured zone property along the canal. This is something unique we own this and Mack is right. If we lose this opportunity, it's going to be unlikely. We will get such an opportunity again. Affordable housing can go almost anywhere. You can't put a park just anywhere. We would be forced to take private property in order to do that. That's all! Okay! Thank you. Glenn just there's a lot of comments coming across and I can't read all of them. If someone wants to just ask a question for the public and wait first, wait till we go to the public session and then just do a text to me privately and just say: I'd like to ask a question and I'll call on you but you're across four screens. So just bear with me. While I look for your your name and stuff Jerry, you got a question more of a maybe even a question, but definitely a comment. I think that Glenn pretty clearly stated the history of this location and it was actually 25 or 30 years ago that there was a group in Carol gardens that actually tried getting it made into a recreation area, not a park. My question to Mack is more like, since I do not see that your proposal is creating a area that would be designated as a park zoned as a park and thus alienated and would be there forever right now. The term public place guarantees absolutely nothing. It's a term, that's kind of amorphous. So have you. I know you said you were looking at into the New York State alienation process. What have you found so far, and how do you see to make sure that if this goes through as a park, it stays as a park? Yeah, that's a great question. I mean I'm, not a legal expert. I just have read the documentation from when it was officially designated. As for public use- and I think that the evidence really lends itself to the fact that it seems like the whole community and local elected officials really wanted this site to be used for open space and recreational space, so I I'm not sure exactly how the parkland alienation process may apply. My understanding was if there was some kind of official zoning designation, that that dedicated a site for open space and recreational uses that had a bearing on its designation as parkland, and so I do not. I do not know the answer to that, but I think really what I'm? What we're curious about is what the city's feeling DCP, how they are thinking about it perhaps they're thinking about it. The same way you outlined in terms of it having less of a variant, perhaps they're thinking a different way. It'd just be interesting to hear, I think, with the city's perspective since they're opposing the use change, have you had a chance to go? Look at the Original Board of estimate. Some of us remember that thing. The Original Board of estimate designation is public place and do some more research on that. I've read a number of documents, including board investment documents, I'm not sure if it's perhaps the specific one that you're referring to, but would certainly love to see those if you've, if you have access to them to learn more as well, it sounds like you have quite a lot of knowledge about, like the documentation and the open use designation. So I'd love to have the opportunity to learn from you on that. The only other thing I had is, I think you need to be a little bit more specific, and I, like the presentation, I probably say that I think, there's a desperate need in all of CB6 for more parks more park land. I think you need to take a look at what the ideal, how much park per 1000 or whatever the formula is and show how much underserved this community board is in parks even with the Red Hook recreation area. But I also think that their the balance between a park and affordable housing is a tough one and I'd like to see how you resolve that makes total sense yeah. I would just say that, with respect to your latter point, you know we are not the decision makers we're just providing an idea that we think, like a lot of the community supports, and so I think that it's important to say that you know as part of the public process around the site, which I think is sort of the intent of the of the process. With respect to the former point on quantity of open space per capita, I agree it's something we can look at. We know that the wants is underserved for open space. One thing we are trying to stress is the quality of open space is also important. You can create quantity of open space, but you may not necessarily have the same quality, which is hard to achieve and having a large park is really a nice way to do that, so both quantity and quality are important, but thank you. I have well noted your your advice. Thank you. Other committee members David, if I could jump in first man, sorry who's talking about this- is Alex. Oh, hey, Alec, okay, sorry, first of all, thank you for your presentation. It was really it's lovely and it's lovely to see a group of people in the community who care so much about it coming together to propose what its future should look like, and I think it was thoughtful. What I'm struggling with is that the very things that make this site an attractive space for a park are what make it an attractive space to build around 900 units of somewhere between 74 and 100, affordable housing, which is the proposal that's on the table from the city. You know there's publicly owned land in a site of this size, it's rare to come by it's the same thing that makes it a special place for a park, and I it's difficult to say that we're not sure how this would impact the rest of the affordable housing proposal, because we know precisely how it would affect the rest of the affordable housing proposal. It would dramatically reduce the amount of affordable housing, that's created by the Gowanus rezoning and in the area where we have the opportunity to do the most affordable housing with the least luxury, because we do not have high costs of site acquisition because it's publicly owned already. You do not need the luxury units which we all want. Fewer of I'm guessing to cross subsidize the affordable, that's coming from the land itself. So that's where the rubber hits the road. Here you know it's, the cost is on the table. The cost is very obvious, and it's not obvious how, by any means, you would make up that desperately needed, affordable housing on the rest in the rest of the rezoning proposal, and so that's my reaction. It would obviously be a lovely park, but we have such a desperate, affordable housing crisis, and so I I'm it is a comment that I'm making, but I would like to put it back to you, because you know I think you've been demurring on what the effects on the proposal would be, and I think it's very concrete what the effects on the Arizona would be. It would be a dramatic reduction in the amount of affordable housing that can't be made up elsewhere, yeah. No, I think it's a really fair point. I mean it's a valuable site because it's land and I feel, like some extent, you know in New York people are just trying to figure out what to do like with a limited supply of land. Affordable housing is really important. That's for sure. I think that open space is also important, and so I think that you know we're not saying what should be or just saying that we should think carefully about how we want to what we want to put where you know, particularly as this one site was initially set aside, specifically to be open space and used for recreational purposes. So I put that out. First I'd say: second, you know the Gowanus for zoning proposal is very, is very imaginative in a lot of ways. You know it's saying it's looking at something that something that is now and saying hey. This could be totally different. We could reimagine this in a lot of different ways, and so I think that you know just in the way that a lot of a lot of thought and care and like visionary thinking, was put into the Gowanus resilient proposal. Perhaps there could we could harness that same level of of imagination and vision to think about ways in which you might be able to increase, affordable hazard in a different way. So when you say that the impacts on affordable housing are very clear, I'm not so sure about that. I would so respectfully say you know. Maybe there are other ways to address affordable housing that we have not thought of, and maybe there are not but like. Perhaps it could be good just to think about it a little bit and come up with some ideas together. I do not think it's a great idea to always have affordable housing lumped together. I think it's kind of important that people living in affordable housing be mixed in with everybody. I do not think it's such a great idea to just shove people into projects, or so, if there were more density in the rest of the area and then the new developments had to have a little bit more affordable, it might be possible to have a park. Thank you, Judith, I'm going to Glenn. I think you wanted to respond. I do not know if it was so what Alec was saying or what Mac was saying, but if you can go ahead, this is Dan before you do that. I just want to say hi to everybody. This is Daniel. Sorry, I'm joining late. I just got up it's great to see all of your faces good to see you. I just wanted to point out one thing: two things actually, the trade- off, if you will, between a park and housing, should take into consideration the quality of the land there and it happens to be the most polluted contaminated site along the Gowanus canal, which makes it less valuable for housing more risky for housing than for use as a park, and that should be a consideration here, especially since the state Department of environmental conservation has decided to do a lesser cleanup that was originally anticipated, which means more chemicals will be left on site and the proposed residents will be exposed to them over time, and we do not know what the effects are going to be, although they're not likely to be good. The other thing is, we are still in a Covid-19 pandemic and will not understand the effects on our city on our buildings, residential and commercial over time, and this should also be considered before we make a sweeping change to this area as if Covid-19 never happened. Thank you, okay. Thank you, glenn any other committee members. I have a few people from the public who like to speak here. Okay, Bob go ahead. I think you're on Mute yeah. Oh there you are. I do not think it should be. A discussion on whether or not we have to give up, affordable house housing or have the park has to pay for it as Al described. This was a area that was decided many years ago that it was set aside for public use for parkland or that kind of use and the decision should be which one of the other not and it does not have to be decided on which one would pay for what more or less. If I think, if the community thinks it should have stayed parked parkland, that's fine and go from there not having to then decide well, you know which one is cheaper or which one does why? That's all. Thank you. Bob. I'm actually going to ask Richard Barack to say a few words. Some points of clarification on the part which are you there. I think you're muted. I had a modifier to get to the screen that I could unmove. So, first of all the public place destiny designation is different than if it was a mapped park. So at the time in the 70s they did not map it as a park. A public place then, would not, therefore, need to go through the legislature to have a change. A public place is basically a placeholder for public interest, so it allows the process now to consider uses that would be deemed into public interest consistent with the idea of public place from what we saw in the scoping there seems to be, I mean I would expect to see some map land on part of this public place site, because it was looking to have an extension of bond Street curving around to back this mystery so that land to the East I was speculating when we see the certified application, we might actually see some parkland as part of this so streets. You could deem to what extent you deem them serving public interest, and then there was talk- and I know HPD has participated, listening some of the site in the last presentation that was at the community board, probably around March or so February showed that they were looking to reserve some of the site for a likely public school which again, some may deem to be a public interest use. So those are some of the things to keep in mind in terms of looking at the proposal and the southern side, because it's not city owned. If there really was strong interest and ended a process, what would have to happen is that site would be removed from the rezoning and remain in limbo, where it still has commercial light rights for a significant amount of time before any effort could be made towards parkland jurisdiction. Thank you, Richard Joanna. Did you sorry? I want to call on well. Did you want to respond to that Mac or oh? No, I just want to say I was super helpful thanks. One thing that I thought of while you were speaking Richard was just in terms of the current zoning designation. That's something that would need to be modified or is that something that needs to go through a process in order to develop the site in different ways? Or do you have any thoughts on that two things number one: the public place designation, which is not a zoning designation. It's a city, Map street map, designation that has to go away to develop the site in certain ways the existing zoning that you have there when you have manufacturing districts when there's an M1 district that does allow park as use I'm trying to remember, I believe it's not an m1. I believe it's an m2 over there, so the zoning, the underlying zone right now allows for a wide range of retail to warehousing to actually making things industrial uses with a pretty suburban parking requirement. Okay, thank you. I want to call on Joanna hi y'. All this is a really interesting conversation and I'm kind of scrabbling with how far along this process is and how exciting this new idea is, and I'm just you know, trying to balance it. A couple of things I wanted to bring up were just new information that we have. Since the most recent iteration of the Gowanus plan came from planning and Glenn mentioned it, we have a pandemic. We also have a lot more data on our climate crisis dance card. We know now things we did not even know six months ago, and I just wanted to raise. You know the environment as a member of this conversation that does not have a voice. I think that you know the city should seriously be looking at this site in a way that can most mitigate the climate disaster. That's knocking on our door if there's a way for the affordable housing aspect, which is very needed and very well thought out at this point to move forward in a way that incorporates as much open, wet sponge as possible. That's great, but I think at this point open land and land that has been curated. Naturalists to provide defenses against flooding, it's pretty precious at this point and I think a park has a better chance of being designed with that in mind. Just from my novice angle on things- and I just I'm not sure how involved everyone on the call has been in the whole Gowanus rezoning process, but just to know that there are very powerful interests at play here and there's more money than we can even dream of at play on the real estate front, and so you know having the hope that the land can be used best for both the people's open land, recreational use, but also preserving the planet. You know there's a lot to push against so just to for everyone to know, that's what's behind the scenes, and there are a lot of people trying to push forward the Gowanus rezoning plan as we speak right now. They want it done yesterday, regardless of what happened to us all in the last six months. So thanks so much. Thank you. Joanna! I'm going to open this up to the public, because I know some people have been asking or waiting patiently and Edward Dellman you're, the first one I had here with a question: do you want me to ask it for you or do you want to it's? Okay, I can ask it myself: okay, hi everyone, and also thank you Mac for that great presentation. That was really helpful. It's a really imaginative idea. I guess my question is whether you are aware of similar plots in the area that are either city owned or would also be able to be purchased and used for ever no or zero cost, because I think I mean I think, what sort of going off of what Alec was saying, like that's the attraction of the site, that it is publicly owned, land and obviously land is the most expensive asset that goes into any of these projects, and so I wonder like if there are other like publicly owned lots, even if they're, not as large, like in the area whether those could be used for affordable housing, I'm just not sure what you're understanding as a sort of the neighborhood yeah. I think it's a great question. I'm not sure I guess is the short answer and it would be great to find out like. I would welcome the opportunity to talk to people who do know if those kinds of resources might exist. I think it's a great point and I do not have a great answer for you on it. Thank you, okay, thank you. Edward Dan, Miller hi. I want to say thank you to the committee members for letting me give a comment here, and I I've noticed a lot of people saying that, like trying to kind of have it both ways right that we need public, we need a lot of park space and that we need housing and as long as we're only talking about this particular plot, then it seems like the trade- off is kind of zero- sum right. It's either going to be a park or it's going to be housing and a lot of people think that we need both. So what I'd ask is, if you are in support of this being a park, why not affirmatively seek out opportunities to upzone the rest of the neighborhood? Why not go to some of those brownstone blocks just to the east or just to the West in Park, Slope and Carroll gardens and say, let's up zone these, let's allow much more dense housing here. Are there? Would you would the comm would Mac or you specifically, or would the committee in general be in favor of upzoning the broader neighborhood as a way to make up for the housing that we would lose if this site were to become a park? I will just say speaking on behalf of the committee, that I do not think we've established any formal position on that. It's a it's a valid question and one that we will. You know, consider Mac. If I do not know if you have a response to that yeah, I agree. I think it's a really interesting idea. I would say that we have not really considered that option. To be honest, we're a small, grassroots organization. Our main focus has been primarily on this site public place, which we think would be an ideal site for a park, and so frankly, it's only been more recently that we've kind of started to become more involved in the broader discussions about the rezoning and affordable housing just because that is tied into the whole thing. So I think it's a really great question. I we have not thought about it in great detail. Okay, thank you. Margaret. You have a question bargain's still here: okay, I'm going to move on next person was Matthew, Fairley hi. Thank you to the committee for having this and thank you and I wanna. I want to compliment. I want to compliment mack on that presentation and his engagement in the community, but I do want to say that I think as much as I hate to say to zero some game. I think that particular part of land would be better used as affordable housing. The city needs affordable housing on an epic scale, and that is a certainly a very good place for it. It's right next to transportation, it's a block from a subway station. It's right where to go, and I'd just like to you know, add on to what other people have said that you know public use does not automatically mean a park. You know, public use means a school public use means fire departments. Public use means things that serve the public and affordable housing serves the public. Affordable housing serves the people of the city. That knows that desperately needs it. So as much as I really do, I really am impressed with what you've done. Mac and I you know please keep doing. I think you have a lot of questions. You still need to answer, but I just want to say right now. I think the best way for us to move forward is for affordable housing on that here, and I hope the committee will take that into account. Thank you. Thank you. Matthew Rita today I thought that was really well said and totally respect that opinion and, like the points you made, I think there you have some totally valid points and so we're just presenting a different perspective and opinion, and it's kind of the idea of this. I feel like of this public process. So I want to say thanks for relaying that and Mac you could help me out. I have to move this meeting along. So unless someone asks you a specific question, maybe we could interested. Thank you Rita Miller. Are you still with us? I'm here, okay, go ahead and ask your question. Well, I have comment, and I guess some questions too. First thing is: I completely disagree with this idea that affordable housing or a park are the two choices. I do not think that anybody should be living on that property. I'm not a scientist, but I've been reading a great deal about the intrusion, problems etc, and I asked the committee to take a look at some of the things that came out of Greenville South Carolina. Their Department of Health absolutely recognizes the danger of putting buildings on top of these properties. There is the environmental, science and technology vapor intrusion study going on where they show various methods of how to build more safely. They think on some of these properties- and I did not see anything in any of the in conclusions that match anything at all- that they were doing on public place prior to the change to the plan of the remediation. Besides, that, I think Mac's idea is wonderful. I think it is an appropriate usage of that site that will be contaminated in perpetuity, and I think that having people live on, it is a terrible idea, but having it as an open space area is a wonderful idea. I also think it conforms with the legal disposition of recreational use. I heard what rich said and instead of my picture, what you have up there is the City Planning Commission last couple of paragraphs and that talks about once that map proposed map change was done, which was completed in July of 1974. The property would go to the parks, recreation and Cultural affairs administration, even if it never made it into that particular department, so that there was never any obligation to have any kind of public review of removing from there to another department. What I do not understand is how were the rfps for this housing thing ever even initiated when the site was mapped for recreational use? What department it was in does it matter. It specifically says recreational use. So how was it? How is it like? Okay to issue rfps, no matter how many years later excuse me. I have an allergy, no matter how many years later, without a public review process in order to remove it from a recreational use, disposition to housing- and I please do not say they're- going to put a little tiny strip of gas and some black grass and some weeds somewhere and called out the park. So I guess that's directed to rich okay. Thank you, Rita. Sorry, I'm not sure, I'm going to say this right, ankur dalao hi! Yes, thank you for your comment. I just wanted to echo some of the comments made by other people in support of affordable housing and this site. I am a former CB6 resident, but I actually had to move out because I was essentially priced out. My income went down many years ago and when it did, I could no longer afford the neighborhood. Cb6 is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country and I think a big part of it is a lack of market rate and affordable housing, and I would strongly support creating more affordable housing for the neighborhood. I think that's the most important thing to do if there are struggles between a park and affordable housing. I think we should pick affordable housing over a park and if you want to have both, I strongly support some of the comments made earlier about increasing density in other places in the project. I do not agree with giving up some of the market rate units in other parts of the project, because I think those units are necessary to fund and subsidize the affordable housing, but I think you avoid a lot of that problem with this site, because the land is already owned by the city. Thank you. Thank you. Encore David, Mark shames give me a minute sure, martin. I just want to thank everybody who came because I'm going to hop off of the call. I appreciate all the comments. I have a long history myself with regard to Gowanus, I sort of have an understanding of why public place was designated. That is somewhat different from the understanding of other people in terms of its designation to stop something else rather than for a specific use, but we can get into that. Some other time- and I thank you all and we will consider all the options that are in front of us bye. Thank you, Mark. Are we going? Are we going to have some zoning matters or is there? Maybe we have one? We have one landmarks yeah, but let me I have, I think, one other person to call on which is Toby Hyde Toby's still with us, yeah hi. Oh there you are okay. First of all, I think Congress a little hard to hear you toby a current resident of CB6 and I think Concur said it except it nicely about the need for affordable housing, but is in terms of process. Does the board anticipate or the committee anticipate, do taking a official action tonight or in the coming? What happens next? After this presentation? There will be no official action tonight. This is just a presentation by Matt and Bowanis lands. Just for the committee to become familiar with the project. I think for most of us it's the first time we're seeing it and we will consider it going forward and then we'll. If there's a position we want to take on it. We'll take a position, but right now we have no position. Thank you sure. Okay, I'm just looking over on my chat screen here and I'm sorry. I hope oh tally, yes, hi. Thank you, yeah sure. I appreciate everybody's comments. I particularly appreciate the enthusiasm for affordable housing and I think that I would support that. The concern here is building affordable housing in a toxic flood plain on a polluted plot of land. The question is whether this is the right place to put it as opposed to somewhere, that is it not in one of the most fragile ecosystems facing climate change, massive risks. Thank you. Thank you tally. I have one other person to call and I would ask that we wrap this up, because the committee does have some other business conduct tonight. It's getting dark out. Some of us need to get home for dinner. So I appreciate, if anybody's just repeating stuff, that's been said before, just you can, let us know via emails, but I'm going to call on Ken a hi. Thank you for your presentation and taking the time to listen to comments. I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add to the support for the affordable housing element. Affordable housing is extremely rare in in the city and in the district, and we also have seen the statistics for the lotteries for people getting into affordable housing and then to add to people's points about the environmental aspect. You know, as this land is developed, it can be developed for safety and it can also be developed for brazilians climate change resilience. So I want the board to consider that resiliency against flooding can be part of the plan to develop, affordable housing here. Thank you Ken. So thank you. Everybody Mac! Judging by the chats, you have a lot of fans and I would encourage to. I would encourage everybody to reach out to Mac and Mac reach out to them, because I think, as Mark or maybe Jerry pointed out earlier, the presentation could use some, maybe more rigor. I've been speaking personally and there's a lot of people here who have a lot of history of the community and, I think marlene pointed out the Nrd assessment, restoration of natural resources that could be a potential source of funding. So I think, there's a lot of opportunity for you to build out your proposal more strongly and I hope everybody got Max Email Mac. If you want to just say what your email is one more time that would probably be helpful, sure yeah, it's the onenesslands gmail.com I'll put it in the chat too. I just wanted to say thank you to you, David and the other CB6 land use committee members for putting this on really a great opportunity to share this idea with you. So just want to say thanks for hosting us and the great questions and feedback all right. Thank you, Mac. Okay. The committee is now going to consider a landmarks application. Let's take a few seconds here, just to catch our breath, while you're catching your breath. I just want to encourage everyone to read through the chats there's a lot of really good comments. Links and opinions is the applicant here for 611 second street. I am here yes, thank you, okay, Mark! Thank you for being very patient. I enjoyed the presentation, I'm glad ty. Do you want to put up the project? This is a sorry. Let me just announce it formally. This is a proposal for a second story edition on the rear of a building above an existing one- story, edition at 611 second avenue, plus a penthouse room on the existing roof. His second street there's a second street or Second Avenue, Second Street. Okay. I have I guess whatever I took a screenshot of the second half and my apologies yeah. I guess that does not sound like a landmark district, okay, Second street right. So take it away. Thank you. This is a building between Eighth Avenue, Prospect, Park West on the north side of second street. The proposal is to, as was said, to build a an extension above the existing extension on the rear of the building and a penthouse room on the roof adjacent to the existing penthouse, which is on the left on the left side next one. So this is just the Landmarks Commission Historic District map that they require, showing that little black DOT is where the building is located within the Parksville Historic district. Here you see the project location at 611, 2nd street, it's the middle building that you see labeled at 611, 2nd street and, as you see, there is a roof extension on the in this slide from the back on the right side of the building and on the slide on the right into the left side of the building to the south window. So that's that would be the location of the rooftop penthouse and on the lower part of the building. In the back, you see the one story extension which we're proposing to put an extension above that next one. These are just some existing photographs of the rear of the building. The White brick area is where we're proposing to vertically extend that and have a one- story. Extension above it to enlarge the master bedroom's room next one. These are some existing rooftop photos. The wall on the left is the existing penthouse from the building next door, and our proposal brings the penthouse on our roof further back from the street, but adjacent to it. Next one- and this is a block diagram showing the rooftops of the of the building and labeled in green. You can see the rooftop penthouse adjacent to the proposed fantastic, this on Prospect block West, as well as Eighth, Avenue you'll, see four- story, buildings and some penthouses along that block. This is the front the front facade of the building and, as you can see, we're far under the maximum zoning allowable height of 60 feet, and you will not see the penthouse as you will see in the mock- up presentation from the from the street. It's as I said it's about 28 feet back from the front the sun. This is this is showing the rear of the building, with the extension with the extension on the second story above the above the existing one story, as well as the penthouse up on the roof. This is a 3d model again, showing the existing condition on the left with the penthouse that's built. Next door to our building and the model on the right shows the proposed penthouse on our building same idea from the rear. The existing is on the left, as you can see, to the left of our building, there's already an extension on the second floor of the adjacent building and now we're proposing an extension on that second floor above the existing. The reason it's sent back from the face of the building on the sit on the first floor extension is because of the zoning, which requires a 30-foot rear yard, again existing basically existing and proposed existing on the top row and proposed on the bottom or that's next one another angle of the rear existing amplifiers. It's basically the same model only from different angles, which landmarks likes to see. You know from different angles, which is why we did it. This way. The side elevations of the existing north elevation and the proposed elevation on the right, as well as the sections of the building we tried to match, basically match the building with the extension on the second floor and bring it up and basically match the opening of the fenestration with glass similar to what they had now. This is just some zoning information and site plan of the building on the right. You see the site plan of what the footprint of the penthouse is as well as a second story: that's hatch, that's hatched in and on the left, you see a section, a section of your bone, showing that the line of sight from the person across the street- and you can see the angle and that will not be visible from the stoop across the street. This is all as of right in terms of zoning. There's no variant required the reason. Obviously, it's a landmark district, so we're going to landmarks, but we're not asking the building department for any variances. It's all floor area, open space and height are all as of right. Here's floor plan showing the second expansion. Sorry, we do not need to talk about any of the interior spaces that we're just here to look at this, for this is in the presentation, but I'll go I'll, go quickly through it. So this is the mock- up. Well, this is the zoning diagram again showing the zoning the zoning is compliant, and this shows the footprint again of the penthouse and the rear extension excellent. There's a zoning diagram shown within the zoning of the 770 zoning next fly. This is where landmarks, where, where live, asked around the neighborhood, basically around the block, showing whether the mock- up can be seen from any public thoroughfare and in the next few photos, you'll see you'll see photos of that. She asked for there's no visibility from the mock- up. This was the mock- up that we built showing you know showing the room outline, here's another picture of that mock- up, and these are the photos. I won't take too much time with them, because, obviously, from the front or from the sides you do not. You do not see the mock- up. It's not visible from any of the photos that we, the 11 photos that she asked for so we could flip through these. You know of the different spaces. That's number four! That's number five from Prospect Park West, looking West is number six number. Seven is the corner of second street and eighth avenue. Number eight is second street between seventh and eighth avenue. Looking back down the street number, nine and ten is from First street and Eighth Avenue looking east and number 11. She asked for a shot from first street, which obviously there's a building in front of it. So there's no way to see any of the the condition that we'll propose and that's it. Thank you. Thank you very much for allowing us to give you this presentation all right. Thank you mark so mark just so you understand the rules right now, we'll have Q&A that you can answer and once the there's a sort of informal right now because of the pandemic, but once we have a motion, the committee just discuss it amongst themselves and unless someone asks you a question specifically they're there's you would not be able to speak during that at that time. So that being said, is anybody in the committee have any questions and I'm having a hard time just because of presentations, I'm seeing if anybody's raising their hand or anything Ty? I do not know if you can say all right Bob is that you personally, I think it's too big and large. I do not particularly like it that big but you've got it next door, so I do not think it's something that we should be looking at as being wrong. At this point, I'm not sure I was for the one next door either, so I do not see a problem of that with the size considering where it is and the placement of what what's there. I do have a question about I'd like to see the back elevation. Please ty, okay, one second yeah mark. If you know the page number it might help them find it quickly. I'm not sure. Okay, not just if you have to know what I'm getting is two and I wanted to double check on it because you went by it quickly was the and the only place I saw it was the actual with the actual drawing okay, that's good yeah. I do not mind the well. I do mind the railings up on top also, but I could live with it, because that's what we've been doing, but I do not like the idea that the railing goes past the roof line of the of the extension. I think that the corner- and I'm trying I'm doing with my Aaron- realize you're not seeing it I'm thinking that the arrows are on everybody else, but the where the railing goes past it on the right side of the building. I do not think that's appropriate for the building. I do not mind in front of the chimney there Mark is that a Juliet balcony or something? No, it's just a balcony above the extension. It's not it's, not it's a real, it's a real deck. I can show you the so I I'd have to bring it back. I could cut it short of the chimney, but is that what you're objecting to bobby the third floor? Not the extension I'm talking about that railing or that porch that deck whatever you want to call? It should not be bigger than the roof of the extension that step back. Let me I have to look at the plan, but yeah it will be. It will be the same as the extension. That's correct that might be drawn further. The railing should not go past the extension. I agree all right. Okay, other questions, yeah. What is the material on the exterior of the penthouse? That's visible, cement type, siding which will keep the weight. You know it's a it's like a board type of finish, so is it going to look like vinyl siding? No, it will look like white. Are you familiar with the Hardy board? Finish yeah kind of looks like vinyl siding they have panels. It's like a panel. It's not it's not that like this, like a vinyl side, they have very nice recessed panels that look like lines. You know with notches in it it's it's their architectural series. It's not meant to be like an overlapped side of them. Okay, other questions. David yeah, do you feel like making a motion, or are you asking I'm? I just want to make sure mark. You do understand what Bob was getting at about the railing on the top of the extension, the new extension, but it should not go past the extension- and you did say there was an error in the drawing right. I did say that let me double check the plan. I assume no emotion still should say that, even though I just want to make sure yeah, I understand that was for everybody else. I know you know. Yes, that's correct jerry. You can't go fast extension that was, that was an error in the case of cutting and pasting of the Magic computer. Yes, I just wanted to make sure I heard correctly yeah sure I would agree with Bob that the size is a bit much, but we do have a roof extension on the next door building and you know you do not have to scroll it's fine and I think that I would make a recommendation. My motion is that we recommend to LPC that they approve the plans for 611 second street, for both the front and the back and with one slight condition to make sure that the drawings presented to LPC reflect the correct positioning of the railing on the top of the extension you can see here. I just want to make sure that's the motion so Mark. So now there's a motion on the floor. So if the do other committee members have any comments, is there a chance for public questions? Yes, go ahead, I'm sorry! Oh hey buddy! My oh am I were you going to speak someone else. I I'm on the committee, and I did have a question about the fenestration on the side of the extension to the rear, not the penthouse, and did we see a picture of what that's going to look like face on for the neighbor in the back? Just that's your family. No, I do not think you saw a photo a picture of it, but it's brick to match the existing extension. It's all brick because we're seeing now it looks like they're windows. Oh absolutely, it's all good, okay, good, okay, daniel yeah, just well! First of all, I I'd like to know if there's anyone any, are there any neighbors who are here to comment? You know before we close the discussion to committee only yeah. I live in the House next door. Okay! Well, let me just finish my comment. I mean this committee is well acquainted with my views on these fairly radical expansions of the of the you know landmark envelope of these of these properties and I'm not going to belabor that here so I'll just say that I'll be voting no on this one, but I do think we should hear from the neighbors yeah, of course Daniel Herowitz. Yes, I I live in the House next door. That also has the roof extension. So I'm not going to oppose this extension going up, but these are the first drawings that we've seen of the proposal and just this image that's up here. It looks like the two roof extensions. Almost they look like they've become one building that are built together and I'm just wondering I mean that might not be a landmark issue, but I'm wondering if that's really how a build the building will be allowed to happen. Like can, does the one building go right up to the wall of the next building? Technically, no, but I'm going to allow mark to answer that the existing it will go right up to the wall of the existing building. Not it's not. As large as your extension, so it's quite it's cut short, but the wall. That's there now is half on our property and half on your property, so it will go right up to it without war. Unless Mark, I think you may have a seismic separation issue there, but it's not much, but I would take a look at that any other questions from the community. Sorry, I can't see very much here on the screen when the presentation's up so shout out. If you're yeah, yes, Carol Crewson, can you hear me? Yes, I can go ahead. Okay, I'm on 6:13., I'm on the other side. Okay, when I moved into the house my 613 over 50 years ago, that extension was there. Okay, I am. I have the only extension. That's on that entire blog. I did not realize I thought that was grand added in and I did not realize that people can make a an extension now just like that. Is that true? It is true if it conforms to the zoning uh- huh, and what about blocking my you know of you and son from because now I have a wonderful view. Of course, up to up the block you're talking about on the side, yep correct, I mean you could certainly express your concern to Mr Lipton, but it is their property and they can think as long as they do it as of right. They're allowed to do that. Okay, any other questions in the community, any other questions to the committee. Yes, I do not believe we had a second for Jerry's motion and I would just like to ask that the motions specify the which extension we were talking about when we expressed concern over the railing, the back or the roof Glenn. I thought I was clear. It's the it's the back extension these on these a new extension that goes from that shuts out from the parlor floor and we're referring to the top of that extension. The railing on the I just wanted to make sure that was clear, because I did not hear it in your motion. I did make it okay. I did not hear it. It's okay, you're right, we do need a second. I have another question before it moves forward regarding the doors on the penthouse and on the third story. Is there I feel like there's a lot of different fenestration going on you have one over one and then all these multi- pane things and then the doors are all solid. Just maybe to consider the visual impact maybe find a solution for the doors that is more unified with other things on the building. Sure we'll look at that. Just consider yeah thanks. So do we have any other comments or does anybody want to second? The motion? I have a comment about the roof. I do not see the railing that's going to be on the roof in the back. Is it going to be vertical or rails or oh, okay, it's close now I can see it. Okay thanks. Will it be black mark you'd answer that it would be a dark color to that? Yes, it would be I'm not sure if it's black or a dark bronze, but it will be a dark color. It's not going to be a white rim. I'd like the second jerry's motion, all right. Thank you Maddie. So I think I know where Daniel sits. Does anybody else object to the jerry's motion? Probably the easiest way to ask this. Is this a time to make a friendly amendment, or I do not know the process, but there's no mention of those side windows that are in the rendering on the third on the interior extension, not the penthouse. I just think we should mention that that's meant to be a brick wall. I think that's a good point. I have no objection to that. Being added in I'm sorry which side windows were you talking about. Was there? Was that a drawing error or was there something I do not know? And then the edition shows windows, basically the view that's being stolen, being transferred to the new edition. So I think that needs to be a solid wall and that's what the owner says it's intended to be, but on the rendering that I was just looking at, I see windows, I'm not sure if he meant the one that was showing the windows or the other side, which we can't see. So we should double check yeah, but neither of those sides should have windows. Why all right? So well so you're saying that's a so Joanna. That's a friendly amendment that you, if they're showing windows there, you do not want the windows there. I just want to make sure I understand this correct. I mean the owners verbally told us that they're not meant to be windows on that edition in the back, but the renderings show windows and so the owner of the owner of the neighboring properties. No, they the owner of the current property Joanna great, but we do have a window though yes, okay, yeah, thank you mark so Joanna. I understand so jerry you're accepting this as a friendly amendment yeah. The amendment, I guess would be that from the amendment that we would recommend the removal of the window. The side windows on the new extension is that correct, Joanne Joanna forget my ignorance, but is there a rule that precludes the side window that you're objecting to there is not there's, not a specific zoning rule. I do not think, but it's I guess you know back to prior points about you know what was there when the owner bought the house. Someone had that view and then some, the other house is they're going to be able to look into the neighboring house on the other side from that window. If it proceeds there's some privacy issues. I do not know it. Just does not sit. Quite right, for me still happens. There's nothing just a ques point of clarification, because where that window is looking onto a roof of the next house, there's no there's no occupancy of the roof next door so hold on. Can we go back? Can we go back to the room yeah? Let's go back to the rendering yeah, let's go back and look at the drawing yeah. I saw two little windows on the side. I might have been making them up, but well we're waiting for that I'll, clarify, think more and Alec. There is not a ruling in terms of what can or can't be done, but we're supposed to have the look and feel of the backyard Doughnut and we've historically felt that the look and feel does not include windows on the sides. That's so I think that's what she's going okay, so Joanna are these the windows you're referring to. I do not have an arrow, but I see two windows there where yeah those guys. Yes, so from that angle, you'll be able to look into the pink house, and I just I do not think that's appropriate for an after the fact addition. So my reaction to this drawing and again I do not I mean I come at this pretty naive- is that the house with the gray cap also has side windows already, and so any privacy intrusion there would be mutual, and so I would not see a need to preclude a window there. That side would be fine. I'm talking about the pink house I see, but so I'm going to Alec. If I could actually add something here, so I mark you said there was one window there's actually two windows. I would propose that maybe the window, that's near the main wall, the house be removed the window that's out towards you know the yard remain it's very hard for someone to stand that window and look into the rear of the pink house, just the angle and the depth of the jam and stuff. It's that someone would have to be doing that almost intentionally and I would propose well now. I need Daniel Cummer, maybe on the process here, but that we do not accept that jerry. You do not accept the friendly amendment and I have another amendment saying: remove one of the windows and leave the window. That's closer to the rear yard, which window are you talking about? Accepting the window, that's closest to us, the window, that's closest to the belt, the deck, the right, that's in the farthest in the rear. Okay, I understand what you're saying yeah and my understanding of the angles is that the one further the one near the deck would have a better angle into the house. The one near the house would be looking into their own property right. Well, I mean no one's intentionally planning for beeping toms, but it's a thought. The people on the other block can see in from you know from across the backyards. So it's not like yeah. I just think presuming I mean the neighborhood spoke up about being on the other side. 613, the view directly out is being blocked, but there's also there's a there's, a view cone if you will and they can see past the extension- and I do not think there should be tit for tat that just because someone else lost their view that this person can't put a window in. I do not understand that logic. Well, I will withdraw myself and a and a blank wall does not look that great either. I think I agree yeah I would. I would recommend that we sort of go in the Middle David and it has two windows right now. I would recommend that we, the motion, the amended motion, read also that we recommend one window on the side be placed in the middle which would take care of everybody not looking in and still providing that's exactly. What I was going to say sounds good okay, so it works for me hold on Mark we're having too many conversations. So thank you, Jerry Bob Levine did you have a comment yeah. I had to comment on the motion in there. I agree with Joanna in terms of the side. Windows are usually bothersome for the neighbor, but it's more so when the window's on a lot line, and I think we're usually much more stringent on a lot line window, this window is back from the lot line and makes it a little harder to actually see in so I do not. I do not feel that they're equivalent and I have no problem with this side because building this down all right. So does anybody want to second the motion? I do I second it thank you. Judith can we have a vote all right? Who does not approve the emotion, you put your hand up or do a chat alex. You do not approve the motion. Daniel. You do not approve the motion. I'm sorry you're closed. Three. Are we talking about on your amendment or on the motion itself demanded the motion where Jerry said go to one window instead of two you do not have to vote. I will vote against them. Amendments all right, so Alex voting against it Daniel's voting against it David for the motion or the amendment. Well, I thought you were making a new motion. Are you? Are you accepting a friendly amendment? Are you making a friendly amendment to your motion? I'm making my own friendly amendment that there'll be one window placed in the middle and the rest of the motion remains the same and I thought we had a second to it. Yeah, okay, we do not need a separate. We do not need a separate vote. It's part of the motion yeah. I agree with that. Yeah, that's what I thought. I guess I would also point out. I I'm not sure this is the window. Placement on this issue is a particularly a landmark issue other than the fact that I suppose that extension of the neighbor was part of the you know grandfathered envelope that's being affected, but I I'm opposed to the size of this entire project to begin with, so, okay, so we're voting on the motion right. Yes, so I have two no's from Daniel and Alec. Are there any other nodes? Glenn? Yes, three! Is that that's a no any other nodes, so ariel you we did not so in other words, voting yes means we approve of it, but getting involved in designing where the window goes, which to me is ridiculous, so I mean I do not see that I think a few people pointed out that it's a little bit beyond issue. If no one else on the committee has any issue with it, I would not like it as a neighbor that was not like, I would say, architecture. I think a window centered in the wall, rather than these two windows pushed to the edges just looks better, so that to me is historically relevant. It's a more balanced composition. That's my two cents! I do not know, are we supposed to be design redesigning? I do think that there was the issue that Joanna brought up about just being neighborly and it would be nice for the owner and the architect to talk to this neighbor and if the neighbor, if there's some adjustment that could be made with the neighbor that would be nice, but that's beyond and above beyond landmarks. As far as landmarks knows, what they presented is fine. I think we have a vote. Can we have a vote? Can we just finish the vote and then, once you start voting the comments? Yeah? No, the motion, so I have. I have three people against it right now: Alec, Glenn and Daniel are there? Is there anybody else against the motion and the motion is to make sure the railing does not extend in front of the chimney and replace the two windows with one window in the center of the? Is that the West facing elevation? I think so? Well, it's thank you. Mark anybody all right, David! I can see that Charlie Piggott is voting. No in the chat. Is he on here, yeah, okay. So four knows we have so jerry me Bob, I'm going to say your name and if you disagree with me just know: Joanne Joanna. No, I know Joanna Arielle, Maddie and Judy say yes, okay, so that's I thought it was Ernie all right. So the motion the motion passes. We do not really have Quorum, so I'm just going to tell Peter that we did not have corn, but that's what we voted for all right. So I think that concludes this. Thank you good night, just a general comment for the new people since I've chatted for so many years over it. The landmarks is the look and the feel of that donut and we can define it as whatever way we want. So you could define it as not having side windows on the on the extensions you do not have to. You can do whatever you want, but, yes, we do have a say on the look and feel of what's back there. That Solomon said David are we concluded? We are concluded? Actually we maybe we did have Quorum ty. How many members do we have now? I'm counting real, quick, there's 11 on this call. I thought there was only 10.. I counted 12 earlier well. Mark left was not debbie here, yes, Paulie, I'm pauline Pauline's no longer on well. We had a lot. We ty you and I can email about this, but we had 11 votes, seven. Yes, four! No! So, okay! We are concluded okay, good night. Folks, thanks everybody, it was nice. Seeing you, everybody see you soon.
