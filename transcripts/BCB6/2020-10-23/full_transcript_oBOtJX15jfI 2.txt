I want to thank everybody who is logged on for participating. This is a big event coming up in community board six, it has major consequences. There are people with very strong opinions with regard to every aspect of this. We are probably aware of your opinions already, but nonetheless still want to hear them, and we will get to as many questions as we can tonight, and first I'd like to thank Jonathan for being here and winston for being here and I'm going to throw it to Peter Fleming, who is going to make the formal introductions for our meeting. Thank you, everyone for joining it's great to see so many people interested in this topic. You know, as you know, this was the rezoning of Gowanus was a matter that was supposed to move forward earlier this year, but you know pandemic. You know, has put a delay to that. So we are essentially here to restart the clock. This presentation is not expected to have a whole lot of new information. What it is expected to have from the city Department of City planning is a timetable for how we're going to move forward, and you know there'll, be. We had asked city planning for some preliminary meetings before certification so that we could a reacquaint ourselves and be just sort of get back into. You know the learning and listening mode. So we're going to hear from city planning they're going to tell us sort of give us a refresher on what it is. They are planning, but obviously we'll they're, reserving I'm sure the idea that, when they make a formal presentation to us in January or February that that's when we'll hear the details of their final plans for Gowanus, so thank you everyone for coming. We really appreciate it. I also want to point out the community board. 6 has set up a portal. If you look at the link you received with your invitation to this meeting, you know, there's a button you can push and you can leave your comments. There we're going to keep that document up throughout this entire process and create a sort of a living record of of what people's comments are for and against. As Mark said, we know there are people that have strong thoughts on all aspects of it. We're anxious to hear what you have to say and my job as chair of Community Board six is to make sure that whatever community board sticks decides about. This is that we reflect as much of what the community thinks as possible, and you know I think it will be less important. You know whether we say Yay or neon and much more important, the comments we make on specific aspects of the deal, but we're not making any decisions tonight we're only here to listen to learn about. You know to get reacquainted with the with the plans and to hear their timetable and we're going to go from there. So I'm going to keep quiet after this, and I'm going to ask our council member Brad Lander to offer his comments and then we'll hear from the Department of City planning. So thank you Brad. Thank you very much. Peter and big, thank you to community Board six for inviting me to join you tonight. As you restart public engagement on the Gowanus neighborhood rezoning. It is great to see so many people out on a Thursday night to start that re- engagement together. Obviously, people have very strong and very different opinions and that's the part of goal of democracy, and I really appreciate community board six, taking it seriously and finding lots of ways for people to make their voices heard. Look I get that people are skeptical of rezonings and with a lot of good reason. Too often, resulting's in the past have displaced low income and working class people strained infrastructure not listened to the voices of community been driven by developers, but, as I think a lot of you know, I believe that if we get this right and that's still a big, if for a plan, that does not yet have anything meaningful for public housing residents in wackoff, gardens and Gowanus houses and it needs to. But if we get it right that, because of all the community input that there's been so far over the last eight years, that the Gowanus rezoning really could be different and that it could deliver genuinely more inclusive and integrated, more sustainable and resilient, economically vibrant neighborhood right when we need it that it could be part of recovering from Covid-19 and learning its lessons. Seeing what we've come to see in these past few months in a way that can both create some real economic energy now and build a durable community that is more just and more resilient than the one that we have now. We do need more information, not only on the issues of public housing, which are a fundamental bottom line. Unless this rezoning contributes to significantly addressing the issues of the dilapidated conditions in Gowanus and wyckoff, then it's not in my opinion worthy of moving forward. But there's other information we're going to need in the couple next couple of months as well. More details about the affordability mix of public plays the details on Csos to make sure the canal is getting cleaner, more information on the Gowanus mix and the transit bonus and the schools bonus, and I'm really grateful that city planning is willing, rather than just to hit the go button which they could have done on the euler to spend time engaging with providing more details to and listening to the community, and it really is from deep community engagement that we've gotten here by my count. There's more than 50 public meetings that we've had small group. Large groups focused on issues in public housing in the parks in the nonprofit organizations in the small businesses to help us get here and as a result, there's a lot in this that I think, is really worth spending time with. You know, because, unlike previous rezonings, this is not a neighborhood with a lot of low- income, folks in privately owned rental, housing, nearby, there's a lot less risk of displacement, and so new, affordable housing, mostly for people who make 60,000 a year or fewer. Bringing that into our community represents a really big opportunity. Thanks to the strong advocacy there's a really strong set of measures to make sure that the rezoning would strengthen the Superfund cleanup, make a cleaner canal and a more resilient and sustainable neighborhood. We've pushed for and won new zoning tools for transit and school infrastructure to meet the demands of growth, some landmarking to make sure that we preserve buildings and a really innovative new Gowanus mix zoning to make sure that we keep Gowanus, creative and mixed use with light manufacturing, arts and Artisan uses and preserve the character that makes it special now. Look, not everybody agrees with that, and that's the point of doing this session and having the public engagement. There's going to be a lot of questions. There's going to be a lot of voices raised. What I feel good about being a community board six tonight is, I know, that's going to be done in a way that people are going to come with strong opinions and strong feelings and then express them and we're going to listen to each other and try to move through this process together in a way that we learn in a way that we listen in the way that we try to improve things and really make a hard set of decisions, but one that we make together responsibly and democratically. So, thank you for being here tonight. I look forward to listening to the comments to reading that document. That has everybody's comments in it, who put them in that way and to continuing to work with you throughout this process thanks very much Peter and Mark. Thank you, councilman Lander. We appreciate you being here. We appreciate your opening remarks. We truly want to hear from a broad- based number of people. We do already have a number of questions from many people, but we're going to start off with a presentation from Jonathan Keller who's been with us many times before, and we thank him for coming and I will turn the proceedings over to him for the presentation and then we will get to questions from the committee and the community. Thank you great thank you mark and Councilmember lander and Peter for your comments and the introduction. Just sharing the presentation just confirmed you guys can see the powerpoint yep. So great. We're excited to be here both virtually and at this stage in the process, and we want to you know first start off by thanking coming board six for having us again and thank you all who have taken time out of your night. I know many of you are taking time out of out of your day from your families or your jobs, or your hobbies or whatever you were doing before to join tonight, and the fact that we have over 300 attendees at that. Last time I checked is a testament to the power of online community meetings, but as a father of three kids and they're five years old and under I do know that tuning in is still a commitment, and we thank you for taking that time. We're all here, because we care about Gowanus and about the future of our city and neighborhoods, and we want to shape that future. What that future could be for not just ourselves but also for future generations, is the focus of our thoughts and always grounds us in what we're discussing so tonight, we're here to touch base with you all, as we've just heard, sort of a little bit of a preview of what we're going to talk about we're going to share info on upcoming meetings and a timeline of when we'll be coming back on components of the plan that you all have given us. Lots of you know, feedback and concerns on, and we're also going to dig a little bit into what public review is and how it works in anticipation of certification in January. But we are also here because you asked years ago and multiple times and in particular, Community Board six asked us to come early and share and then come early and share again and so we're here to talk about this crucial next step to make Gowanus a sustainable, inclusive, mixed- use neighborhood for generations to come. But a lot has happened in the past year, since we were here in December actually to talk about the Gowanus, green development and Covid-19 has upended life as we know it, and what we do know about the virus and about the crisis is continuing to evolve and continuing to come to light in the coming years. We'll be looking back, I'm sure, but we. What we do know is that the virus in the crisis has attacked the most vulnerable among us, essential workers, those in crowded units or in large families, those with underlying health conditions and those that depend on institutions like government agencies, non- profits, etc and across all these levels. We've seen the virus and the crisis exploit and exacerbate the deep racial injustices and inequities that have really come to the forefront of our national consciousness over the summer. So you know many of you have been asking and I'm sure I've thought you know if code 19, you know, has it upended life as we know it has it really also changed our understanding of reality? Has it upended our previously held beliefs and assumptions of the world that are really kind of ground into the fibers of the Gowanus plan that it's based on and it's a fair question and it's a good question and what we've seen is that you know the past nine months have really laid bare the persistent inequities in our society, particularly, it's highlighted the tenets and principles that are embedded in a lot of our work in Gowanus, including issues such as equity and inclusion, environmental justice, open space, urban form, housing security, and it can go on just to name a few. Another key question that some of you have brought up has the need for the plan changed and, frankly, no, you know, in fact it is clearly even more urgent. As noted before the crisis has hit people living in crowded conditions. We need more housing to help alleviate crowded situations across the city. It's also highlighted our need for outdoor spaces to just be out and be ourselves and be out safely and Gowanus has a lack of open space today. It has also highlighted our need for job generation and giving a broader group of people access to jobs and housing and open space in high opportunity areas, and then I think. Lastly, the crisis has also meant that our normal in- person engagement process has moved online like many municipalities across the world, and we have seen and are seeing it tonight with over. I'm sure this the number has gone up, but over 300 people attending this online meeting. It's really broadened the access to the democratic processes such as this, and just to give you a sense of scale. Typically, our Gowanus process, you know pre- covet routinely- would get around 200 people attending in person. So you know again great to have such a great turnout to hear more about the work we have ahead of us again, no doubt that there are improvements we can and will make, and particularly to also online engagement. But remember that you know before these technological advancements it was extremely hard for those people it with two jobs: families, dependents, other obligations to keep up and get involved with these processes. That often happened. You know after work at night, and so we're excited to be able to. You know redeem some of this time with the ability to do online forums. So the next couple slides are review, but in light of all of this, and in light of the past number of months, you know we should highlight the fact that the plan responds to the moment and the future with significant new, affordable homes, new jobs and open space, including a waterfront park, new schools and incentives to keep Gowanus mixed use, improvements to infrastructure and NYCHA communities and resilient and a resilient shoreline, a greener canopy and catalyzing brownfield cleanups. To make this all happen, we need to change the zoning. We need to make land use changes and there are a number of them that we are proposing, and these need to go through the public review process towards the end of the presentation. I'll just give you an overview of what that process looks like to start helping build capacity for when we are in euler for people to have really strong input, and so, as we've noted and mentioned before, the proposed land use changes and our public review, we will be coming back. We're very excited to be able to share updates on Gowanus green, in particular, on the proposed affordability levels, but also on infrastructure, and particularly on planning for transit schools and storm water and csos, which are key elements of the plan that we have heard all along. As you know, critical to understanding more and we're happy to come back, we do need a recap on how we got here. I'm excited there's a tremendous number of people tuning in tonight, and many of them are new to the process and would benefit from a refresher of the process to date. So going back way back real quick as most of you know, but maybe some of you do not. The canal was built in the 1800s and was a centerpiece of the growth of Brooklyn that success quickly led to the canal and surrounding blocks becoming overwhelmed with hazardous materials and shortly after World War Ii, the canal was really a shell of its maritime self as a number of changes, macroeconomic and otherwise disrupted the businesses throughout the area and by the 60s. The community was having discussions about what to do with the neighborhood. How can the area be cleaned up and then what should it be used for which are the questions of the day here as well, and then six, the sixties? There have been a number of planning studies and reports and initiatives that have been issued for the Gowanus and the surrounding area, and these include land use changes throughout the 90s and early 2000s that limited new housing opportunities and growth in the neighborhoods surrounding Gowanus itself was a naturally occurring live work, neighborhood up until zoning changes, city- wide in the 60s, which have largely remained in place and then now, due to that outdated zoning. The neighborhood has really seen a lot of adaptive. Reuse of existing buildings being used for a variety of commercial in open storage, uses what you really get for new construction, as many of you know, is self storage and hotels. The neighborhood is extremely well served by transit that basically rings the study area. Many of the canal blocks are also within the floodplain and, as you can see, this also tracks with the blocks that were primarily impacted by Sandy in 2012.. Looking at the census tracts that comprise the rezoning area, we see, the median income is 115,000.. The census tracts with the NYCHA communities actually has a median income of about 39,000.. This compares to Brooklyn overall at about 56,000 and New York City overall at 60,000., so the neighborhood that we're planning in is much healthier and wealthier than other New York neighborhoods and for two to three decades. You know land use, changes around Gowanus down zone and limited opportunities to housing, schools and jobs in these neighborhoods, and so what you see from we pulled a little bit from the district 15 plan is that the school segregation in CB6 also reflects similar patterns of housing, segregation, and so that really kind of brings us to okay. So we have these historical legacies of pollution. We have these issues and challenges. You know. Why are we acting now other than think you know? We have these issues. Why act now, so we need to act now to harness development, to produce sorely needed housing and jobs in walkable, transit-, rich neighborhoods, and to clean up the hazardous materials and right the environmental wrongs of the past. But we need to do it now to promote fair housing and ensure that Gowanus and New York City as a whole, recover fairly and robustly and the pandemic and the movement for racial justice really make it clear that all neighborhoods must pull their weight to provide safe and affordable housing options. So, to get from, we have these challenges, we need to act, but the future is volatile, uncertain challenge, changing wha. What do we want the future to be like, and how can we actually shape it? We launched our study in our process in October of 2016, so, yes, it's been four years as of in four days. It will be four years. October 26 is when we kicked off and we asked all of you how we should go about this study and what we came up with was an extremely robust process that resulted in the past four years of engagement and iterative development of the proposal and the goals and objectives we held numerous meetings, both large and small. We also had an open call for five working groups that committed their time for six months to meet and do deep dives on various topics. Each of those meetings lasted at least four hours and as many meetings in Gowanus, they always go over. So we also went and heard from NYCHA tenant association meetings whenever they met and also went out to the community went to pop- up events to share updates and information along the way we also, which was very exciting, piloted plangowanus.com, which is our first foray into online engagement, and it was a tool not only to get input from a wider audience, but also to share information and archive documents from that working group process. And if you go there now, which do not because you should be listening to this presentation and asking questions soon, but go there afterwards. All of that work is still there, agendas notes presentations and it's a really good trove of information about the process and how we came up with the Gowanus plan and, of course, as many of you know, over the course of the past number of years, we've been coming to cbcb6. I think I did not actually count, but I was trying to mentally count. I think we're up to around 15 meetings and we've been extremely happy to be working with the group of Community board members that we've been sharing info with and soliciting input from over the years. So this led to a June 2018 framework that you know really set the stage for where we are now. The Gowanus framework is a comprehensive framework of goals and strategies. It also included recommended land use changes that would be implemented as part of an overall Gowanus neighborhood plan. This process really was made possible. You know I gave you a sense of all the meetings, but just to give a shout out to the tireless work and commitment from hundreds of you all and local residents, workers, organizations, business and property owners and your elected officials, but it also has been a vast interagency group consisting of 17 other agencies that we've been coordinating with, and I think really one of the special things has been that the virtuous dynamic of government agencies and community members coming together really has been the linchpin of all this and of our comprehensive planning efforts, so that land use framework was then used to develop our zoning proposal. And this is really a high- level schematic. We shared details of it in January of 2019, and I just to give a 30,000 foot overview for those that are new here and, of course, we'll be coming back and going into the painstaking detail of the zoning proposal and the special district text. But for now just to boil it down. We are increasing density for job generating non- residential uses, we're eliminating parking requirements near mass transit, we're also allowing residential at appropriate densities and, depending on the location. Well, sorry back it up we'll allow residential at appropriate densities depending on the location, and we will require all new residential would have a portion of new development be permanently affordable, housing, we're also proposing in the zoning to help shape a resilient and active waterfront and, as mentioned before, promoting a mixing abuses throughout the neighborhood and in mixed- use developments by way of incentives and we've also considered how does all this fit together? How does this Jigsaw Puzzle fit together within the existing neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods, and really have given a lot of thought to a tailored urban design, principles and regulations that will be embedded in the special district, so a synopsis by the numbers? This is extremely high level, and you know kind of does not show the nitty gritty details, but it does mean over 8,000 new, affordable home 8,000, new units and 3,000, affordable homes would be generated over 3,000 new jobs, nearly three six acres of new parks and open space and again, there's so much more that we've shared on this and there's more to come, like talking about sidewalk widenings requirements for brownfield remediation, the transit bonus, the schools, tool, etc. That we'll be coming back and sharing more on and in the coming months again. Just to give you a taste of really the tremendous amount of work that went into our urban design thinking, you know, while the outcomes that we just mentioned, respond to our current moment and our needs and plan for an increasingly uncertain and complex future with climate change. We've also paid particular attention to human scale in urban form and the public realm so requiring buildings would be set back at key locations, create light and air adjacent to low neighboring context, flexibility, to encourage world- class architecture and really thinking about how to activate the bridges and the open space along the canal. We've also tailored requirements for the waterfront open space to the unique nature of the canal. This is not the East River. This is not the Hudson, and so what we heard are the desires of the community to incorporate activities along the shoreline like historic interpretation or art installations and other amenities. So you know just to put a real fine point on this today. None of this is possible. The current zoning institutionalizes the status quo from the 50s and 60s a world that has passed on many times over it holds on to years of decay, and it keeps existing brown fields from being remediated and infrastructure from being upgraded, and it also keeps newcomers out and from enjoying the life- changing benefits of growing up in neighborhoods of opportunity, near jobs, schools and stable housing, and so to make our shared vision of the future a reality. We must change the zoning in this 80 block area. Those zoning changes must go through public review, which we are anticipating to begin in January of 2021, and I have a few high level slides on Ulerp and I'll roll through them quickly, because I know we want to get to your questions. Ulerp is the uniform land use procedure. It's a standardized seven month process by which community members, city planning experts and elected officials weigh the merits of particular proposed land use, changes and ultimately decide on whether to approve or disapprove those changes. The first step is for the City Planning Commission to certify that the application is complete. An application consists of a technical land use document outlining in detail the proposed changes and an environmental review document that reviews how the proposed changes may affect the neighborhood. This starts the seven month clock the first step along the way is a 60-day review by the affected community boards. The community board will no doubt review and deliberate hold hearings and issue a recommendation. The next step is for the borough president to do likewise in a 30-day review cycle. The community, Board and Borough president recommendations, along with the application, then come to the City Planning Commission, who has 60 days to review, also deliberate hold hearings, ask follow- up questions and ultimately issue their recommendation as well after the Cpc City Planning Commission weighs in the City Council also takes up review for an additional 50 days also holds hearings, also deliberates and ultimately decides to approve, disapprove or approve with modifications, and that's a pretty high level of the euler that would start in January, but again before all those public hearings and meetings that I'm sure you'll get tired of my face because I'll be coming to all of them and saying hello. You know you'll have chances to hear from us in the coming months about Gowanus green in infrastructure, and you know with that. I would kick it back to mark and say thank you for giving us the time to provide that update and share some background and we're excited to keep going with you all. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time and, of course, you're going to stick around and hear a number of questions. We're going to start off with questions from members of the committee, so if you would sort of raise your hand in the in the raise your hand, box and whoever's monitoring that full moo will, let me know who's going to be talking. Okay mark. This is ty and I see that Glenn has his hand up. So I'm going to unmute him first, okay, surprised that Glenn has anything to say on the subject but happy to hear from him. I've got a quick question for Jonathan. Now I might be jumping the gun and this will come later, but I'm hoping you can answer. You mentioned incentives for the mixed use in Gowanus, I'm wondering if these incentives are going to be any different than what was used at lightstone, where we have no mixed use, sure yeah, they are absolutely different. This is you know a product of a lot of discussions going all the way back to 2016, where a lot of people you know were and still are concerned that the rezoning would produce just residential only buildings. So the we looked at this from a number of ways and seeing how far I need to go back for everybody, there's a lot of people new on the line on the on the zoom. There was a lot of ask for a mandatory, not an incentive, but a mandatory requirement for mixed use, and we talked about all sorts of ways to do that, and we examined many ideas and proposals from the community like that: mandatory mixed use idea and dug into it and in the many meetings that we dug into those real issues. We also dug into the unintended consequences of being overly prescriptive in the zoning, and we also shared real- life, examples of like Sheepshead Bay and the garment district, to name two. But you know there really was a and there still is a lot of real fear about residential only building. So we came up with a two, a couple: tiered approach right to keeping Gowanus mixed use. First, we identified side streets to remain for only commercial and industrial uses, and then we decided we should give them more flexibility to grow and increase density, while also removing the onerous. You know requirements of parking for those businesses to grow, but we also developed with the council member and with many of you, the idea of this Gowanus mix incentive and some of it was outlined and more will be coming, especially when we release at certification the zoning text. This would not be mandatory, but it would be free development rights. If you will free square footage, people could build and where this use incentive will be applied is where there's sufficient density and lot sizes to fit into those buildings and where we heard a lot of folks really wanted to see the activation, and this is essentially mostly the canal and around Thomas Green playground, trying to give you a little bit more there without getting too in the weeds, because it can get pretty wonky with the zoning quick. But let me know if I did not answer your question. I would just ask you to present some examples at some point. What could be built on a property using you know this mix or that mix or taking advantage of the various incentives? That would be helpful. Yes, absolutely I yeah we have done some of that. Last time we presented. I think there was a schematic of the spectrum of what could happen. We can delve into that deeper in a in an upcoming. You know, you know we. It depends if we have enough time to come back, but we can definitely it at minimum. Go into that when we come back to the community board during euler good. Thank you sure. Next up is whom I see that Jerry has his hand up. So I'm going to unmute Jerry now Mr armor, it's you're up, okay! Jonathan. Can you hear me? I can hear you Jerry. Thank you. First of all, thank you for the refresher course. It's been a long time incoming, but my question is, with the community board having 60 days from certification. That was really not enough to go through the detail in the minutia of what you guys are going to be presenting and that we have to vote on. I would like to request- and I think you will find it not hard to agree to come back to the committee once you've finalized your draft zoning resolution, but before certification, so that we can go through it and understand it, and also that the community can understand it that 60 day time clock is very short on something of this size and the additional meetings would be very helpful for everybody, the Community board and the community to understand what is being presented and the ramifications of whatever's being presented without getting into that tonight. So when we talked about pre- certification meeting, we meant more than this. We meant sort of like telling us what what's the meat on the bones and what are the bones before we have to really vote on it. Otherwise, it's going to be sort of like buying a pig in a poke, so I'm sure you can commit- or I hope you can commit for city planning to come back to us a number of times before it's actually certified, but with more on the bone than what we had tonight. Yes, absolutely thank you jerry for your comment in question and or request. However, you want to frame it but yeah. Yes, you know, I think we've tried to make clear you know tonight was not the get into the neat the weeds. If you will, we are going to get into the weeds on a lot of plan components at the Gowanus green update and on the infrastructure update in particular we're going to get into the weeds on the transit bonus and we're going to get into the weeds on the schools bonus and how they will work and how they would be applied throughout the rezoning area. We're happy to come back to as many meetings as you can stand from us and so yeah. Let's figure that out, I think you know to set expectations. Can we share the application before it's certified? That's not something we can do, but we can definitely go through the details so that when it is shared and we're presenting it's stuff that you're already up to speed on, I did not expect you to share the details, but I did expect you to give us some. So we have a decent learning curve absolutely and we, and so we get in as you call it, the weeds, which is probably very appropriate, considering that we would like to see weeds growing along the canal and some other nature, bringing back some nature to the canal and sort of semi- marsh weeds will not will really look nice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you jerry, as you know, and I hope the people who are on the call Know Community Board six has asked for pre- certification meetings in letters to the Department of City planning, and we do believe that more engagement is better than less engagement and listening to people is important and then how it all plays out can not be predetermined, but at least we will have known where what the concerns of everyone is. So thank you for saying you will have the pre- certification meetings which, in the past were not clear, so anybody else who's next mark. I just wanted to put it out there, that's well. I appreciate it jerry I wanted to. I wanted to go on after you and reiterate it. More is better than less than community engagement. Thank you. Next up, okay, we have three in a row here. First is David Briggs, okay David! I can hear me. Yes, hey, David, hey Jonathan! Thank you for the presentation. You said in the beginning that what the pandemic had done is sort of increased awareness of how open space was important and more paraphrasing here, more affordable housing that allowed people to sort of. I guess, get more socially distanced. That's my own phrase in there and I'm seeing on this last page here in the center at the bottom. There's the an image of the cso Head house attention tech facility at the north end of the canal, which has which, as the cag knows right now, it sounds like that may not be operational until after 2031.. So when you started the zoning, you had some assumptions about housing and open space. You've pointed out that the pandemic has highlighted that need, and we have this fairly recent information about how far out these critical infrastructure needs will be met. Has that changed the Gowanus zoning plan at all? Has that changed the well? Are you presenting? Are you I mean I sort of agree with. Everybody else is asking it's. This is a broad overview, but there were some underlying assumptions that have been developed over four years and started before that with council member landers virgin Gowanus initiative. But a lot of things have changed, certainly in the last nine months and have refocused the community on what we need- and I just I guess, I'm just wondering- is the plan and what you proposed to us last year going to substantially change by these with these new conditions and with this new information about the retention tank facilities, which are obviously critical to make sure that we do not continue polluting the canal yeah. Absolutely, I think, there's a there's a lot in there. I kind of feel like there's two distinct things I think in terms of timing. I think that's just unpacking this a little bit in terms of timing of the rezoning. You know it's not an overnight thing as you know, but for others, maybe it's helpful. You know we were when in what in our environmental review. You know we're not analyzing that this all happens overnight and that's not something that would is reasonable. This is something development occur over time and our particular build year is actually after the tanks, and so when we're looking at the growth, that's in the neighborhood and when we're looking at the infrastructure. The timing of when that infrastructure comes online is absolutely critical to our analysis. So any change in you know the build year of our project or the build. Your of the infrastructure that we're assuming to be online can change our project at the moment. It's not anticipated that these would not be online and that we're coordinating and planning with the EP so that the canal and the remediation the remedy is intact and that we have a clean canal in neighborhood. So I mean, I think, to your broader question about the has the zoning proposal changed and I think what I've been really struck by is the comprehensiveness of the plan that we've put together with you all the fact that we looked at sustainability and resiliency environmental, remediation, community and cultural resources, land use and urban farm economic development and jobs. You know really has been so comprehensive that it has really weathered the pandemic well, and when you look at the things that it has highlighted as gaps and needs, the plan responds almost as though it had sort of envisioned the fact that we're going to need these things in the future, and so you know I would be happy to walk through what people think are. I aspects that the pandemic has highlighted that have you know shown the zoning and plan to you know come up short and if they you know, we can work on those and make them better or change. So does that help answer your question? I have a series of follow- ups, but I won't take up time. I just want to ask, or just clarify one thing when you say the build year, because many people may not know what that means. No, thank you yeah build year. Sorry, thank you. So much David for giving me the chance to say is a jargonistic term. It just means when we analyze for the environmental review, what the potential effects of the land use changes are on the neighborhood. We have to select a point in time to analyze, for when these things would all come online and we make assumptions on how soon the market would you know, turn around and build to the zoning, and so for our purposes. That's about a 15-year build year and there's a lot more to that. I'm happy to do a secret 101 whenever anybody asks, but when we look at other infrastructure projects like the cso tanks or you know the Fourth Avenue improvements that have been made. Those also have dates by which they will be built. Those also can be called build years, so we look at when everything will be online and we make assumptions about what's going to be there and then, if they're not going to be online, will there be you know, gaps in infrastructure will be impacts to the neighborhood. Thank you sure. Okay, thank you, David for not bringing up all your follow- up questions now. Please do, however, put all your follow- up questions into the forms so that they do get asked of city planning and that they can address them in subsequent meetings. I will who's next Joanna Smith is next hi Joanna hi all good evening. Oh thank you again, Jonathan for just bringing this all back to all of us. It's been a while every time I've been walking down in the neighborhood during the pandemic. I think oh yeah. This is going to be really different soon, but you know it kind of it's good to just be back in the room and really grappling with all the issues before us, and I guess I just wanted to emphasize Jerry's point. More information is always better and along those lines I have kind of a special request, because I'm more of a visual learner I like to like, read through all the lines and see what's changed, I'm kind of interested in iterations and I'm wondering if that's too much transparency to ask for, but I would like to see like what exact points have been changed due to our new reality and I'd like it. You know like how a law, firm kind of does a little rhetoric. Yeah no well you're, really helpful well you're in you're. In luck, because environmental review is extremely litigious, so there's actually one of the documents that you particularly well. I mean everybody should, but you, I think will particularly appreciate is the final scope of work. The fight like, as you know, about in 2019, we shared this draft scope of work, scope of work outlines for people who are new, the methodologies that we'll use to undertake the environmental review, but it also describes the project. It describes the zoning and when we come out with a final scope of work as we certify that will be double underlined. All the changes will show up there and, if there's other sort of aspects that we need to highlight where we have changed, we're happy to you know, specifically, you know bring them to the Community board, share them in a presentation and so forth. So but yeah, that's actually frankly, one of my favorite things is the underlines too, and that we definitely have that yeah great, just one quick follow- up just to keep in mind, I'm sure everyone is that we have an election coming up. That could substantially change the federal funding that we get for a lot of the kinds of projects that this plan is addressing, and I know we can't plan for the unknown in that way, but it might make sense to just put a pause button on and see what happens in the next month. You know there's something to be said for having more information before proceeding with assumptions. That may no longer be true, so I just want to get that out there. Thank you. That's great thanks! Joanna, thank you, Joanna. I would ask any of the Community board members, who feel absolutely that they must speak. Okay, but I would love to move on from the community board members to the members of the general community so that we can get some questions in from them before we have to move on to the landmarks portion and do you want me to keep sharing my screen or should I take it down? How would you like? I can keep it up if anything comes up actually for questions, yeah! Do that? Okay mark! We still have two committee members with their hands raised. Okay, so who do we got next Bob Levine, hi Bob, but quick? It's just a request, and I was in Carol Park today and their signs up with pictures or projected pictures of what the zone is going to look like. I know everybody has their own view of what might be there, and you say this you're going to bring in what's allowable. Can you please really do realistic viewpoints of what the maximum are? Putting the two floors for elevator editions on top, including credit for whatever you named off a list of credits, so just be realistic of what the maximum buildings are. If, as well as what you typically would think was going to be there, that's all there's no answer to that. I just try to try to give us some scenarios when you present. Thank you. Thank you. Bob next, up next up and I'll make this a last call for committee members to raise their hand is Ariel hi, two quick questions, one. I did not see on pre- certification meetings about Nitro inclusion. No, I do not know if that comes under MIH and affordability or where that would be. But hopefully that will be one of the sessions and also you mentioned the environmental impact statement. I hope we're not going to see that at certification but similar to the framework. I hope we see that well in advance of certification, because that has an awful lot of information and impact to, and I will I look forward, I now see to the community sure I think those are probably two big questions- that a lot of people probably want the answers to on NYCHA. You know we know that this rezoning must directly benefit local NYCHA residents. We understand that this is the bottom line for many members of the community and, as you've heard tonight from the council. Members who, as I described in the alert process, have the ultimate vote on this proposal and it has to be addressed as a center piece of the process. You know, I would say, as you know, the city's budget situation obviously presents new challenges right now, as Joanna also pointed out, we are working through them and we must work through them and we're going to work on the proposal and get back to the community as soon as we can did not want to put it up here and set expectations that it's on the list right now, but it's definitely something that we know has to be done for this process to move forward. So on the Eis question, I do think it's important if you would stay with me. I know it's. Maybe it's a little bit again in the weeds not to keep using that word, but the draft eas will be released at certification of the euler and giving it's. I think it's really important for people to know like the technical and administrative aspects of conducting Eis why this is the case. It's an enormous undertaking. It looks at 20 different topics related to the environment. In built context, it looks at each one using standard methodologies and it can go deeper into detail where warranted and a critical piece to keep in mind is that a key challenge to the Eis process is that it's a snapshot in time for decision makers and the community, but in drafting the eis it's also not a static process. It's not linear what information standards and data are included is a live question up in until the end, which is certification, which is why releasing something months early for from before euler is not really feasible or helpful things change. The zoning proposal can change, it has changed and the Eis needs to be updated to reflect those changes. So it's not really possible to share in it in advance. That said, we have given, you know, an idea of where things are going along the way and we're happy to talk about seeker 101s and explainers and to come out and pour over the eis with you right after certification to build that knowledge and build that capacity. And have you ask questions about it once it is out? So I know that's not satisfactory. You want it before Ulerp and I appreciate- and I understand where you're coming from, but I hope at least this answer gives you an idea of to what our limitations are and again. However, we can come and come every other day or whatever is not too much and not too little that we can help you pour over this stuff, like we're here. For that. Thank you and thank you to the members of the committee, and I want you all to know that I've been trying to read every one of the comments as they come through, and I know many of the people who've made those comments, and I appreciate their being here and it all will be reviewed by. I hope city planning and certainly by us and now we have gotten questions from a number of people and I'll start off with those who submitted the questions early and is Barbara woods in the House mark. I looked in the Chat and Barbara does not seem to be here, so I think we should move on to the next person. Okay, she wanted to know if we'll allow questions from the public. The answer is yes, Paula Smith from NYCHA capital improvement question. So Paula Smith are you there. Paul is here and I'm paula, I'm going to allow you to talk now in the function, hello, hi, paula, hi. I want to know what they're going to do to fix the problems in niger before they start rezoning now. Thank you. Thank you for the questions. Paula. I think you know I. This dovetails with Ariel's question on NYCHA. I think you know the unsatisfactory answer that needs to be. You know unsatisfactory for now is that we do not have the update on NYCHA funding. We are working on it. We understand it is the linchpin for this to move forward and be approved, and it can't be without that, and so you know we are you know. Ideally we would have it right now and we would be able to get this out of the way and we can just. We can start talking about those improvements. We can start talking about all these other things and we can really focus on them. I think you know we're hoping to come back as soon as we can and we're working on it. You know every day to try to get it there and we're. You know, I'm excited that we're going to get there and you know I am looking forward to the day that I can provide you a satisfactory answer. Okay, we obviously we really need to have a satisfactory answer before all this goes forward, and I know you're aware that this is critical from not only the community board's point of view, but we'll understand the councilman's point of view yeah and just to give a thought like we are. You know we wanted to have this tonight and we also want to meet- and you know not delay on giving you updates on other aspects of the plan so that you are ready as a certification comes along and we're not sort of having a lot of these meetings during euler. And so you know, this decision is to make sure that we inform you on a lot of these things and we're not ignoring the NYCHA question and the NYCHA piece. Thank you. Jonathan next up is Susan young of the frogs. Is there yeah? What was the question I submitted? Several? I guess you're, it's up to you to tell us what you want to ask, oh goodness, well, I'm kind of concerned that there are not enough parks and there's a proposal to have the Smith Street, ninth mystery and ninth streets as a proposal for a park. But then, if it's not wrecked, it's only remedied for two feet. Instead of 20 feet and no vegetation can be grown except for trees, and I understand that the East River is trying to destroy the trees there. Why can't those trees be transported to the Smithy Ninth street area for a new park since there's only one park in Carroll gardens? That's you know, supplements. I mean the new school, that's already built in my neighborhood. Thank you, Susan Jonathan yeah. Thank you Susan, for that. I think there was a lot there. I please tell me if I'm, if I'm wrong in my response on this subject, I think you were talking about the area around Smith and ninth, and particularly, are you focused on public place and that? Okay? Yes, my so a couple things one we are proposing a park there, a new neighborhood park that will be city owned and we are going to have actually in a few weeks an update on Gowanus grain, where we and our colleagues and other agencies, along with the development team, will give an update on our plans for the site and we'll also have people on hand. I know last year in December, there are questions on remediation and we'll have folks on hand who can talk directly to what the remediation will entail and what the you know: different components of the project. After remediation are, and if you have questions particularly of trees and what can be built, I think we can make sure that someone who has an expertise in that I am not an arborist. Is that the right word you know I know a little bit, but I would not you know chance to answer that particular question. I think we can make sure that someone from, I think the parks, Department or someone else could be able to talk to that yeah. Yes, because you know, thank you sure. Thank you. Susan. Okay, next up is Toby hyde mark. If you do not mind, I was asked to pass along an additional committee member question, which is whether the Eis has looked at past rezonings and their impact on neighboring manufacturing areas, so whether the rezoning is going to take into account the impact that it might have on the manufacturing base in the Gowanus to me, those seem like two different questions that I can parse out. The first one is: will this eis look at other rezonings where there were changes to manufacturing districts? No, it's that's, not something we're going to do and able to do to go through a historical review of what that has what has occurred. That's really outside the scope of these actions, but the second one I think you know the first one is really I think at the meat of it is in the second one which is like. Are you going to be looking at the Gowanus ibz in the Eis? And the answer is yes, it's within the study area of the analyses in the eis, so it's in there. Hopefully that answers that particular question right. Thank you. Of course, you know in the letters that the Community board has written to you. We have specifically asked you to do a study in the Ibc zone. You know, I know NYCHA and Ibc have not been formally made part of the rezoning, but they remain important elements to move the community forward as a whole. Thank you now, alex next up is toby hyde. Here he is here and I'm trying to Alec. Can you hear me? Yes, hey folks, thank you so much for the presentation. I appreciate it. I have two sets of questions one fairly broad and one a little more technical, but I really am excited to see this move forward. I live in park slope. Certainly a member at resident here and you know one is when we think about the using this space and maximizing the number of the amount of housing that we can build. You know, despite as you reference the pandemic and rents, are stable, if not rising in Brooklyn as people move from Manhattan. But how can we maximize the number of units and affordable units here? I saw a lot of our six, a and b in in the plans, and why not? Why stop there? Why not move to seven and eight and really make this a place where even more people can live? Second, is you know, and obviously all that comes with mandatory inclusionary and more units mean more affordable units? The second, the second one is on the parking. You know there was a reference to a decrease in parking requirements. All the online documentation shows drops to 20 from 50, for example, in the r6 areas. Why 20? Why not eliminate it further and there's a reference to in the transit zone? You know the wonderful thing about this area. Is it's bounded on both sides by subways, so does it? Is it all considered a transit zone or are there areas that are excluded from those requirements? So I think that's something that you know as we think about building more housing and building it in reasonable fashion. How can we, how can we lower those even further and where did the transit zones begin and end sure, thanks Toby, I appreciate the questions and the comments and also the point of view, because it's also it really is something that we think about. You know we hear a lot of comments and concerns about. You know it's too much and it's too big, but there really is when we come up with these plans, a consideration of how much a neighborhood can handle, and the urban form is something that we really do look at when it comes to street widths context. Where can additional density be accommodated, is something that we've spent. You know hours and you know lots of years looking at, and so you know you could just say: let's do everything at the maximum density and just pull the rip cord. That really ignores the fact that our neighborhoods are. You know the places we love, because there's a unique urban fabric and that urban fabric starts with the streets, and we really think about this from the pedestrian point of view, and you know if Saggy has anything he wants to add into that. You know he's our urban designer extraordinaire. I would also kick it over to him sure I think you know it's all a matter of balance approach. The neighborhood is, after all, bounded by low rise neighborhoods, so the transition to that scale was also very important. We look at narrowness of streets and where we can accommodate more density and where density or and height could be accommodated in a lesser format. So it's really amount about striking that balance to maximize where possible, because of the need, but also making sure that the public realm the streets, the open spaces that we are proposing to create, are of good quality and feel good right as people who walk inhabited and inhabit the open spaces in the streets. Thanks again and to the second question about 20 percent, how we came up with that number and why not lower we looked at a couple things in coming up with that number. You know, first and foremost in the in a lot of our thinking is that you know climate change is real and that you know allowing for cars to continue to dominate our neighborhoods and be really easy to include in our social lives is something that we really need to have a clear- eyed understanding of the trade- offs that they have when it comes to developing, affordable housing in every space, especially, this is not even looking at a place like Gowanus, where it's probably more expensive was estimated a few years ago at 50,000 dollars per space, and so we looked at this from really a principled standpoint. But then we also looked at it. From a standpoint of you know: what are the ownership levels in and around the neighborhood and what are what's the current utilization for garages? You know along fourth avenue in new buildings, and what we found was that 20 percent was a good number to lower the parking numbers too, so that it would not get rid of all the parking requirements that actually the spaces would be provided along the canal. Those are the larger developments where the number of units would really trigger parking. It's also the place where you really want to have parking. You have street ends. You have dead ends where you do not want necessarily people coming to this amazing neighborhood for the open space and the shops and the funky mix and the people and circling a lot around for parking, and so the 20 was this pretty sweet number that came up with lowering parking to get us the uses and get us the proposed development that we need, but while also making sure that there is parking where we do need it. Hopefully, I think that answers your question. We have heard this before. You know why not go down to zero. We did think about that and we came up with 20 as something that was appropriate for Gowanus. Thank you. Next up is Cassie carrillo from 32Bj Mark. I do not see that name among the attendees okay, how about as an alternative, Theo, Ralph Ford from 32Bj yep? Okay, this one yeah. I heard you for a second hello, hey ethio hi. How are you doing yeah? How are you, okay, I'm going to have my daughter read for me because I'm driving right now beautiful? I would love to hear from her. Thank you good evening. My name is C.O Brushfort I've been a proud 32 bj member for 32 years I lived in Gowanus neighborhood on Warren Street for about 45 years. I'm here tonight on the behalf of my union to express our support for this rezoning. This rezoning is expected to be eight thousand two: eight thousand two hundred units, new housing and Gowanus, and many building services and jobs like mine, I'm happy to report the development alone to cancel Pmg and doc development and all years management. I have made credible to create replica wage building service jobs for future building service workers at this site. I'm looking forward to watch Gowanus change through the rezonings by becoming more active, more affordable, more familiar on the behalf on more jobs like mine, on the behalf of New York, City, 32Bj member. We support this rezoning. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, I'm glad you read it rather than the person who's driving. That's very good! Thank you. Thank you. I hope you understood. Thank you so much. Okay. The next up is, let's go to Gowanus arts, David, Kurtz and or Johnny Thornton. I see David here, okay, now hi. Can you hear me? Yes, all right, so I'm David Cutz, I'm the president of arts Gowanus. As many of you know, article honest is a non- profit organization that supports and advocates on the behalf of artists working living in the Gowanus neighborhood arts. Gowanus is a member of the Gowanus neighborhood coalition for justice and we entirely support the demands and in particular the top three deal breaker points put forward by Gncj. If these demands are not met, it'll be very difficult for arts Gowanus to support the rezoning. As you surely know- and this is nothing new- you know- artists are an important existing component of the Gowanus neighborhood. I think somebody said part of the funky mix. You know artists, add fabric to the to the neighborhood and it's important that the artist community be supported through this process, so we're keenly interested in assuring that there's a sustainable and affordable space for artists and that they'll be retained and expanded through the rezoning initiative, and I have several questions, I'm curious to know if gowanus's need of sustainable and affordable space for artists in order to keep the creative community intact and we're hopeful that the artist that artist studio space will be part of the Gowanus mix. And my question is: will the text specifically state artist studio space is an appropriate use for the proposed point three far associated with the glottis mix? A second question pertinent to the first: is you know in order to maintain visibility for Gowanus artists, there's a need for non- profit, run artist, exhibition and gallery spaces will gallery spaces operated by a non- profit organization, be included as part of the 0.3 faar for the Gowanus mix, and and if so, is there a specific percentage of the 0.3 far that would be dedicated to artists, studios and or non- profit exhibition spaces. Sure, thanks David and thanks for you, know, joining giving us those questions I'll try to go through them and remember them. The first one was specific to what is in the zoning and will it have artist studio space defined. Somehow the specific uses will be outlined in our zoning text that will be referred out to the public when the application is certified in January. They'll have a list of them, as previously you know described. The Gowanus mix incentive that's outlined in our draft scope of work is comprised of really two use incentives. One would incentivize the inclusion of like a really wide range of non- residential uses that are allowed in the proposed districts and the other one would incentivize the inclusion of a more specific set, a smaller set that includes light industry, arts related cultural, civic, induces and repair and production services. So actually, in fact the 0.3 is really 0.6 and both of those incentives would include artists, so the smaller set incentive would include it and also the obviously. The larger expansive incentive would also include artists, and I think your second question is related to essentially would nonprofits be able to operate those spaces, and my understanding of the zoning is that it does not differentiate between for- profit in non- profit gallery spaces. So you know my understanding is it does not conflict there and then the last one was. Would the percentage? Would there be a percentage of that floor area ratio, I'm being reminded again from David Briggs earlier question, not to assume that people know what I'm talking about floor area ratio being, basically, how much square footage you can develop and so there's a specific amount that we're setting as an incentive. For you know the Gowanus mix and the question here is of that you know ratio. Would there be a percentage? So is there a ratio of the ratio that would be, you know, mandated for artists, studio space and the answer is no. The use incentives are voluntary and a key part in what is described. You know that I think you know very well David as well is that I think the relationships with the developers will be very key in getting local organizations working with developers to make sure that the spaces that will be built are provided to. You know, groups and organizations in the community that really satisfy the goals and vision that we've worked on together. Thank you, Jonathan. I think we can only take two more questions before wrapping it up. We have many more questions. We know what those are we are going to have. Jonathan. Have those questions to look at and hopefully to answer before the next meetings and to the extent possible and hi Dan Wiley next up is going to be Martin Bc. If he's here Martin, you should be unmuted, unmute Martin, I'm trying to unmute. Can you hear me yeah hi, Martin hi, so I'd like to address what, for me, is the elephant in the room which is rising property values and how that can affect existing and established commercial and art space and small businesses like myself? So when I see this blooming, I worry and it's, and I have good reason to worry that my building will be sold and then I'll be. You know, plumb out of luck, even though I've actually operated this space since 1981., and I a lot of the talk seems to seems to be about incoming development, and I have not really seen anything that gives me reason to not be. You know worried. Secondly, again about like rising property values is incoming owners potentially of commercial spaces and small businesses. What I'm anticipating is that, what's going to dominate, is sort of economically high- end or even luxury retail, and I wonder if there's been an assessment of the demographics of what kind of the small business owners that come in, for instance, can we expect a lot of black ownership? Can we expect a lot of hispanic ownership? I myself am hispanic by the way, so I'm I'm afraid looking at this, that with the dominance, that of very well- off financially privileged people. Moving in that look at these percentages that that's going to dominate and it's also going to affect neighboring neighborhoods. So it's sort of and honestly if this is looking like a further whitening of south Brooklyn, because of what I just said, I can't really support this. I can't support it because I'm scared of my building getting sold. To put it simply and also, why would I what was the term used assume my fair share of something if it's just going to be dominated by you know the very well- off? So that's pretty much. My comment question sure I do not. It helped me out. If I'm wrong, I did not really hear a question to respond to. I do not really agree completely with the assertions I think you know there has been clearly disagreements. You know there is no housing that is allowed today. There's housing in the adjacent communities and not a lot of growth is allowed and what we have seen from that dynamic is just gentrification, and that is happening without the rezoning and what this rezoning has to offer are 3,000, affordable homes, incentives to make this, you know Gowanus mix a reality and also lots of investments in the community that would not be coming otherwise, and so I do not necessarily agree with the assertion that this would make things worse. I think this is what we're bringing to help actually integrate the neighborhood make this diverse and produce opportunities for people who you know really should have the opportunity and the chance to live in a neighborhood that has good schools. That is healthier. You know the life- changing difference. This can make for kids and families will accrue over generations and that's not possible without these changes. Thank you, Jonathan. By the way, it indicates here Martin that you're in the old can old american canned factory building, and I want you to be aware that CB6 passed a resolution to try to make the old american Canned factory more economically viable, so that the commercial and manufacturing tenants rents could be kept at a an acceptable level, and we did ask for that, and we will continue to promote that next up is oh, a friend of mine. Here we go Andrea Parker. Are you there? Yes, thanks and thanks everyone for coming here tonight. I do want to say that I mean I've been following the chat and the conversation, and I appreciate how difficult it is to hold a public meeting, but I do think that making sure that we can see people's faces and actually have conversations with our community members is going to be important in future meetings for the future meetings. I jonathan. I understand your response about the eis. I do feel like there's a lot of stuff, that's not going to change and the more that you can release from the eis ahead of time, so that we can understand what these impacts are. The ais is an extremely difficult document for people to read and we are going to need time to look at it and to really evaluate it, and particularly I'm wondering whether at the infrastructure meeting DEP will be presenting the results of the eis for combined sewage overflow number one. Will they be presenting those results and number two? If those results do not show that the new unified stormwater rule will mean that new development does not increase pollution, will the city be investing in additional infrastructure in the neighborhood? Thank you, Andrea. That's a good point. I think I will take that back as feedback for the upcoming meeting. I know we are. The plan is to come on December, 2nd with DEP to share those results, and I you know that's a very good comment and I'll see what we can we can provide, and did I miss the your earlier question or comments on yeah? I mean the other question is if the unified stormwater rule does not allow a net zero increase in cso, will the city be investing in more infrastructure, sure, increasing the size of tanks or making micro tunnels etc? Yep, I would not want to steal our thunder from December 2nd, so I'll leave you at a cliffhanger we'll certainly get to that at that meeting, but I also thought- and I just wanted to make sure you had very good comments about engagement. I wanted to make sure I did not miss a question from you with the sort of two topic comment. Question did I miss so the question would be at future meetings. Will we be able to see each other's faces and have conversations with other community members sure? So I think you know. I know we received a letter from gncj about you, know a list of suggestions and we're pretty happy eager to sit down and talk about what we can do. What our limitations are, what we're thinking could be things that we can augment. I think, just to put out there. The in- person thing is not really possible from you know us as a city causing inducing people to gather when there's a virus that you know can risk people's lives. So I've really appreciated the list of things you've given us and other people have also given us suggestions- and you know, hey we're- we had something over like 350 people attend tonight, that's amazing, but we also acknowledge this is new. This is early days in this kind of new reality, and so we're clearly, you know still trying to figure out how we can, especially during this time of the pandemic, when there is that real risk augment it to get more people involved and have more people, see each other and hear each other. Each other's voices is the short long answer there so I'm happy to, and I would love to set up a meeting to figure that out and talk with you guys. So once again, thank you for being with us Jonathan, I hope you're with us a number of more times, with far more specifics before certification, and certainly during the certification process. You know we're reading all of the comments that are coming in. I know most of you not all of you who are making the comments. Thank you for making the comments if we can get people's faces on the next meeting, that would be terrific I'd be happy to give up my face for somebody else's in the next meeting, but at this point I want to thank Jonathan and Winston and all of city planning for coming to us for committing to pre- certification meetings, which are have not been typical in other places, but should be commonplace from here on in and for that I thank everybody. Coming keep putting your questions in the portal. If you put your questions in the porthole, then those questions can be answered subsequently at subsequent meetings or even before those meetings to you if you provide your email, addresses, etc. So, thanks the whole community. Again, it's terrific turnout. We really do appreciate it, and I'm going to turn this over to my friend David Briggs, to do the land mark section of our meeting today. Thank you. Thank you mark, thank you again to DCP and Jonathan Segee. Yep, thank you for having us we'll, also be sharing our presentation, so you guys can have it to share out to the community so yeah. Thank you. Seeky too. I have not seen you so I did not know, but thank you. Thank you. We'll take a 10 second breather here, while people log off unless people want to stay on, certainly welcome to. I guess I want to ask first, I'm not sure who's representing the project at 519. Second street. Would it be James Backlay? Are you here? No, that's Scott Rosenthal the property owner, I'm here, okay, so you're going to present the drawings and take us through it sure, okay, so Scott the way it works. Is I open it up to you make a presentation after that people will want to ask questions. I will call on them and they will ask a question and then you will answer it. Please do not interject while they're asking a question just so they can get their question out and we certainly won't interject while you're answering it once there is a motion. You are no longer allowed to ask any questions, and that goes for the rest of the community as well, except for people on the committee. Unless a question is directed to you by the committee, all right is that clear? Okay! So do you? Do you want to share your screen or ty? Do you want to share the screen? How do we want to start here? This is a the project is at 519 second street in Brooklyn and ty. For some reason, I can't see the applica, oh nope, just nevermind. It popped up. It's a, I guess so. Exterior restoration at the entrance to create handicap access or wheelchair access is that fair, Scott, that's exactly right! Okay, so so back to ty, are you going to share this screen? Yes, I'm going to share the screen. I'm going to share my screen here in a moment and Scott you just say: whenever you're ready, okay, it's all yours, Scott! Okay! Are we on screen share yet? Does it appear so I do not have the screen up. Okay here we are all right, 519, second street, it's a 20-foot, wide four- story. Townhouse! It's between 7th and 8th avenues and part of the renovation anticipated is to provide a barrier- free access to the Understoop entrance at the basement level. To do that, it will require modifying the area way in effect, lowering it to match the existing sidewalk grade. Property in this slide shows the existing and the proposed change in the area way height to match the sidewall. There's no modifications anticipated for the knee wall that provides the entrance way from the sidewalk into the area. It's just the concrete pad, which is a 20th century, cracked, concrete pad that would be removed and replaced with blue stone pavers to match the historically appropriate, covering for the area and, as you can see on this slide just previous to what we saw, the grade will be pitched after the stairwell to marry the basement level entryway with the sidewalk. This is a view of the existing conditions of both the sidewalk and the area way, and we anticipate removing the cracked concrete area and putting in 24 by 36. I believe pavers blue stone vapors in place. Please the demolition plan that's anticipated is in the hatched area, filling the removal of the concrete pad, and if we go on to the we'll see that we need to add a step to the stoop which is shown, I do not know if you can see my cursor on the right hand, drawing at the base of the Stoop correct, and that is because the area way is lowered to match the sidewalk grade. That added step was conceived to essentially match what has already been done at 525 second street, which is a brownstone three doors away from the subject property they married their areaway height to the sidewalk and also added a stoop. Just as you see in the proposed basement plan and a photograph is central and it shows exactly the way our step ad would look together with, I might add, the blue stone pavers, which 525 also has in their area way and any changes or exposed areas that results from removing the existing concrete pad will be repaired and matched to the existing conditions of the brownstone with respect to color and materials and workmanship. And finally, you have a summary of photos of the neighboring brownstones and the relevant. Drawing on this sheet is the one on the right hand, side, which depicts the paver plan for the blue stones. The one on the left can be disregarded, an elevation showing the placement of the pavers and the substrate base, upon which those pavers will rest, there's also a hatchway which will be added which will be consisting of a diamond plate aluminum, which also is exactly the same as what's at 525 right now. I believe. That's the end of your presentation, Scott, okay, I'm open to any questions that may have arisen so just before we do that Scott and Ty. I know we had the whole email exchange about a photo of the front area way there is that, could that be shared with the committee? Yeah just give me one. Second, I'm going to unshare and then reshare okay, by the way, just to make sure I have the attendance correct. I see a phone number here without a name so well now it just went away. I just want to make sure I want to know if that's a committee member or not 917-, 817- 0829, if you're a committee member, could you just send me a check or something in the chat or that's me David Paul basile. Oh I'm glad I asked hey Paul yeah hi good evening, everyone, okay, good! Thank you Paul, all right! So Scott can you just explain this photo sure that's a picture of 519 second street and it shows the area way as it exists. Now, you'll see the steps up, we anticipate removing them and making the entryway add grade to the sidewalk and that will provide the barrier free handicap access to the basement and we'll cover the area way with the blue stone pavers that square rusted out galvanized steel covered lid, which is not attached to the property, is the area that would be replaced with the aluminum diamond plate Hatch, okay and Scott. Can you just explain? What's going to happen when that slab comes out and it's lowered, I do not know almost a foot at the bottom of the wall, the sidewall, the neighbors stoop and your wall just right behind the or the basement, the seller hatch is being replaced right. That's a good observation and myself and landmarks has had numerous conversations about the methodology and materials to be used to parge and match whatever area is exposed to what the new area is to the existing area, so that it the transition, is not noticeable. So, for example, if you look at the stoop to 521 second street, which is visible on the right hand, side where that brown area is, we would match the sandstone with similar materials applied in a historically appropriate way and on your wall same okay, whatever is exposed, will just be a continuation of what you now see. Okay, thank you. Scott questions for the committee looks like Bob's got his hand up a couple of questions. What's the thickness of the blue stone? Is it you know like half inch pavers or is it the thick inch and a half stone? I do not remember what we specified, whether it's 3 cm or more, but I would have to go back into the drawing to find out the I do not like the aluminum, the idea of an aluminum hatch. I mean the worst I or the best out of it, I would say, would be a brown anodized aluminum, but I not even sure I like that either, but that certainly would make sense, and I do not care what 525 has or whatever the number was. I doubt if that was approved by landmarks. Certainly, no aluminum hatch came through here in the last 15:20 years that I know of, and the other thing is what's the bottom step that you're going to be adding made up. Is that bluestone or is that brownstone we've been matching the 525 model and what's already at the subject property which is cement? It's concrete are your steps concrete color or they browse them? Yes, sir straight down. Okay, other questions, Joanna hi! I am excited about increasing accessibility in the neighborhood, so I just overall commend that gesture. I'm curious about also about the blue stone, more details you mentioned. Maybe they're going to be two by three pavers and I was wondering I know it's more expensive, but if you've considered a larger slab and then let me sell you on it because then in the long run, there'll be less subsidence. Since you are planning on you know, people with mobility needs using it, you'll get a more even run. If you use a larger paper and if you're looking for historic accuracy, you know just thought I'd throw that out there, and I really like the detail on the step where it curves around to match the existing curve, so just preserve that whatever intending there thanks jerry, I think that it's very it's very pleasing to the eye, and I would agree that handicapped accessibility is very important. Jerry you just got muted hold on Jerry. We can't hear you okay, there you go. You hear me now. Yes, okay, I think anything that we can do to make some of our brown stones. More handicapped, accessible is long overdue and we've approved a number of these previously on 9th street. For one example stop smiling Bob, and I think that this is something that is long overdue, but I do have one question: after all that, where you are lowering the level down to the entrance on the basement level of basement apartment lower level, is there currently a step there now or does the gate open up? And it's all one level? How far are you actually lowering the inner airway to meet that doorway and that gate approximately four inches? Okay between the sidewalk? It's this odd circumstance where you have to walk up into the area way and then down into the basement. So it's kind of not efficient. That's what as bad as you think it is unless everybody wants to keep going. I actually have some comments to let Glenn go first. I just want to ask if there's anyone from the community here that wants to comment on this before we entertain a motion. Well, I have just my comments and then we can open it up to the community. We could we bring the photo back up David. Do you want just the one photo or the full presentation I'm actually going to want both but the photo? First? Okay, sorry, I'm going to play architect. I can't help myself. Okay, thank you. So Scott on your neighbor's stoop, you'll notice, the bottom of it facing the street is I'm and I was not quite sure how you explained this. So I want to make sure I understand it, but the bottom face of the street appears to be brownstone and then that wraps around right where ty's cursor is right now and all and continues as Brownstone, and if the entry airway is lowered. I recommend that Brownstone color continued down so that reads as a plinth underneath their neighbor's stoop. I think that's a consistency of design intent on your building. Since that line does not line up. I think a change in material is appropriate. I guess you're, I'm not quite clear if you were saying that the newly exposed area below the window on your building would match the brownstone at the neighbors stoop or is it a different color because you said it'll match, but you have brick above you. So what are you matching? Okay, good question? We are matching to what is right next to the material to be matched so, in other words, to start where you did on the right hand, side the neighbors Brownstone we're going to use brownstone parging, whereas, as we move to my building under the window area, we're going to match the material under the window area. So sorry, but is not that just a blue stone window sill or is it something else? No, it's cement. It's just concrete. It looks like it has a tent, no it's cement, so I would propose that you actually tint that concrete to match. Bluestone, I do not think concrete is a particular I mean well. Concrete can be a very attractive material, but maybe in more modern settings. If this, if there, if your stairs are concrete, I agree that the bottom step should be also concrete, as long as it's tempted to match the rest of the stairs. If there is a tint, if you understand what I'm saying there, yes, okay, so now can we go to the drawings. This is going to pick up on Joanna's point. Okay, perfect, so on the right there you I do not know how the 24 by 36 was derived. I think if you just picked slightly larger flags at the entrance, where right where it says new tread on the right drawing those joints should line up with the opening, and otherwise you have these little weird thin pieces and, frankly historically, they would have done that and the two by three seems a little random in terms of the size and if you just made them a little bit bigger and have the joints aligning with some of the existing architecture, be a much nicer look and I do not really think it's going to impact your budget. I see no reason not to do that. The 24 by 36 by the way, was at the request of LPC, but it was not our preference, so I'm happy to adjust the size of the pavers as suggested okay, and I think actually the way you have it going. The other direction looks fine, and my third and last point is: I agree. I is it your intent. I agree with Bob's point that about the diamond plate, hatch. Being aluminum is that supposed to be just an unfinished like a mill finished aluminum? My main concern was that it does not corrode anything that works color wise to anyone else's preference. I could see if they can anodize the material in a way that it's color matched to the blue stone, for example, it's possible. I have no preference on that. Well, so aluminum oxidizes and it does not look very attractive once it oxidized. I would be okay if you just painted it black, but if someone wants to paint it suggest that it matched the blue. So I'm, okay with that too, most of these hatches around the neighborhood are black. So am I I'm open to any suggestion that that's reasonable, okay? Well, let's, let's leave that there and, let's see if anybody from the community has a question. I think I saw a couple people yes, Judith had a question. Let me see if I can pull her up. Okay, hi! I just my basic question is: are you will have to redo the sidewalk, which is really cracked? I was wondering what color that was going to be the logic there would follow from what was going to be done in the area way to match the neighboring flags, both I guess north and south- of the repair work. But yes, absolutely we're going to repair the sidewalk as well, and the people next door on either side have blue stone still so you're going to put approximately that color concrete down. If you're talking about the sidewalk, the science itself is cement, I believe on both sides of me. Oh okay, I was just wondering what color it was going to be to match the color that exists north and the south of the replacement flags. Oh okay, that's my question. Any other comments, jerry. If you want to yeah. Okay, do you hear me, like okay motion, is to recommend to LPC conditional approval, with the conditions being one that the to increase the size of the blue stone pavers from the 36 and by 24 to an appropriate, larger size and two to tint the cement that will be placed next door on the stoop to match the brownstone that exists there and also to tint the cement to match the color on the David. I do not know the how you define that line of cement on the actual building which you were questioning, but it should be tinted, some something somehow to match that existing the batch of the blue stone yeah, the Blue stone. Thank you and those are my that's the motion with conditions anything on the hatch. Thank you. I can't even read my own notes. I write so badly and also that the hatch, instead of being just a plain bare, unpainted aluminum, should be painted with a flat matte. Black color should be painted a flat matte black and we might as well throw in that the additional step added to the student, the matching as well excellent I'll. Second, that any comments seems like a no- brainer anybody against this all right. Well, thank you, Scott! Thank you all good! All of you. I appreciate it all right. Thank you good night, all right folks, good night, everybody concludes the meeting good night, everybody good night, everyone, I'm driving back to the slope if anybody needs a lift, I'm very funny very funny for doing a great job. Absolutely thank you. All right have a good night. Thank you. All right have a good night.
