A lot of you know, I, believe that if we get this right and that's still a big, if for a plan, that does not yet have anything meaningful for public housing residents in wackoff, gardens and Gowanus houses and it needs to.
If we get it right, that, because of all the community input that there's been so far over the last eight years, that the Gowanus rezoning really could be different and that it could deliver genuinely more inclusive and integrated, more sustainable and resilient, economically vibrant neighborhood right when we need it that it could be part of recovering from Covid-19 and learning its lessons.
More details about the affordability mix of public plays the details on Csos to make sure the canal is getting cleaner, more information on the Gowanus mix and the transit bonus, and the schools bonus, and I'm really grateful that city planning is willing, rather than just to hit the go button which they could have done on the euler to spend time engaging with providing more details to and listening to the community, and it really is from deep community engagement that we've gotten here by my count.
We've pushed for and won new zoning tools for transit and school infrastructure to meet the demands of growth, some landmarking to make sure that we preserve buildings and a really innovative new Gowanus mix.
I checked is a testament to the power of online community meetings, but as a father of three kids We're all here, because we care about Gowanus and about the future of our city and neighborhoods, and we want to shape that future.
Lots of you know, feedback and concerns on, and we're also going to dig a little bit into what public review is and how it works in anticipation of certification in January.
It's highlighted the tenets and principles that are embedded in a lot of our work in Gowanus, including issues such as equity and inclusion, environmental justice, open space, urban form, housing security, and it can go on just to name a few.
It has also highlighted our need for job generation and giving a broader group of people access to jobs and housing and open space in high opportunity, areas, and then I, think.
So, the next couple slides are review, but in light of all of this, and in light of the past number of months, you know, we should highlight the fact that the plan responds to the moment and the future with significant new, affordable, homes, new jobs and open space, including a waterfront park, new schools and incentives to keep Gowanus mixed use, improvements to infrastructure and NYCHA communities and resilient and a resilient shoreline.
Just give you an overview of what that process looks like to start helping build capacity for when we are in euler for people to have really strong, input, and So. As we've noted and mentioned before, the proposed land use changes and our public review.
We're, very excited to be able to share updates on Gowanus green, in particular, on the proposed affordability, levels, but also on infrastructure, and particularly on planning for transit schools and storm water and csos, which are key elements of the plan that we have heard.
And these include land use changes throughout the 90s and early 2000s that limited new housing opportunities and growth in the neighborhoods surrounding Gowanus itself Was a naturally occurring live work, neighborhood up until zoning changes, city- wide in the 60s, which have largely remained in place and then now, due to that outdated zoning.
You know: land use, changes around Gowanus down zone and limited opportunities to housing, schools and jobs in these neighborhoods, and so what you see from we pulled a little bit from the district 15 plan is that the school segregation in CB6 also reflects similar patterns of housing, segregation, and so that really kind of brings us to okay.
It also included, recommended land use, changes that would be implemented as part of an overall Gowanus neighborhood plan.
One of the special things has been that the virtuous dynamic of government agencies and community members coming together really has been the linchpin of all this and of our comprehensive planning efforts, so that land use framework was then used to develop.
Housing, we're also proposing in the zoning to help shape a resilient and active waterfront and, as mentioned before, promoting a mixing abuses throughout the neighborhood and in mixed- use developments by way of incentives.
We've also paid particular attention to human scale in urban form and the public realm so requiring buildings would be set back at key locations, create light and air adjacent to low neighboring, context, flexibility, to encourage world- class architecture and really thinking about how to activate the bridges and the open space along the canal.
Current zoning institutionalizes the status quo from the 50s and 60s It holds on to years of decay, and it keeps existing brown fields from being remediated and infrastructure from being upgraded, and it also keeps newcomers out and from enjoying the life- changing benefits of growing up in neighborhoods of opportunity, near jobs, schools and stable housing, and so to make our shared vision of the future.
It's a standardized seven month process by which community members, city planning experts and elected officials weigh the merits of particular proposed land, use, changes and ultimately decide on whether to approve or disapprove those changes.
The, community, Board and Borough president recommendations, along with the application, then come to the City Planning Commission, who has 60 days to review, also deliberate, hold hearings, ask follow- up questions and ultimately issue their recommendation as well after the Cpc City Planning Commission weighs in the City Council also takes up review for an additional 50 days also holds hearings, also deliberates and ultimately decides to approve, disapprove or approve with modifications, and that's a pretty high level of the euler that would start in January, but again before all those public hearings and meetings that I'm sure you'll get tired of my face because I'll be coming to all of them and saying hello.
And I think you will find it not hard to agree to come back to the committee once you've finalized your draft zoning resolution, but before certification, so that we can go through it and understand it, and also that the community can understand it that 60 day time clock is very short on something of this size, and the additional meetings would be very helpful for everybody, the Community board and the community to understand what is being presented and the ramifications of whatever's being presented without getting into that.
We are going to get into the weeds on a lot of plan components at the Gowanus green update and on the infrastructure update in particular We're going to get into the weeds on the transit bonus, And we're going to get into the weeds on the schools bonus and how they will work and how they would be applied throughout the rezoning area.
The zoning proposal changed and I think what I've been really struck by is the comprehensiveness of the plan that we've put together with you all the fact that we looked at sustainability and resiliency environmental, remediation, community and cultural resources, land use and urban farm economic development and jobs.
The fight like, as you know, about in 2019, we shared this draft scope of work, scope of work outlines for people who are new, the methodologies that we'll use to undertake the environmental review, but it also describes the project.
And we're going to work on the proposal and get back to the community as soon as we can did not want to put it up here and set expectations that it's on the list right, now, So on the Eis, question, I, do think it's important if you would stay with me.
Maybe, it's a little bit again in the weeds not to keep using that word, but the draft eas will be released at certification of the euler and giving I think it's really important for people to know like the technical and administrative aspects of conducting Eis. It looks at each one using standard methodologies and it can go deeper into detail where warranted and a critical piece to keep in mind.
We are proposing a park there, a new neighborhood park that will be city owned, And. We are going to have actually in a few weeks an update on Gowanus grain, where we and our colleagues and other agencies, along with the development team, will give an update on our plans for the site and we'll also have people on hand.
Mind, I was asked to pass along an additional committee member question, which is whether the Eis has looked at past rezonings and their impact on neighboring manufacturing areas.
Certainly a member at resident here, And, you know one is when we think about the using this space and maximizing the number of the amount of housing that we can build.
How can we lower those even further, and where did the transit zones begin and end sure, And, it's too big, but there really is when we come up with these plans, a consideration of how much a neighborhood can handle, and the urban form is something that we really do look at when it comes to street widths.
You, know, first and foremost in the in a lot of our thinking, is that you know climate change is real and that you know allowing for cars to continue to dominate our neighborhoods and be really easy to include in our social lives is something that we really need to have a clear- eyed understanding of the trade- offs that they have when it comes to developing, affordable housing in every space, especially.
You have dead ends where you do not want necessarily people coming to this amazing neighborhood for the open space and the shops and the funky mix and the people and circling a lot around for parking, and so the 20 was this pretty sweet number that came up with lowering parking to get us the uses and get us the proposed development that we need, but while also making sure that there is parking where we do need it.
I'm looking forward to watch Gowanus change through the rezonings by becoming more active, more affordable, more familiar on the behalf on more jobs like mine, on the behalf of New York, City, 32Bj, member.
You know artists, add fabric to the to the neighborhood It's important that the artist community be supported through this process, so we're keenly interested in assuring that there's a sustainable and affordable space for artists and that they'll be retained and expanded through the rezoning, initiative, and I have several questions.
I do want to say that I mean I've been following the chat and the conversation, and I appreciate how difficult it is to hold a public meeting, but I do think that making sure that we can see people's faces and actually have conversations with our community members is going to be important in future meetings for the future.
The ais is an extremely difficult document for people to read and we are going to need time to look at it and to really evaluate it, and particularly I'm wondering whether at the infrastructure meeting DEP will be presenting the results of the eis for combined sewage overflow number one.
That's anticipated is in the hatched, area, filling the removal of the concrete pad, and if we go on to the we'll see that we need to add a step to the stoop which is shown, I do not know if you can see my cursor on the right hand, drawing at the base of the Stoop correct, and that is because the area way is lowered to match the sidewalk.
