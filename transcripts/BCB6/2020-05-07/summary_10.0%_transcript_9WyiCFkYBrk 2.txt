I hope everyone is staying, safe, keeping their family safe, at least taking an opportunity to go out for the occasional walk on Sunday It is peaceful and wonderful and great greenery and flowers, and as long as you follow their rules, which are not really very burdensome, but do not let the children climb, trees, do not steal flowers for mother graves and be respectful to the fact that this is a cemetery and not a park, although in its early days before the building of Prospect Park, that's where people in Brooklyn took their leisure.
We, had our budget hearing and budget legislative hearings for small business and workers rights and that open streets program that Peter just mentioned, but that will come later in the meeting.
You, know so weird world and do democracy in ways we never ever thought we would have to do it before, but on the upside we rarely get the New York State Attorney General who's busy and running around the state, able to join us for a community board.
Yet, but at least they're back in the New York City, Schools and I feel like good enough for Community Board six.
All of you to know that the FDA has not approved any at- home tests, no treatment, no cure or nothing or cream for the Prevention of or the cure of Covid-19, and so I urge all of you to reach out to them to our office It's the they're trying to again prey upon the anxiety and the fears of countless individuals.
We've been working with Congress and with regards to the Paycheck protection plan, making sure that small business women- owned, business, minority, owned business, local businesses take advantage of this loan program as foes as opposed to large businesses, and particularly business, is with connections and business is with lobbyists and businesses with a conflict, and so we are working with congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, who sits on the subcommittee as well as congresswoman Maloney as we monitor and provide some sort of oversight with respect to this paycheck for protection.
We have been called upon to mortgage service providers to offer immediate and long- term relief to all New York homeowners, I'm happy to report that Democrats right now are in a discussion led by congresswoman Maxine Waters, to provide some relief to tenants, they're urging and they're coming together around the package.
My fear is that landlords will go to the court and will seek judgments of eviction, and so what we need to do is provide them with some financial assistance on the federal level, And I'm, hoping that our congressional delegation, I've spoken to all of them and most of the members of the congressional delegation here in New York, who support relief for tenants and for small homeowners.
What has what we all know is true is that this pandemic has revealed fault lines that fall along racial lines and economic lines, and that's why we've called for expanded treatment, expanded capacitive capacity and rapid testing and hopefully expanded treatment, and so all throughout the state of New York We've been working with a coalition of elected officials to expand testing and communities which unfortunately, have had a disparity em, who have been Distin impacted in a dramatic way.
We do know that there are other primaries scared for June 23rd I've, advocated that we go to an absentee ballot system with the governor of the state of New. York is mailing out absentee applications to all of us in the state of New York, but voting, but polls will be open on June 23rd for the local primary we've got a primary for state, Senate I believe in that covers community board.
I think that we're going to go to before the claping starts our New York City, comptroller Scott stringer.
We crunch some numbers just yesterday, and we are now pretty sure that we're going to lose 900 and jobs and city many people who had jobs, Pre Covid-19, who now will lose their jobs by, but by sometime in June.
As far as I'm concerned, the state has a thirteen billion dollar budget and to make matters worse, the Brian, cabin and Joe and Simon are not with this, but the governor's proposal to cut spending will impact New, York City, another three billion doubt We all still have to recognize that the federal the federal stimulus has not been equal across the board, New York as the highest number of cases.
That I think New York City should need on for the for now.
You got ta save some money in good times, because you never know what comes our way We have to think strategically as a thinking about the budget.
We talked about health and social services and our communities that have struggled, but we also have to reimagine how people going to get to work, how kids are going to get to school How we going to protect people, how testing is going to become, in the short term, a critical part of society, so I'm throwing a lot out there from an economic perspective, because this is going to be probably the biggest challenge.
And I could show you numbers where this Dwarfs the said the city's fiscal crisis in the 70s, and you could really do some parallel between the depression and where we are potentially, and this means that the way we used to think about governing, which is well throw money at something if it sticks it.
We're going to have to look at this budget Both on this community level and each and every one of you in city government, with mayor De Blasio with Tish James elected officials, who are the best in the city, so I do not mean to tell you what you that you already know, You need more numbers from me on the budget.
Kovach crisis happened and they pulled me back in So I've been happily trying to help wherever I can in the face of this crisis and had a chance to work with some of your great local elected officials like Joe and Simon, and Brian Kavanaugh and Nydia Velazquez Kevin Parker Bobby, Carol, Brad, Lander I'm joined by a couple great colleagues from city government as well, who can plug in on some more specifics.
A few quick items, one following up on an item that Tish mentioned, which are the tragedies that we've been facing in our nursing homes, mayor, De Blasio, has made it a major priority to try to step in and provide support to nursing homes across New York City.
And we're going to build out and the states doing the same large contact tracing operations so that when Mike were hopefully not Mic, test positive, we're reaching out to him the next day as the positive test comes through identifying all of his close contacts and then hopefully providing some meaningful opportunities to make it easier for him to quarantine or isolate at home and or even in a hotel.
I've got a seven o'clock that I think I'm a little late for it too, but if I can follow, up, I'll leave my contact information and make sure that the right city agencies get back to anybody with any questions and really want to.
I know, there's some interesting stuff he's working on with legislation for insurance protections and Bobby good evening, CB6, Thank, You, You , know, I do not want to reiterate all of the smart good things that the mayor's office, the Attorney General, the controller are doing, and My other colleagues.
One of the most important things that we're going to need to be is to assist our small businesses or nonprofits, and one of those ways is to get them working capital.
Whatever reason the governor refuses to say that it will take more than 72 hours to get a call back, So I'll say it will take more than 72 hours for the Department of Labor to call you back, especially if you are looking for pandemic unemployment insurance, if you're a gig work or if you're, somebody that does not just have a straight w-2, please feel free to reach out to my office.
Possible, we're also working very diligently to make sure that our small businesses have a way to access the funds that are available, we're working on a grant program with one of our local natural profit.
So I worked with colleagues money from around this phone today, and this was meeting today to get a request to the Congress to provide a hundred billion dollars nationally in the next stimulus package, Detroit housing, at least ten billion of that to New York.
So many people living in congregate, settings living in public spaces in some cases, so I think part of that package ought to be addressing much both additional services for people in Shelter, so that we can get people into places where they can be isolated and the city's already doing some work to expand the use of hotel rooms rather than congregate, settings.
That is also true of long guns of rifles and shotguns and other such things in New, York City, but not in other parts of the state.
Senator I just took a little frolic and detour to be on a zoom happy birthday with a colleague, so First of all, I want to thank you, Mike and Peter, for hosting this again and to all of my colleagues in government for participating and a tuition Scott for getting on the zoom call with us and just a you know, a couple things I do not want to repeat what's and said: I think all of us at the state level are overwhelmed with unemployment pandemic unemployment.
The nursing home issue, as Dan mentioned I've, been working very closely with Dan on Cobble Hill, and you know it's really brought into stark relief.
And I think that we'll see after the investigations that are done, that we will find that there are a lot of ways that we can improve the way we as New York, works, work with and help our nursing homes who are caring for our most vulnerable citizens and make sure that you know we look at these congregate care settings if you've been watching Rachel Maddow There are now several nursing homes, with many more deaths, for example, as a result of Kovac 19, and so they all need some help.
I think we're all struggling with ways to help small businesses, please that the Chamber of Commerce of Brooklyn Chamber has started a new fund that will give low- interest loans or no interest.
Just want to say one thing about student loans that Tish mentioned about the work her office has done.
Again, if that's helpful, to people, because that's a really critical, critically important issue as well for so many people and just to say that if you, if you have questions, we really do want to hear from you, the staff is working, extraordinarily hard, as is every elected official staff.
I'm, just incredibly grateful for all of the work that so many members of the community have done to help support our restaurants by providing foods to the hospital staff and to the emergency rooms and to each other, and so it's a really great way that the community has stepped up, and we have incredibly creative community in this district The next person that we're going to hear from is Julie menin and she works with the census.
So I am now running the census for New, York, City and I really want to emphasize it at this time.
You may have heard that Curbside Organics collection is something that has been suspended, As, a budget cut that like breaks, my heart and I know for many of us in this community were the best composters at all of New York City and we're reducing hundreds of thousands of tons of solid waste.
There is some money that should be going, but we want to get more in there You know just an editorial note on Cobble Hill is there's a lot of the news of Like.
So they're people in news from the nursing home more than 50, had coded and recovered , I think it's very important for the state and the governor's office in particular to recognize that they should be working with providers that are finding ways to manage this crisis, just like hospitals which have public and private ones, and work with them, and associations like leading age, to actually figure out how to be better prepared and how to really support them.
Thank you so much for coming out the second straight month and for all the work that you guys, New, York, Brooklyn Presbyterian are doing right.
