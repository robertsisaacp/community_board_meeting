It was announced that, after four plus years of planning work, the Gowanus zoning proposal would enter public review in January of 2021 the community board and others requested.
Specifically, we will be presenting on sewers and drainage and how the Gowanus plan will support the creation of new schools and improvements to the area's transit network and infrastructure.
I think that the broadly, if we get it right, the Gowanus neighborhood rezoning, offers us an opportunity to build a more affordable, more integrated, a more vibrant, more sustained, a sustainable community than the one we have today, but there's a really big caveat, which is that growth must come along with the infrastructure needed to sustain it for new families and businesses who would come, but also for all those of us who live and work here.
But the ones that are already here, because we already have some overcrowded schools and some transit policies to make sure that we have the subway access and the buses that we need to nurture our families for a long time to come, It I'll, just say one thing here that I know.
Look, that just like it's important to me and to you and to the community that there's no additional csos in the canal that we make it cleaner to protect the remedy of the dredge and those tanks that are getting built.
That they're, going to look with real hard scrutiny at the new stormwater rule at the data that's being presented tonight and tell us what they think about it, and that's one of the great things actually about the super fund is that it brings the EPA in as a real guarantor of the canal.
You know judgment or whatever of this, not whatever our final position on this in the end will be determined by the content, and we are looking forward to what's there tonight, because obviously the csos and infrastructure have been a major issue.
We released the June 2018 framework, We have made progress on a number of fronts, including completing the first phase of high-level storm sewers along third Avenue, completing a major upgrade to sewer and water mains and the Gowanus IBZ along 9th street and 2nd Avenue, and progressing planning, design and property acquisition for the Cso facilities at the head of the canal.
We would welcome your comments as you receive the EIS go through the chapter, and you know obviously we'll obligated to do a response to common section, but we're very much looking forward to coordinating with the community and city planning on all aspects of the infrastructure.
As you know, We are responsible for a sewer system for the city of New York, one that is both combined, that's shown by the blue color, one that is separate, which means the storm and the sanitary sewers are separated with a dedicated pipe for each storm.
And I'm, going to turn it over to Melissa, who has been spearheading what we refer to as a unified rule for our combined and separated areas, and we think this will have really tremendous benefits.
Do. I just want to give everybody a summary of the stormwater rule that we have in place right now for specifically foresight and house connections and show you this introductory slide on how it compares to what we're working, on.
The first component is that sites that trigger twenty thousand square feet of soil disturbance or increase impervious area by 5,000 square feet are required to retain the water quality volume which, in New York, is one and a half inches on the property on the site, where it falls.
That's, giving some more flexibility for the development community and allowing them to manage the storm water in a way that is more cost effective in terms of the amount of space that a tank takes up.
So again, just want to highlight the new, unified, stormwater rule will affect all new and redevelopment sites that drain to a city, sewer.
The first component is going to be updates to DEP rules, chapter 31, which are the site and house connection permit requirements that I mentioned on the previous slide.
These requirements are in place today and they are in place to maintain optimal stormwater quantity and flow rates in the sewer system to help with that peak reduction, but they're being increased moving forward, and so that's going to trigger the sites that trigger that are all new construction, additions, alterations and other agency projects.
This is the what we call the retention first requirement, which means, If you trigger this component of the unified stormwater rule, you must use green infrastructure to meet the requirements.
Hand, side of this slide is showing you that projects that trigger both of the components of the unified stormwater rule will get credit for implementing green infrastructure.
So you'll see that more clearly in a few slides, high level benefits of the unified stormwater rule from a resiliency standpoint, point we're requiring more on-site stormwater management for all new development that improves water, quality.
This is going to minimize the time for the development community and make the review side even easier on the DEP end of things, and then we're going to create more consistency across the sewer areas, which makes it easier for development to plan.
We did ask for a site that was large enough to trigger both components of the unified stormwater rule, because we really want to hit home on the credits that we're giving to redevelopment that chooses to use green infrastructure to meet both requirements.
It would be very typical for a project to implement a green roof and a blue roof for their water quality component and then a detention tank for their sewer operations.
The sewer operations requirement here would be managing 40,000 gallons in a detention tank at a release rate of 0.25 cubic feet per second fast forward to the new unified stormwater rule.
This would require a 51 increase in the total stormwater management practice volume on this site, so the green roof, the blue, roof.
In addition to that, which is probably the biggest win for this particular site, is that the detained volume so whatever is not being managed in Evapotranspirated from the green roof, is released back to the combined sewer system.
Essentially, the takeaway here is that the new rule is going to require more on-site, Stormwater management, more stringent release rates back to whatever is going back to the sewer system, and it requires green infrastructure.
The last note I'll say about this is that on the second to last bullet on the slide, we have a note that there's a credit given for the green and blue roof and that's applied to the tank, and that is something the development community has asked us for many years.
In March, we worked with City Council to pass Intro number 1851 with which authorized the expansion of the water quality volume requirement from Ms4 to combine sewer area that happened in August.
We, have kind of shifted from the idea that somehow the city could separate out all the sewers I'd hope to see that at one point in time, but not affordable in the short term, we have moved from the idea that we could just keep building sewers that are larger and get all of the flow to the treatment plants that would require us to build bigger plants, require more energy, more greenhouse gases and all the rest of it, and we decided and started to think really hard about.
We wanted to see the effect that our 2021 rule would have on the growth that would result from this rezoning and we wanted to ensure that the growth in the area, meaning the sanitary increase in flow, would not offset or would not create additional csos from overflowing into the Gowanus canal, because we have worked so hard already to reduce those csos into the canal, Both with the efforts that DEP made prior to the Superfund program, with the two tanks that EPA is requiring, and so I know that most of you.
We assume that 16 of the lots, the projected development sites, those in purple, are assumed to trigger the new site, connection, proposal, House connection, proposal, volume and flow requirements that Melissa reviewed with you and volume, and infiltration practices associated with the chapter 19 rule, and we assumed that 84 of the lots would be the smaller lots and they would be assumed to trigger only this out site connection, proposal, House connection, proposal.
Next, okay, Here we go, so we have predicted that the cso volumes to the canal will decrease with unified stormwater rule in place, because that management of the stormwater on those sites, as they redevelop will offset the sanitary increases in flow.
The rezoning is anticipated to add approximately 18,000 new residents and that would be predicted to generate approximately 1.253 million gallons per day of sanitary sewage, and the vast majority of that, as I had said, earlier, would be transmitted to the water resource recovery, facility.
What we have identified through the analysis is that the anticipated unified stormwater rule is projected to reduce stormwater runoff to more than offset the sanitary increase by approximately 5 million gallons a year of cso, reduction.
That's a pretty intense event and we are showing that the event would generate 0.3 million gallons of sanitary flow, the stormwater runoff reduction, due to those lots being redeveloped and developing those stormwater management controls, either through the lower flow orifice or through tanks or through green infrastructure such as the Green Roof Melissa, was showing you would be about 0.9 million gallons, and so overall, Net weather flow decrease would be a 0.6 million gallons.
We talked about the pre, what we consider water, body, Watershed facility plans, so, prior to the upgrades that some of you may be familiar with at the Gowanus canal, pumping station, We had flows in the vicinia of 500 million gallons a year of cso into the Gowanus canal and without the tanks, but with the improvements that DEP made, which included the upgrade to that pumping station.
That is not going to be seen by the sewer system in the cases where it can not all be managed on site, either soil conditions or other issues, or in the case where we have those smaller lots where you won't get the green infrastructure or the less than 20,000 square foot.
It is important to note that you know key work has been done in the d15 diversity plan in the past couple of years, we're headed by the council members and the community boards and other organizations, and the other year.
There's a lot of monitoring and development trends that goes into school planning and once it's determined that a school need exists, the SCA and City act to provide seats and can do so in a number of ways through outright purchasing of property, to construct schools, leasing and renovating space or doing add-ons to existing schools.
All redevelopments within these zones will be required to work with the MTA and the city planning chairperson to determine if a volume easement is required before the department of buildings will issue any building.
The space would be dedicated for whenever the improvement can be made in the future through a legal instrument that runs the land, which is just a fancy way of saying it doesn't go away if the developer sells the property, so the transit bonus that we've worked on would be applicable to a 500-foot buffer from the station envelope along fourth avenue.
The rezoning proposal would also support the creation of new schools as new homes and population increase, and the proposal would also encourage private developers to help build new transit infrastructure in return for an increase in floor area.
Any of these projected redevelopment sites will, As long as they are draining to a city sewer, they will trigger either one or both of the unified stormwater rule requirements, So hopefully, that's clear and then the credits that I mentioned they're, not tax, credits, they're, their volume credits.
So the way that our stormwater rags work today is that the way that they're written is primarily so that a developer can plan their site and know exactly how much stormwater they are releasing to the combined or separate sewer system and exactly which rate.
You can take credit for the volume, not all of the volume, but a portion of the volume that DEP feels comfortable is never going back to the sewer system because it's being managed either through infiltration or retention, and so therefore, that tank they're building is downsized to allow.
It's, a volume, credit, and it's something that the development community has been asking us to do for a long time, because tanks do take up valuable, real estate space and we, you know.
What happens if the green infrastructure is not maintained, So, again, two components to the unified stormwater rule, the component, that triggers the water quality volume requirement that requires retention, has its own authority enforcement authority process and then the sewer, the site, connection and house connection requirement, has its own enforcement process.
You can't finish the construction of your project unless you meet the site connection requirements, so we feel very comfortable with the compliance under the new unified stormwater rule.
I mean people have compared it to love canal, it is so polluted and the New York City is the number one polluter right now by dumping raw sewage into the canal, Hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage on an annual basis in violation of the Clean Water Act. So I'm, just wondering there's been talk of this unified stormwater rule.
I definitely appreciate the information that you shared tonight about the modeling work that you've done on how the stormwater rule would work in Gowanus, but I still have questions on how we will know if it's working, if it's just a model, so.
We need them to do their utmost to manage their stormwater on-site to send us the minimal amount that they need to send us and, as we redevelop property in the city, That's exactly what you're going to get from this unified stormwater rule and that will be borne by the private sector and the private development will have to pay those costs.
We like to manage those school yards in a way that the agreement with the trust for public land and the city of New York is that they'll allow for the custodians to have overtime and to continue to allow the community to access the park amenities, but for the private sector sites we're not going to insist on that type of access.
I. Think I would just highlight some things that I would you know related, but also very unrelated to the specific you know, rule per se, but this came up a number of times early on in our planning process in the working groups and elsewhere about you, know, What's the where the benefits of a neighborhood study.
You know, If you look at the surrounding communities in park, slope, Wormhill, Carol, Gardens, that's where the sewage is coming into the canal and through new development in this role, we'll be able to make it cleaner.
And please answer the question about that- was brought up at the Cag meeting last night about the constrictions in that bond, street, sewer that run under public place site and how that's going to be managed.
So we're looking at with all of that spending, combined about an 83 reduction in combined sewer overflows and with the new long-term control, plans, also, the current capital projects that we would like to implement.
This I was taking some notes, but I'm, not clear in the presentation how the unified stormwater rule projections take into account the retention tanks that are going to be built in the city.
You know, I appreciate our back and forth on this for the past couple years, as it relates to this particular comment, question on the stormwater rule and infrastructure catching up.
You know I think, frankly, The. What we're showing here is that the new development is part of that infrastructure, and that's not just the case for housing has infrastructure, but.
So, the new developments from at least the sewer stormwater point of view is part of that infrastructure, and so I think this phased approach, I'm not quite seeing the connection there.
We've done a lot of analysis on this and set the rule up so that we know it's possible for every developer to meet the requirements on the property that the stormwater is falling on, and that really is in the best interest of the city for water quality objectives when a developer builds or tries to comply with their requirements using an off-site location, It's not always in their control.
You can't do a site-level practice like a rain garden, You are required to do a green roof and then, Whatever is left over, You are required to manage in a tank with a new release rate that significantly slows that water, down, Great, thanks.
I think what we're going to do is run down the list of people who are up when I started talking, and we can also, as we know that last time write, us.
Well, you know, As far as the New York City Green infrastructure program.
We have over 200 parks that we've partnered with them on with over 40 constructed sites where we've gone in and comprehensively retrofitted, the properties to manage stormwater and, in some cases, we're able to direct some right-of-way flow into those to take even more storm water out of the system.
