And we're going to need to do it by raising revenue on the state level, which means raising taxes and really to fix all of our budget shortfalls that be on the city level that be on the state level or that be for the MTA.
And I just want to bring that to all of your attention, because that may have gotten drowned out by the other big news today, which is, as you may know, our governor and our mayor hate one another and refuse to work together at any moment, and because of that.
We've already put out some stuff, some really great things from Yale University that have guides for folks to work with their young children at home, for literacy and to learn to read as well as other supports for families who are struggling with remote learning and their children were struggling with remote, learning.
We appreciate her taking the time to come and and tell us what she knows about tomorrow's school closing.
I do want to explain that even when the schools are open, the preponderance of time, children are remote.
And I think it's very important to understand that they are going to school.
We have ordered more technology, not me personally, but the department of Ed had ordered a hundred thousand Wi-Fi enabled lap iPads and, as these are trickling in and they're coming in small pieces principals and their Aps will be going to the schools and distributing them to families as they come.
I know I believe is in CB6, and one of my schools in Sunset Park also will close for two weeks.
Schools have given out devices that are chromebooks, as you know, but the families don't have Wi-Fi and in the initial Covid-19 outbreak there were companies that were giving out free Wi-Fi. We, have, however, at the Department of education been very graciously given a donation of hot spots, and we are in the.
You just make sure to you, know chime in we as a school city, the city as a whole, put in a proposal to the state and within that proposal, a three percent.
And I just want us to reiterate that their remote learning is happening to everybody in the school system.
And again they were talking about evolution and the way the teacher was teaching them to write, critical thinking and to take notes was extraordinary and was a skill that they will use throughout their lives in college and high school, incredible skill, and just the level of the articles.
It's, not perfect, but I will tell you one last thing that I think is important: every school in district 15, but across the city, is reaching out to every single child.
The same time, I know that there are people who very much want their children back in school as quickly as possible.
And I think most people do and we are going to do the best we can in all directions.
I'm, certainly not the mayor, but what we're going to do is make sure whatever happens, we're going to support our teachers and our kids and our families in the best way that we can.
You should know that the food services people are providing Thanksgiving dinners in a frozen form, so families can take them home and heat them up, which I think is incredible and very kind.
We are then now going to move on to the elections committee Jason, if you're here, if you can just facilitate, if there's anybody that wants to make I believe this is the time for nominations from the floor for officers for 2021, so Jason, whatever you've got to say.
I just wanted to acknowledge that another area where you know we've been working hard to kind of minimize.
As you know, people who live in proximity, obviously with the school closing down the immediate effect of that, might be minimized, but it is.
I know you have a busy agenda, but if you want to have me, take questions, I'm, certainly happy to do.
Now that we'll go back into session in January and it will be an interesting beginning of session, I'm, not quite sure how that will happen, but I think that it's pretty clear that we'll be working remotely more than not this legislative session.
Obviously, the number of people out there at the Gowanus dredging, where we actually are doing the beginnings of dredging, the main channel of the Gowanus canal and a lot of thanks, are due to you know the congresswoman, who really led that fight to the EPA, which has created this community advisory group process and supported it.
It really is the largest and most engaged community advisory group for a Superfund project in the entire country, and that is really a testament to all the community members and the organizations that have consistently stayed with that Cag process through some difficult times and some confusing times and really required everybody to learn an awful lot, and you know, I am just very proud of all the community members that have really worked so hard and been so engaged in that community advisory group process and who are showing no signs of letting up.
Those are often the first to go, but psych beds are also departments that you know, hospitals feel they can can eliminate, and so we don't want that to happen in the future.
Just I want to thank Superintendent Scott for her presentation, which was you know very hopeful.
Our meetings are recorded and uploaded on our YouTube page, so I know, there's been more interest for whatever reason: I guess, due to being locked in that people want to see the meetings and things like that they are on our YouTube agent.
You know, if you have a community issue that you want me to include in that feel free to email me at Mike, Bkcd6.
So we're going to start by hearing from Tai who I want to thank for being so actively involved in the meetings with the city on this.
Him stands in front of all of you and introduces you to a long list of items for the first time and asks you for a yes vote, and we want to turn this into an ongoing proactive review from a small working group made up of board members.
We want this to be a working group so that it's so that its door remains open to any board member who is interested at any time.
Perfect well, I do want to give a huge shout out to Tai who has been incredible in this process in terms of fact, finding putting to identifying other materials and ways to prioritize so, but just to kind of put a little bit of context, because you have seen these lists in the past, but we need to back up into a planning document and.
You know we have to address some of those immediate needs and the other thing I just really want to implore this community board and raise your sensitivity to is.
Several of these do have to do with Covid-19, and so you'll see a request for mobile and pop-up testing for not just this year, but in the future we know that peaks are going to require even more active and flexible testing.
I know, I, think fiscal year going into fiscal year, 2020, and I'm not sure.
I, think we're going to be chiming in more regularly like that and submitting testimony and those sorts of things.
And this that committee, this committee should embrace that the year-round process involves not just these submissions, but once the draft once the proposals start coming back from the mayor's office and City Council, there are opportunities for hearings and for responses and that's where, and that typically happens between February and April, and then they start, you know making the sausage and the like.
I guess I would love to hear some fact-finding if possible around what services are being offered so that we can make sure that people in the district know where to go, what to do and what the gaps are.
We're going to presume that this is approved and again I thank Rick and Ty, and the committee for all of their great work.
And I'm, encouraged by the fact that the city has been so instructive in terms of trying to reform our approach, so that you know, perhaps we can actually be asking for things that we have a chance of getting.
Any any comments on this you're going to have to speak up because I only probably only look, I thought we wanted larger pavers in general, rather than these small tiles.
A motion in support of resilient red hooks resolution asking for Van Brunt street to be removed from the New York City Truck route map resilient red hook is co-chaired by our colleague, Hildegard link.
A resilient red hook, resolution asking for Van Brunt street to be removed from New York City's truck route map, as I mentioned before Hildegard link, our colleague on the board is the chair.
They have been grappling with this issue of truck traffic on Van Brunt street for some time and approached the board with a request of a letter of support to their resolution, which asked the Department of transportation to remove the designation of Van brunt as a truck route.
Actually I believe, passed a resolution asking the EDC and port authority to allow truck access in and out of the container port facility, which is what the resilient red hook folks have proposed.
We, also included in that in the resolution, a reiteration of our previous motion from several years ago to ask for access through the container port and also, as would include in that a request to look at truck access on the eastern part of red hook, including the possibility of remapping hallux street as an alternative to Bay Street, which is a current truck route.
Really trying to work with thoughtful groups like brazilian red hook and others, and, having said that, I'm interested to hear how the mapping makes this a safer issue for red hook, especially specifically Van brunt, without a alternative.
But, if that's not available, I, just feel that it's premature to De-map a truck route which has historically been a tool for truck drivers and others using the street to know what they're up against in a mixed-use community like red hook and words in the proposal such as incompatible or compatible.
I know, there's a lot of things happening on Van, Brunt and in red hook, but unless we have a discussion on the studies and alternatives that are, the city is readily able to make available de-mapping, it just seems like it's a premature and dangerous route to take as a community board, because there are people who are going to rely on that map to know how to navigate red hook.
Speed limits, I think that we can look at other ways of minimizing the issues that residents are having in red hook without causing more confusion and trucks, perhaps navigating through other streets that are really not meant for trucks, vision.
So I think that most people in red hook know the issues that we face as businesses, already.
Think d mapping is just not a way for us, as businesses and truck drivers to be able to better help make the community a safer place.
You read the actual motion from the community board because I think that's.
Not, d-Map Van brunt street without having an alternative, especially for the West side of red hook, and the waterfront.
Six endorses resilient red hook's request for a letter of support to Nycdot, asking that Van Brunt street be delisted as a truck route, and the letter will present alternative proposals for truck access to future.
Last mile warehouse, facilities, including, for example, our past motion requesting truck access through the container port from Hamilton Avenue, as well as an exploration of truck route, alternatives on the eastern end of red hook, such as the potential remapping of Hallucks Street.
And I do think it allows us to try to push D.O.T a little bit on the need for a comprehensive truck study for red hook, which has to be done.
Definitely think that this is a good idea, but I also want to make sure that I would like to make a motion actually to add to the resolution that we would like to make sure that those alternatives do not include Columbia, Street or Richard, Street or other streets that go by NYCHA.
I also want to highlight that as part of the the community needs, we did request that trucking study, specifically because of these new last mile facilities, but yeah to reiterate.
I would like to move to include that we do not support moving that truck route to certain other streets that are also in residential areas.
I just want to add one thing, as some of us who've been around long enough know that even if you take Van Brunt street off the truck route, the regulations will allow truckers to still continue using Yup street as to go down on them, because once they're off a truck route and the destination they're going to is not on a truck route.
If we can get Conover Street in the port authority to do what they should have done when the container port was first opened years, ago, so I think it's important that we, yes, we eliminated trucks from Van Brunt Street, but we make sure that we provide that alternative.
Don't know how many years long after I'm, serving on the board, it'll work.
Trucks, going to the new ups facility will take full advantage of on the port and trucks coming to the new Goldman Sachs facility will enter red hook this way and in that way, not involving Van Brunt street at all.
I'm, not going to say no to what you're saying here, but I think it has to be put into the motion.
I. Think if you're, not speaking, can I ask you to please mute because we're getting a little feedback from some people.
I was also agreeing with the point that you have to look at it as a whole neighborhood and that you don't want all of the trucks to be coming off of down onto West, 9Th, Street or down onto into Carroll Gardens.
So I think that if we pass this and approve it, what we're asking for is that the city and the port authority work together to one open, up, Conover Street, and then we can talk about the d mapping.
You know with the schools in our district and if any parents are having any troubles or having any questions they can reach out to me or my colleague Laura, who works on all our our school issues and we'll do our best to help you out we're hearing in regards to Covid-19 tests that there are really long, lines: city Mds throughout the district, we're still hearing good things about New, York, City, Health and hospital sites, and you can get an appointment online and I.
I just wanted to highlight that in that meeting you know we highlighted the fact that ups had agreed to study truck routes as a good neighbor gesture to help fund it and we're looking for a DOT interest in collaborating on that.
