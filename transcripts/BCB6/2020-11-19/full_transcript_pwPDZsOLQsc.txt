I mean we have 53 participants, I have but I. Obviously that includes people who aren't members, so are you taking names? Yeah I count, 25 board members, Peter I was just about this. I was just about to say we have 25 and what's the total count on board members? Well, it's not going to be more than 50, so we need I, think we're I think we are technically a quorum. Yeah, we'll just need one more, but we will call all right. We might as well at least begin with the the people that are a couple of people that are going to speak so that we can let them go to wherever else they need to go. First of all, welcome I'm Peter Fleming, the chair of Community Board, six, I'm going to apologize in advance. I'm waiting for an important phone call, so I may have to temporarily drop off, at least from a volume point of view. So if that happens, you know or Mike can take over and call on people until I'm able to come back. It shouldn't. Take me very long. Unfortunately, she was supposed to call 25 minutes ago and didn't so anyway. We we're going to begin first with our two speakers, we're going to hear from Assemblyman Carol and then we're going to hear from Anita Scoop from the city, school, local, school district, 15 superintendent, and then then we'll go on to our regular business, so Bobby. If you want to start sure good evening, Community Board six. Thank you, Peter I hope everyone is well and safe. Just two quick things before I get to schools, which I think is probably on every single person's mind. I do want to mention that earlier today the MTA board announced a doomsday budget for 2021 and it really is a doomsday budget. It is 40 cuts in service that have already been cut tremendously of our buses and subways as well as almost 10,000 layoffs. This would be catastrophic, to say the least. If this were to happen and were to be implemented, the cuts would go into effect this spring, just as the Covid-19 vaccines are supposed to be rolled out just when we might start be able to really revive our schools, our economy, our lives. This would I fear, break the back of many New Yorkers and many businesses. This can not happen and the only way to stop that is to bring tremendous resources to the MTA and the way we do that. Well, we're going to need them to borrow from the Fed window, which they can do we're going to need federal assistance which hopefully is coming either in the Heroes act or when a Biden administration happens and we're going to need to do it by raising revenue on the state level, which means raising taxes and really to fix all of our budget shortfalls that be on the city level that be on the state level or that be for the MTA. We're going to need all three of those we're going to need federal assistance, we're going to need the state to raise revenue and we're going to have to figure out how to borrow money and possibly also make some smart cuts. But that's a huge thing. Please reach out to your local assembly, member state, senator and your local Congress member, and we have a great congressional delegation here in Brooklyn I, see Dan Wiley from Congresswoman Velazquez's offices on Congresswoman Clarke, who is my congressperson Congressmember Nadler. We have a whole host of folks and we, of course, have Chuck Schumer who lives in community board six. We need all of them to bring their forces to bear so that we don't have that doomsday scenario and I just want to bring that to all of your attention, because that may have gotten drowned out by the other big news today, which is, as you may know, our governor and our mayor hate one another and refuse to work together at any moment, and because of that, our schools are closing tomorrow, and that is really unfortunate. The second Covid-19 wave is real and I. Don't want to pretend that we shouldn't take it very seriously, but it is crazy to me that we are closing our schools first before we close indoor, dining or gyms before we try every effort to keep this critical resource open. That is a lifeline to so many children, so many families, and so many in our community, and so this closure is going into effect. I hope it will be as short as possible because we are able to work as a city in a state to flatten and lower that curve, and so we're able to reopen our schools but I do want to be clear right. Our schools had a 0.2 Covid-19 positivity rate out of 140,000 tests. We know from the science that the reason for the uptick is because of people gathering in homes, gathering in restaurants and dining halls and wedding halls and other locations. It was not because of our schools, and so I really wish that our governor and our mayor and others could have worked together to figure out how to make smart closures and smart policies and smart enforcement so that we didn't have to close this most critical resource, and so tomorrow we're going to be putting out. We've already put out some stuff, some really great things from Yale University that have guides for folks to work with their young children at home, for literacy and to learn to read as well as other supports for families who are struggling with remote learning and their children were struggling with remote learning. But that's all I've got to say now. Happy Thanksgiving, please be safe. Please try to distance. If anybody has a pressing question, I'd love to try to answer it, but I don't want to monopolize too much time. Thanks Bobby we're pleased that Anita Scott, the district 15 superintendent was able to join us at the last minute. We appreciate her taking the time to come and and tell us what she knows about tomorrow's school closing. So I'm going to introduce her now and thank her again for coming in at the last minute and just remind her that she has to unmute before she speaks. Thank you Peter for reminding me to unmute. I really do appreciate it. So, first of all, I want to tell you that our schools are prepared from the get-go. We have always planned for any eventuality because we are concerned, we don't we didn't know in which direction we would go and, as our assembly members said, it is a political decision and it's based on a decision that is certainly not in my hands and consequently, what is in my hands is ensuring that our children are going to get the best possible support that they can get whether they are remote or not. I do want to explain that even when the schools are open, the preponderance of time, children are remote and I think it's very important to understand that they are going to school. Some kids are going to school five days a week and I will explain who some kids are going to school two days a week. Some kids are going to school one day, one week two days the next week. All of that is contingent on a number of things. It is contingent upon the following the very carefully following the CDC rules about social distancing, the number of students and teachers that can be together in a room and also to ensure that we have sufficient teachers and support for our kids. So those have a real impact. That's why we have what we call cohorts of two cohorts where the kids go two days a week and three cohorts where it's smaller groups, and it depends on the number of kids in a school and the number of kids whose parents have chosen blended learning. So what is going to happen? Well, we've been remote before we were certainly remote last spring and we're much better prepared. Now we have every school has a digital curriculum. It has materials that are online that are ready to go for our students. They have instructional packets that are going home to the students who may have limited technology, and we have been preparing for this for a while prince. We are also in the process of getting more technology. We have ordered more technology, not me personally, but the department of Ed had ordered a hundred thousand Wi-Fi enabled lap iPads and, as these are trickling in and they're coming in small pieces principals and their Aps will be going to the schools and distributing them to families as they come in. Ironically, they were supposed to start coming in this week. So, but what are we doing for the kids? Who don't have technology? One of the things that we're doing is that we are giving them what I'm calling grab-and-go bags, which are in fact, materials. Reading books supplies that workbooks things that they can take with them and work on whether they have technology or not. Some of our children, who don't have an iPad, will literally call in on their mother's phone, but this enables them to be part of the lesson and part of the learning. We have teachers who have prepared wonderful, online lessons and wonderful online support and we are ensuring that they have the supports that they need and that they have put them in place most of our schools. Virtually all of them use a platform called Google classroom and by now people are much more comfortable with it than they were in the spring. It's not perfect. Nothing is ever perfect and of course we want our kids to be with us and to teach them face to face, but we are going to do the best that we can under any circumstance and I'm happy to answer any questions for Anita hang on. One second sure thank you for being here. Do you have any indication that district 15 schools were a source of community transmission? I will tell you I can only give you anecdotal evidence on anything because I don't have data, you have to speak to what's called the situation room or the central office about that and I can explain what the situation room is, but I will tell you that, unfortunately, what I have noticed over the past week and a half to ten days is that there has been an increasing number of cases called in schools. Unfortunately, one of my two of my schools, whether we closed tomorrow or not, were closed for two weeks already. Ps 29, which I know I believe is in CB6, and one of my schools in Sunset Park also will close for two weeks already. So this is not done lightly. This is done when there are serious number of cases in a school. I can not say to you that we've seen like just enormous numbers, but we've seen a significant rise in the numbers over the past 10 days. Thank you, Peter. Somebody wanted to know on the chat. If we have any sense of how many people don't have technology, I can take a stab at it, but I, don't think I can't say to you how accurate I am. Let me look something up hold on I come prepared, and we appreciate that. It's my pleasure, okay, one more. Let me see if that's the one I was looking for as a total across of all of district 15, we have applied for 3,000 pieces of technology. 3,000 iPads part of the problem is not it's not the iPad, it's the Wi-Fi we have given out. Schools have given out devices that are chromebooks, as you know, but the families don't have Wi-Fi and in the initial Covid-19 outbreak there were companies that were giving out free Wi-Fi, that's not the case anymore. We have, however, at the Department of education been very graciously given a donation of hot spots, and we are in the we've applied for those as well and so we're in the process of getting those and giving those out in addition to the iPads that are coming great. Thank you. Bridget did you have a question? Yeah I, don't have a question, I'm just going to one I wanna. You know thank Anita for her leadership with district 15. It's amazing the amount of work she has put in terms of cleanup and getting the schools ready and I give her a lot of commendation. I just wanted to just reiterate and Anita. Can you just make sure to you know chime in we as a school city, the city as a whole, put in a proposal to the state and within that proposal, a three percent? If there was a three percent rise in cases of Covid-19, that was that caused the shutdown of in-person learning? There is learning remotely and I just want us to reiterate that their remote learning is happening to everybody in the school system and I I'd like if Anita can chime in on what I'm saying. Absolutely I'm really happy to talk to that, because the teachers are doing a yeoman's job and I am going to tell you an anecdote. A couple of anecdotes, so I had the privilege today of visiting four classrooms across our middle schools and the classrooms that I visited were remote classrooms and the learning that was going on there. The ownership of the learning was just extraordinary if I may describe to you one classroom, which was a sixth grade, math classroom, the kids were commenting on the way problems were developed and it was not the teacher just saying this is how you do this. The teacher put up two different solutions to a problem by the way very cute, very engaging for young students, and she said- which one do you think, is the better solution and to listen to those young. First year middle school kids, who had adjusted to remote learning, who had adjusted to middle school. Remember they started middle school in the middle of a pandemic was extraordinary. They were comfortable, they were engaged, it's not perfect everywhere, but believe me, your children are learning they're learning. Every day there then I went to see a science lesson in another school and again they were talking about evolution and the way the teacher was teaching them to write, critical thinking and to take notes was extraordinary and was a skill that they will use throughout their lives in college and high school, incredible skill and just the level of the articles. She had an article on evolution and they were breaking into small groups and she had geared it for three different reading levels, but she did not say group a you're doing the easy level group b, you're doing the middle level in group c, you're doing the hard level she put it out there for all of them. She said you make the determination, please everybody start with article number two, and if you find that you have a little trouble, you can go to article number one or if you find that you finished it and you'd like a little more challenge, you can go to article number three. There was absolute student ownership of learning. There was remarkable teaching going on and then the last one I'm going to talk to you about is a first year, English teacher, again sixth grade because today saw sixth grade, and this young woman was teaching them the concept of motif and theme. Using initially, she had used the three pigs that was part of what they had done and then today they talked about Moana and the kids were able to relate to things that they knew to glean a concept and they were arguing with each other and determining, and then they broke into small groups and to watch our children in small groups without a teacher I was a fly on. The wall was remarkable because I will remember that one little girl hazel, was a child who took charge immediately. He was in charge and she was just pushing the group along and they were working and she was. It was really fun to see so I want to give kudos to the teachers. I just finished. Writing them notes. It's so funny before I came to the meeting, but I also want to say something about the other teachers. There are teachers who are working and who are doing great things and doing more than they should have to do and they're doing them it willingly and with a kind heart because they care about kids. It isn't that the kids won't get learning, they will get learning. We are making sure that our kids are touched by learning. We have asynchronous curriculums where they can go in, they can read an article, they can respond, they can write. There are little videos that they can watch that are supported. The kids who do not have Wi-Fi. The kids who do not have devices are kids who are being supported with materials. The teachers have put together what I called as I said earlier, grab-and-go bags, because truthfully, what I'm concerned about is the families that don't have things in the house that we take for granted, such as crayons or scissors or glue, or things like that, and so those are being included. Reading books are being included. We we're trying very hard to support everything. I noticed in the chat somebody asked about food services and food is going to be provided. So that's something that's going to continue. The food people are coming to the schools and they will provide food and we we're trying our best I. You know that I'm trying to be absolutely honest with you. It's not perfect, but I will tell you one last thing that I think is important: every school in district 15, but across the city, is reaching out to every single child to make sure they're. Okay, there is nobody who is falling through the cracks. We have families that have been called in other states. I can tell you a very funny story. We have kids who have graduated pre-K two years ago, but through some kind of a glitch they're still on the pre-k roster, and so we've been tracking them down to make sure that they're in school and that we can then take them off the rosters. We would love to all go back to 2019 in September and have our kids five days a week. We would love to do that. Everybody wants to do that. We are going to make the best out of a difficult situation and we are going to prioritize keeping our kids safe and that's all we can do so. Thank you. Anita I really appreciate it. I have a question for Anita Hi Anita. Thank you for attending tonight. The question is there any direction or sense of direction? How long this temporary shutdown will be, and also because it's right before Thanksgiving, so it's going to go through the given holidays spoke today. He said definitely through Thanksgiving. So that's tomorrow and Friday, which is two days and then three days next week, which is five days, are definite I, don't know, what's going to happen after Thanksgiving, I'm sure we'll find out he reiterated today and as did the chancellor, that this is a temporary shutdown. So we just have to wait and see. I know that there are families that have real concerns about the holidays and travel and that's I'm sure something that will be taken into consideration. At the same time, I know that there are people who very much want their children back in school as quickly as possible and I think most people do and we are going to do the best we can in all directions. I'm obviously I'm not the chancellor, I'm certainly not the mayor, but what we're going to do is make sure whatever happens, we're going to support our teachers and our kids and our families in the best way that we can and if I can tell you just one little tiny thing that doesn't really have to do with academics, but has to do with the way people are thinking of things just so. You should know that the food services people are providing Thanksgiving dinners in a frozen form, so families can take them home and heat them up, which I think is incredible and very kind hearted yeah. So it's a really good another Anita. Just one more question, I'm sorry, of course you know you can ask as many as you'd like yeah the school in Sunset, Park I heard a few parents. They had emailed and called what's the procedure once the school shuts down like they were concerned about. How do they clean you know what happens before and are they? Are the parents informed of what the procedure absolutely parents have been informed of the cleaning procedures, but sometimes we've had meetings. The Ccs had meetings, schools have had meetings, we've had the custodians explain, but it's a process. It had there's special sprays that are used special chemicals that are used to wipe things down, that's done every night and when they do when they closed a school and I want to reiterate what Taro said, the schools did not have very high rates of students getting infected or teachers getting affected. It is about still about this deep cleaning. If you'd like week, I can arrange for you to have Joe Lazarus come and talk to you about how it's done, because I'm again I'm novice at this, but they did they. Definitely they have this spray cleaner tank, cleaner that they wear that they spray and they wipe it down, especially they do all the hard surfaces and the bathrooms they keep. Also schools when they're open, keep windows open. Yesterday I got complaints that some of the schools are too cold and they were now talking now that we're going into winter weather that, how do you balance keeping the windows somewhat open and keeping the heat going, and they would there's a protocol for that? So all of those are things that are taken into consideration because you have to make it accessible and clean and there are masks in the schools. There are sanitary hand sanitizer. All schools have all of those things all of them. Okay, we're going to move on. Thank you very much Anita for being here. We appreciate the information. Perhaps the education committee can have somebody you know come in to talk about the cleaning. That might be something for a future meeting of theirs and we appreciate that offer so we're going to move on. Thank you again, Anita just sure. Just for information we're we are sponsored. We are not sponsoring. That's the wrong word to use. We are facilitating a meeting tomorrow with the department of City planning to talk about the the so-called public place site, they're, going to tell us a little bit about some of their plans, and that is going to be a zoom meeting that we're facilitating. We are not the sponsors of that meeting. It is not our meeting. City planning is responsible for the content of that. So please direct any comments or complaints. You have about that. To them, but we are zoom confidence. Yes, we're a conduit, we're just offering our technology to them because we have it set up and we know how to communicate with everyone. So I encourage you. If you're interested in hearing more about the plans for that site, you know we will Mike. Maybe you can post in the chat the link or as well for people that want to know, but we're you know we're just the facilitators and you know making it easier for them to be in touch with the people in the in the community Board district. So we are then now going to move on to the elections committee Jason, if you're here, if you can just facilitate, if there's anybody that wants to make I believe this is the time for nominations from the floor for officers for 2021, so Jason, whatever you've got to say. Please say it yeah, so I know that 2020 feels like it's about three years long, but it has been a year since we elected our exec board. So last week's meeting I mentioned that if you were interested in running for the exec board or wanted to nominate somebody to email Mike, so I'm going to kick now to Mike to see. Did we receive any nominations we did? It was all for. Thank you Jason. It was all for the current slate of officers we received I, think like 23 or something like that, which is Peter as Chair Eric as first Vice Chair Jerry Armour at Eric, Mcclure, first Vice, Chair, Jerry armour, as second vice chair, Karen Broughton, as board Secretary and Tom Miskul, who I believe is calling in right now as board treasurer. This is just last number meeting. If anyone so now, you'd have to nominate from the floor. If not our current slate gets next year. So does anybody have a nomination to make either unmute yourself and speak, and this is only board members that can do this or put it are posted in the chat. I think we are hearing none. Then that means we will not have an election in December. The current board has been has been reelected and we'll move on from there. We're going to do the things in a slightly different order, because Rachel has to leave so she is going to give the Peter once I think Joanne Simon just jumped on okay Joanne. If you want to say something, I'm not sure I can't see everybody before we move on. Remember you have to unmute. Oh okay, Joey we're not hearing you so we're going to move on to state Senator, Brian Cavanaugh and then, if you're having any technology problems. Just let us now. Can you hear me my aunt? Yes, perfect? Thank you very much. Congratulations to the re-elected among you! I also was recently re-elected. So you know, I share your. You know your enthusiasm about re-upping for another term I, just a few brief updates. I'll. Just briefly, you know: I was here when Bobby Carroll spoke about. You know, situation with the schools. You know I just want to say that I don't want to be in the business of second guessing our public health authorities and the executive officials that have to make those decisions. There are hard choices, but just to acknowledge that it's a very difficult news for a lot of our families- and you know we really do have to work to you- know- redouble our efforts to make sure that we're supporting students struggling with making remote learning work while they're facing so many other challenges, and you know I, it's good I know our local district really is working very hard on that and all of our teachers. But you know it's I just wanted to acknowledge that another area where you know we've been working hard to kind of minimize Covid-19 impact as I think I've spoken with all of you in the past about his housing, just an update there. We have one of the main tools we've had at our disposal to minimize the impact of Covid-19 on housing. Stability has been the eviction moratorium. We had called for a blanket more term to be in place and such a Morgan was in place for much of the pandemic. There is a bit of a loosening of that. The most recent executive order from the governor, combined with the court's interpretation of those leaves open the possibility of some evictions happening during the pandemic. I think that's a terrible mistake. We've been pushing the governor to clarify, and you know, tighten that up and at the same time absent that I really do think it is important for the legislature to step in and make it. You know complete more time. It's just among the many activities that we shouldn't be engaging in during the pandemic is putting people out of their homes against their will. You know with their families and their possessions. So again it's there are still many protections in place. You know we passed something called the tenant Safe Harbor Act, which makes it such that rent you are unable to pay during the pandemic because of hardship can never be the basis for an eviction not just during this period, but really ever even if you end up with arrears and we've also been pushing very hard for our rent relief package, we did a small pack, a small bill for very low income people that has had a modest effect, but we've been looking for I know. Bobby also talked about the need for Bella for the MTA. We also need going to need large amounts of money to address the housing situation. We've been looking for about 10 billion dollars from the federal government for that that's about 100 times the 100 million dollar program that we've already implemented, which was also funded with federal money. But you know it's an ongoing battle, but short term. Really we do need to make sure the moratorium is put back in place and I again, I've got legislation to do that, as does my colleagues Eleanor Myery, who has a you know a bill that would accomplish that statutorily as well a few other items. Just briefly we you know, we've been monitoring the Hicks Street project, the retaining wall, and you know, we've had lots of complaints, including some comments from the local school and we've been working on monitoring the noise as it affects the school as well. As you know, people who live in proximity, obviously with the school closing down the immediate effect of that, might be minimized, but it is. We are trying to make sure that project you know is not unduly burdensome and we had gotten some assurances from the DOT about noise monitoring and mitigation, and some of that didn't seem to have the intended effect. So we continue we're continuing to monitor the situation and push for that broader. You know that's part of the BQE effort we Joanne Simon I hope she does get on and you can hear from her directly, but we've been pushing for a couple of bills on that. One is to give the city the power to do a real overweight truck enforcement on that a lot of the need for the renovations of the BQE come from excessive weight, heavy trucks and it's very difficult to enforce. So we've we're trying to authorize the city to do a modern in motion enforcement system that will allow effectively to weigh the trucks with sensors embedded in this in the roadway and issue fines, we're hoping as soon as we're back in legislature that we can get that passed and get this and the city can get that program up and running. We've also, you know longer term looking for some for a broader kind of authority to address the you know, the huge construction needs along that entire corridor. Just brief, a little piece of good News and I see Dan, Wiley and I. Think some of our other folks are congressional offices here. But you know it is good news that it was. It's been announced that the two split tolling in the verrazano is going to take effect on December 1st and that will prevent lots of traffic from being driven unnecessarily up the BQE and across Manhattan. So it's great for congestion, and you know the environment and traffic and also you know the maintenance of our roadways and it's been long coming. But you know that's a little minor piece of good news at a very tough time. I mean not it's significant, it's at all right, but relative to you know the global pandemic we're facing. Obviously you know we understand that it's a hard time to be thinking about. You know the positive I think I think I'll stop there. We are work continuing to work to make sure to do what we can to contain a Covid-19. We do continue to distribute you know, PPE, masks and sanitizer and other materials to people as needed. So if there are organizations that you know of that need those we are happy to. You know try to provide those things. I'm happy to take questions. I know you have a busy agenda, but if you want to have me take questions, I'm certainly happy to do it. Anyone, okay, great I, think Joanne Simon has now joined us. So Joanne. If you want to say a few words that'd be gone. Fine remember to unmute, please thank you. I will do that. I was apparently signed in under my staff member's name, and so they didn't know it was me so thank you Brian and yes, we are working on the the truckway issue, which has direct implications for the triple cantilever. But, as you know what happens, there ends up backing up into the trench and very much as an issue for CB6 as well as CB2, and we're trying to move that. You know I had delusions that we might go back into session. This fall. We have not been told that won't happen, but we have not been. We really don't know whether it will- and that was something that I was trying to get passed if possible this year, because it really does impact the roadway and it's the truck weights are our problems. But the speed is a problem when we had less traffic because of reduced traffic because of the Covid-19. So all in all, we need to do it. I expect that we will go back into session in January if we're not back in November December, which November is pretty much gone. Now that we'll go back into session in January and it will be an interesting beginning of session, I'm not quite sure how that will happen, but I think that it's pretty clear that we'll be working remotely more than not this legislative session and it'll, be. You know, we'll be reporting back on how that goes a couple of things locally. Obviously, the number of people out there at the Gowanus dredging, where we actually are doing the beginnings of dredging, the main channel of the Gowanus canal and a lot of thanks, are due to you know the congresswoman, who really led that fight to the EPA, which has created this community advisory group process and supported it all along. It really is the largest and most engaged community advisory group for a Superfund project in the entire country, and that is really a testament to all the community members and the organizations that have consistently stayed with that Cag process through some difficult times and some confusing times and really required everybody to learn an awful lot, and you know I am just very proud of all the community members that have really worked so hard and been so engaged in that community advisory group process and who are showing no signs of letting up. You know I'm confident that our community will continue to be at the table and you know engaging in it. You know in a very a robust way, with the EPA through this process, and so it was a really nice thing to be at the other day and I'm just I can't believe we're there. You know it's been 10 years, we're actually there it'll be longer, but you know we're much farther along than many of us ever anticipated and even throughout Covid-19 and through changes of administration. So that's a good thing. Recently I was out at New York Presbyterian Methodist, with Naisna the New York nurses and some Brad and Bobby, and the burp president to really call on them to reopen psych beds. One of the things we're finding as a result of Covid-19 is that hospitals are relocating their psych beds. Sometimes, to you know, Westchester, for example, we don't have enough sight beds. You know, certainly through the a major crisis we needed many more Covid-19 units and while we are seeing an uptick, we are finding that there are advances in treatment, but people you know who need psychiatric care. Are those people are going to end up on the street they're going to end up sick with Covid-19 and Covid-19? Is causing so much emotional distress, and so what we really need are more beds, not fewer, and, as you know, there were 50 beds at Methodist, which they say they are bringing back and we are encouraging them very strongly to bring them back sooner than later. I also want to just mention that one of the bills I have is a hospital closure bill which would really revamp how it is that a hospital could close or close certain departments, and it would require a really specific as very specific requirements for community engagement in assessing what that community need is for their hospital, because too often what we see is the hospital makes a proposal to the state and the state really doesn't engage in any way, and we could be. This is what happened at litch when they tried to kill the Maternity Department of Pediatrics. Those are often the first to go, but psych beds are also departments that you know, hospitals feel they can can eliminate, and so we don't want that to happen in the future. So I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to get it passed because you know we're seeing more and more, particularly as we go through this pandemic. The need for our health care facilities to be at the ready and to be serving the people based on the needs that they actually have and I just want to just I want to thank Superintendent Scott for her presentation, which was you know very hopeful. I share many of the concerns that people have with regard to the schools and the the rate of infection that our schools are showing. I really am one of those people who believe that we should have number one started with our youngest kids and our kids with disabilities as we reopen the schools and that we really should be targeting these closures much more specifically, I. I'm not happy that the schools are now closing because of an overall infection rate when our schools have been the safest places for our kids to be as it's turned out. So you know that's a decision that the mayor has made, and everybody will be. You know following that, but I am concerned about it and and that's about it unless people have specific questions, those are I don't want to babble on for too long, but I do want to wish everybody a very happy thanksgiving and a very safe thanksgiving. So thank you so much thanks, Joanna I appreciate. We appreciate it again. I think we're going to go out of order and we're going to take Rachel from permits and licenses, because she has to leave us a little bit early. So we're going to ask her to make a report on her motion all right. Thank you. So we had one applicant at our meeting last month, the we did have quorum and it is for terrace restaurant Bk. It was up for a second just a second I'm having a little difference. No, it's okay! It was there! Well, it's going to be it's where the blue ribbon. Restaurant was next to Calexico on Fifth Avenue, between Garfield and first street they're going to be a. They call themselves a diner continental restaurant. They. This is a owner that has a lot of experience with restaurants. They they're they also operate grand canyon bistro, which is at 300 skirmahorn and another restaurant in on third Avenue, seven in third avenue, somewhere in Brooklyn as well, so they this is going to be their third restaurant, that they are going to operate, so they have experience with restaurants and and they want to open here. We had no real issues with their application. They had done all the proper notifications and postings and the motion was unanimously approved, so I guess we have an opportunity for anybody to make comments if they wish, either by posting them in the chat or on muting yourself and speaking members. Only again, please, okay, hearing none! What I'm going to ask is that I'm going to presume that you're in favor of this motion, unless you indicate in the chat that you are not and then we'll count the nose just to make it a little bit simpler. So again, if you are against this motion, please post so in the chat, and we will mark you down as no anyone. Okay passes unanimously. Thank you very much. Rachel I appreciate it. Thanks we're going to move on to the district manager's report hi everyone. Thank you. Peter I'll, be pretty brief, because I think most of the people here have probably already heard from me today and every day for a while. If you want to keep hearing from me I'll tell you: can text Bk Cv6 to 22828, you will receive our daily newsletter. One thing I just wanted to say in the zoom era. We're in that- and I've got a few questions about this. That I do share the videos after, but we and I'll share it in the chat evidence. Our meetings are recorded and uploaded on our YouTube page, so I know, there's been more interest for whatever reason: I guess, due to being locked in that people want to see the meetings and things like that they are on our YouTube agent. Also on our archives, calendar page I mean I'm happy to direct people, but it's just something. I've noticed a lot of lately and it's all there and recorded, and you know you can relive the magic that is cbd6 and if you have any questions- or you know, if you have a community issue that you want me to include in that feel free to email me at Mike, Bkcd6 and I'll do my best to include it and I. Guess: I'll see you later on tonight or next month on the radio there you go so November is the time when we traditionally do our our community budget priorities for the next fiscal year. The city has made some substantial changes in that process and I'm happy to say that they are incredibly more involved in it than they have been in the past. So hopefully our list will become more responsive of what the community needs and that there's also a good stance to you know that we that it will be. You know more representative of what our needs are, so we're going to start by hearing from Tai who I want to thank for being so actively involved in the meetings with the city on this. So you know we're going to hear from him and then he'll pass it off to Rick left class, but we're going to start by out by hearing from ty, hey everybody. I have a few quick comments. I want to make about what this process looks like, but first I should apologize for my newly stitched up appearance I had a little run in with a dumbbell while working out this weekend, but luckily the Methodist Dr assured me I, don't have a concussion, so everything I'm about to say, should make sense. Every year we review a list of capital and expense budget priorities. Like Peter said it's a charter mandated process that all 59 community boards participate in some. Do it really well and some don't and our board, like many others, falls in the latter category according to DCP, for various reasons that go back a long time. So we've been working over the last few months to transform this process from our typical way of doing this, which is basically Rick, left, Glass, God love. Him stands in front of all of you and introduces you to a long list of items for the first time and asks you for a yes vote, and we want to turn this into an ongoing proactive review from a small working group made up of board members, and this working group. Short-Term goals have been to reassess the most previous of the board's submissions, remove some items that have been funded in previous budgets and some that are no longer feasible according to agency responses and at items that address other needs, and this year we had obviously an eye toward the specific moment that we're living in and I feel confident that this group did. That and I want to thank Rick left Glass, Eric, Mcclure, Angelica, Ramdari, Michaela, Bowderston, Jason, Reichel and Samara trilling for their work on this over the last month, or so over. A number of zoom conferences and phone calls and emails. The medium and long-term goals of this working group are to review and assess the agency's responses. Decide if there's more action to be taken on our end, keep an eye on the list of the year and adjust them accordingly establish a way to receive feedback and suggestions from the community at large and report back to appropriate committees, the board chair and the full board when necessary- and we want this to be a working group so that it's so that its door remains open to any board member who is interested at any time. And if you have thoughts about the particular list we presented this year or in years past. Really the best place for you to express those is in the zooms and meetings and phone calls that we'll be having probably quarterly or as needed. Should something come up, and the point of all this that we're doing is to turn this process into a living document that doesn't just express the board's opinion on priorities, but proactively advances those priorities to the best of its ability. So it's true that tonight, hopefully, for the last time we're asking Rick to present to you a list of items. You haven't really thought much about or had time to consider and I hope. You vote yes on them, because this group worked pretty hard and very quickly on them and really the real work that needs done around. This is not a casual debate about rankings tonight, but an ongoing process at the working group level and, if you're interested in this ongoing process and what we're trying to establish and build I, I'm asking you to email me: Ty, Bkcb6.Org and I'll loop, you into everything we're doing and moving forward. This will be something that is a little more regular part of what the board does and runs a little more in parallel with the board's typical business. So I guess, if Peter will allow now we'll just go to Rick to talk about the highlights of this year's list. Yes, Rick, please go ahead perfect well, I do want to give a huge shout out to Tai who has been incredible in this process in terms of fact finding putting to identifying other materials and ways to prioritize so, but just to kind of put a little bit of context, because you have seen these lists in the past, but we need to back up into a planning document and what and just so people understand there typically are three parts: three primary parts of the city budget, there's the revenue budget, which is how do we? You know? Where does the money come from and obviously right now? That's where a lot of the strains are two is: where does the money go and that involves both long-term physical infrastructure? That's all under the capital budget, and then people tend to think expense when they care about city budget. They think about the expense budgets. You hear about the deficit here about the cuts, so we're asking so we're always asked to input on the expense and capital budgets. The as Ty explained it's a year-round process. We are right now submitting for fiscal year 2022, because what right now we're in fiscal 2021, which ends June 30th, and so the review here is from July 1st 2021 until June 30th 2022. and the what the way things kind of carried out this year, because we are in a very unique moment of time. As Ty said, we were able to excise some stuff that was no longer relevant or timely or had been done in the past and I would bucket our those that we put forward into four primary categories. One is the ongoing needs that we have seen that have not been addressed things like every year. We ask for more handicap access to the subway to the elevated lines as well as Grand, Army, Plaza and seventh, and obviously this year, we're not going to be getting those just given the MTA budget, but we have to keep pushing. Second is what happens environmentally and so right now, obviously, Covid-19 not just in terms of health impacts, but in terms of employment and education impacts. Third are issues that arise during the course of the year and you'll see some here like 457 trees have been removed from NYCHA property by FEMA because of construction efforts. So, let's you know we have to address some of those immediate needs and the other thing I just really want to implore this community board and raise your sensitivity to is. We are one of the wealthiest community boards in the city. We know that we have among the lowest unemployment rates we have among the highest educational attainment rates. But if you look at medians you're absolutely undermining many populations in the community who are not in such fortunate situations. So, for example, our median income is a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but around Gowanus houses, it's thirty five thousand dollars and at red hook, houses it's thirteen thousand dollars, so we're very focused on what are the disparities in the district and how do we ensure that services are being provided to those who need it most and that falls into various categories? So with that preface just I'm going to zoom through a few examples? I would be here all night if you wanted to talk about everyone. I'll just give you a a high level on a few of the highlights. Several of these do have to do with Covid-19, and so you'll see a request for mobile and pop-up testing for not just this year, but in the future we know that peaks are going to require even more active and flexible testing. We only have one hospital in our district. You know New York, Presbyterian Methodist. A lot of the other districts are doing testing through the New York City Health and hospitals, which is the public hospital system and the community health centers. We don't have those, so we need that flexibility of mobile and pop-up testing, which can also then be deployed for vaccinations, not just Covid-19 related but seasonal flu, etc. You'll also see a you know, an area around, and this came up earlier ventilation around the around the schools, which has to be done very carefully. As we know, because of seasonality, you will see one around the tech which often we hear oh kids are getting the hot spots and the iPads. There are still a lot of disparities there and I think as a community board. We need to keep pressing on that and supporting the DOE in terms of their being able to access the resources they need, and we also put a significant focus on employment related activities. We know in the past we've very much emphasized the economic aspects of the neighborhood, whether it's commercial corridors or the industrial zones, and what we've really tried to do is look not just at the job needs or commercial needs, but also the employment needs. The flip side, who is being who has access to positions? We don't have a workforce center in our district, so it's very hard for people from red hook to access workforce, training programs. So a lot of our priorities fall into those buckets. So all of these also align with our desires around the Gowanus rezoning, be it around the economic aspects, be it around. The housing get around infrastructure and resiliency. So there are themes that cut across, but at the same time we have to be careful that not everything is in the Gowanus when you're talking about the geography of the district. So we have to look at needs, for example, in red hook and stretching across so that's kind of my whole structure. I guess I would just open it up to if you have questions about individual ones, but I would implore you not to worry about what's number three and what's number six and what's number twelve, just really identify if there are issues or concerns or questions Peter had to step out this weekend. So as his chair I will do his shoes, but Rick I will let you conduct any discussion and recognize people. So if you have a question folks, just I see Jerry has his hand up for starters, Jerry, you're, muted, sorry about that Rick, my usual bad habit took effect and I read the document and I'd like to congratulate you and everybody else who worked on it. You're right, it's comprehensive and it's finally looking at things a little differently as far as the disparities are concerned and I think we have to continue on that route and I think that you guys did a terrific job yeah. We can nitpick and move stuff from five to seven and seven to three and in the great scheme of things, I think that we support some of these items is more important than actually what order they're in so again, thank you and I do support the report as it was given to us a couple days ago to read. Thank you. Anybody else have a comment to make. I do it's. Joanna I also thought it was really thorough and really reflective of our values as a community, which is great I did want to highlight that some of the NYPD items and the fact that they, the just the language in some of those line items, doesn't seem to reflect what happened this summer and the discussions that have been happening about NYPD funding and I just wanted to make sure that we take that into account in our asks. I think one of them refers to 911, and you know staffing issues just that just to keep that high in our mind Peter. Do you mind if I comment on that, because we did talk about this a lot in the world. Yeah I mean yes, absolutely, please say something, and you know I mean if it's possible to just take a quick look at it to make sure that there is no outdated language. That would be good but sure go ahead. Yeah Joanne I really appreciate that feedback. That was something we really wanted to take seriously. Unfortunately, the way we pulled this together left us with really only a few days to rewrite, as many of these as we could I still have to do the formal submission. So if you want to send me some kind of verbiage change on some of these, please do and we'll incorporate it. Also, in that regard, we shifted some of the you know and there might be some legacy language. Sorry, can you hear me I'm getting echo away from traditional policing and more the NCO model, the neighborhood coordination officer model and and very much would like to see and I. Don't think we've effectively articulated it. What are the services that mitigate so, for example, mental health services, rather than the form of policing that sends in emergency police when people are experiencing a crisis? So those are things that I think we'd like to deal with, but you're right 911 is obsolete. The world is very different, but we have found programs like the neighborhood coordinating officers are a much better relationship model that moves away from the historic stop and frisk, and all of the other crises that fortunately, people are becoming much more aware of other crash videos. Rick I just would want to add one thing on that. Speaking to Joanna's point I think I totally hear on that, and also as Ty was talking about. You know as we're talking about this being a continual process. I know I, think fiscal year going into fiscal year 2020, and I'm not sure if he's here, I'm not looking at the whole list. Glenn Kelly brought to our attention the New Yorkers for parks letter and that was closer to the actual budget negotiations and I, know I. Think I don't want to assign action to Joanna here, but I think if I recall it correctly, I emailed I, remember saying: Joanna our resolution in support of additional money in the parks budget to match I think it was like 95 percent of the expense and 95 million dollars in expanded capital and expense budgets, and things like that so like along with this list, I think we're going to be chiming in more regularly like that and submitting testimony and those sorts of things. I know all right. That's what I'm hopeful for I know. Ty and Rick and I have had discussions and I know. I've spoke to ty a lot about that. That's just my point. That would be the kind of thing where, if anyone that jumps in we can advocate for a a cause in that way, yeah and this that committee, this committee should embrace that the year-round process involves not just these submissions, but once the draft once the proposals start coming back from the mayor's office and City Council, there are opportunities for hearings and for responses and that's where, and that typically happens between February and April, and then they start, you know making the sausage and the like. So that's where we would very much appreciate opportunities to have members of the community testify on issues that are important that are or are not addressed within the broader budget. So we would welcome people from that perspective, not just let's put bliss together. So thank you, yeah Ariel, oh Ariel, and then shoot it. I think this was mentioned initially in the introduction, but this is tied to the statement of need. Is it not a statement, mission statement? This is the priorities that flow from the statement of needs, so several documents are presented. One is the statement of need, which is mostly data based and descriptive, and then the key priorities. We have three most pressing issues around housing, economic opportunity and resiliency and infrastructure. This is what flows out of that, so you're only seeing the final product document all right, so it all comes out of context. So it would be nice to get all of that. So we can look at that, and the statement of feed for the community six doesn't have to just be did it could be. You know, like you, take the data and then you make a you know a case around. Why so, then, all these pieces that are nicely described, you know have a you can see that we can see how they're doing against our overall need, as opposed to them being discrete little packages and that's what I would think would be helpful for us to make that judgment. So maybe we could I mean that also that would be a nice. We had talked about this I think a year or two ago about working on that statement of need, so that it would be easier to then flesh out these pieces, and so that would be something I'd be interested in working on and I'd like to see where I don't know if it didn't make any progress. Since you know, along with this, we made progress, but it started late, and so we will very much value participation for the next year and the full for this year. The all of those documents will be available on the CB6 website. So not just this final list, but the community needs statement and the what are identified as the pressing priorities by area. So there will be the chance to use that to inform future refinements. I, just I appreciate the input here because, frankly, I feel, like I've been kind of hanging out on my own with lists and so having Tai put this level of effort into it and sophistication and having the committee people like Samara and Angelica and Jason and others who've really been kind of a very active part of the process and just stepping into the to the breach yeah. Thank you, Rick. In addition to what ty talked about with making sure that this is more a more open process for the board, it's been great working with both of you and I, really look forward to having a process where we can have more community input from non-board members, but community members, so that we have a process for submitting potential new items. For you know if people look into the future two years and think what they might want, that there's a place for us to collate those so that we don't have to do this as a scramble in the year. But we have a backlog of potential items to consider and Arial to your point with data to support that. So we can make a really great case to the city Judith, that you have your hand open. Thank you. I'm very concerned that the children who are at risk in our district, some of them who attend, who are living in the red hook and Gowanus houses, especially but other children, also who need additional tutoring. Now that the schools are going to be closed, can there be funds? I noticed that your first item was daycare. Could you also modify that to also add tutoring for at-risk children, or maybe we could even have a program where there could be a volunteer program where you could virtually match? People who could tutor with people who need tutoring senior citizens and older people, especially I, think, would welcome the opportunity to help others and also kids, who need help could receive individual attention. I just think it would be a great idea, I think that would be great I, don't know if this is the process. I think it would be helpful to identify what services are being offered within the district already through community-based organizations and then what the gaps are. The specific needs around day care came out of a, and this also relates to tech, but came out of the fact that with parents working at home, kids being at home adults, you know being restricted from jobs that there were particular needs. The data actually says that our district has a disproportionate number of kids from zero to five, and so that's why daycare itself became kind of a key priority. I would think that, within the context of the tech discussion, which is digital equity, I don't want to just say it's about hardware. You know it is around use it's around teaching it's around technical mentoring. It is around Wi-Fi, so that may be another place to think about it. But I would very much I mean to that point. I guess I would love to hear some fact-finding if possible around what services are being offered so that we can make sure that people in the district know where to go, what to do and what the gaps are, and maybe those things that are offering services could be receive additional or some grant from the city or something to assist them, because we have tremendous need now to help children who aren't really receiving the help that they would otherwise get yeah ty, maybe ty and Samara. You know as you're working on the final submission. Maybe we can see if there's a way to incorporate that in some way, I'm not exactly sure what, but once we go through it, we can probably figure out a way to do that. Thank you and it definitely becomes a point of advocacy over time. Some of this is budget, and some of it is policy advocacy. Any other comments. We do need to move on so Bob you have to meet. Typically in the past, we've never really dealt with the board of Ed itself. We've always felt that wasn't part of the city budget system. They don't come to our budgeted hearings and it's never been so I just whether is there a change in that before we add another, add something to the broadband budget line that is brought to bed so I, don't remember the specific reason, but we've always not put it in what we've been told that we don't deal with it yeah now. Actually we have put it in the past, but typically with programs like compass, which is the after school program. So rather than school day programs, the Department of Ed, has not been as active in the budget process. Some agencies are more involved, some less so like housing and preservation has not typically been involved. There has been an effort at the Borough council level to get more of the agencies involved, but we have had d.o.e in in the past anyone else. Okay, I presume. We need to vote on this. Oh yeah. We do need an up and down vote on this. Okay, so again, I'll ask that if you are not in favor of this as it's been presented or if you wish to abstain, that you note that in the chat and we'll count those up, otherwise we're going to presume that you're in favor of it just to make this a little less unwieldy. You know my vote so seeing none seeing that nobody posted in the chat we're going to presume that this is approved and again I thank Rick and Ty, and the committee for all of their great work and I'm encouraged by the fact that the city has been so instructive in terms of trying to reform our approach, so that you know perhaps we can actually be asking for things that we have a chance of getting. So you know, that's that's the good news, we're going to move on to landmarks and I believe that David has a motion for us. Yes, hello, everyone ty, do you wanna, throw up the drawings yeah, I'm going to put them up right now, 519, second street? Okay, can you go to the next sheet? Okay, just stay here per second. So what what the applicant was proposing is to actually lower the courtyard the entrance courtyard there at the lower level, slightly just to facilitate a more accessible approach to the entrance underneath the stoop. And can you go to the next slide and you can see what was being proposed here on the bottom at the top? Is the existing condition where it says right? Elevation at the bottom is the proposed condition go to the next slide. This is the courtyard as it exists to what's technically called the basement level on the upper left and upper right, and I'm not sure why he had demolition labeled since something have been demolished yet, but there's the same photos top and bottom these will they be removing the weeds. Do you think? Hopefully we thought that was outside our purview keep going ty the next drawing. This is a plan that the drawings were a little bit on or unorganized sorry, but he's just showing the area there, where the hatch door is going to be removed and be replaced and the step into the courtyard. The step up is going to be removed and go to the next slide tie, there's actually on the upper right proposed basement plan, there's a new step being added at the bottom of the stoop. You can see that right where the word right above where it says up on the proposed basement plan, and you can see the hatch there is also smaller than what was existing and he's putting in a trench drain right where the door is just above. Where is circling right now just to handle any water, so there's no longer step down to that door. It'll be at that level, go to the next drawing ty okay. So this shows the new concrete step at the bottom of the the stoop. That's in the detail, 816 at the bottom of the sheet, and you can see in the photo there is where they had done something similar at 525 second street and go to the next slide. Okay, so these are just photos of buildings except for 519, which is the upper right that are nearby did I think they were really for context more than anything since they none of them really represent the same condition except 525. But 525 is a good one to look at in the lower right, where there's a blue stone paving in the courtyard it's at grade and there's the extra step go to the next okay. So here he's showing the pattern of blue stone paving and are there more drawings, ty? Okay, some more details go to the next. That's it! That's the last slide. Okay, so can we go back a couple? Maybe well keep going back. This is a hard presentation to deal with, but I'll go back, one more, I'm looking for the existing photos, so I can explain everything in one okay, you can stay here, so we essentially did not object to the proposal, but we made a motion with recommendations to adjust the proposal with more to our liking and they were the following. First of all, he wanted to paint that he wanted a the new hatch to be unpainted. Aluminum- and we said you should paint it black second- was that this new step at the bottom of the stoop would be tinted to match the rest of the stoop stairs. He had just called it out. It's rough concrete and although it's hard to tell there, we just wanted to make sure it matched the rest of the stoop in the same color. The third was that underneath the window that you see in the upper left photo that's straight ahead, there's going to be a new exposed. What I would call a water table at the bottom of the building, and we decided bring my nose up here again, sorry that that would be finished to match the brownstone and then on the right with the neighbors stoop, which is a lighter gray color. We that's also going to be exposed, and we said to finish the bottom of that, so it matches that stoop wall and the final thing was that his paving was just adjusted slightly, so it aligned with the entrance into the courtyard if you could go to the paving pattern, tie yeah. So if you look at the you can look at either drawing but the paving pattern. It just didn't quite line up with the opening, and so we asked them to make the papers a little bit bigger, so it did line up with the opening and it's just a little bit more of an elegant look, and so you know those little small pieces of blue stone say right at the bottom of the new step and we did have quorum and it was anonymous, and so we put that to the community board to vote on. Thank you, David. Any any comments on this you're going to have to speak up because I only probably only look, I thought we wanted larger pavers in general, rather than these small tiles, I yeah I. Think that's what I just said: yeah we're increasing! We asked them to increase this increase the size of the pavers, so I you can see. The opening into the courtyard is three feet. Eight inches wide, so we asked them to increase the width of the paver, so they were three feet. Eight okay I know Jerry armor I thought had suggested a specific size, but I, don't remember what that was I, don't think we got too specific. It was just really more of alignment, but no jerry I, don't well. We just asked him to match up in size so that it didn't look like it didn't. Look too modern it blended in much better with the building itself. Any other comments from anyone hearing. None, I'm going to again ask that if you have any objections to this, that you post your objection in the chat and we'll count those up, otherwise we're going to presume that you're voting in favor of this hearing, none we're going to say that it's passed unanimously. Thank you very much. David I appreciate it. Thank you. Moving on, we have a couple of motions from transportation, so Eric Thanks Peter, so the first step is a. Let me get to the so. A motion in support of resilient red hooks resolution asking for Van Brunt street to be removed from the New York City Truck route map resilient red hook is co-chaired by our colleague Hildegard link. Ty, that's the well! We I can do this one. First, that's fine! Let's do this, while it's not so this is actually the second one on the agenda. It's a motion to approve an application for expanded, curb cuts at Beard Street between Richards and Reed, to facilitate the use of emergency vehicles and those are actually those emergency vehicles are Verizon vehicles. This is a will be a Verizon facility, and the issue here is that it will be a facility where they stock replacement, poles, the really long telephone poles, and so in order to be able to get those in and out of this facility safely. They need to expand the curb cuts, which you are the kind of a difficult drawing to look at. But if you look at the left side of what you see on your screen, there are lines going in and out. Those are the roots of egress and ingress. So, in order to be able to navigate these trucks and in the bottom right of the diagram, it's hard to see, but there's an example of the truck with the pole, trailer behind it in order to be able to safely get in and out of this facility, they need to expand the curb cuts in and out and in order to be able to navigate those they need to remove parking from the opposite side of Beard Street. That's the side of beard. That's along the water. In total, the plan is to remove about 10 parking spaces. Current regulations are overnight bands two nights a week from midnight to 3 a.m. Otherwise it's you know, alternate side parking so and a total of about 190 feet of curb space where they need to take the parking away. So that's the motion we had at quorum and approved it unanimously with Leroy abstaining as a D.O.T employee. Great. Does anyone have any comments on this hearing? None we're going above that most of Brooklyn the work is underground. Incarnate is underground. Red hook does have them above so I can understand the need and therefore it probably should be there, but is most of their out above street wiring for the in Brooklyn. The rest of what's in Brooklyn is that nearby is that more in south Brooklyn park or another area did any of that get looked at, but we didn't discuss that specifically, it's a very good question. I think. The reason for locating this facility in red hook is because of the overhead wires in red hook. I'm not sure if this facility is intended to serve other parts of the borough or nothing is needed in that neighborhood yeah Leroy, do you know anything different than that? Well, I believe actually I think they will be servicing other parts of the city. It's good that it is in red hook, like you, said Bob, because we have overhead out in red hook, but they will be servicing other parts of the city and one other question in that, where how is it coming? There are those coming in or the canal or trucks just trucks are being brought in there. Yes, okay, thank you that will get to our second, our second item on the agenda. So one Bob just to answer your question once you leave downtown in park, slope you'll find that about 70 percent of Brooklyn has their wires, especially through residential areas. On poles. If you go through some streets in Midwood, you go out to Sheepshead, Bay and Flatbush. You'll size see a lot of poles, so it's not just for red hook the size of the and what they said. The size of the facility is for all of Brooklyn I. Just wonder: okay, thank you! That's it any other comments. Hearing none again. If you have any objections to this proposal, I ask you to please post your objection in the chat and we'll count that up otherwise we're going to presume that you're in favor of this motion, Peter I need to abstain. Okay, David is abstaining and I presume Leroy is as well. Okay motion passes Eric. Your second motion, please thanks Peter, so back to the second motion that is report. A resilient red hook resolution asking for Van Brunt street to be removed from New York City's truck route map, as I mentioned before Hildegard link, our colleague on the board is the chair of and I say. Hildegard here is the chair of resilient red hook. They have been grappling with this issue of truck traffic on Van Brunt street for some time and approached the board with a request of a letter of support to their resolution, which asked the Department of transportation to remove the designation of Van brunt as a truck route. The issue of trucks on Van Brunt is multifaceted, as you guys all know, it's the route of the b61. It's a shared bike route. It's the principal retail strip in red hook, it's narrow and two-way. So having an abundance of truck traffic. There is a concern. It also becomes a greater issue, as red hook is the proposed site of a number of future last mile delivery facilities. Ups is building a facility on the waterfront on Ferris Street, which will be several hundred thousand square feet. There are plans for an Amazon facility on the southern end of red hook and two other last mile warehouse facilities in the hopper. We have asked the department of transportation to perform a comprehensive truck study for red hook. That hasn't happened yet, but given the location of the ups facility on Ferris Street, it would be accessible along the waterfront by go by entering and leaving through the container port facility. Jerry pointed out when we had our meeting that several years ago, the board, before my time actually I believe, passed a resolution asking the EDC and port authority to allow truck access in and out of the container port facility, which is what the resilient red hook folks have proposed as an alternative. So we we had some lively discussion about the proposal, but we passed a resolution unanimously with Leroy again abstaining as a D.O.T employee in favor of their request to send a letter of support. We also included in that in the resolution, a reiteration of our previous motion from several years ago to ask for access through the container port and also, as would include in that a request to look at truck access on the eastern part of red hook, including the possibility of remapping hallux street as an alternative to Bay Street, which is a current truck route. There great I know there are some people that have comments on this. So can we just keep it orderly? Who wants to be speak? First, I see that Paul Basile has his hand up Paul. You have to unmute yourself, okay, Paul, okay, thanks everyone. Can you hear me yeah, yes, yeah, so I hate to feel like every time. A truck issue comes up that I come out on these things and I'm like the big bad truck guy, but I'm really trying to come at this discussion. Looking for a reasonable alternative to solve existing problems and I would just make a few points and if they ramble don't hold it against my support for street safety needs and finding common ground. You know I'm really trying to work with thoughtful groups like brazilian red hook and others, and having said that, I'm interested to hear how the mapping makes this a safer issue for red hook, especially specifically Van brunt, without a alternative. That's readily available. I know that Jerry mentioned the port and Eric mentioned the port access. But if that's not available, I just feel that it's premature to De-map a truck route which has historically been a tool for truck drivers and others using the street to know what they're up against in a mixed-use community like red hook and words in the proposal such as incompatible or compatible I mean those are debatable. It is an ibz. It is an industrial area, so I mean what's the definition of incompatible at this point, I know there's a lot of things happening on Van, Brunt and in red hook, but unless we have a discussion on the studies and alternatives that are, the city is readily able to make available de-mapping, it just seems like it's a premature and dangerous route to take as a community board, because there are people who are going to rely on that map to know how to navigate red hook currently and so I think it's a bit premature and dangerous. If people rely on that map I, it was brought up before about enforcing truck rules and weight limits and idling laws. Those are all tools that we can use to keep trucks in line. Speed limits, I think that we can look at other ways of minimizing the issues that residents are having in red hook without causing more confusion and trucks, perhaps navigating through other streets that are really not meant for trucks, vision, zero is mentioned and I think that we, as a community board, have every right to demand. This study be done on a timely manner and that resources be given to the community. Given this increase, that's coming our way with ups and Amazon and others, but I think that's a reasonable request and that's vision, zero's obligation to give us as a community. It's been a long time truck route, so I think that most people in red hook know the issues that we face as businesses already and so I think that, given these, given the challenges that we face as businesses already I, think d mapping is just not a way for us, as businesses and truck drivers to be able to better help make the community a safer place. There are a few more points, but you basically got the idea of why I think d mapping is premature and I would love to hear more about why red hook resilient red hook and others feel that d-mapping is a first step rather than a consequence of any study that gives us recommendations and solutions, and thank you for letting me speak I appreciate it sure mark you had some comments to make. Yes, I basically agree with Paul. There needs to be a study before you d map I support the goals of the Red Hook initiative. I. Think that should be considered with regard to any study that we do, that is done, but I don't believe you should de-map until there is a study that shows there are other and appropriate ways for truck traffic to get through the area and if the language I supplied to Eric earlier today isn't made part of the resolution, then I will vote. No well connect point of information. Sure can we Eric? Can you read the actual motion from the community board because I think that's? If I'm not mistaken, we in the meeting and I know I was one of the ones who was speaking about this is that we shouldn't be mapped before we have an alternative. So is the alternative part of the not part of the motion so Leroy to that point and I wanted to respond. You know the we have already made the request for the truck study to D.O.T and the motion included. These alternative proposals and resilient red hook has put forth alternative route proposals because we would not want- and we know DOT would not d-Map Van brunt street without having an alternative, especially for the West side of red hook and the waterfront. So that's why the motion was written. The way it is and I will read it right now. It is Brooklyn community board. Six endorses resilient red hook's request for a letter of support to Nycdot, asking that Van Brunt street be delisted as a truck route, and the letter will present alternative proposals for truck access to future last mile warehouse facilities, including, for example, our past motion requesting truck access through the container port from Hamilton Avenue, as well as an exploration of truck route, alternatives on the eastern end of red hook, such as the potential remapping of Hallucks Street, as an alternative to the current truck route on Bay Street. So I don't foresee any possibility of DOT D mapping van brunt as a truck route without mapping alternative truck routes in its place and I do think it allows us to try to push D.O.T a little bit on the need for a comprehensive truck study for red hook, which has to be done. Given the amount of last mile warehouse development, that's in process and in the future can happen there. I marry you I'm sorry hi yeah thanks so much for everybody. Who's spoken on this I definitely agree, obviously, that I live on as a Van brunt. Resident. I definitely think that this is a good idea, but I also want to make sure that I would like to make a motion actually to add to the resolution that we would like to make sure that those alternatives do not include Columbia, Street or Richard, Street or other streets that go by NYCHA housing. I don't want to just be pushing this problem further east, and so I would like to make sure that that's included in the proposal. I also want to highlight that as part of the the community needs, we did request that trucking study, specifically because of these new last mile facilities, but yeah to reiterate. I would like to move to include that we do not support moving that truck route to certain other streets that are also in residential areas. We accept that as a friendly amendment. Do we have to vote on it? What exactly do we have to do? Jerry was the motion maker, so he could accept that as a friendly. If he wanted to, he also had his hand up I. Think a couple other folks did as Well Gary Dunmuth Jerry. You have to unmute still muted sorry about that I clicked on it and it didn't seem to work a couple of things. I'll answer them, I guess, I'll answer the first question. First, I'll accept the amendment. I just want to say about the con about the going through the container port. The original motion was not to go through. The container port was to open up the container port and continue Conover Street, as it runs all the way from it from where it is right. Now, at the fence, at Conover Street to create a real street inside the container port and let the trucks go there, thus eliminating them from Van Brunt street. So I think we have to be careful to make sure it's not running through the container port. It's an extension of Conover Street through the container port. We'll know that we'll note that wording. Thank you and I. Think I just want to add one thing, as some of us who've been around long enough know that even if you take Van Brunt street off the truck route, the regulations will allow truckers to still continue using Yup street as to go down on them, because once they're off a truck route and the destination they're going to is not on a truck route, they are allowed to take the most direct street to get to that location. So taking it off of the official truck route, will yes diminish the number of the amount of trucks on it, but it won't eliminate them, but the opening of Conover Street or the extension of Conor Street through the container port. All the way to Hamilton Avenue will do wonders for getting trucks off Van brunt because they don't want to use it. If there's a street, that's as wide as the container port will allow and go directly to what will be the ups facility. It will also stop trucks coming in on the east side of red hook, who want to get to the West side coming across if we can get Conover Street in the port authority to do what they should have done when the container port was first opened years ago, so I think it's important that we, yes, we eliminated trucks from Van Brunt Street, but we make sure that we provide that alternative. That will function not now but now and in the future and I. Don't know how many years long after I'm serving on the board it'll work. That's it victoria! You had some comments. Sorry I had to unmute I just want to reiterate that to Paul that it's, this move is not going to get trucks totally off the Van Brunch Street and it's been a daily I mean cars daily, get nicked bumped totally run over by trucks on Van Brunt street, because we are they're just going that way and I want to say that Jerry's point about opening up Conover Street is the way to go so, and we do need a truck study, especially with the amount of trucks coming to red hook. So we're not doing anything without.coming and looking and studying and understanding what's really going on here and there has been studies. Alex Washburn part of brazilian red hook has done a sound study to study the amount of reverberation that trucks are making up and down and Brunch Street to show the kind of traffic that is happening from the large trucks coming down. Van Buren Street on a daily basis, Hildegard I understand you had some comments, plus Eric said you might be able to share your screen to show us something. So we have a map. I have to actually I have to step away fairly quickly, so I'm going to share my screen. Yeah I'll, give you share screen privileges, just a second okay, ready, yes, okay! So here is a map of our proposed truck routes. Trucks going to the new ups facility will take full advantage of on the port and trucks coming to the new Goldman Sachs facility will enter red hook this way and in that way, not involving Van Brunt street at all, this particular truck route is moved far away from public housing, which is great, and the majority of trucks will be coming in between the hours of two and seven in the morning when there's very little traffic on the arterial roads. So it's important to make sure that they are far away from residential structures. With that in mind, Eric I'm going to ask you to take over and I am going to return to my primary responsibility. Thanks Hildegard Great, Bob I think you had a question. Yes, just a reminder when we asked for ninth street to be relocated when they, where we go politicians that we'll get to that and that what we really need in Brooklyn is a comprehensive truck route study. It seems like we're doing these things in piecemeal, I'm looking at the route that you've got picked out now that end up going up, Smith, Street and stopping at the highway and what's preventing trucks, then to just keep going two more blocks and going up stream which what happens to all the trucks, the sanitation trucks coming from that spot right there or the asphalt trucks coming right? You need to be looking at it's at a much larger point, our picture and I'm not going to say no to what you're saying here, but I think it has to be put into the motion, as this is, should be part of the larger trap truck route borrower. That's important! If you don't say that then I would devote against him. I'm not looking for you to now take time to do specifics, but I think if you're, not speaking, can I ask you to please mute because we're getting a little feedback from some people. Any other comments. Besides Bob's, yes, okay, go ahead. I was also agreeing with the point that you have to look at it as a whole neighborhood and that you don't want all of the trucks to be coming off of down onto West, 9Th, Street or down onto into Carroll Gardens. You want them to be rooted so that they will stay away from all of the residential neighborhoods. Great. Thank you Judy. Anybody else can I make just one more point sure so. I think that we have Jerry's point with Conover and again Hildegard and Victoria's points being all taken into consideration and all valid points and considerably good alternatives. I just think that the mapping creates a dangerous situation for the truck drivers, the cyclists and others who are not familiar with the area and rely on the map to give them the best route that is currently available and de-mapping. It I am afraid, is going to cause more confusion and dangerous situations in the short term before we push for that Conover solution or other feasible available alternatives. Thank you. If I can say Peter P Peter, if I can say this, it won't be d, mapped unless there's an alternative route. That's done! I'm telling you Paul, it's not going to be mapped unless an alternative route is going to say if we can soften our language so that we say consider d mapping or something along those lines. You know- or you know not make d mapping the first sentence in there and say we want this study and we'd like one of the things we'd like you to seriously consider doing is d-mapping if an alternative comes up. So if we can modify that language, I think that would be the solution that would please most of the people that were objecting I think it was very clear at the committee that we understood that we had to provide an alternative and that you can not just d map Van Brunt street, without an alternative being presented being accepted and, as I pointed out earlier, even if it is de-mapped, the trucks can still use it. So I think that if we pass this and approve it, what we're asking for is that the city and the port authority work together to one open up: Conover Street, and then we can talk about the d mapping. You can't d map without a replacement. Leroy's absolutely correct! Is that what it says, though, in the thing there, because I'm not seeing that I, think Eric's presentation in Eric's presentation rather was very clear that that's part of it that you have to consider something before you eliminate something you have to find a replacement and it has to be approved. It has to be built right. Okay, so, as you know again, if we can just make sure that the motion doesn't start out by saying, we want you to do map this, that we want you to do these things, and our goal is that you will de-map it assuming that all other things line up. So if we can pledge ourselves to that kind of wording, I think we have a greater chance of success Peter if I could just just interject. This motion is in support of us sending a letter in support of brazilian red hook's idea. So since it will just be a letter, I think for the sake of not having to rework the motion, we could just address that in the letter itself. If that sounds right to you sure it does, it sounds fine, Bob, yeah, I. Imagine the fact of needing a larger look at the truck routes. If you don't say anything about it, of keeping the trucks out of the residential air areas that order red hook, then I can't support it and I, don't think we should do it. I mean it had just lost some general learning in there. That says that we have to do that, whether it's Smith, Street, West, Night or just Hamilton Avenue coming up right, but to just stop there. Is it right, D.O.T and Leroy correct me if I'm wrong D.O.T expects to release their city-wide smart freight management plan before the end of the year, which would address the entire city, it will address the entire city, we're hoping to get that out before the end of the year. I've heard that before you know, but thank you anyway. I know there are some people that are still against this, so I'll ask that mark has already posted that he's still against it. So if there's anybody else that wants to vote against it, if you could post that in the chat we'll take that into account, can we can you clarify again so you're we're voting to support? Is it what brazilian red hook said? Not what we were we're voting to send a letter in support of it with the acknowledgement that we're going to word it in a way that doesn't mention d-mapping as the first thing out of our mouths that we're going to say we support them to do all of these things with the goal of d-mapping, but not suggesting that d-mapping is the primary goal of what we're trying to do here, not in lieu of an alternate route right. So we're writing a letter of support for what brazilian red hook is trying to do, and I'll I will look at the letter. You know to make sure that it does all of those that it does all of those things so again, Bob is abstaining. Marcus against Paul is against anyone else. I'm against it. I agree with Bob and mark okay. Judas is against as well Leroy's. Abstaining Leroy is abstaining, Ariel is sustaining Rick I think said, was against and Karen Peter just make sure that just make sure Leroy's abstention is recorded as for cause, and yes, okay. Thank you all very much for that. We'll again and I'll make sure that Mike shares the letter with me, so that I can make sure that the languages is appropriate to the sentiments that were expressed here. We didn't have anyone sign up for community sessions, so we're going to hear from representatives of elected officials and we're going to start with Megan from Brad Lander's office, hi everybody for those of you who don't know me: I'm Megan Flynn, I'm the director of constituent services and community affairs for Councilmember lander. So obviously you know where we're I'm really feeling for public school parents and another imminent closure and an indefinite closure of schools and we're working. You know with the schools in our district and if any parents are having any troubles or having any questions they can reach out to me or my colleague Laura, who works on all our our school issues and we'll do our best to help you out we're hearing in regards to Covid-19 tests that there are really long lines: city Mds throughout the district, we're still hearing good things about New, York, City, Health and hospital sites, and you can get an appointment online and I. Will post all that information in the chat about how to book an appointment online where the closest sites are the voter assistance? Advisory Committee of the New York City Finance Board is holding a virtual hearing to get feedback on early absentee voting and Election day voting. So if you had any issues- or you were a part of the group of people who received an incorrect ballot, that you can testify to the campaign, finance, Board and I will post the registration link in the chat with more closures imminent. As the Covid-19 rates go up, you know we're still trying to work to support our small businesses, we're working on our recovery, lease legislation with our colleagues at the state and hoping that when they come back into session, they give us authorization to pass our bill. You know at the council, grab-and-go meals continue as Anita mentioned. Students and families can go, get to any school building between 9 a.m and noon. On weekdays. To pick up three free, grab-and-go meals from three to five pm and New Yorkers of all ages can go and pick up. Meals at 260, community meals, sites around the city and I will post those in the chat as well. If you're interested in staying local this year for the holiday and not traveling, we will be putting together some resources to volunteer or to donate food canned goods or frozen turkeys to people in need or to chips right here in park, slope and I hope you all have a lovely thanksgiving and stay safe and stay healthy from Scott Stringer's office, hello. Everyone can you hear me Jeremy. Somebody else needs to mute. Please we're hearing you and not hearing Taika go ahead. Well, hi everyone! My name is ty Karaguchi for those of you who don't know me yet. I am the Brooklyn bro liaison for Comptroller Stringer, just a few quick announcements. Firstly, comptroller stringer and a better balance launched a new work and family survey to inform and improve critical workplace protections. Accommodations and flexibility for working New Yorkers as schools face extended closures and many businesses have either shuttered or shifted to remote work. The survey will analyze how New Yorkers relationships to work and family have changed amid the pandemic in order to help identify future policy recommendations during this crisis and beyond. So if there's any interest from folks on this call to participate in our survey, I will drop the links in the chat. The survey is also available in Spanish. Secondly, the comptroller announced his support for the New York Taxi Workers alliance proposal for Medallion debt relief. This proposal addresses the taxi medallion crisis that has led to widespread financial devastation among drivers whose medallions values plummeted, as resulted in the deaths of nine workers in one 12-month period. The plan calls on lenders to write down outstanding loans to a maximum of 125,000, allowing medallion owners to repay loans on terms they can afford with current earnings. So under the agreement, the city would act as a backstop for medallion loans held by individual owners. After reviewing the proposal, the comptroller's office has concluded that it offers a comprehensive risk management approach that could reduce further future liability and cost for taxpayers. A statement from the comptroller predatory lenders took drivers for a ride and left families in a wreckage of financial distress and despair. We have a fiscal and moral obligation to make this right and embracing this plan is the right start. So I will also drop the link to this report in the chat and, finally, the comptroller urged the city to act immediately to close the digital divide and to provide all New York City students with the internet access they need to participate in remote learning and realize their right to a free and public education. Amid today's Covid-19 pandemic, the comptroller urged the city to solve this divide that leaves over a hundred thousand students who live in approximately forty thousand households without internet and seventy seven thousand students that lack wifi, enabled devices. A statement from the comptroller reads that there's no reason why, now more than seven months into the crisis, the city still has no comprehensive plan for addressing these challenges without immediate action. These students will fall further behind in their coursework and find themselves at an even deeper educational disadvantage, and we simply can not allow this to happen. The comptools plan is that the city should offer subsidized and redeemable internet passports for low-income families to purchase broadband service from providers in the areas. The compteller outlines solutions to these challenges, recommending that the city convene all of the internet service providers as well, and carriers operating in the five boroughs to discuss all possible options to quickly provide affordable and reliable internet to every student in the city, who lacks a high-speed broadband connection and I will drop the link to our report in the chat as well. Thank you, Dan Wiley, from Nitty of Alaska's office. All right thanks, I think I'm off mute. So it's it's been busy, obviously happy to see, hopefully some regime change and a new administration. So we can move on the Heroes act to get funding where we need it for local municipalities and states, as well as MTA, and everything else. Also. Congressman Velasquez, of course, has red hook in her district and want to send her best wishes to the victim 17 year old of a shooting. He was in critical condition, but had surgeries and is recuperating, but this happened in red hook, houses on Columbia Street and we're working with to try to get help for the family, and at this point the police don't have a lead on the shooter. Also, we were with the commissioner and also Eric Mcclure for the opening of the completed 4Th Avenue protected bike lane on fourth avenue going north from first up to Flatbush avenue and also another one. They got going up from Empire Boulevard up to Ground Army Plaza I did use the opportunity to discuss one-on-one, while the commissioner was having her bike tire flat fixed to chat a bit about the truck route issue and last mile delivery onslaught that we're seeing in red hook with actually five last mile delivery, logistics centers being proposed up lease space from ups was the earlier one now Amazon dove height a dove hurts also on Columbia Street. That's what I have as a picture behind me where you can see near red hook, ball fields. The commissioner was gracious, Enough Leroy was there too? We did do a meeting, including with councilman, Bradlander and Carlos Menchaca, to discuss the resolution from the red hook community and also the interest of the community board. I just wanted to highlight that in that meeting you know we highlighted the fact that ups had agreed to study truck routes as a good neighbor gesture to help fund it and we're looking for a DOT interest in collaborating on that. Some of the things, though, to bear in mind, is that Van brunt is really the main north south thoroughfare and to replace it requires having two streets designated truck route since they're one-way streets. The other thing is, as we learned from the light rail feasibility study, the congresswoman got funding for in 2010 10 years ago. We didn't get a trolley, but we did learn some things and so turn. Radii is another big concern when it comes to where a truck where you could move a truck route so getting over. There is an issue, but that all points up the fact that we would like to see a study, and now that Amazon is showing up and these other ones. You know we're reaching out to see if they wouldn't help fund such a study as a good gesture, the other issues in red hook. You know we did have a town hall meeting with red hook, houses on the soil, since there was lead contamination found in the ball fields. They had done testing in red hook, houses which is having resiliency upgrades and construction, and so we had a good meeting with EPA and NYCHA on what their safety protocols are for. Protecting the community against further lead contamination, since they're excavating so much and putting all that new infrastructure in to be more resilient. So there was also interest. The congressman was interested in seeing if the red hook community wouldn't have a community advisory group. Much like the Gowanus canal has a community advisory group, since this construction has a lot of impacts, so we're interested in any anyone. Who's interested in being part of a regular group like Guanis, has for red hook houses and that resiliency reconstruction in helping to facilitate that and talk about what that would look like, also, of course, they're gas, outages and red hook, guanis and white cough, and so we're also concerned in the holiday season that people who have limited mobility are able to get meals. Of course, Guanis dredging kicked off on Monday and was glad to be there with a number of people from the community board and the Cag. After 10 years of Cag existence, the Cag has turned 10 years old and Gowanus in the main channel has started. Epa is 50 years old. The Superfund site is 40 years old. I've been at this for 20 years with the congresswoman. We did the first cruise up the canal to try to get attention to cleaning it up with Buddy, Scotto and others, and this week was the first day of full dredging. So congratulations to everybody. I also want to make a shout out to a business. Annie Catrell of Annie's Blue, ribbon general store in park, slope on 5th Avenue and President. Street is going to be a witness in the congresswoman's financial services subcommittee on housing, community development and insurance. That subcommittee on housing includes insurance, and the topic is ensuring it that insuring against a pandemic challenges and solutions to politic for policy holders and insurers, because a lot of people who have bought, who bought business interruption insurance found out that the business interruption from a pandemic isn't covered so and Catrell from park. Slope is going to be testifying tomorrow at 10 a.m. If anyone wants to view that I welcome you and with that, I, probably am over my time so I yield the balance thanks. Thank you. Matt from Zelda Myrie's office, hi, everyone just a couple of updates here from Senator Murray's office. Our office remains open by appointment only for constituent services over on Nordstrom Avenue and Linux I drop the link in the chat for those of you who are constituents who would like to make an appointment for very limited one-on-one constituent services. Echoing some of the concerns we had earlier about traffic safety, the senator wrote an op-ed last week for streets blog about traffic safety along with 3Rd Avenue. A little bit further south than CB6, but nonetheless, I also wanted to let everyone know about Senator Meyer's small business survey. We are conducting a survey of small businesses in the district to understand the challenges they have faced during the Copen 19 pandemic and are hosting a town hall on December 10th that you can rsvp for I've dropped a link to the survey and the Rsvp in the chat as well sharing the concerns of everybody about the announcement today on schools. We are in touch with leadership in district 15 and other places to kind of understand more about the plan there. Otherwise, that is our report. Thank you for anybody that I missed I apologize. If so, if there's anybody that I missed, please speak up. Okay hearing none is there any new business that anyone needs to discuss again? Hearing none I'll entertain a motion to adjourn. It's all moved. Thank you, Jerry, happy Thanksgiving to everyone! Please stay safe! Please wear your mask and protect yourselves and your neighbors and one thing Peter. Thank you and thank you to Angelica and, of course, ty for helping host throughout the meeting and the muting and all that stuff. So thank you and in the spirit of Thanksgiving. So thanks and a happy thanksgiving to everybody, take it easy stay safe. Everyone please! It's.
