You know we're continuing to meet in this manner because of you know all the things that are going on in our city and in our state today.
This is not exactly news, but for those of you who didn't read Mike's message, we expect city planning to certify the Gowanus rezoning on January 19th and that will start our time, clock.
You know at least one of the presentations from city planning at either landmarks and land use or economic and waterfront development, so that you know the basic details and understand what you're voting on.
You know some of our landmarks and land use gurus have on it as well as the economic waterfront development people, so that when we ultimately vote on it in either February or March, we will have you.
Just, following up on what Peter said, you know, of course, my newsletter as people, know, I, do give alerts about the upcoming meetings and things like that, but also and we've gotten more views than we used to all.
Let me know, in which case you know, I, can make sure the president's office knows that you still want to be repointed and things of that nature.
Obviously, If any vote is close, we'll figure out another strategy, but for now we're going to work with noting in the comments, If you wish to vote against a emotion, so I'm going to turn it over to David Briggs who's going to present the landmarks and the land use items as I understand, it.
Okay, So we're going to start off with 433 9th street legalization of third floor rear windows and the park slope historic district, extension.
Here, this project had gone through landmarks and then the owner changed something without going back to landmarks, and so now they're asking us to okay it.
If we go to the next one, What they're really looking for is to reduce the on-site parking requirement, the height and bulk of the building, Even though it's going to be a different zoning district will not change.
Some views of the building that currently got designed by Bernheimer Architecture Ariel Bird's eye view of the promenade conceptual photos, a section diagram showing how the street end will be terraced down to the canal, providing more absorptive soft edge rather than the typical hard bulk steel sheet piling, And this is a little further along where you have the promenade, where people are walking and Florida police with guns drawn home and more details of the promenade and for those who were you know following the zoning.
But the motion says that the application is approved contingent upon a restrictive declaration being reached with the office of Brad Lander.
So David I will make that motion to accept the application, with a restriction that they reach an agreement with Brad Lander's office on a restrictive declaration for the industrial use and to request a more creative use of the community space so as to promote the best use.
Think what I wrote down, because I hadn't gotten there yet, but to design a more creative public amenity along the promenade based on the committee.
The concern was that, unless we use words other than encouragement, If we require a more creative use, it is more likely to get involved included in the department of City planning's consideration.
Technically, That means that the drawing and design of the building, as well as the public amenities on the waterfront, can change.
I said what we're voting on is the change in zoning district zoning designation, not just the parking right.
We're buying a pig in the poke on design of the building the way in its appearance, the green roof, because since we have no control over that, they they're pretty pictures, But we don't really know what we're going to get.
And I think we'll have a better handle on what, if it's appropriate, not because we'll have a better handle on what's happening with the rest of the rezoning, because they have to go through the entire Euler process before they start committing funds to completing the design of this new building and the promenade.
I heard that the school issue for the Euler was gonna, be totally put on the city portion that it wasn't going to be part of the discussion of the whole Euler of the Gowanus rezoning.
What school issue you guys talking about the building of a school they were, that was going to be part of development on public place, I think at least according to the last presentation.
Well, What I was going to say right since we're really only talking about the changes to the parking rates.
I, Don't know that we need to put it in the motion because it we can ask for anything.
So I agree with Glenn on this, because part of this whole rezoning conversation and what's come up in the IBZ conversation is the look ahead and a reduction in the changes to zoning and parking.
Representative said in the chat that you know they would be happy to keep us apprised of design changes and everything like that.
So one thing I do wonder about is, and I hadn't had a chance to look at this before the meeting last week, but in going from M1 to M2, you lose out on use group.
So one of my questions, is: I'm, not sure I'm wondering about the conversation that Brad Landers Office is having, because I thought they said that they were going to be having offices up there.
The studies and the conversations that we've been having with regards to the IBZ is that it, given all the information that city planning has accumulated from us and other property owners and businesses that it will be used on a individual, basis, a case-by-case basis with developers or project or property owners that come to DCP and the iibz looking for some relief, whether it's for parking or some growth to sustain their businesses, so.
You, know 20, different things, but again, I think this is all so in terms of the use.
I think, Instead of just going to agree with whatever Brad Lander's office, says.
If, I may, It was clear from the conversation with Landers Office that lander is in favor of this project, with the caveat that they have to work out some agreement with regard to permanent space, which, In other conversation, I would I was told, is likely to be some maker space and that kind of use and the intricacies of negotiating that are far beyond this board.
That communication should be with Brad's office so that his negotiations, you know at least understand what our position is and what our goal is.
I agree with you Peter that we can separately ask Brad to keep the industrial percentage as high as possible and they'll negotiate that and the second question I had was about the area way along the canal, because I know at some point they were saying they weren't going to require it in the IBZ, because that was going to be an onerous amount of cost to any IBZ owner trying to do anything on their property.
You, know less office and more industrial manufacturing, use.
Okay, so they're getting the waiver on the parking, because they're changing the zoning district, so I would suggest we.
Well, Let's see recommendation to reprove rezoning contingent on outcome of restricted declaration negotiations with the following condition: design, a more creative public amenity along the promenade based on the committees and communities.
You know how many people throughout the community are actually interested in having a park on the site and we'd be happy to share that those results.
When an issue comes up such as the rezoning, we would ordinarily hold one or more committee meetings and we would offer people an opportunity to state their position after they listened to the appropriate agency.
We ask the committee members to you know to listen to what the community has to say, and you know to use that in making their decision.
And I'm, happy to, and if you know, if you want any further conversation on that, just ask Mike and I'll, he can put you in touch with me.
I'm hearing voices, but I'm, not sure if that's just background hearing, none we're going to call the question if you're, not in favor of this motion, Please note so in the chat.
Csos park maintenance, how to program and get access along the canal and, following the rezoning, very carefully, So I just wanted to highlight one thing that I mentioned the congressman met with the regional administrator and, Of course, we kicked off the dredging of the Gowanus canal, main water body, and she also was very interested in an EPA participating in a public meeting kind of like what you were at a conduit for with DEP and the infrastructure, and that was a great meeting on infrastructure that really got into a lot of weeds.
Last mile delivery companies have outbid the Us postal service that you know the Us Post office that actually leases some space around Gowanus to manage its trucks and his parcels.
I know the actual people have reached out.
I, don't know too many people that would want to read them, but please sign up as yourself, I guess.
We are at a point where evictions, although there are still lots of protections that we've put in place, they have resumed in New York, The first New York City eviction that we know of was a couple weeks ago in Brooklyn, not in your catchment area, but not too far, and you know that's going to accelerate.
This would be the last full board meeting before you know we get into holidays, So I just wish all of you happy holiday.
Okay, we're going to hear from Megan Flynn from Brad Lander's, office, hi, everybody.
I know a lot of people had reached out to our office about that.
You know as a tool to better understand the M/ WBE landscape in New, York, City.
We're going to try to have somebody actually in the district office on Smith Street.
