I. Right, yes indeed, and that one you should have gotten invites for, and everybody should know that Rick is the chair of the economic development portion of our committee.
And I think there are still apparently a lot of economic waterfront, community development and housing members who have been emailing around and trying to get in.
This committee has been looking over the last couple of months at the impact of Hovid on businesses in the district, and also we had a presenter and our October meeting from Community Board, six in Manhattan just discussing affordable housing in and comparatively across the city, and then that, right at that point, we got the news that we were about to launch back into our Gowanus.
So this meeting was going to be about housing and when he came back to the land use committee last month, there was a tremendous amount of input, really interesting commentary going on the chat line and one of the things I just realized, having been on we've all been in various modes of zoom and I.
I am still going through the 68 pages of chat from the DCP presentation, and you know we are some of the some of the initiative for tonight was around looking at Gowanus stepping a little bit outside of Gowanus to look at it as we as our rezoning, fits into the greater condition and situation of housing.
So, even to the point where public housing residents would, it would be like if here, instead of NYCHA, doing an RFP, selecting a developer and then going to the residence and saying on this unveiling of saying this is, who we picked.
We can continue doing some of those study trips to learn together from other places, the kind of work you can do to really see real resident decision making in public housing and how that can be a real benefit for everyone.
We can kind of cover our eyes and pretend like it's not happening, or we can work towards making it better for both the tenant and typically low-income homeowners to create some.
You know naturally occurring affordable housing, as it's sometimes known in places all across the city, where typically HPD programs can't touch so, for example, community Board.
Six, you many of you probably don't know me, despite that, I was at HPD working on all the new construction, all the supportive housing and all the preservation deals, because there's been relatively little HPD activity in community board six, so I never had a reason to come before you to pitch one of our projects, because there were just very few and far between, whereas there's other community boards.
All too often so basement apartments is one of the tools that we may have to create something like affordable housing in neighborhoods, where HPD really doesn't have a lot of tools and the neighborhood isn't well suited to the kind of scale.
We took a look at the presentation that John Sanchez from CB6 in the Bronx did, and we've been working with him on advocating for the rezoning in Soho, and so we've been that the convention of comparing community board sixes or community board twos across the city, I think, is a really smart.
Those two lines start to really diverge since 2010, where the employment in New York City, has gone up by 22 percent, and the housing stock has only gone up by 4, so at Chpc were unabashedly housing supply advocates, and this is why we have a hugely growing economy and people talk, about.
Quote-unquote over-development in New, York City, but that's not borne out in the numbers of how the housing stock has gone over the past decade and over the past generation.
If you look at some of the cities that we think of as being having a high quality of life have been kind of a booming city with a progressive outlook, the Seattle's, your Austins, your Denver's, those places are building four and five times as much housing per capita as we have.
Is you know, a third of where Jerome Avenue is a third of where Inwood is less pop density in terms of population in east Harlem and around the same as East New York, which was the first rezoning under mayor De Blasio.
So I want to talk a little bit about New York City's, where we live initiative, so the Obama administration, reimagined kind of redefined the fair Housing Act and decided that I mean this had always been true, but they decided to finally make good on the spirit of the Fair Housing Act, which is that it's not enough to just say.
That rule was promptly rescinded by the Trump Administration, but the city of New York decided to continue to pursue the process under affh, which is to do a research and a report about what they, what the jurisdiction was prepared to go through in order to affirmatively further fair housing.
You know we tend to think of ourselves as this liberal bastion, where segregation no longer exists and where discrimination no longer exists, and we all want to live here because it's such a diverse, city.
One of the goals in the cities where we live report has to do with equitable growth and equitable development and making sure that all New Yorkers benefit equally from the benefits of development and that we're not burdening any one particular neighborhood unduly at the same time and access to opportunity developing housing in high opportunity.
That again right now is just something that the city did voluntarily, but that we're fairly likely that under a Biden, administration, will kind of be reinstated as a legal, requirement.
So one of the Strat goals and the strategies is to facilitate equitable housing development in New, York, City and the region talks about increasing housing opportunities for low-income New Yorkers, especially in amenity-rich neighborhoods, and then they literally name in the action items to advance proposals for neighborhood rezonings in Gowanus and Soho Noho to expand the housing, stock, add new, affordable, housing, increase, neighborhood diversity and other neighborhood planning objectives.
Another question in here was around the the big vacancies due to the presumed exodus of a lot of people because of Covid-19, and this was a ongoing conversation during Bcp's presentation about about acclimating to a postcode, potentially a different world of possibly doing other kinds of housing, either related to people that have left residential housing or converting office, space, etc.
We think that there will be a softening at the very high end of the market, so the thirty thousand dollar a month apartment is now going to be a 20,000 a month apartment, but that's not the same thing as creating enough housing supply for everybody who needs it.
So I think the city's plan is to go full steam ahead anyway, so that final report was issued about a month.
Everyone got kind of like mealy-mouthed and let's do a task force on this, and nobody could quite put their finger on what actual tasks you could do to further fair housing, and the final draft really responded to that criticism in quite a direct fashion.
And then we'll just take that literal report and just send it to the Biden administration or whether there'll be some changes to it, but I think they are planning on going full speed ahead on where we live.
Regardless of what happens with Affh Jessica can I ask: Do you have a view on how the community preference policy interacts with the fair housing aspect of the Gowanus rezoning, plan.
We had actually recommended to the city that, as one of its Covid-19 responses that we pause on affordable, housing, lotteries and entirely use the existing, affordable housing pipeline for essential workers, so that we made a list of things that we want the mayor to do in the last 15 months of his administration basement apartment regulations is one of them and and affordable.
We would just let people live in the neighborhood of their choice, but you know we were clapping for five and six minutes every night in prospect heights, where I live, and now we don't even do that, but we really never substantively essential workers in our neighborhood continue to have affordable, housing.
Because I know at least I talk to a number of brownstone building owners and developers and all those hated people and they have empty apartments.
That's why I'm so into and have been for 20 years into the rezoning and the Gowanus and low levels of AMI to house people in good habitable housing in our neighborhood anyway, thanks right.
Think that's a totally reasonable debate to have and neighborhoods can have that discussion separately about whether you want to only house the poorest people, first.
We can talk about in the committee in terms of you know, putting additional pressure on which ones we want I believe it was one and three with a very low 25 percent AMI in there right.
And, then the other thing I would say about the kind of changes in New, York's, economy, post Covid-19, and something like this is a.
This is a plan for the next generation or longer of what the land use is going to look like along this waterfront.
So I think reasonable people can disagree about if next summer, New York's going to be back, and this will all feel like a bad dream, or if it's going to take five years or 10 years for us to bounce back from this.
I think that's something we really should try to nurture as much as we can, as you can see from some of the fights in Manhattan about where the city is taking some of the vacant hotels and using those hotel rooms to help house homeless, New Yorkers those are being met with really bitter legal battles, and that's a very nice way.
I. Think we've learned a lot about what it means to kind of stay safe as a community, so we would be.
This challenge this important work of updating the city-wide zoning that applies across our flood hazard areas affecting the homes of 800,000, New Yorkers that are currently at risk of flooding, and what the presentation that Jonah is going to go through is detailed.
It's, a city-wide update that aims to support resilient building construction in the flood plain and enable buildings to be better prepared for major storms like Hurricane Sandy, but also for future sea level.
We know that coastal flood issues are critical in community district 6, particularly in red hook Gowanus and the Columbia Street Waterfront.
When we analyze the city's coastal risk, we focus on the area that FEMA designates as the high-risk flood zone, which has a one percent annual chance of being flooded each year in 2012, Hurricane Sandy awakened us to a more widespread risk, which many of you know.
We, know that first communities want to be able to prepare buildings for flooding, even if they're not located in what FEMA determines to be the current high-risk flood zone, especially in the areas that face moderate risk of flooding.
We heard people also want the option to raise their occupiable space a little higher than the current flood level that FEMA projects to better prepare for future storms and sea level.
We also want to complement local projects that were, we know, are in various stages, such as the red hook, interim flood protection, measures, the longer term coastal resiliency project.
One percent annual chance flood plain now, the moderate risk 0.2 annual chance flood blend would be allowed to use the proposed options for resilient building design in community district 6.
You can see a rule that applies to new and existing buildings, which allowed any space to be exempted from floor area.
So with that in mind, the proposal would modify these regulations to instead only allow the first 30 feet that is dry flood proofed to be exempted from Florida, provided that the space is used for non-residential use and complies with certain design.
In 2015, we created a set of rules known as the cottage envelope that offered side and rear yard relief in exchange for a shorter height limit, the 2015 provisions were limited to only a few neighborhoods, where the issue was most prevalent, but our proposal today would make the cottage envelope available across the flood plain, allowing resilient buildings to fit within their context.
In addition, we're proposing more flexibility for buildings that are legally that legally do not comply with the current bulk regulations and the 2013 flood techs already included some flexibility for the first floor above grade to be raised to the DFE and allow the home to increase non-compliances in the process of elevation.
It did not account for living spaces below grade, so the proposal rule would allow such spaces to also be relocated above flood levels, provided certain height lot coverage and yard requirements are met.
As of right, we're proposing a new BSA special permit, where owners can apply for relief from zoning provisions in order to meet the appendix G standards for construction.
The proposal would allow more flexibility to locate this equipment, provided that it's not placed too close to the rear log line and does not exceed a certain height for buildings, with large open areas like the red, hook, houses or other NYCHA campuses.
The proposal would allow commercial corridors in the flood plain to use the first two stories for non-residential use, provided that there aren't subgrade spaces within the building and then for existing industrial buildings that have a high lot coverage and are more constrained by floor.
We'd like to speak about is how the proposal would apply, not just in the flood plain but across the city.
So, as we near the end of the presentation, I just wanted to really note that zoning for coastal flood resiliency is designed to work in tandem with the Gowanus neighborhood plan.
Scale, we'll be going more in depth when we Gowanus for public review, but just want to quickly highlight that examining additional grading controls and elevations for developments to meet resiliency standards, something that we're taking a close look at a look at and also how street ends can be built out to improve drainage and reduce flood risk and then, lastly.
I can think of a number of people who will want to comment on it, particularly since one of the I was at some of these meetings by the way, and many of these meetings were dominated by people from red hook rather than Gowanus or the rest of CB6.
How certain changes, a property owner can make to the property, actually affect the cost of their flood insurance, and the spirit of all of these kind of additional flexibilities that are being proposed are in order to help.
You know areas, but it looked to me like it was poured concrete and standard building materials from New, York, City, and I'm.
Or you know, kind of the flexibility people have now of how to construct their home.
