Okay, I think at this point most of us kind of know how to work zoom, but you should know how to mute and unmute yourself which, if you're using a computer, you have a button down at the bottom left of your screen to do that with.
We can ask them questions as well and following that it will be a perfect session, and then committee member will debate whether we should approve this letter decline or make change to the letters so so melanie and and elise you can start.
I know atlante's committee members are well familiar with this proposal, but just for the general public and then also as a little recap, because it's been some time since we last presented at land use.
So though, as a general overview of the goals of this proposal, we want to remind you all that the specific requirements and overall goals come from the chinatown working group plan and the larger history of community-based planning that led to the development of that plan in particular, which we'll review very briefly in the proposal highlights, but the essential core values, core goals behind this plan include ensuring that future development prioritizes affordable housing, particularly at ami levels, accessible to the existing community and then also prioritizes development of commercial establishments and community spaces that serve the existing community.
Next, we're going to share a couple of the of the basic land use requirements within the proposal, but these are just a fraction of what's actually in there yeah, so you all have access to the full plan.
But I also know many members of this committee are intimately familiar with this history in a variety of ways, having sat through many long meetings that are encompassed within this timeline, but as referenced earlier, the bones of this plan are directly drawn from the chinatown working group plan for the immediate area and that dates back to the start of the cwg group.
We received feedback on our last draft on march 16th, which was, as everyone knows, right sort of right, as things were, taking a pretty serious turn in the city, so our sort of planning and thinking and timeline in recent months obviously has been seriously impacted by the coven 19 pandemic right.
We are coming to the coming to the landings community today because, as co-applicants, we want to continue to move forward the application by resubmitting a third draft of the reasonable worst case and, in addition to submitting a third draft, also submitting it alongside a letter that uses the opportunity to respond to some technical concerns raised by dcp, and then you all have a draft of that letter and that's specifically what we're asking for the land use committee's vote of approval on, so that alicia can sign it on behalf of the board and then after submission, after submission of this third draft and letter, we would anticipate some sort of response from dcp within 90 days, because their response timeline is mandated by law.
Yes, okay and what is your question olympia melanie just said, we received the letter that she wants us to approve, but I'm not sure whether she means the dcp letters that are posted on the calendar, because we didn't receive a letter from you.
Oh so we so basically thanvada was saying that the is it better now, okay, so I didn't post that dcp letter for you guys, because I don't want to overwhelm the committee member.
I can kind of explain it a little bit my understanding of george's analysis right, but I'm kind of a third party to this analysis that set so essentially essentially the letter we got back in march march, 16th from dcp in regards to our second draft of the reasonable worst case.
Development scenario discussed technical issues and edits to the application, but also gave strong indication that dcp essentially was unlikely to continue to move this application forward in an active way because of because of issues with because of disagreements with the planning rationale behind our proposal.
Right- and I think that's something- that's been understood from the early days of the chinatown working group and from the early days of this rezoning proposal- is that what we are doing both in terms of its content and in terms of this process, is atypical in comparison with kind of stamp processes and standard applicants and sort of ideologies of planning right different olympia.
That dcp essentially put it really clearly in writing right and it felt as if they were not responding to our proposal as a technical document, and it was not necessarily coming from their position of responsibility to carry the technical document through the application process, but rather from the perspective of of the city planning commission's like ultimate role in voting, an application, yes or no right, which is supposed to be much further down the line.
So when jackie's, referring to george's sort of like onwards, analysis within the strategy, memo george took a look at this situation and took a look at dcp's rhetoric in the letter and so forth, and gave some background in context to why, in the face of this kind of clear opposition, it may make sense for us to continue to move forward the application right and essentially george describes two options, one which is moving forward.
The application, despite potential future opposition from cpc, and I want to emphasize cpc right, like city planning, commission level, not ecb, and then the other option which he calls let's make a deal, would be going back to the application, making major revisions to its content and essentially to its like very nature.
In order to compromise, with compromise between dcp's planning principles and arts right so olympia, your mic is open again, I am not opening it, so I don't know what's happening guys, you are not mute.
So, as community groups, we are not prepared to go down the route of compromise right now and we believe that we have an obligation and we also have a commitment as organizations to continue moving forward the plan as close to the original as possible as far as possible in the sort of onward scenario in george's memo.
I come from a very long history of community planning in the neighborhood involved, the input and the and the input and discussion and priorities of a wide variety of stakeholders and represent a unique planning process when compared to what's been done in other parts of the city or what dcp's like typical, typical rezoning looks like, and you know not only do we stand by the actual rezoning requirements within the proposal, but also believe that commitment to that larger process is really important and george essentially outlines you know moving forward through the technical parts of this process.
So the basic sort of political assumptions or, like administrative points of view that are shaping the decisions that the commissioner is making right now are essentially like time limited right, and so, if we continue to move through the technical parts of this process, we will, even if this current commission and this current mayor has strong opposition to the plan.
I can speak to that if, unless we're not coordinated very well, but I think we got this, so we really need to know from the department of city planning where we're at because just like developers when they submit their applications for rezonings to facilitate their process, their projects.
There's very little we can still change, but we can just keep going, but actually they wrote a letter in march that lays out not what's technically wrong with how we present the reasonable worst case development scenarios, but why they disagree with what we're trying to do and we're trying to in this resubmission to say: okay, you know what we're going to give it one more shot, because it's not your job to say why you disagree with the content.
Maybe we'll consider another strategy, maybe we'll consider court, maybe something, but we can't just keep coming back and redrafting and redrafting we want to give them a way to signal to us like no we're not going to change our position from march or yes, okay, thanks for making these technical changes, let's just pretend it was about that we'll move forward so notice it.
So much lisa, one of the strengths of this application is that there's the community board as one applicant which has been here for this whole process and like kind of been the steward of the working groups and everything- that's happened in the last seven years, but there's also independent, not-for-profit organizations that represent different interests in the neighborhoods and can act independently.
So once we have a clear signal from dcp about which way they want to go with this, then the different actors can choose what to do based on what they want to do next, and it's clear to us that there's no, you know, maybe, for the community board understanding that march letter with its harsh language is a final agency.
Maybe the community board wants to think about how to approach this or wants to have a different set of meetings with the mayor right, like we're done working through the agency, we're done working with the environmental review people because we're not getting anywhere with them.
So somebody one of the applicants could choose to sue based on knowing that march letter is a final agency determination and it sounds like one right that is their language.
Now. We're really trying to figure out a way to thread the needle and get back into the administrative process and not go that route at all and have them say like okay, thanks for this long letter, let's scrap all that merged analysis and just accept your reasonable worst case.
I feel like yeah their tower in the park buildings there, but I have a really hard time saying that that's exactly what we want to do without qualifying it.
By saying, if coupled with height restrictions, and also saying I wondered if we could change the last sentence in and on page four, I'm sorry, it's last paragraph on page four, going on to page five, I think I said three and four.
You know what I mean, so I think lisa the kind of qualification and our technical team is here to correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that kind of qualification would not actually making changes to the overall integrity of the letter.
I don't I mean like I'm, not sure this was supposed to be public, so I don't know this is one comment, so my comment about the presentation right now is I'm interested also in the strategy level.
You are not mentioning that lawsuit that happened in that development and when all this thing was happening, we always said that we were applying for this rezoning, also as some sort of what do we call it like back game or whatever it's called so is there something that we should be considering on that level only time so far, sorry, jackie!
May I speak yeah, so I just want to response to olympia a little bit about like what to prophesize and whatnot, because we feel like without publishing that then people will not have the context to understand what we are trying to approve tonight.
they're like frozen in time from that december 2018 moment, and even if the lawsuits are as successful as they can be, the developers can just start over unless the underlying rules are changed, and so what we're trying to do right now is change.
This is kind of the little in the weeds technically, but this is exactly what the prior comment just before talking about the lawsuit, that's what this was addressing right, so that right, the question at hand that you can think about right is if dcp made a determination right, which we we're trying to figure out right.
That's one of the goals here is to say was that march 16th letter, you know a determination or not, and also right, one of the other things to figure out is if it.
To sort of comment on at that point, in the process, right I mean, and the argument right being made here is that there were- and this is also outlined in george's memo- there was there's a history of the city planning, commission and dcp as their as their agency, that helps them fulfill their tasks, sort of slow walking, right projects that had kind of political or policy recommendations that differ from the department's goals right and then there were rules established under the prior city planning.
One of those things is kind of this issue of slow walking projects for political reasons, right and saying that you have to kind of let them go through review as technically complete, and this is just sort of citing a number of different rules right, euler rules which are rules in the city of new york having to do with land use applications as well as the establishment of of the rule we just talked about.
You know, I think, there's probably there's probably pushback that dcp may have on this, but that's kind of why you send the letter, I guess, is how I would frame it is.
It would be things having to do with the set of sides of affordable housing, or you know the regulations around commercial uses right which, like what we're proposing here, is not necessarily in dcp's vision of how you would develop this area and or in any area right, because it has a serious, significant, affordable housing set aside for one beyond my age, but the question is: can they ask us to change that on that basis alone?
I guess what I would say is like if you look at history, they've certainly done this before historically done the thing before that we are saying they cannot do in this letter right and the question is: is this rule change?
So I mean I don't know if there is any value in adding any comment around that in this letter or whether we as community board three wanna resume in a future agenda discussing that, because if we don't change the seeker as a language committee, we will be reading a lot of crap sincerely in the future olympia.
That's why I want to make sure that we all comfortable with these a few paragraphs yeah so what's interesting, is that when the bloomberg administration announced that they were gonna take a different direction that was actually right after these rules were passed.
So what I'm saying is, if there's, if they're, interpreting a rule that seems to go against the way it is written right, clearly written right, then we're trying to address this right and getting some clarity on that, and I think that what you're likely to see happen right is- and I'm not saying you shouldn't sign because of this, I'm saying actually, maybe you should sign because of this, because it's it's useful to get clarity on these issues.
So that's how I would wrap that okay, thank you, jim, do we have more questions and then I'm gonna open to public bill firms.
So we ask the members of community board three to please support the two bridges, rezoning application memo and the cover letter to the department of city planning.
So please support the two bridges: rezoning application, a memo and the cover letter to the department of city planning.
So let me see seeing no other hands, so I'm going to ask the committee to decide whether we're gonna approve the letter.
This look right, yeah, okay, so it reads: your team asked for a rationale explaining why 60 open space requirement is appropriate and how you determine the additional requirements for new construction on lots where there are existing buildings.
So I had a process question, so you wanted a motion for this letter because we're going to pass it like a rental and then it's going to be voted on the full board.
I mean I think the language is okay, jackie, it is just dcp speaking, so it sounds weird, but it's correct.
Thank you so much guys the letter got approved and then it will be sent to the food board and it is likely going to be approved by football as well.
