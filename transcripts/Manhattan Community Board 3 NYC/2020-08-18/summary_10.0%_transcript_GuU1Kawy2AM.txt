Hello, do I need to check in with you guys with my name, because I'm not on the zoom online yeah, if you're calling in by the phone, I can go ahead and you don't obviously have the app option to enter into the chat box, but I can, if you want to just go ahead and give me one second, to open the chat box and state your name.
Well, while we're waiting for one more community committee member I'll go ahead and read through the guidelines for anyone who is attending here as a guest or an applicant, so the meeting is being recorded just for everyone's use.
I would like to know when usually for administrative approvals, but the process is, and it's outlined on our website is that somebody has the opportunity to look at what is listed as an administrative approval, not heard of committee.
Look at the sla notice and the questionnaire that was submitted by the applicant, which is on the website, look at the elements of the business you can reach out to the applicant and speak to the applicant about whatever concerns you might have and then, prior to the committee meeting, if there's an issue with the business that you want addressed, you ask us the calendar.
If that's what should happen, some things are resolved just by speaking with the applicant or they're just a question of wanting clarification about what businesses.
If you want to just make a comment about the business, that's fine, but we're not hearing the applicant tonight or discussing whether or not to approve this as we've already determined, would be administratively approved.
If you have a concern or comment about it, you could send that into the off after this meeting or after you've reviewed the questionnaire that the applicant submitted and the stipulations the conditions that it's agreed to about how it's going to operate its business, then you can certainly send something into the office and we'll try to address it, for you send that into the sla website.
Direct to the snla website is tv, three or four you can and if they're, yes, you can and they'll get forwarded to me, okay, but make sure, but make sure you submit them to the community board, not just the sla website yeah.
Okay, so herman has now joined us all of our community members are here we're going to go ahead and get started just another quick reminder for anyone who's just joined recently, since I last read this, if you are joining, please sign in the chat box list, if you're an applicant, if you're here supporting an applicant if you're a member of the public, with any comments for or against or you're just here to listen, but the chat box is what we use for our attendance sheet and on that I'm gonna go ahead and hand this over to alex for her to begin the meeting good evening, everyone to start we're going to go to our approval previous month's minute and then we're going to build into the agenda items that clint reviewed when he went through the agenda so is.
Okay, we're moving on to number two number two is: was an agenda item added by the office and something that we have discussed on and off as a committee which is adding to the administrative approvals, the stipulation requiring that the applicant or the licensee operate for a year before applying for an upgrade and as a committee, we've discussed different amounts of time.
I would say there was like a handful of them at one time in the space of several months, but otherwise it's been every once in a while that we've heard from somebody who has been operating with less than a year.
Just the way it is you mean you like to see a more comprehensive resolution that includes something along the lines of no sooner than but from at least like a and I'm not even saying that it would necessarily be a year, but from this point on, you may apply for a changing class of your liquor license understanding that your application is going to be evaluated just as any other application would, which would be whether or not it's appropriate for a changing class and whether or not your business has been operating the way that it agreed that it would, when it was administratively approved.
I don't I kind of agree with herman, but we have talked about this in the past and I think it is a good idea because often we're having people coming in with administrative approvals.
Coming back after three four six months, when they haven't been operating long enough for us to even really get a full understanding of, if they're going to be good operators or if they're going to be problems, so I do think this is necessary.
I personally think that a year is not long enough, because the administrative approval process is to give us something and if they're only doing it for a year, by the time they get up and running so that they get their license, they open they're going to have a grand opening.
That way we go through all of the seasons of them opening, because, obviously you know different seasons of the year cause different problems for different businesses.
I know that's putting it off another month, but maybe it's probably a good idea to have it formulated into a more comprehensive resolution so that we have a better understanding of what we'd actually be discussing and voting on anybody else.
You should write all that in so this is an application for the sla notice says: tavern with minimal food recorded music and notes the existing outdoor space pursuant to the executive order, which it doesn't have to because it's pursuant to the executive order on the ground floor of this location, the ceo, it says, is 74 with four tables in 15 seats.
I mean, or the photograph that was submitted or photographed, show that the cloud is completely open without any agreement to close at 10 pm, which is one of the stipulations on our questionnaire recorded background music, no promoted event scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no tvs, no security, no sound proofing, no intention to upgrade no hosting pub crawls or party buzzes happy hours to 8pm.
This way, the district manager also submitted a statement that, because of the two she said, there were two gatherings, both of which generated complaints, the second resulting in a fight meeting, with the bid with the business improvement district in that area, the community board, the precinct and local elected officials or their representatives to address what was going on with the business and which ultimately resulted in the business agreeing not to be open for the period of one week or consistent with whatever phase we were in and until we moved into the next phase of the executive order.
I know I note that I have not heard personally from anybody that I emailed the community groups that were listed on the cb3 website, inviting them to certainly reach out to me that I put them in touch with my clients if they had any questions or concerns about this.
It's a french fried place and I think the record is that hasn't happened since I don't know what the second event that you mentioned was, I don't know anything about that and it doesn't sound like it was.
The questions have perhaps after we hear from members of the public- you, let me know: okay, we do have at the moment there's one person in the chat that has signed up to speak on this item and that would be marvin aviles.
You're back marvin are you finished yeah, I'm finished, I don't know why I got caught, but I think you got some of my stuff in my email, so I just wanted to state my two points.
Okay, I see none alex okay, robbie just for clarification, you're saying that the applicant was seeking to serve beer and wine, but we only had a notice for beer actually alex yeah.
I think this is this is at this point this event and there were two gatherings of some kind, because the second resulted in the office actually responding to the site, but the event that happened on may 31st ravi had flyers posted to announce the event with the logo and name of the business on the flyers.
So I know it's called a gathering, but it appears to be consistent with an event, given that all these people showed up in the same place at the same time and were summoned there in some way, whether it was just via the flyers that the neighborhood saw, or by some other means, as well and like and was with the idea of having music outside and coordinating off the street.
So I'm going to give our chairs the opportunity to speak, and then you or the applicant can respond to this, but I think in order to get to the making of a resolution, we have to move past this place where all of these unauthorized things have already been done in a really short amount of time and figure out how we get some assurance.
Now I know you know I don't I don't know what prompted them to have this type of event for a french fry place opening- and I know that they're applying tonight for beer wine or something like that, but I am really just disgusted at the fact that they had no regard for the community when they allowed this thing to happen, I mean, or, like gentlemen said, like marvin, I think his name was marvin said that the cars had their logos on the side.
There clearly was no one that wanted to take ownership of what was going on, and I felt like I didn't know who the point person was that I could even get a word in edgewise to talk to someone to say what are you guys doing?
I mean yeah, there were celebrities, I heard there were celebrities there and all of that, but the thing is it's like we are a small community.
I learned about it when susan mentioned it to me when I put in the application, and certainly I've discussed the reality of the situation in this neighborhood with my client that whether it was planned or not, which it wasn't, even if other people want to do something like that, it's not going to stand unless it unless anything, has to go through all the right channels, and that's not the plan to do at this time.
We definitely would like to see it, but these were people that were a fan of the place that thought it was a cool idea which I frankly, don't think it was a cool idea for this neighborhood, not in these circumstances, and not certainly going through the proper channels, and that's what I told my client okay.
I will say that being an attorney myself, I appreciate that sometimes clients or people that you deal with, who want to make statements to the to a court or a body, will tell you something and as the attorney we're not necessarily supposed to be relying only on what we they're saying and what the face value of those statements are.
So I can only deduce that he was the orchestrator of the event and this the community officer from seventh precinct had a very lengthy discussion with him, and I can I can upload that if it need be, I didn't want to because I didn't think it was appropriate but based upon their position, I'm frankly very shocked that the legal representation of mr schlossberger is not in line with either his client or the events that occurred on that day.
I don't know that I can rotate it easily on youtube at the moment, but, okay, let's eat them, did you have a flyer yeah, I'm just getting that one right now hold on one second or actually was.
It was sent right when the event happened, so it was attached to one of the initial letters yeah and one okay, one of the early ones, the 101 sand street resident, hey clint.
This neighborhood we're not saying that no one knew anybody who was operating, who came with cars, but it was not planned by my client to do so.
I think we understand yeah so, and I saw the video and it's consistent with what everybody has said happened at that event.
But it does it's not consistent with he's in charge of that event, and that's what we're saying here and as far as contrition goes, I've told my client that you know this is the type of thing that you just can't not do, and you cannot allow your friends to do that either, and I think he knows that I mean it's very clear.
It certainly wasn't what the neighborhood wanted and certainly you know events can happen, but those things have to be done in through the proper channels by anybody who wants to throw an event whether it's a block party or anything else.
People are going to stand and get a beer and right now, yes, they're allowed to get a beer to go, but once this executive order's over with, if it ever is whatever that may mean there's nowhere to even sit in there.
I mean okay go ahead, just in terms of the you know, legality or the size of the place.
That's allowed when that, when, hopefully, when that changes and the coveted executive orders are over, I mean I prefer that there be outdoor seating personally, but even if there isn't, when there isn't assuming there isn't, he will have to not allow anybody to leave that place with a beer and break the law.
That would that will be something that will get his license revoked and it's not a takeout beer place this you know it's, it can't be, and if five people want to be able to sit on the inside of that premises and have their french fries with a beer, then that's what they can do and maybe his license won't be all that amazing.
Then, when you can only sell five years at a time, but that's the way it's going to be, but right now, but he's entitled to that he's entitled to have a wine beer license.
I think we understand the points on both sides- okay- and we just have to move on to the discussion and making a resolution.
I've already spoken so, and I agree with him with respect to the hours of operation, the type of business, the location, and you know what they seem to be marketing toward and also what I've read in terms of what they say: they're marketing toward which is the hip young, energetic community that exists in the area, michelle ellen jesse herman.
It's not a right, so it could be taking be taken away in a couple of months depends on the liquor authority and they have to apply for a sidewalk cafe or some form which may not even be given to them and serving french fries and beer and wine until two three o'clock.
Okay, anybody else, I'll just say that I agree with herman that maybe if this had been an administrative approval, that would have been less contentious, but there are a lot of operator existing operators in the neighborhood who have lost their license for less than that kind of behavior.
So I don't see why we would preemptively give someone who has already proven to be a bad operator a license, especially right now, maybe at a different time: okay, jessie or ellen, and then I'm gonna make a statement with respect to the process, and then we can discuss the resolution and what it might look like.
I don't know necessarily the sla would not credit this, as opposed to any other information that we might put forward for opposition to a beer wine license.
My expectation is that the applicant's not going to assign any stipulations that we construct, although maybe that maybe that person or people will and then we'll go to the sla and we'll end up having to send somebody to the sla, and I have no doubt that the community will submit material to the sla also about their concerns about this business.
Currently and when we were traveling through europe, we saw free stores, all over france, the netherlands and then into belgium, and my daughter came to me and she said we got to bring this to the states, because there were lines in front of all these street stores and we were trying different french fries and- and so I rolled it off, I said, make me a business plan, yeah and sure enough.
She makes me a whole long business plan and she shows me how she wants to perfect the french fry she spent over a year working on.
Guys is a dj, you know and he started playing and another guy out of nowhere, not part of the car people started videoing the whole scenario, a lot of picture, taking a lot of iphone thinking and, and then- and so this was a very not planned event.
I don't know if a single second event that ever happened, we've been we've been operating, the business is doing nicely, it's increasing.
I mean, I guess, okay, if it's since it's beer and wine, I think you kind of have to do that.
I'm looking at the application that I emailed you guys and it says beer insider and that's an error- we're not probably ever gonna start cider, but it's going to be beer and wine ravi.
This business has been open since may of 2020 and that in the three months of operation that there have been two events or gatherings- and I think that we can- although we can put in that the applicant's attorney denied the second gathering, we have information from the district manager actually talking to the complaints, referencing, the second gathering and the response by her and the precinct in the bid and elected officials from the meeting.
Given that the business has already been disruptive and has had these, what they're characterizing is irresponsible, unsafe events, the in addition, the lower east side dwellers submit a letter which also speaks to its current operation, unassociated with the events themselves, in terms of how it's utilizing residential garbage cans for the rails, that are that are actually part of the places that you eat the fries and they submitted photographic.
We can include that the applicant, the attorney for the applicant, the applicant, were given an opportunity to speak and stated that they didn't plan this event, that it happened without their planning and that when and that when- and I guess and I'll rephrase it, but that the lack of planning, including the number of cars that showed up for at least the initial event, the number the use of a dj outside the blocking off of the streets and they just profess, not knowing what the second gathering it is.
I think, if they're saying that and I had included what clint brought up, which is of my own little notes, that this location has no tables and chairs that, even in the explanation of the questionnaire submitted, the table's insurance referenced in the questionnaire to the community board, where the tables and transfer currently exist outside pursuant to ceo executive.
We also understand that the apron has no license experience and it has himself spoken at length about his experience or in the fashion industry, and nor does he have any familiarity with this area or it's already existing issues with respect to the vehicle, congestion, pedestrian congestion, noise from people, noise from horn honking, because cars can't get down the streets which are blocked and that you know this was evident in the event that was held on behalf of the business and how it exacerbated all of these conditions.
And consequently, we have great concerns about the approval of a license of any type for this business, because we have concerns about the ability of the applicant to follow or permit requirements.
But we understand that the threshold for the approval of such a license is low and consequently would therefore approve this application with certain stipulations governing the method of operation of the business, and we can go through what they are, but I'll propose them.
I would propose no outdoor state, no commercial outdoor space recorded background music online, the facade closing at 10, no pub calls or party buses, no unlimited, specials, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for overseeing heads in life outside alex.
Yes, I believe so, do you have any questions about anything for number 15, no wait lines and staff outside death responsible for overseeing people outside okay, so I've made the motion.
On the ground floor, the cfo is 74 with 18 tables 59 seats, a 20 foot bar with 10 stools proposed hours are 11 a.m to 12 a.m; sunday through thursday 11 a.m to 2 a.m, friday and saturday kitchen open all hours serving this is the applicant wrote the swedish street food but then also wrote primarily burgers accordion doors and windows, two tvs recorded music and djs at background and entertainment levels.
In fact, there was a statement as part of the questionnaire with a plan to address waitline staff, had an agreement to have staff responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the applicant listed 19 ops within 500 feet, but submitted an sla report that listed 20, and there are 20 per my count as well as four pending ops within 500 feet.
The applicant has operated the bronze brewery at 856, each east 136th street in the bronx since 2011, with an op license issued september 21st of 2018 submitted a applicant submitted a letter of public interest which in some said it would be one of two breweries in manhattan, which would provide patrons unique access and perspective to the beer making process.
The word used by the applicant with activations also were used by the explicit through two new releases per month, which is something that currently exists as its business that it operates now and then also said.
So I notified the applicant that it was within 200 feet of iglesia de cristo, which is the east side church of christ, which is located at 56 second avenue, and it's been open for 47 years and that's it.
I think, as we have sorted out the layout with the architects, but that is just not going to be feasible, so I think, while we would have liked to have had, for example, live bands for salsa nights, the space just won't allow it so was something that I think we had initially intended for the space, but not something that we're going to be able to do given the confines and the meet and greet was really something that we wanted to do just as a way of opening our doors to the neighborhood.
The comment I was gonna make is I work in the bronx I'm familiar with a lot of the neighborhoods in the bronx, I'm familiar with morrisania and the port morris section of the bronx, and I can see just in looking at your location and looking at it, whether it's on the sla website on the lamp map or looking at it on a street view that it's in a warehouse, it's not surrounded by a residential area and it's not surrounded by any licensed establishment.
So the location sort of lends itself to what you do now, whereas what you want to do here is bring that business, even if it's in a smaller format to what is essentially a 1900 residential like mixed-use, residential building in an area that is packed with people, whether they're people who actually live here or people who come here.
So while I appreciate that you want to bring this business to this community, I don't know that this okay and the location's two doors down from a church which is its own issue.
I don't know that this is the right location to have this type of business, and I think you're gonna find if you attempt it that you're going to have more problems than you'd care to deal with and that maybe a better location for this business in this community might be houston or delancey street, or even just off either of those streets which have much more of an industrial slash residential character than this location, which is residential with commercial overlay.
I don't know when you did your search, but we we're hearing all the time about businesses that we're losing and just to add another license to the to the neighborhood is generally something that my organization opposes and it you know, according to a 500-foot rule, it just seems that there's a lot of disconnects between what you want to do and the space that you want to do it in yeah.
If I, if I could, I mean, I think what we more than anything want to do is bring a small brewery system down to the east village, and I understand there are other locations that sell beer and craft beer, none of which are actually producing beer on site, and I think, more than anything, that's we're looking to do looking to have a full kitchen serving food with the product.
I mean, I think why, may I ask why you are requesting full liquor, yeah previously unlicensed location in a famously oversaturated area?
You know, first and foremost, a brewery selling our own beer, but we found that people did not want to come to the to the brewery they did not.
In addition, there are four pending licenses per the sla lamp map, and then I would put in how the location of the existing business, which is what I said in a warehouse in a relatively isolated industrial section of port morris in the bronx surrounded by no other license, is markedly different from the location is proposing to occupy, which is the 1900 building in a in a densely populated area that, furthermore- and I I'll add in because we- I didn't- have it before that- laura that a representative of the east village community coalition, which represents tenants and businesses in the community, spoke in opposition to this application or to the issuance of a full-on premises like license for an application to operate a small pilot brewery and to the the reasons stated by the applicant during its hearing, which is that it want to be out.
If I might actually just for purposes of guiding my application of the slas, would it be possible to I guess what I'm hearing is that the community board would be in favor of a wine insider licensed at this location with the brewery, or do I need to submit a secondary application for those purposes, or is that able to be part of the resolution?
It has a prep area serving small place all hours, it says french doors, but the facade opens completely and has for a long time no tvs recorded background music.
The op license was issued, may 5th of 1987., and I, like I said I have outlined the violation history which, when we heard the applicant in july of 2006, they stated that all of the violations were for were from the partner who had previously operated the business and not for that person, and then I also have some information that I gathered from social media that I can speak to in a minute and I will say the applicant says 18 licenses within 500 feet.
There are 30 ops within 500 feet of the solicitation, and I believe I counted two three excuse me pending op licenses, I wrote it in my draft and then the the amended application says it's seeking to have live music for new year's eve only and happy hours to 8 pm.
What did I want to add just to clarify and the staff that he's had working there for years are all going to remain so from the outside nothing's, changing it's going to remain as 10 degrees, just clarification alex for new year's eve, not looking for live music.
I just want to note that I myself have actually seen a live performer, usually sitting on a stool, usually right at the front of the building with of the business, which I noticed, because the facade is completely open.
the account for the applicant and the count for us with respect to number of licenses in the area and that the existing principal has operated this business since 2006, whereas, given that the business method of operation will remain the same and retain the one of the existing principles of the present business, we would approve with, or we would deny unless the applicant agrees to the following stipulation, which is that this would operate as a tavern cocktail bar with a prep area serving food during all the hours of operation, or rather it's on the stipulation it would be less than a full service.
Kitchen with hours of operation of 4 a.m to 4 a.m, monday through thursday, 2 p.m, to 4 a.m, friday, 12 p.m, to 4 a.m, saturday and sunday, no commercial use of the outdoor space, closing its facade at 10 pm or when any amplified music is playing.
Music, no live dj, no djs, with the exception that it may have djs on new year's eve, no alteration without first coming before the community board will not host pub calls or party buses will not have unlimited drink specials, we'll have happy hours to 8 pm and we'll have no wait lines and have someone responsible for overseeing crowds in those websites.
A wine beer license in september of 2015 with stipulations operate a full-service balkan restaurant serving food within one hour of closing.
Closing his father, 10 pm playing recorded background music, not seeking an upgrade not applying for an alteration without first coming before the community board, not hosting club calls or party buses, not having happy hours, not having weight loss and having staff responsible for overseeing crabs and noise outside.
The liquor store: that's right next door to it and identified itself as within 200 feet of a church which is saint mark's church on the bowery I counted, 25, ops and one pending rp using the sla lamp map, the license the beer one license was issued january 14th of 2016, and I guess there's confusion here, because the business seemed to oh there's, confusion on my part, but then it seemed to close in december of 2018.
So I'm not quite sure what has been going on with the business in the time since it opened and now the other thing is that the existing hours of operation appear to be 1 am 2.
Am 3 am if you look at social media or places where there, where it references the take out service for this business and list just hours of operation and the website.
The actual hours of operation would be monday through friday, 4 p.m, to 11 p.m, and the weekend it's 4 p.m, to 12 a.m. That was a mistake on the application, so I don't know if there's an increase in hours and the belly dancing would be one hour from 9 00 p.m, to 10 p.m. On friday night, only for one hour with respect to the closure in 2018, perhaps my client can explain that.
Restaurant we've been in business for about five years now, we're just looking to upgrade to the actual full liquor license.
It should be on the application, but we do not serve alcohol on the outdoor area, meaning beer and wine.
It seems a little strange to me that the name on the restaurant, like if I as a person that lives in the neighborhood, I don't know that it's dine.
I know what it looks like and so dinah dying a restaurant on yelp is closed and there's this mojane that's open, but I don't.
So I would, I would like to suggest, I know in the past, there's been a couple other businesses within 200 feet and the sla has ruled that this is not exclusive.
Okay, I think the application states it's three.
200 foot law- I think we can include so I think we can include two paragraphs that say that there's a an issue with respect to its proximity to a house of worship, that being saint mark's church, the bowery that the applicant has stated and submitted a proximity report indicating that this house of worship is 310 feet from this location and that the community board understands that in the past the fla found that this is not exclusively a house of worship.
I mean, I think, still to reiterate what I'm saying earlier, that given the reasonable hours there's no complaints, they you know, seem to be operating, you know and not being any kind of problem or nuisance to the neighborhood.
As long as we're adding in the stipulation for the sla to consider the church in their recommendation or their determination- and I would recommend- we approve with stipulations- okay, all right so then the resolution would be the awareness clause stating what the application is applying for, which is a change in class of its wine beer to a full on premises.
What the elements of the application are, the next paragraph would be that it was administratively approved in september of 2015 and the stipulations that include to then when the wine beer license was issued.
The previous op license was issued december 19th of 2018 and the applicant we heard last month as well has a number of businesses already in this neighborhood.
You know 150 60 employees and I'm actually not able to hire all of them back because we're going into this economy that I think, is going to be rough and there's some people within my company that I don't want to lose jobs, and so we decided one of them happens to be this brilliant woman.
I yeah I have closed a few because of covid that we just didn't think would sustain so we're down to, like I don't know exactly nine or ten right now and now, like I said, they're part of the reason why doing this one I couldn't make deals.
Yes, and actually looking at me and making menacing faces to me, because walter can I walter, because I know I want to give you your opportunity to speak, but I think I could refine at least parts of this so ravi, much like with your businesses on 7th street.
Try to do some cooking outside, for you know to actually provide service inside it can't be used at all right.
I thought that was an applicant and he got a chance to talk for 45 minutes, so I think I've only been on for 10., so you have to let people talk more to get them to say what you need them to say, but he wasn't really saying what he needed to say at the beginning.
I would get a message that there would be a kind of a community meeting where I could meet with the restaurant owners learn how to renew their licenses, but this is all not being done publicly and I'm just wondering why that the people I saw the people from violet once and they were reasonably good tenants, but they shouldn't have been in five or nine, but but I would like to have had the opportunity to at least you know, have a review and there's other you can yeah.
You know as the result of comments or complaints regarding a business, but was there anything going on that?
So if there's any, you know understanding that there's a history of complaints or regarding a business, and you ask a question with respect to that you'll get an answer responding to whether or not there's a history or we've heard anything all right.
Okay, so we have to have a discussion and go on to the making of a resolution robbie with respect to the windows which are sort of an easy thing at this location, because there were, there was a period of like lot of standing complaints, because the street itself is pretty small.
I think that other app store outstanding thing we might have to just speak about are the proposed hours of operation, and I don't know if any committee members want to talk about them they're longer than what we have had.
I don't have a huge issue, maybe normally we would ask for to bump it back a bit to 12 in one, but given that we do know how he's operated as other businesses, I would probably be okay with well the side street businesses like the 7th street business is closed.
I don't know if I would go as far as ten years when I looked up the three one ones, but not in the past couple we'll say that okay, I mean not.
I can draft the stipulation at the bottom, but it's going to be that the facade the windows close at 9 00 pm every night, that there's that there's a recorded background music, no promotion that scheduled performances or events with covers no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines and somebody responsible for ensuring no noise or people outside or overseeing noise, and patrons about that excuse me anything else, get everything ellen you're!
