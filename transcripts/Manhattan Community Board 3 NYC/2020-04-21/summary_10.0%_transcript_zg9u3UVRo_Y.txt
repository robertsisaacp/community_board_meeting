Sidewalk cafe I'm, just a member of the public okay, we've got, we know.
My understanding is yes, I spoke to the tenant the other day and he told me that his attorney, couldn't you know, wasn't working at this time and okay and I said well, look it's a zoom call.
You know I like to think I mean things were moving in a good direction from the lease standpoint as well again, that was pre kovin, so I'm not sure you know if certain language will change, but hopefully the neighborhood will embrace the use.
So next we have item number two which is dig in it's located at one: twenty: seventh, fourth Avenue they're applying for a sidewalk cafe permit oh yeah.
Closing its facade at 10:00 p.m. playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration before coming to the community board, not seeking an upgrade not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having them limited, drink specials with food, not having happy hours, not having wait lines outside application is for seven tables and 14 seats with a row of two tables and four seats on 4th Avenue and a row of five tables and Tennessee on East 13th, Street and proposed hours of 11:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days.
Applying for this unenclosed sidewalk cafe the seven tables as described five on the 13th Street side, a single row with planters, one of the seats would be an ad a seat and then two tables with chairs the same on the 4th Avenue side- and you know our architect- did the drawings according to the code and the regulations and we're going through the process.
Loft us was here to find out in any information mary did you have any questions or any comments about this yeah I mean the sidewalks are so narrow, as it is and I'm sure that you know your architect work to code or whatever, but in light of what's happening right now you can't walk down that block and social distance.
You know somebody comes at you from the other way you have to walk out in the street, so the idea of putting a sidewalk cafe there and I know that now I think it's bar bacon has an enclosure for their entranceway and even just to get around that which would be the and that's smaller than what I would think the sidewalk cafe distance is it's difficult and that's a busy corner.
Think that question for me was whether or not the sidewalk would the sidewalk on 4th Avenue would be able to accommodate any tables, because it's slanted- and it is yep very congested and tends to be narrow, I mean tends to feel narrow when you're walking down it is one person right yeah.
If you are you talking about on the 13th Street side, Mary yeah right between the newspaper box mm-hmm, they did clear it out by the mailbox, there's nothing there so that there's more of a linear feet.
Can you read it and the idea it's a newspaper box, yeah I'd, be then, but it says it's a five foot, but it looks like that line.
If you guys look at the mm-hmm, the one online, the diagram, it doesn't go over like you're, saying Alex, but it hits all the minimum requirement.
So I feel like we can yeah well I mean I, can't dispute the minimum requirements, I'm just saying as a human being walking down the street it's crowded now and having a sidewalk cafe here.
I think feels like an impediment, and you know I want to be supportive of local businesses, but I just feel like this is encroaching on something.
It's five, it's correct, yes, I think we're talking about the plants are not being the newspaper box not being what would be considered fixed street furniture.
Unless someone removes the newspaper box thing, so it doesn't actually have a unless that's on the other side of the photograph it doesn't or the diagram, it doesn't have a straight line from the planters yeah it's over here side: okay, there's an 8 foot, and can you just say what it depicts because I can't see it yeah this line over here, I'm here I think I can annotate this somewhere.
Is it, but even so, I think table there, though right, so it the table stops before those yeah the tables the tables over here building the tables are against the building, but it's the perimeter of this sidewalk cafe that we have to measure from the tables, if you're putting planters out you're, making that your perimeter well but I think but the planners that stopped before those boxes too right.
Think that's fine I, the only thing I might ask, because you aren't you know the tables are a little bit further to the east, maybe just to help pedestrian movement.
That makes more sense, possibly yeah, just I think just to keep the perimeter out there of some sort and then there's a clearance, that's required for that this mesial, but I just-I my concern would be if this is where your service I was coming out.
You're gonna have your patrons trying to get in the sidewalk, cafe your waitresses and waiters trying to get by and pedestrians that could make it a little tight just right in that little section, and you can devise a way to change what the perimeter is like right there.
I wasn't seeing that when I was looking at that, but I think the server's would come in and out through the 13th Street entrance on that far side they wouldn't necessarily have to go.
We heard that the issue is the edge of your sidewalk cafe on 13th Street ends up abutting the beginning of a series of street furniture and fixtures that may make it difficult to get by I mean the alternative is to shorten it by a table, but it works technically as now correct, mm-hmm, there's nothing wrong right.
Leave that determination up to do fine, yeah, I'm, south of them on south of the proposed by buck a fanny search, Street, and ask that a resolution be devised to perhaps create more space between the sidewalk cafe and the newspaper the newspapers stands.
Yeah I would rather try and let miss Benson I call it a table mm-hmm all right.
It has the eight feet of minimum clearance, which, if you know there was less, we could question it, but I mean I'm not really in favor of fourth Avenue.
We have 8 feet so I'm in support personally mm-hmm I, don't know it's I, don't know what you're talking about cause I, don't think any place on 4th Avenue other than the hotel has a actual DBA per minute.
I think it's called the damn palak and he has bench yes, okay, they don't have tables just benches yeah, okay, all right!
The second, with state with the application, consists of in terms of what heaps and tables are requesting and at proposed hours of operation and where the seats and tables would be located, and the third would say that, whereas clubs would say that we have a concern about the clearance between the planters proposed to be located around the sidewalk cafe on East Third Street ie, 13th Street and the newspaper different sensors located south of the proposed cuts out this north of the proposal.
I think that would do it yeah, but I, don't know how that works, because I'm pretty sure that they're out there to permit, which is why we see them consistently in the same place and for the same newspaper.
Yes, one know: you're everything: okay, we're gonna, move on to number three now I'm, sorry, so Brenna and Nina.
Okay, so yeah I got it if you want to go ahead, Alex in it and give a summary of the application.
We approved in March of 2019 with stipulate a stipulation to operate a full-service American restaurant, serving food, all hours having kitchen open and serving food all hours having hours of operation of 4:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday 4:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. Thursday through Saturday closing at Posada ten playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming, just having happy hours to 7:00 p.m. now hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight lines outside and having staff outside or responsible for controlling noise and crowds outside.
We've been embraced with open arms and everybody seems to like what we're doing there and we're looking forward to opening up again eventually and we're asking for community board members help, but this cafe the sidewalk cafe their weight and sense of open we're seeking for, as you know, we're seeking for 13 tables and 26 chairs.
So, at this time, we're just wondering if it's possible to get the cafe license, which would tremendously help us and I feel like it will also help the community as well just open up the doors making 6th Street a little more enhanced to the eye.
All days correct, yes, okay, I, don't think there was.
Starting on January 1st non-crime corrected means they required a police response and they found a condition that required them to say something to you or the manager, and 18 is a high number even for a year and ten non-contracted of 18 is a high number of non crime corrected as far as I know, and we do have a neighbor upstairs that we have an issues with he's been calling constantly the police on us he's complaining by noise.
If it's more than one person, then you should know that right so that you can address the issue, but they have the ability to tell you whether or not it's one person or more than one person, okay, so what I would suggest is working with them, but also just you know, I know you had been open before and it does I even thought to myself.
It looks like it would just be a little tight with what yeah it won't be tight, but I think would be enough space for the two people to see they come from server -.
At the other side, there is the phone booth furniture which are fixed furniture like specifically at the far end I guess it would be the North End, where the phone booth is I, don't think, there's enough clearance there for a sidewalk cafe.
This is more than two peaks yeah, so like I, don't think that there's enough clearance between your sidewalk cafe and the phone booth at that end for it to be there even for the weight line, I, don't think!
This is nine feet: they're measuring it as nine feet, eight inches from here right, but then all this street furniture is here so I, don't know how he walks yeah, that's all fixed up, considered, fixed furniture, and you have to have an 8-foot clearance between the furniture and the edge of your sidewalk.
Is there cheese I mean we're looking at your plan and it doesn't appear that can be because your plan has five and five feet: four inches for the single table and in order to accommodate a wait, aisle right, you need to have a weight aisle that's set five and a quarter which leaves a remaining nine and eight inches and a quarter.
What Department of Sanitation would let you, but it seems to be thick there for a reason, I think there could be a space in here where he could put a table or but I don't know again.
So that means the garbage can would only be able to take up one foot eight inch in order to have eight feet of clearance right, and so that's why we're getting rid of that one if we get rid of that one table that table there below yeah so that one's out.
I just that space to me looks like I can fit two unless I'm missing something I think this is too much for us to try to.
I, would approve only like one single row of tables along East, sixth Street, and then my expectation would be that they would have to be flush against the facade of the building.
However, your devising that so that means either they sit in between your open windows that don't fold back flat or you keep your windows closed so that you can accommodate your sidewalk cafe right to see how on the easternmost portion are the westernmost portion of the sixth Street, which is the farthest into the block.
Do you understand that we still think it's an issue about how your doors open and whether or not you can accommodate the sidewalk cafe the way we think it needs to be accommodated which is on this and we get that you said: doesn't have much life to it, but sixth Street is a residential street, which is why it doesn't really have that many tall cafes.
Okay, so it'll begin with where it's closed, it's just what the application is for a second, where clause which outlines what the sidewalk cafe consists of in terms of number of tables and see it's where they would be located in proposed dollars that were having reviewed, submitted diagram.
67 tables at 87 tables and fourteen seats in a single rose to talks against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side of the business Ellen.
It would be one row of two top tables of seven tables and fourteen seats against flush against the facade of the building on the East sixth Street side, as if it said, okay do I have to include none on First Avenue.
All right now know that I put that into the resolution and then the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe would be 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. all days.
This is a rest prod for whom we approved administrative leave proved a wine beer license in February of 2017, with stipulations to operate a full-service restaurant at a Japanese, high Stuckey Styles tasting menu and a kitchen serving food open and serving food during all hours of operation, with hours of operation of 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. all days, no use of outdoor space.
So I'm going to ask the applicant to speak to that, because photographs of the location, the way it exists down and as advertised show two counters where the chef works in between with seven feet so on each kids like sitting on each counter.
We had yet to come in that asked, for you know like an after-dinner beverage, and since we only have a right now, we didn't have anything that we could offer them, so that kind of you know encouraged us to pursue this more and now I guess even with the situation given I think that we just need any anything that could help us survive when we reopen I, think just even having this you know, liquor license could help even just a little bit of increase in sales for us to, in addition to, of course, providing a better experience for our guests, I did want to add I understand the concerns about having other you know, 15 other establishments in the area that already have full liquor licenses and we're not a bar were we're very quiet, we're not where we only really limit our seating.
So even the residents in our building the signed, our petition there they're supportive of us so I- think that's encouraging for us to also hopefully apply for this liquor license also with the other restaurants in the neighborhood are Japanese restaurants in the neighborhood we have like papayas and sushi restaurants and I know it's not gay bars, but we're quite different from that right now.
Don't know whether the committee has thought about that, and if there are any ways we could possibly address that also just the hours is it in, because I think the beer and wine had slightly later hours and I just would be concerned about it going until 2:00 a.m. like right now, you're.
So well as long as it's still tsukimi and it's under our ownership, we definitely don't intend on opening late I mean even you know, even if we try to do more than one seating, it's actually gonna be physically difficult for our team, but in terms of the yes right now we because of our concept, we haven't been able to do delivery or takeout, unfortunately, we're just relying on you know some of our even some of our neighbors, who have actually bought gift certificates for us to you know, keep us open when we reopen you're concerned about us, possibly changing our concept or philosophy.
I guess I can you know I can only say you know say verbally, but yeah and we've been thinking about this restaurant for so long and we're so lucky that we found the space in the East Village, which we myself and our partners.
I think the concern here is what, if you guys, don't survive by the end of the year and you already, you know we would approved a spot that was not like license before right.
How big do you know offhand how many square feet your total space is think it's like 700 square feet about yeah cuz.
Yeah, because you as opposed to only and you know the application- should be what exists now so good thing that exists now are 230 counters of what sighs two counters, but it's not and we don't actually serve sushi.
That's why I said is that it can you approximate the length of the counters just so I know that help yeah it's a little bit different is what you originally were proposing.
Yes, okay, so it's kind of like an immersive meal experience with people, so this front section with this little this little entryway and bar counter.
Think I would be okay with this, maybe reluctantly, but and nothing against nothing about your business Karen, but just in general, with our you know our kind of history and what we generally approve but I.
You know, I think you mentioned early hours, it's not going to generate a lot of street traffic.
I mean I think all of those things we could put in there to support going out of the norm and approving something like this on a residential side street okay, in which case the resolution, would the first paragraph to say that this is an upgrade application and where what the application consists of, which are the element that has described as a summarize in the application that it was previously administratively proved a wine beer license in February 2010 and the stipulations that were approved at that time, that its license was issued.
You have I mean I know you said right now, you're generally having one seating, but if you are gonna have two seatings, because it's I think what Alex said, because it's a residential street, you know you can't have, even if it's only 14 people waiting outside at 8:30 or whatever blocking, is sidewalk or anything waiting for the next seating.
If you are gonna have seedings, you know, I, don't know if you have a text system or something where it's specifically that they would show at a certain time, so that they're not waiting outside at all we're definitely going to have to the time of reservations and also we're giving ourselves at least 30 minutes to prepare in between so that, okay, all right, they can actually come in.
I, don't know whether that I think maybe a year is a little bit too short.
We might get too much pushback I'm thinking, maybe my thought this is just me- is something like 18 months just because that gives us a full cycle of a year to one and sure they're gonna remain open to we get through all of the seasons, because, if even if they open in July, they may not really get started until August September October they've missed the summer.
You know if we do 18 months, I, think that gives us enough time to really see how they're operating, how do I mean they're different from season to season?
Of the 14 sounds a little more comfortable to me, but I'm open to I'm, open yeah discussion, I mean I just kind of picked 18 months, because I feel like for some reason.
I've got this petitions I've done other things, then I could come and I'm like, but you know, maybe in ten months once we've warmed up and we've proven ourselves, but by the next season.
So it's encouraging people to come before us, rather than get in ministry of labour well to come before us if they want their business to evolve in a certain way within a certain amount of time, as opposed to there are a block of businesses that fit into that administrative approval that are like the wine bar that just stays open till twelve and has recorded music or the restaurant that is open till eleven is that you know sit-down restaurant like a Italian.
Is you know this and I said they've been closed for several months and they pretty much they're like?
