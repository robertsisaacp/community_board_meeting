If you're, not a community board member, we're gonna, ask you just to type your name into the chat field so that we can have attendance that way we are recording this meeting and the video and the chat box gets recorded.
We are recording this meeting and if you've just joined us, if you're, not a member of the community board, if you can just type your name into the chat box, that's how we're taking attendance in lieu of you signing in the sign-in sheet, which we would do at an in-person meeting, can I ask the person with the 3 for 7 phone number that ends in 798 just to identify yourself so that we know who you are.
So if you need or have a question answered about the technical portion, Michaels running production and also to Ryan who's, taking notes for this meeting, our first parks and waterfront meeting some members of the public we're going to use the raise hand, feature to ask questions, and that will happen after the community board.
It would be February's minutes because we do not meet in March I know everyone read them and memorized them, so we're gonna go ahead and vote on approval of those minutes and Michael said best way to do.
You want to go ahead and do that: Trevor Holland, yes, okay, Webster, David, Adams, yes, you're on Altman, hey, yay, Carlin Chan, yes, Ryan Gilliam, yes, palutena Jones, yes, Michael Moreno, yes, Carolyn Ratcliffe, yes, Robin, Chatel, yes, Josephine, Aviles, Josephina I, know she's wrong.
Everybody knows where it's located in Arkansas, the northern edge of the drive through the budget is 6 million from the mayor's office, and the project is roughly 2,300 square feet next slide, please I'm, sorry yeah, so the goals of the project are to upgrade the existing restrooms to bring them up to Toronto such great parks, maintenance of operation, space at the first day left card, locker room spaces to the building reconstructing interiors, which in this case, are for back and space to clean and partially report the exterior brick to do new windows and door as required and utilities, including an oil to gas conversion.
There is office space and locker room space on the left or western leave of the building and the eastern building there's an office space and there's also a mechanical space with the stair wrapping around it and in the center of course, is the loggia, and this is the existing concrete ramp that we are addressing in this project as well.
If you notice on this plan, the new men's entrance on the left to the furthest western edge of the building and the new women's entries on the right is the furthest eastern end of the eastern wing of the building.
These two instances are essentially being relocated if you flip back the slide one more time, you'll notice that the current configuration show is the man's edge it's tucked in next to the office space and the women's actions based on the eastern wing.
You know and other people to come in and to essentially muster in the morning and to have meetings as required to maintain the property and its rightful place.
If you go back, one slide, you'll notice here that the existing concrete ramp only took one day of the loggia, and you had the continuous steps that ran across the back of the loader you'll notice that if you move forward, one will lose those steps and we'll put the switchbacks clear that area so we'll essentially occupy three Bay's of the loggia space.
If you go back, one slide, you'll see here that the area between the ramp blow to Memorial is actually quite tight, and so we didn't really feel that was an appropriate use of space and it was, it was cutting off circulation, east and west across the back of the building.
One slide, please so we're able to recapture some of that circulation space and that's going to be important for us, because, as we get further into the presentation, you'll see how we modify and the fencing on the eastern edge of the building to allow for more circulation.
If you look at the office space and the M&O wall storage area, this is now one open space, and this will allow for mustering of staff in mornings and during meeting hours, and also for the volunteer staff and seasonal staff, as required to the right of that you'll notice.
This is a slide whilst when we start to discuss some of those changes to the fenced in area, east of the building, which is quite an eyesore, has always been something we wanted to address.
You'll see that dotted line is a chain-link fence currently from the pool which is just off the top of the screen down to the building with a chain-link fence that turns a corner and closes off that entry to that rear garden area frogging the eastern portion of the park.
That door will be the main entrance to the women's room and you'll notice that a window will replace the existing door on the left side of that bay, and then that will be a window that flexible or lockers face for the lifeguards.
These windows were trying them to take them to the same sill height as were original to the building, so you'll notice that the existing window is a lot smaller than the proposed window, and this is something that we like to do to bring our buildings back to their original condition, so we're clearly taking that attitude here next slide, please and in those similar condition on the western wing.
Okay, again this we will mirror the wing to the right with the obvious differences that here we have three windows in the in the office area of the building, whereas previous climbing, so one window and those against our to match the existing condition of the building next slide, please.
Please- and here we are in Volusia, on the right and at the western end of the building on the left, so you'll notice at the existing West elevation.
It'll match the new doors going into the other areas of the building, as will the entry to the girls room immediately to the left.
The arts, constant, the breakage ABA signage and the concrete for the for the ramp itself and we'll be putting in our standard deep and real at the ramp, will be putting in double hung windows with the divided lights to mimic the multi light windows, DP, art, standard steel, fencing, seven feet to match the western edge of the building will be printed replanting a tree, and that would be the promised economy and that's pretty much the project I know it's a lot.
Well, first of all, I want to say that I think, as you can see, from the presentation, Jorge and his team have put a lot of thought and care into this project and a book and have considered every single detail virtually I believe but number one I'm pretty sure that the renovation of this building has been a long-standing community board, 3 a budget priority.
The second point I want to make is that, obviously, this project provides a dual benefit to the public, which will have a much more pleasant to surrounding and better conditions in the bathrooms and to the Parks.
Department employees will have better working conditions, and a third point I want to make is that it is that this design allows for much better use of the space that's available in the building and by moving the mechanical room and giving us space for a first aid room and the locker rooms for the lifeguards.
Think probably the easiest way is the raise hand feature, and then we can call up people on the phone you just hit star nine.
To raise your hand, the other thing people can do Trevor, if you want is they can just type their question into the chat field and just repeat it to a horray.
Thinking you know, I see four rooms dedicated to bathrooms and I see if it's an opportunity here, a lost opportunity to have some kind of indoor public space for community usage, for you know any parks, programming that might happen or and or any possible for the Friends of the park now or the concern any Conservancy that might come to the future, and so given that I want to know why we need four bathrooms and can't we just again go for a gender-neutral bathroom.
We could eliminate two of these rooms and create a public indoor public space that the community can use for events question for you more than for me: okay, very good, well, I'm, just an interesting question and you know I think what we have here is is unusual circumstance where we have separate bathrooms available for boys and girls, basically to serve daycare centers and others who prefer to have their or our kids come into a separate bathroom and not be not get mixed in with others.
Is that something that the community put forth and because I know, there's also been a lot of talk in with all these Park buildings and in normal locations in our in three that there's no community space available indoors in any of these parks?
We actually appreciated the fact that there was a separate inside bathroom for the children to utilize when they, you know when they went to the sprinklers and the swimming pool area, to say to Robin and I do understand what you mean about having genders fest non gender specified restrooms, but I think that would be an additional bathroom for that particular part, because that park is a haven for people that are transient and people that utilize different areas of the park like the dog, walkers and so forth, and so on.
We are inundated in the warm weather with the travelers aka pumpkin grunge, okay, a lot of them a heroin users I think that one of the reasons why Tompkins Square has maintained that specific area for the children with the sprinkler and with the separate bathrooms, has a lot to do with that.
Seven but Susan told me there were more, so you attract a large number of people at different times that there the park ends up serving and not everybody wants their preschool or toddlers dealing with some of those issues.
This balance is so gross I'm, never taking my kids with them at all, but I'm glad they'll be fixed, so I'm not arguing about against the need that everyone is saying about boys, room for kids and the daycares, but again I'm going back to parks to say you know.
Thank You, Ryan I'm, just gonna ask some quick questions before we see if we can get a couple questions from those who are also on soon, but not community board members, the budget and I know that's a big question for a lot of city projects.
So you know, hopefully things will be back to normal by then okay, thank you, I'm, looking to see Michael, do you see anyone who has joined and not a community board member who's once asked a question or comment?
Robin mentioned is an existing restaurant to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at a first date, lifeguard locker room spaces in the building, reconstruct the interiors to clean, partially repoint, exterior brick new windows and doors, and these include a gas conversion also I mentioned this- is a budget priority for cd3, a better use of space, better use of overall space for these this particular building?
Yes, if I may you may also that we're providing a da accessibility I'm just going to repeat what Steve said to provide a da accessibility which is crucial, ah and I'm, trying to figure out a way to incorporate some of Robins concerns, including that parks consider to use some of this space for to a lot some of the space for community use or for community programming, and those are all the things Steve.
Was there anything else, because we're really just doing this drafting this right now well, I think you I think you basically covered the main points that I had I seen wrong, but I tell you what I would like to what I would like to suggest to Robin is that I will look into the possibility of using the lifeguard locker room for some community space.
Okay, so I'm gonna, add that since it came from Steve Thank You Robin I really go to Val. First I think one of the things I didn't hear was that people or parents and daycare centers like the idea of children's restrooms in terms of one of the, whereas is I, think that should be one that is highly desired, that there's a boys and the girls restroom, and so I didn't hear that so I think where that should be one of the, whereas is okay, I'm gonna figure out a way to rephrase it, but I think that's important and we're gonna put and, as Steve has mentioned, to repurpose the lifeguard locker room into the community space.
Think we need to also consider the fact that many of the community members who use it and have family or children in the area really appreciate the fact to do this.
It's understood, Ryan I just wanted to add so we're putting in that the lifeguard locker room area could possibly be used.
There are a lot of schools as been mentioned, that use it of the schools all have their own space and then I'm, not sure who would be using it for what like I said, it's you know as far as the people that actually use the playground.
There's probably gonna have to come back to us at some point, even though it's going to be DC now, but I think they just want to take a look at it.
You have another commoner question just when you went to the thing about the first aid room, I'm like I, just kind of think.
So I think that should be wanted aware, as is that they did allocate space for a first aid room.
I think, okay, two more and then we're going to try and get this resolution together or at least add some bullet points.
So it's not like there's great public access going through the pavilion area into the children's play area and that's something that you need to think about as well.
So unless Parks is going to change that the suggestion about the tennis of the locker room for the lifeguard that has access to the outside to the public area and it doesn't infringe on having people go into an area, that's reserved for children, Thank, You Carolyn for that particular lass, I think Steve's going to take it back and take a look at it.
But I'm gonna go to Susan Carlin has said disregard, so I'm gonna go to Susan again, okay, I just wanted to say as far as first aid for the kids, you know, there's often not staff there.
You need to read it: okay, upgrade existing restrooms to code, upgrade parks, maintenance and operation space at first aid and now I know we need to change that language, but as first aid, Locker lifeguard locker room spaces in the building.
Think one of the points, though, with the lifeguard, is the fact that you have staff that can utilize the equipment in the first-aid room.
You know okay and we're gonna expand on that language and I agree with you, I just I'm just trying to get the bullet points of what we talked about.
So does anyone want to I, don't quite understand what is like the beginning statement, I'm trying to we're writing this resolution on the fly and we're voting to approve that you're actually right willing to approve the Thompson Square Park, the post-renovation field house, recollection Steve!
We do have and I don't know, trying to see who's left on the phone, because I thought we might give able to get a tox report before we close the meeting Steve.
Yes, if you want to give us a brief update in as far as projects in our area and I know, everything is going to change, but you know well, actually, I should be prepared for this and I'm sorry that I'm not but basically but most of our capital projects that we're in construction have been suspended.
But you know a lot of our spaces unfortunately have closed and I guess a concern that they were people were not following the social distancing guidelines.
Last week there was probably like 25 guys in there working out together, and none of them were practicing social distancing and then the other question I have, and this one might be a little bit harder for you to answer is because we don't know sort of when this will end and when things will well when construction will start again.
But when that does happen, is there it's parks planning on communicating what the new timelines are on projects that were small to your first question, the fitness equipment situation is dead, a concern of ours, and it's something that is that is under discussion and I would not be surprised if we ended up closing down those areas as well, but I think we're looking at that right now, so there may be a decision on that.
Thanks: okay, one last one from Robin, hi I, hope that, like over 90 nights and hit the parks community too hard, and on that note, I'm wondering if the parks is still going to continue to bring on its seasonal employees at the same numbers or what the plan is for that day.
I will check on that and, if I find out anything I'll, certainly let the Trevor- and you know, Thanks, just one last question and follow up on what Robin said: we've heard numbers from the Transit Authority, the fire department and other city agencies as one if you, if you had any indication of how the parks staff, including the frontline workers, are being affected.
