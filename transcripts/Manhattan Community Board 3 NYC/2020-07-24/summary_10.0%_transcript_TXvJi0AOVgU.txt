Can you hear us alicia technology's awesome all right, so I'm gonna get the meeting going while alicia figures out her technology.
Yep daily should drop off yeah she'll be back okay, I'll come back michael mourino, yes, lisa kaplan.
So if that's herman just hit star nine to raise your hand and I'll know, that's herman, okay, anisha, stephen, yes, melee!
As far as people who are now returning to the workplace and what protections they should be expecting from their employers related to covid this, I can't think of his name right now, but a council member from the upper west side did a similar town hall with her last month that I attended, and I thought was really well done, which is why I asked if we can do it down here for our residents and we're partnering with margaret chin's office and paulina rivera's office on this as well.
Could I ask you what the information you gave about needing the waiting room and all that who is that coming from zoom zoom sent out a like an email update?
I guess reported that last meeting about avenue b the resolution we did on avenue b so after we had a meeting which we discussed, the fire department objections to closing part of avenue b after that dot went and closed avenue, b between second and third street right around the corner of the fire department without notifying the fighter fire department, they're closing it for friday evenings and weekends for restaurants.
Last friday the fire department was not on the call, but dot's answer to this was that they can take the they can get out and move the barricades, which of course, is going to add time what it seems to me that they're doing instead, they I'm suddenly seeing a lot of fire engines on those days, come west to avenue a and then turn north on avenue, aid which does tie up traffic and I'm sure it adds time to it.
That they've now asked cau to work with them and notify community boards, so I got a call the other day that they restaurant owners want to close avenue c.
I suggested to them that it would be a lot better if the village alliance were in charge rather than just putting restaurant owners in charge and they have gone to them and it looks like that might happen, which I think will keep it in much better shape, and I think oh, we don't have a second exact meeting scheduled for august.
In regard to your question about a second meeting, I mean, I think the question really is right back to you and the rest of the staff, because you know: do you guys feel like that?
I don't feel that way, but then, like with the last meeting thing, you know things just keep coming up.
It sounds like he's going to do that and one of the things that where it helps to have a bid, I know not everybody sees it this way, but the bids do require compliance to the physical setups and other compliance like no outdoor music and that kind of thing, and he was telling me the way he's able to have businesses comply in his areas.
I was a little disappointed to hear the captain basically use the word discretion, which means that they're not really going to be doing much as the mayor's office or any of the public officials talked about solutions for the covet 19 uptick in young folks, because they're not enforcing, or at least as far as I can see, the police aren't enforcing social distancing or mask anymore.
You know I'm going to certainly bring this up again tomorrow morning at the borough service cabinet meeting, and it's not community board three, it's you know it's probably most of the city, but very certainly all of manhattan, I'm not alone in reporting these, and I do not know what to tell you.
The other thing I just wanted to remind people as david used to and as michael sometimes does, when you vote in the beginning of the meeting and to adjourn you don't need a motion, you don't need a second and when you take minutes, you really shouldn't be using anyone's name, you know so, and so second it it's just what our corporate minutes format is just to report on what was discussed so it'll just to make life easier for all of you just vote on those.
I have spectrum, I don't know, what's happening all right, do you want to turn off the meeting or do you want me to do it?
Yes, okay, so good, all right, and if I get booted off michael you're going to have to pick back up.
I think there's only two committees that met since the last time that we met it was sla, so nothing to report okay and then it was next yeah.
They also came to the meeting, and the committee asked a lot of questions and the development team would address those questions in the next presentation and we also finalized the district statement.
I think everybody else met right and- and you spoke before landmarks susan- you have a question go ahead.
I just I saw that michelle made a comment about the broadband report that I had sent to everybody, and I just wanted to make sure that people look at it and look at our community.
There's no downside, but I think if we just have to be very careful to understand how many people- that's not reaching yeah it's funny, because michelle's comment was, I think, related to all of the internet connectivity issues that will be happening of what I sent out and I just want people.
Those dots allow you to change, who sees the chat or who can chat so like right now for our meeting.
I know a lot of folks wanted to happen.
We only had maybe what two comments, michael, where people were trying to make statements, but once they realized that it was only going to host it sort of stopped, so I found it to be extremely effective in stopping second meetings, thanks all right alicia back to thank you.
They, the committee, worked on the district needs statement and they will need another meeting in august in order to finalize that which I think carolyn communicated to susan today.
I wanted to ask first of all, if you know I know it's unusual and hard to have a meeting right before the exec, but if I could be notified like the next morning, because so what I did is I removed the committee from the agenda, sent it out and then had to revise it.
I want to just also suggest that since they're already on the economic development committee for a report for august 5th that they bring what they've done for the district needs statements, because in the past that I know, there's been some confusion about how much to include- and I think you're really good- to be able to look at what they've done so far.
No blame real, I'm just asking I'm just letting people know that it can make a difference to notify early rather than late absolutely, and I will communicate with carolyn to make sure that, like we're in better communication about that, the one thing I would say about having this on the economic development agenda for august, like an update from the committee, is that no actual revisions to the district needs statement happened last night.
You know like doing any extensive work on the district needs and there's a I guess that goes into okay.
Okay, because you know you think it's funny.
If you want okay, thank you.
