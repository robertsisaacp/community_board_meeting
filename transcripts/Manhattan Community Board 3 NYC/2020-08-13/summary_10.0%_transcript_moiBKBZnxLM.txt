The prospects of new commissions and projects are, I think, it's non-existent since theaters want me to change that, for you, yeah, please theater's venues and all live performance initiatives are get indefinitely, shuttered that the economic hat that the arts and cultural sector is receiving will last for three to five years depending on sector specificities, artists and cultural workers, or the creative capital of new york are integral to the creative industry, capital that fueled new york's tourism and export economy for years.
The city should create a wpa style program to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as impacted arts and cultural industries rebound okay down to the next page.
The city's annual budget has become more constrained, so support for small vulnerable arts organizations is not certain in cd3 neighborhood, art venues, libraries, community, gardens and parks provide local, often low-cost access to cultural programming and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects such as designated arts and cultural spaces.
The mayor's office of media and entertainment and dcla should support a neighborhood level, trilingual data and communications platform for the many cultural spaces and projects located in our districts to share information on programs and learning opportunities, dcla the mayor's office of recovery and resiliency and the new york city.
I think there's still a lot of information that was from the 21 district needs statement, so you know we should figure out if all of these different pieces continue to be the priorities that we want for fy22.
I think you know maybe not having this entire long list of priorities and figuring out like because the pandemic is such an extraordinary situation and it has disproportionately affected arts and culture.
I think that there's we really wanted to be like as specific as possible to the needs and to the district, and you know you know like, for example, the last one.
I think the I don't know maybe anisha would have a better answer to this, but is the budgetary cut, like obviously we're saying in the introductory paragraph of the cuts and the effects that they've had, but is that really, I don't know, does that?
Does that work in a district needs statement that number I don't think like particularly?
I think the bigger challenge is that you know dcla didn't reduce the size of their budget and they're still sort of committed to giving grants and funding from you know, council or other places to arts and cultural organizations is at least my understanding, but it does mean that, like we don't know, that's for 21, we don't know what 22 will look like.
What's in the council members budget yeah right, because normally the way that most small arts organizations are funded through dcla is through a 5 000 grant from the discretionary funds that goes through dcla.
So I don't know quite how you know if you cut it out that it's going to reflect what the actual reality of the situation is, I think we could say something like local non-profits rely on city council, discretionary funding for their operations and for fy fy21, which is what I believe, oh yeah.
We say I don't know okay, so it's all right, so I think you could say instead of unconscionable that the funding reduction to a district has been.
I you know I didn't work on this little piece of it, so I'm not sure if all right and then tariq had a comment in the chat, can we add, rely on discretionary funds both for operations and for programming right, because that is one of the advantages of dcla is that you can use funding for administrative expenses as well as for the programming, and there are very few grants that fund administrative expenses.
So it is the way that many small organizations help to meet some of their administrative expenses, as well as to pay for the programming right so linda, if we could add in for their operations and programming right here, yes, operations and programming, and then I think the period there and then this year or like in fy, 20 and 21., I'm going to say that in fy, 2021, okay, I think also too, where it's.
Okay, then, you could take out the numbers, but it's, I think, a 98 budgetary cut that drastically reduces funding for organizations within for arts organizations within the district right yeah.
Okay, let's start over here now, let's see so, we said many local non-profits rely on city council, discretionary funding for their operations and programming in fy 2021.
I'm sorry, I wish I could type that would help right, yeah man well, computers would sometimes be user-friendly, drastically reduced funding to arts organizations within the district.
I think carolyn's last point was many at the very top of the second word should be many local or third words, non-profit yeah right here.
I don't know that you necessarily need to say that, at least in my I mean, I think what this was one of olympia's points.
What olympia was trying to say is that, even though dcla has still a budget and like a huge budget and is still committed to funding arts organizations, it's the fact that city council in our district had their budgets cut the mechanism through which that money comes which does come through dcla.
Can you make a comment there and maybe we could move on from this point and then see what other things are in the document, and then we can right on here right yeah, since I don't know how to do it.
The other way I'll just put it in here, okay llmc and what is the comment lower manhattan cultural council is funded through dcla and so expanding the amount of money that goes to to lower manhattan.
I know that if you're reallocating funds through dcla that they could give it lmc allen cc lower manhattan cultural council yeah, that's it linda.
Okay, maybe if we like, if anybody else has any sort of like global comments like any sort of big picture things that we should that people think are left out or you know, maybe should be cut altogether sort of that kind of level yeah.
So there is a question from jack in the chat that I can answer, so the discretionary funding is actually I distributed from directly from I mean through the city council, so the they are a different budget line than what we would like to use.
The question is, the city will prioritize certain needs, and so, as arts and culture committee, what we can say is this sector is worth of being prioritized because it had the huge impact because it serves the people who have been most impacted, etc, and so I don't think you need to go crazy about finding the way that they can do.
Are you still there yeah I'm here, I'm just thinking more along the lines, just I'm in the school system, and these cuts really affect our ability to run after school programs, and I don't know if we could.
Do you like visuals at least olympia, sorry say that again you mean right in this bulleted list yeah we can add one more bullet and just say that we want also dcla and mom.
I don't know if you work with music also, it can be also dcla only collaborate with doe and create grants for cultural organizations that are giving support services and after school services to you, know, public schools in our district, it's sort of including remote learning so and that's a complete sentence.
Please, and I will type it in yeah, okay for now we're actually on blended learning in this district that I don't think it's gonna work, but you know that's what they're telling us so thomas you wanna say it or I should you wanna, try it.
So I would say local schools- and you know I mean like after school programs right, yes, local schools, including remote learning, including mama, says point.
I mean I think the funding streams can cover anything they want if they want remote learning, if they want blended, whatever resources they need, you know, should we say flexible funding streams that can cover all the needs that these kind of organizations may have.
I don't know I'm being nitpicky about this, but then that last, that section provides support services, comma remote learning within, like I think, instead of saying instead of comma just put including remote learning and after school programs, would read a little better.
That is also focusing on like the more immediate needs as well, and maybe some of this language can go in there as opposed to district needs and as far as the after school programming yeah, I mean thomas we'll know about this too I mean we do have a similar need expressed in education, health services- that's expressed pretty similarly, but yeah.
I don't know if we want to single that out at all are extremely reliant on on income from performances and that sort of stuff, and without that happening for a year or more, it puts especially small and medium-sized or organizations at complete risk and without any kind of steady support they will shudder.
Actually, these people are can be evicted before right now, but I think those can be things that we consider for the reso, because those things the city, unfortunately, cannot do anything so you're, basically suggesting that this paragraph here about the majority of life.
That, I think, is a very fair concern that these people are not going to even survive, but the reasons they're not going to survive is if we don't do anything about the rent, because it's just you know they are expected to be paying the same amount of renting, but those have been sat down from the city and they have no ways of generating income.
Okay, I think I think andrea's comments are reflected in the district needs right now.
Okay, but I agree with andre also that, like out of all the different parts of the cultural landscape, performing art seems to obviously be the hardest hit and the center for urban future report that is referenced in you know this dns sort of reflects that all of the jobs in the performance, not all a majority of jobs in this performing arts have been workers have been laid off right.
So without that money there in the future being that it's going to take so long in our industry, I think very fun is really big in the coming years: okay, so susan thanks and thanks carolyn for inviting me along this evening, yeah I'm still new to this, but I've been coming to community board meetings since the fall, because I reoriented completely.
Yeah and it gets their attention anyway, so I know you're the need for the community, hopefully so you're mentioning the create nyc cultural plan, and I wonder if you're familiar with the people's cultural plan, yes and great, and the low east side of plan might be worth mentioning.
They're sort of the whole committee agrees to them, but there's not even you know you don't not even have a resolution to approve them, but I just feel that if we continue having general comments, we're not going to be able to do the work that we need to do, because the text is not there yet right.
What we did is we reviewed each paragraph and we asked for suggestions from people and comments from the committee about what they think needed to be included or deleted.
So my comment was actually related to the to like a specific point about the district needs that might fit in, and I was thinking about the the cultural plan point.
So I mean, if you want to be precise, we can add a sentence, but I think the sentence that is there is valid, but if people aren't still not able to access unemployment benefits, I think the difference is it's one thing if they are not applying for it before they were not able, just because they were not there like the federal and state were not even able to pay anybody you might have applied.
That's what this says, but I think the comment of sorry, I don't know your name of the person is valid, because what it's referring to is the fact that unemployment then has unemployment has already expired on july 31st and the general pandemic unemployment for which every worker can qualify is only extending through january for now yeah linda.
I guess that's the real sentence, but I don't know, but I'm trying a way to say that without having to go into all of the details, right, yeah, so much thing so much stuff could change between today.
To five years I think the negative economic impact yep that the arts and culture center yeah the negative right in front of economic, just put negative in front of economic, linda, negative, no negative is above in the line above it's in the lineup.
You've been doing pretty good about giving facts yeah so, but fundamentally, the only fact that what we're trying to say is you want to preserve workforce, because our city agencies have a way of preserving industries, and that means they give grants to the businesses and the organizations, but they don't understand that those don't always arrive to the workforce, and so that's why the rhetoric here was you love the creative industry, but you need to fund the people who fuel the creative industry, but if you think it's too worthy or obscure, we can just edit it.
I think it seems like it's a random sentence about how new york city is a creative capital based on tourism and not a connection between that workers work in the creative industries and we need to support them.
I think straightforward, or you know I think this is like that sentence is more for like why new york city cares about arts and culture, maybe not necessarily why community board 3 cares about, at least from my perspective, arts and culture, even though it is connected to tourism for sure yeah.
So I think it also, though, that first paragraph speaks to the points of the specific programs that we'd like the city to fund.
So I don't know if it needs to be said before we address the point yeah.
You know I mean if you think that we don't need to frame it and we just can ask for it without framing it.
Now we're going back here, yeah just put a width and I think you could get rid of the r okay.
I think that paragraph looks good otherwise, and I think the beginning of the next paragraph could be removed, and maybe we just focus on that last bit, which is special attention to local organizations that focus on the most impacted population that are low-income people of color, and I don't even know that it's we, I think what perhaps it's, that it's arts organizations that both serve and represent.
Good okay, perfect, but I don't know if any of these other things really are more needs than budget requests, because I didn't read through them: I'm not trying to dictate I'm not on your committee right.
But I don't know if that is something we put in the need or right olympia, because I think what you're?
I think there is a connection as linda pointed out between understanding that arts and culture is like the most.
This way it is the hardest hit sector right, besides, like general small business in new york city and very much so in our community board area, because there are so many cultural organizations, small theaters, and I think you can certainly say that.
Maybe it's not like there's a we know specifically that there's a program or funding that's needed, but that there should be funding, that's specifically targeted towards the cultural sector, because it does make up a significant share of the city's economy.
I mean yes, obviously that is what we're looking for, but through these things like cultural programming to reach, I wonder if there's a way to like shorten this and also make this a little bit more relevant to the time, because I think this is for.
Like I mean I work on the cultural plan, I think this is more like you know diversifying boards or like hiring people.
I don't think it's relevant to today's time, right now, with the changes that they have integrated into dcla and how they're operating the programs now that they require that in order to receive city funding that you have to have a diverse board, you can't receive.
So I don't know that, like that's what I'm saying is they've already adopted it and they've put things in place so that it's impacted on the arts, organizations that receive funding from them that they have to follow the create nyc plan going once going twice.
I think we could we're gonna have a lot of vacancy, and you know ryan from bad we're saying that more trying to keep organizations in their spaces new spaces right, so this paragraph can go yeah.
I don't think it needs to then let's go to the next point: okay, media and entertainment.
So I don't know if I think this ask of this like bullet point of mom could be a little bit different.
I think we should include mom in here, but I don't know if this specific ask is the ask, I wonder if you should change it into a need yeah.
I think if you changed it into it right now, it's like a budget request.
Carolyn I mean generally is an important request, but I don't know if it's a district need for 2022.
I mean it's a valid point, because there are a lot of artists who do work with us, so all right, yeah.
First week of october, yeah carolyn it's up to you as to whether you think this is in the shape that you want it to be presented to economic development for september or, if you'd like to october, pretty much tailored it down, and that you know that we need it to go to economic development for september vote so that it can be presented for the full board in september and presently I make a comment.
You may do you know when you start thinking of this need and this budget request.
