So thank you so very much linda for stepping up and doing this very important job and approving these four great individuals- linda's run it once I'm going to ask clint since he's our third sort of most prolific zoom person, But if you just if you just search community board three under youtube, you should find it I'm finding the channel 13 one cly manhattan community board three I mentioned that we were having we're preparing for the our first virtual election.
Only hearing about that, as actually all the elected officials and the community board, are working to resolve issues like find public space for the shelter residents and programming.
That kind of thing, so I was asked at first I was asked if the board could support project renault- You know, I give a reference on good neighbor, bad neighbor thing, so I have written a letter for project renewal as district manager.
I even talked about you know how we've had some of the residents several years ago come and testify at our board meetings to support a k2 resolution about k2.
I have information about complaints to all the elected officials, but if we have that, then I could document it in part of the resolution, if you think that's a good idea so like I could put in writing to you kind of one, what the police, the reports from the police today, which I think you know the fact that we got them after the meeting in response to his response, makes it pretty rational We have a policy of always having one office in lead, and so we have one office answer and just copy other offices.
I said that they should also- and susan told me they should loop in the community board because we deal with parks and streets and so many other things I should have added that to my report, but the doe has deemed because I my concern has always been what happens when the children return to school The first is the meeting went well, we had the center for urban future come and speak to us in addition to lesson.
Although I do have to ask a question to exact about the cag, because it's not listed as one of our task forces and subcommittees, because we are just a member, but I do need to give updates and they do they've already sent out one request to have a vote, and I need to know how we're going to proceed as a community board, because a lot of these issues are timely.
