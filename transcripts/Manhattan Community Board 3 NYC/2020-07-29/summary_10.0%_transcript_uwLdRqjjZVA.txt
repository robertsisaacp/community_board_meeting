She is going to be covering basically everything workers need to know, as people start returning to their workplaces and their offices, what protections their employers are responsible for providing in the era of program and what rules and regulations govern their objections and employment.
So I know for one I just got an email today saying we're back to work in the office on monday, so I'll be attending this to make sure I know what to expect when I get there, so registration is required.
In the era of meeting virtually we ask the speaker forms be submitted the monday before the meeting by noon, but we're gonna grandfather some people into that tonight who didn't get it in time, because virtual meetings are a challenge for all of us, so we're trying to be as fair as possible again you're going to be limited to two minutes and I'm going to be bringing the timer up soon to do that and we're going to start with valentina jones.
First of all, I believe the open meetings law applies and these meetings have to be public, since they include elected officials, community boards, city agencies, but even in the in the case of transparency.
These should be open to the community to observe since important information is going to be related and the community has a right to see both the questions and the answers that ddc surpr supplied.
I'm happy to see assemblyman epstein on the on the call right now, so I hope he will weigh in on having transparency obeying the open meetings law and allowing the public to attend the community advisory group meetings not to participate but to observe- and I would like this to be referred to a community board committee so that the community board will take a position on whether they believe the community action group meetings should be open to the public.
We can't go northbound and my concern is basically that we know we can get to 34th street, which is one of the two hubs where you can transfer to many other routes and for those of us who live all the way east.
The vice president in charge of this and all they're really concerned about is numbers of basically having a groundswell of people who are actually using it where otherwise, they will not at this point, unless there's a groundswell of sort of voices to basically try to get us more access, particularly now with covet of people not wanting to be in enclosed spaces of being able to be on the upper decks of the ferries, where you can be outside to actually have transportation to have this affected, and so I was just hoping that we would basically be able to get some community support to basically have some hearings, at least about getting us additional routes, so that we can now go north as well as south.
I believe we had an influx of people wanting to testify regarding the open streets, specifically avenue b.
I really just wanted to spend a short time thanking the transportation and public safety committee for supporting the open streets initiative and cb3 for supporting it and hearing testimony at the committee's meeting on people's experience with avenue b open streets.
We have seen some major improvement barricades, get replaced faster, they're, positioned in the correct spot, based on guidelines from the department of transportation and more folks come out to enjoy the streets at the transportation committee meeting.
We heard some concerns from fdny, but given the discussion we had and the various recommendations made, I'm fully confident that we can resolve the matter and make sure that fdny can get full access to do the great work that they do and our public health and safety initiative of keeping avenue b in open streets remains in effect and intact.
As a nycha resident myself, with limited space due to construction and scaffolding, having avenue b as an open street as an option to walk, is exciting and vital, and I thank you all for allowing me time to give this public testimony.
Now we're going to go to laura seawell hi, I'm laura sewell, I'm speaking today as a long-time neighborhood resident and the executive director of the east village community coalition in support of the transportation committee's resolution on the avenue b.
I've never seen such a groundswell of support for anything quite like this, so we really appreciate the transportation committee's efforts to identify several creative solutions that would help fdny improve their response times without sacrificing the health and economic benefits of the avenue be open street.
Community coalition- and I'm also here to speak in support of the transportation committee resolution on sending suggestions to the dot about how to improve the open street so that both the local residents, the local businesses and fdny's concerns can all be addressed, and we can have a more successful, more beneficial public environment for everyone involved.
We did a lot of work at the committee level, drafting a resolution that takes into account all of the stakeholders needs, and I think we presented a list of four or five really good options for not just you know, it's not even a situation where you know we're giving something up to placate these concerns, but rather we have a number of proposals that will both make the streets safer in terms of emergency access, while also giving more opportunities, for you know outdoor exercise, outdoor transportation, reducing pedestrian congestion and making it a more conducive place for things like the open restaurants and to help businesses that are struggling, and so I hope that the full board will support the resolution.
As a co-founder of lask and a former public member of cb3's transportation, public safety and environment committee and an east village resident, I wanted to formally introduce myself to the full board the new york city department of transportation, as you now know, made us an official partner of avenue b's open street in late june, and we are a group of east village and lower east side, community members, business owners and non-profit leaders who formed with the goal of stewarding and maintaining avenue b as a shared street for safe and socially distanced recreation.
This open street is a crucial public health need and no small joy to a community that has suffered greatly as a result of this pandemic.
We thank the board for supporting the open streets program and the community, the transportation committee who has been working to find the solution that will allow the avenue b open street to succeed moving forward, including their resolution earlier this month.
I do want to give us some numbers for your area and for the city, so new york city as a whole right now has a 54 response rate.
So if you cut the data just around your community board you're at about 56 so again a little bit higher, which is great, but still that's still only 656 of of the total people who live in cb3 and if you want to cut it by neighborhood, the lower east side is at 59 response and chinatown is at 53 percent.
I can pull up some other numbers if anyone needs that, but thinking about really about half of the city has responded to the census.
There was an article in the new york times a couple weeks ago about wealthier new yorkers being out of the city and that's a huge issue, because just because they just because they have the personal resources, doesn't mean that they can just not respond to the census, because they don't think that their neighborhood might need.
So I'm happy to answer any questions folks have about the census, and I urge you all to reach out to your friends and family, make sure that everybody you know has completed the census, and the last thing I will say is that we actually are running a week of action this week we're doing a big push during this specific week.
Yes, so you mentioned, this is the census week of action and, for example, if our community board wanted to gather some volunteers to do some outreach, maybe by phone or for example, by phone.
2020 have a list of residents in our area that we could call that you know, maybe you called before, and they didn't answer the census, so you weren't able to reach them yeah.
Just shoot me an email and we can talk about ways to do a phone bank specifically for your neighborhood, okay, great because some I mean there are many members who are already involved, maybe through their own organization, but some may not be involved.
You know to fill in the gaps absolutely, and I and I on that note- I'm going to put two two links, also in the chat here to so that, if folks are interested in actually signing up to volunteer with us, we have our weekly schedule.
So we've got one more question from our board chair, alicia, hi russell, and thank you so much for coming out tonight to talk to us about the census.
Obviously so we don't have, we don't have the actual responses we just can know based on what the public data that the census bureau is putting out and and yeah, so we're basing our information off of that.
Yeah russell, if you can, if you can maybe work on that and get it from whoever you need to get it from and then just send it to our district manager's office and share with us absolutely robin you've got the last question: yeah hi russell thanks!
We have dear neighbor letters that we can send you a packet of that you can distribute within your building, and that would be great and the last thing I want to say this is a common question that comes up.
Thank you for taking the time I just wanted to talk about a couple quick things.
If people want to come by we're in the office now on tuesdays and thursdays, that's on 7th street and avenue b, we'll have an opening with the lori's girls club on september.
You know we really need to talk about our small businesses and the struggles that they're having right now brad and I will be having a press conference tomorrow with a local group talking about how small businesses are struggling.
People are dedicated to the open streets on avenue b and they are doing such a service to our community.
We need to push our federal representative to put some revenue on the table, but if the senate doesn't do it new york's gonna be a fiscal mess, even if they do it, we're probably going to be a fiscal mess.
I also wanted you to know that I passed legislation requiring a public vote by the mta board if they, if they decide to reduce subway service, less than 24 7 after the pandemic is over.
Since the pandemic began, it's very frightening and we need to address it, I'm glad the senate passed it and then, and then finally- and you know a more light-hearted note, but not inconsequential for many of us, I've heard from a lot of constituents that it's like they're, damned impossible to cancel your gym membership during the pandemic, and it's intentional subscription services like gyms and other companies make it make it purposeful that you have to, like.
I mean I'm not talking about class warfare, but I will say this: it's my understanding that many of them do not complete the census because they don't want the government to know where their home address is for tax purposes.
Now. The truth is the government is not going to know your our colleague here from new york city census.
I know it's not easy working from home and it's we've been so busy and especially, I had to take a little bit time off to recuperate after the budget fight, but I think one thing that is really important in our community.
What areas like how we really gonna be able to you know help our small businesses- and you know restaurants, are closing a lot of our favorite stores are closing, but one of the dining out program has been successful, that a lot of restaurants have applied for permit to have outdoor dining and in chinatown we're actually gonna start one with d.o.t, rockwell group and hospitality alliance.
To close off, I mean to have a section on mars street that to have outdoor dining and that really nice furniture to make it more attractive- and this is one way hopefully can help some of the small business and the in the restaurant.
Today, in the city council, we had a stated meeting and I joined with councilmember powers, who is the council member form for the district number four and with borough president on a bill to temporarily repeal the commercial rent tax and that's the tax that the businesses pay on their and, on top of you know, from night south of 96th street to lower manhattan on murray street, and that includes chinatown on the low east side and you're.
So that will really help alleviate some more of the burden during this pandemic, and also we just passed a bill last month about supporting small property owner with some property tax relief, because we have a lot of you know: building in the lower east side and chinatown a tenement building and they provide affordable housing and tax bills were due in july, and we were able to get the bill passed that to give them the extension to october 15, and one of the things was to lower the penalty of the interest rate.
You know almost 115, you know 116 million dollars in our youth program, and I really wanted to thank all the nonprofits in our community that was able to step up and really ready to do this, to provide the services for our young people, and you know providing emergency food, domestic violence, funding all those things that we were able to say, but on the capital budget side, I'm really happy that we were able to provide funding together with councilmember, rivera and speaker to the clemente cultural center, to really put them back on the right track and also we're gonna.
You know we also provide a funding for exterior lighting for nature, believe it you know to make it brighter and safer, and we have to provide the funding from the city council to do that, and the rutgers community center is finally going to get a new stow so that they can have hot meal for their youth program.
But for our senior it was mainly saving all the north programs that are in our district, and we hope that our senior center will be open soon, because we want to make sure look.
It's going to be a new way of serving the seniors, but we just can't you know, keep these centers closed.
So that's one thing that we are you know continue to to advocate for and also you know, making sure that our public schools, you know, have all the resources and whether it's computer whatever so that they can take care of the student and that's still a big question, how school it's going to reopen, but we also got to make sure that they have the resources they need.
Thank you so much for coming tonight and speaking with us, I have a question about the nypd closing the streets in front of their precincts.
I think that the only one that I saw in your district was the fifth precinct, though, and the streets very close there, so yeah we'll have to look into it.
I mean they actually yesterday, whatever they just closed off part of mod street, to do the setup for a second sorry, I just wanted to drop for a second to clarify so she's, not not asking about the open streets program.
You know with all these the barricades going up we're still waiting for the respond, and I mean this is sort of like some of it.
Let's try with this first, you know how china well italians right the outreach you make it you make it successful and then people will want it.
Our final question for the council members from alicia lewis, coleman, hi, margaret alicia, not a question just saying, thank you again for supporting community board three, and you also and council member rivera for giving us discretionary funds and this very tight budget.
As a reminder, if you can try to keep your reports to two minutes, I'm not gonna put the timer on, but if I feel like you guys are going long, I will put the timer on andrew from mayor bill de blasio's office.
So we really need more federal funds and then, as we all know, there's a huge battle going on in in dc was was trump the president and the republicans not not wanting to give money to people, but they rather spent money to boost the stock market and and and in new york.
So the paycheck protection program that was passed by you know it's people can business can start applying.
If you know, if the current rate, if a lot of people are not responding to census and at the moment our district office is not yet open, but we can be reached at at 718-539-3650 for any constituent service, and you know we can also be reached by the congresswoman's website, also our emails.
But if you have noticed things as a consumer in new york or myself, I have noticed that I mean it's not as good as it was before march, but things are, you know like sanitizers masks and alcohol.
Also this you know, a lot of elected offices are giving them out for free and in fact I was out in sansa park on monday, with volunteers doing census, I mean we gave out free mask to anybody stopping by the table.
Can you find out for us and get back to our district manager and let us know sure I will yeah I will find out and get back.
So I don't want to talk individually like excuse me, but I do know that there are residents that have approached me in my own development that have said that.
You basically just said was that our rents are supposed to be readjusted according to our income, when you lose income, but management doesn't always catch up at the same time, at the rate that it happens, so they end up owing money anyway got it yeah I'll get back to you all right.
Also, I just want to say we're continuing to do ppe distribution work on unemployment cases, so if anyone needs any help with that, please feel free to contact our office.
Are there any questions for senator cavanaugh's office right we've got one more rep and then we're going to move on to our borough president who just joined us so isabel chandler from councilmember rivera's office good evening everyone.
Any questions for council member revere's office all right, we're going to move on to our borough president gail brewer gayle.
I know that that's the number one issue for a lot of parents, certainly for me, so I think they should not open I'll, be very clear and maybe for elementary, but custodians aren't ready.
I think that's what's going to happen, but what do I know?
We still need to find other spaces for students to meet, and maybe we can get some tents, I'm literally searching for tents, so that you could put an outdoor tent that might even work for elementary schools and other special events number two affordable housing, something that community board three is incredibly expert on.
I think I know there are many positions on board three, I'm aware of that, and there are many positions in the community, and so we will take them all seriously and have a process but very transparent and everybody's welcome.
I hope that we can come up with something quickly, because I know it's a great interest in business, non-profit, community everybody, small business is so challenging.
I think 32 000 are going to be distributed with food chinese food around the metropolitan area, thanks to a generous contributor, but we're not in great shape, and I think you know that there's a great map, it's called census, hard to count my favorite map in the whole world.
You know better than I know we worked on the avenue b, open street closure issue, and I know that in terms of the park and the scr they don't, they meaning the city doesn't seem to want to do infant blood interim blood protection measures.
I am concerned because teachers are not coming back from all the principles I talk to and they have reasons and they're legitimate and we can't do anything about it and then you have you know the custodians are terrific, but if they don't have the right system for the air and the window doesn't open and the filter doesn't change the the challenge of the air in the air conditioner.
Our board chair, alicia louis coleman, is going to take over the meeting michelle thanks.
Following our committee meeting two weeks ago, with the closure on avenue b, could you answer the about response times?
So what happens is when they respond they'll, head up east and then they'll try to turn north on avenue b when they they're met at sixth street with the barricades.
That committee asked for the second street reversal, but we this is the first time we heard about the delineators as a potential option.
I don't think d.o.t will be in favor of it only because it requires a lot of maintenance, two or three times over those delineators or I don't know exactly, but a number time over those delineators they're going to be knocked over.
I just want to be able to make sure the public has a risk time to respond after six months or so to see if it goes away.
Yeah and you know I see d.o.t doing a lot of street reversals throughout all five boroughs and as far as like fluidity of the grid, I think in manhattan.
I want to plan it because if people don't know that there's a place to respond, they may not.
If you want to take each question- and I can't I can't see- raised hands michael, can you see raised so trevor and david crane both have their hands raised right now?
Go ahead, I'm sorry what I did not hear from you and what I think is important, because I did hear four speakers in the beginning talk about the pleasure of having these streets open.
Can you tell us how important these seconds, or these minutes are for saving people's lives, because I'm a little concerned that we're hearing everyone talking about the fact of walking the streets?
Thank you, captain moye for coming, and I just wanted to ask you, because I'm not sure if you had a chance or you saw the resolution that we passed in our committee, because we had a couple of proposed solutions that we developed in conjunction with with with another rep from fdmy.
I think paul everything about removing the east 4th street because of problems there and then the other one would be to create some sort of solution where there would be no barriers on avenue b so that there wouldn't be impediments.
So that seems like the simplest solution and but I also had a question about the trap: the parked cars on avenue b- and I don't know if this could be added some friendly resolution to add that those stretch of blocks don't have any parked cars, which would also create more room for both pedestrians if you're going to do a pedestrian and an emergency access lane.
I mean, I think we pretty much covered everything that is possible as far as you know, simultaneously keeping this thing open and providing proper access for the fire department.
Well, I think that's why we wanted to ask you what was your potential ideas of what you would like to see happen for that firehouse on avenue b, like that's where we like?
So, yes, so avid you see, reversing is first, the delineators is second and then, if you could make up some kind of barricades block signage, that would be third, so just to be clear, you wouldn't want any streets to be reopened up like six, a tenth or anything like that.
For both I mean, I understand the need for the fire department and if a resolution could be worked out so that section between 6th and 10th street could remain open to pedestrians, because we have so many small children here in the neighborhood.
You know closed for pedestrians for use and stuff, because it's made a huge difference in our neighborhood to have people have access to the street in terms of safety david.
Now I actually don't think that going down 6th street is a safe way for the fire engine to go.
I think we must deal with public safety, and I and I talked first so I really am not supposed to be making an amendment here and I won't, but I would like to offer amendment if I could speak a second time just to put public safety to make it clear that public safety is first and that if they cannot, if they cannot come up with a safe way to get the fire engines to go up avenue b from 6th street to 10th street, then we do support removing the open street designation for that stretch of avenue b.
The worst case scenario for the fire department is to remove this, because we want to work in partnership with all the agencies and with the board to make new york city a safe and friendly environment for people to exist in so the last resort is to remove it.
I don't mean to interrupt, although I am interrupting, but I just want to suggest that, because we only have them for a limited time that if we can focus on questions specifically for the fire department right now, rather than a back and forth debate among the members, I think that would be most helpful because I believe the captain needs to leave us in about five minutes.
Okay, I direct my question to him if he thinks that would be workable, if traffic is also on the avenue and when fire trucks trying to get through, you know I would like to like analyze that scenario.
I want to thank everybody for the time and much yes.
I have something you need to say and I should just say that the track changes that everyone's seen are just things that we were talking about, maybe adding when we heard that this is going to be happening, so they have not been added yet okay, I am back yes.
Okay, so that is my amendment is to add that first result, if those options aren't feasible or won't, give fn fdny quicker access to avenue d, the city should remove the open strategy, installation on avenue b from east 60 to 10th street and the open restaurants designation for having to be between okay, someone had modified it after I sent it, but that's fine because I hear that's problematic and the open restaurants designation revenue b between second and third street in order to protect public safety by providing for efficient and timely response, we have dny units in the area.
Instead of give that why, I would say, and we'll protect public safety, we don't need to put the whole same long clause and then delete while considering those options is what I would like to have happen or that that's good the way he wrote it that, if they're feasible, that they should consider whether you know extending a long avenue.
I don't want it to go another month, because I really think it's a bad situation over on anywhere east of the park is a bad situation, but you understand that we've got like 24 story buildings, I believe over on avenue d, and if there were to be a disaster, it would be a disaster if there were a fire, and we know that the local firehouse is arriving to the scene.
I think the easiest way to do this might be just to ask if you know, if there's anybody opposed to adding this language to the resolution, can you please raise your hand and make a comment as to why you oppose this being added?
I think it's clear that we're saying we you know- and I do want the open streets to remain, but I don't want them to you see what's going on, is there's something wrong between dot and fdny right now.
We talked about second and third street potentially being closed and they went and closed it anyway, like a day or two later yeah, so it kind of just blew up right in our face, so I think we needed.
I would like to extend that to remove parking on east forestry and an avenue b between you know second and tenth streets on the on the east side.
If that's the side of the street that the fire department we want to make this into the emergency lane paul, I think we're still debating the original amendment from david right, not a new one.
The current parking regulations on that side start on thursday night through saturday there's no parking zone, so I don't know if that affects that or not he thought of having to be between 6th and 10th street about right, I yeah, I'm not sure exactly the boundaries, but I know it's along the east side of avenue b for a good part of the way.
I think it's, the least likely to happen see they would have to be taken down every day and put back up so yeah anyways a suggestion, that's good!
Michelle yeah, I think so everything's in here that I suggested and that robin suggested and that david suggested, okay, all right so paul.
I know that people have things that come up.
Please be in communication with the board, the chairs of the committees in which you sit on or the subcommittees of which you sit on so that they know what's going on, because if you don't tell us, we don't know- and I want to welcome david adams back as he has been dealing with his own personal things happening in his home.
We heard you know from someone from new york city census, talk about the upcoming week of action, and he did say that you know the response rate in our area is something from 49 to 53.
