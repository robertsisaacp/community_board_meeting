I don't know if you want to explain what this district needs and how we've done it in the past, we're a very small subcommittee and what are our focus and also because I mean we discussed yesterday at the land use and zoning that, given the kobe 19 impact, we I mean we added some language.
You know resources for c b, three, and so I, like you know that our district realizes, especially at hpd et cetera, I think maybe one of the best thing to do- is to start out maybe that we could all introduce ourselves okay and how we're involved with the committee.
You don't have to use the raised hands feature since you are a smaller committee, but meeting online virtually gets a little messy when there's a lot of people who want to try to talk at the same time, so I would suggest using a raised hands feature.
So a lot of performing arts, music workers, dancers, all sorts of performers and right now in terms of the district needs, I can bring a lot of experience of the stories that I hear from the impact that it has on people that you know are not going to go back to work until there is a vaccine, and so this budget that we're talking about next year is still going to be key for these people, because they're not going to go back to work in live performance and touring is not going to start until there is a real solution, and so I guess, phase 400., so that's great to have that input.
I went to junior high school in the upper east side right now, work for a private developer, that's mainly situated in cb1, and they do a lot of arts based community initiatives.
If any of you participated in that with the department of cultural affairs, there were a lot of different workshops and opportunities for people to participate, and the idea was is that there needed to be more diversity in the arts, and there were very specific suggestions as how the department of cultural affairs could incorporate diversity into their programming and to their funding for diversity in the different areas of the arts in new york city.
It's making a lot of racket, so, okay, carolyn one thing to add, is that about district needs.
So, since there are a lot of new committee members, I think it's important to remember that it's sort of a odd timing to you know be writing about what the area of the east village, lower east side chinatown needs in terms of cultural and art support, but it's for the future and also to be precise, anisha.
So I think the other thing is trying to find ways that we can incorporate into the district needs is how we can best serve the arts community in what we're proposing to go forward.
So I mean it's that there have been suggestions that education take place outside, there's still a lot of up in the air as to exactly how schools are going to proceed and how arts programs that service children are going to deal with that, as well as the venues for artists, we don't know when the theaters are going to open the galleries you know and how they will be affected by covet 19..
So at any rate, just a minute boo-boo enough yeah the commentary from downstairs that so at any rate, maybe it would be helpful if we went through each one each point: okay, because the original was in the face of intensifying gentrification and the growth of exclusive private cultural amenities in the district, neighborhood art venues, libraries community parks often provide low-cost access to cultural program, and arts and culture should be integrated into the planning of city projects as designated arts and cultural spaces.
We should continue in this vein, that in asia are I'm happy to so economic development already met and one of the things I think sort of like what olympia said with land use is you know, I think we are in just an extraordinary time right now, so we don't fully know what the impacts of you know.
Yes, because they're systemic problems, but I think maybe like between the first paragraph and the second paragraph we state just some of the things that of the impacts of covet and the pandemic, that we know right that performance venues, you know, have closed for the foreseeable future.
You know, I think that would like sort of stating that those impacts that we know right now would be a good thing to add and we've got a couple of hands up, so olympia is one of them.
Maybe a gallery can reopen, but I know that all venues that require a certain public assembly and they have very small margins of game they're not going to reopen, I think, realistically, if we want to brainstorm among with fantastic people that we have here today.
We are very few of us- are still here and so concentrate money to give this kind of classes, for let's call it like the communities that stayed in town that tend to be lower income and people of color is going to be very important, and we need to ask because the doe has taken out the money from that and the services.
Okay, thank you very much, tati hi yeah, I was gonna, suggest the same as indonesia just that we false and in olympia too, just that we emphasize you know the impact of copen19.
19 impact on non-profits arts and culture in new york city from june 25th, so yeah I'll put that in the chat- and this has like that's the center for their computer yeah- that's the center for the urban future right ally, study, yeah, okay, so I know so many of the arts organizations in the neighborhood have been impacted, and it's just you know, every artist I know is like scrambling, so it's just like.
Maybe work with the local artists so that it could be the window can be at least a temporary display until you have the space rented out, you know, or the business continues remaining to be closed or something like that again.
I mean the district needs from arts and culture can be whatever the like the subcommittee feels it should be.
I think, if it connects to business, it's totally fine to steal for it to be in this statement, I the only thing I would you know like to be cognizant of- is the difference between the district needs and michael you might have the most.
So basically, I think anissa's point is very valid because, even though this idea may be interesting, what we in the district needs is as if you're directing it to a program that you want from a city agency until their budget line.
However, I personally had my hand up, because I don't want us to do such kind of recommendations right now, because the artists don't need to show their work.
They need food right now, so I think we should basically have revenue things that have a consistent way for people to make a living like revenue producing either we ask for grants or for programs that pay them et cetera, because, let's be honest, our district is hit.
So many organizations are closing in small businesses, so I mean, I think the language here is obvious, referring to it to a different neighborhood like even gentrification right now, it's going to continue, but it's going to continue in a different way because there's going to be vacancies, etc.
So I think, if we're talking about preservation of cultural venues, you know we need to create maybe a new phrase in the beginning, in which we stress the fact that we do have a lot of small organizations that are seeing sheets of their budget, and we can use some data from the study that the center for urban future has put out and tati shared and basically say that this organization will need.
I don't know if they're gonna survive all the way to the next budget, but that's not true, but I think because we have a concentration of the hardest hit communities who are usually catered by this kind of institutions.
I would say everything else will sound like we live in another planet if we put them in, you know: right: okay, tariq, greek, sorry, my apologies!
I know we've done three residencies this year remotely so that there might be a niche right there for artists to integrate and meet a need in the community via the schools.
I don't even think they're gonna pursue a lot of the resiliency and essential planning that we need, because they're cutting social workers from schools like we are in a different.
This way people can, I don't know, contribute sentences, or I mean otherwise is someone taking notes so that they can write in real time the sentence and share it on the on the screen?
I can try to do it yeah something would be effective if it was in chat and that way we could all access it, because it's going to be harder to do it on, I would think: wouldn't it online with other committees.
Then I like todd's idea of that we each take a different section and send those emails in prior to the august meeting and then in august that we can go over the different component parts and put it together a suggestion to that too, and that I guess sometime between that and your august meeting, is to designate somebody on the committee who's willing to sort of act as a secretary yeah make sure that they can make the edits in real time in your august meeting and that the august, you know that everything be compiled in a word document that can be edited.
So I have a suggestion about that, because this is not exactly sections right and I would say, based on our experience, if each person- and I can well- you know I'm up to here- but I can try to do that if those of you who have ideas like the social workers or something and with the understanding that we are sending this to the city for their budget, so it needs to somehow be asking the city to prioritize budget lines to specific agencies right.
Is this yes, so, basically, if there is like I don't know, I mean we can even have a premise in which we say where the city able, by 2021, to have any remarkable come back.
I personally think the city knows it, but you know that's the purpose of this document to say like what they need.
You know again as she's suggesting, maybe if people feel really strongly that they want to update a certain section of this, then they should probably raise their hand and volunteer now for it.
Otherwise they're going to be left out and it will get updated by somebody else or that if there are additional suggestions to add we could you know set, we could send them all to you know olympia and carolyn, since olympia has now offered to be the secretary, and we just used the next committee meeting to edit the draft of what that paragraph of the impact is and then go through that list and say yes, no, this works.
One thing, though, that I do think that might be helpful is if, since we are meeting in august, we could maybe invite some cultural organizations to come, speak and just tell us what the needs are, what they say.
If I could, I would say you know if you are going to do an email to that email list, just be careful about how it's worded, because if you say something about what do you want to see the fund it's going to make it sound, like the city has money to give out that they're not right, and we can't do that.
And the second thing is, if you are going to go the route of inviting organizations to come, talk to you at your next meeting, I would just highly suggest that you make sure that there's organizations from all around the district- you know east village, side, china, chinatown, right and not just geographically, but also we have very different kind of organizations so, culturally racially etc.
