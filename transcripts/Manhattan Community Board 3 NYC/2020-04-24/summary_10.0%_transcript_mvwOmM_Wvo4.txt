We are all adjusting to this lifestyle that we are in right now and I know that it is going to get better eventually, but I just want to encourage you to continue the great work that you're doing whatever you're doing to stay well and I.
First, we are in need of having maybe a few extra meetings per month and right now it looks like we are in need of having an additional executive meeting, because there's things that do come up as the days go on things happen.
Maybe can go over possible dates and we'll shoot it to you and let you know what extra night that will be for another zoom meeting for exec and just or at least until further notice, but right now, I'm aiming for it 6:30, which is June.
They needed the money to be spent at a community board, a community-based organization, and so Susan and I didn't want to make that decision on behalf of the board, because it is it's tough to decide how to spend six thousand dollars and get it to a community-based organization that is doing covet related work.
We couldn't use Eric's organization because we sit on the exec right, and so we asked them to come up with some organizations that they already had in on a list, and you know they named one of the organizations, and so we went with their suggestion was a Hamilton Madison house.
They received the 6,000 dollar reward award on behalf of the community board, so things like that do come up, and so I am just saying to you all.
They wanted an immediate decision to get it on TV, no Susan I understand but you're, not listening to what I'm saying this is the second time they've made the award see B one word the first time we discussed this in exec we were a little hesitant to pick a CBO.
So that's why Susan keeps saying that it won't happen again, because if we do win a future challenge, we're gonna have more time to actually possibly convene a meeting and have the exact discuss on you.
Okay, so I didn't want to talk about this tonight because it went on our kind of like a virtual parking lot.
We're gonna have to wait a minute and let's handle the things that are the most important but Trevor for your just for what you're saying yes, we do have a policy, we do have something, and but at this moment we were not able to use it because we never promoted it.
We never got it out there to the public, no I understand if I'm saying we need to discuss in exact at some point what we're going to do about this paper challenge.
All right, David, yeah I was just gonna say what Susan had just said that this time they sprung a restriction on us.
So can you explain Alicia what you meant in terms of what are the parameters under which you'd make a decision without consulting yes, so it would be like if the mayor's office called and they needed an answer to a question that maybe have already been voted on out on our website or something like that resolutions, or things like that and I am not able speak to that capacity, or it might be something that can be easily answered without you know us all having to get together.
I mean, like questions, come up or decisions that have to be made similar to this decision that we had to do with the find a group of people that need something or whatever you know like anything like that.
That will require I, really, don't know, I mean yeah, I, think we'll just have to come up and then we'd have to just I'd have to maybe just say, I'll shoot you an email or I'll.
That said, that says that you can expand your authority I think what we should do is just acknowledge that there may be situations like this and that you have a responsibility, as you have responsibly done this time to come back to us and report.
Oh great yeah, just some I agree with Lisa I mean I, think we're all you know in general, with anybody in power hesitancy about executive authority.
But you know these are special times and I think as long as you're not making any decisions that go against what we've voted on or we've taken a position on, then it's fine as long as they're.
You know they're kind of minor things, but I agree, I, don't I, don't think we should like do we need to like set something in stone that like for the pandemic, you have certain executive authority, I, don't think we do right and another item that I wanted to talk about was I asked everyone to come up with some ideas of policies that we may need to create during this time.
Okay, specifically so yes, so I did mention it last month at exact, but I want to just reiterate that we will be having meetings again as needed.
Gonna have two meetings for the month of May for right now, if we don't need the second meeting, then we'll cancel it like I said, but you should be prepared to have another executive meeting because stuff will come up yes, so that was that, was it just making sure that we're meeting as needed and that we're not having people held up for long lengths of time in meetings and I wanted to correct something.
Also publicly SLA I know that you need to run a little longer because your meetings are on zoom' and I would never limit the amount of time that you need to meet with the applicants for the SLA items that you're seeing and I want to commend you for doing a great job at the moment that you're dealing with all of this stuff, because I know it is difficult to meet with applicants on zoom' and then having to each item needs to be talked about, so I do want to come in Alexandra and I'm, sorry, Alex and her team.
You know that we're only going to meet as needed it as necessary.
One of the things that we discussed that we're going to ask all the chairs to do is that if your committee is not meeting in any given month, if you would at least take the time 10 minutes 20 minutes.
However long it takes to check in with all of your committee members, you know not necessarily well this check, but just to check in to make sure you know see how they're doing see if there's any issues they're having related to the community board or things that meet that they want to bring up.
Since your committee isn't meeting, if your committee is meeting- and you are seeing a member not attending you know commonly, then I would also ask you to check up with them as well, too, just to make sure everything's, okay with them.
In addition to checking in with your members, the other thing we're going to ask all the chairs to do is the you know.
The only other thing for my report really is I've just been spending a immense amount of time dealing with the technology involved in us meeting virtually so just you know, excuse my ignorance.
Yeah Jackie, yes, I'm, just wondering if I organize a in for most zoom happy hours with my committee, members do I ballet in the open meeting laws or you should be fine, so you cannot discuss community board anything.
Yeah I went through an analysis of the 50 members and their attendance at the full board meetings, as well as all of their committee assignments, including the executive committee, and by the way I'm going to some time and suggest a new format Susan if you'd be willing to consider it for whoever enters the attendance so that we wouldn't have to do this computation, it would do it automatically I think it was really time to do it.
If the board could send them out, I'd, rather not send them for my personal email, but you want me to I will but I don't see why the board Nitra always said this about okay, great, just a quick question, because I know I'm gonna hear some or get some emails from this person.
Now, it'll be interesting as that three month period constitutes a time where a lot of committees aren't meeting so there so who we actually see how this plays out, but they are during that three-month period if they do not correct their attendance, and they still have over 33% of absences then is when Bayer brought in to discuss it with the executive committee, so in Jonathan's case last time around when he got the warning letter, he corrected to the point where we didn't need to bring him in to the executive committee.
So if he does that again, the same thing will happen if he does not correct and he comes in, the executive committee can take into account that this is his second time in a row having a chemist's issues.
I wanted its first meeting that we took into account was January okay, so this is going from January's date that he has this attendance issue.
So it's probably good to those halves that add up mm-hmm-hmm, okay, all right David Crane did you want to speak yeah no I was double count, never mind any other questions about the attendance.
Let Susan go ahead and report on the budget, because it we may need to really look into that friends account for some assistance.
You might want to put the budget on the shared screen so they're taking so they sent us a letter which I had forwarded to the chair vice chairs and treasurer saying that they were going to do this so they're taking four thousand dollars out of our salary account this year.
This year, however, they're taking 8,000 out next year, which is a really large amount, I'm sure not going to get money from the council again on, because the city's broke 8,000 out of our budget doesn't let us buy a pencil now at the last exec I had said that I would ask for discretionary funds from both council members.
What some of you may remember is that when I first became district manager- and we were getting some donations from film companies and that sort of thing I did what the city wants us to do, and I created an extra account with the city that, unlike our budget, that money is ours year after year, so we can roll that over, which is why I call it that I stopped doing that, because there's a lot of restrictions on it and it makes it difficult for us to spend the money then, where it says cb3 accounts.
You know last year, under the one shot, we've got new computers and a lot of things we have some things we actually want to spend it on is just very difficult to do that at home.
So there's a few things like I want to get another laptop to be prepared for more work at home, but we have other money that the board can spend alright.
Okay, I, just we've been sitting on that money for a while, and you know, I think needs are gonna, be really great in the next six months to a year.
Yes, so I know how that works kind of, although we have to send out notices asking who would like to sit on that committee last time, we did it and we had named.
What I would suggest us a lot of people I, don't know, extent is that if we have a meeting right after this meeting, one of you can explain what it is and discuss who's going to send out the forms and all that make a plan yeah.
She Alex it actually sends the whole thing in yesterday and for some reason neither ed nor I got it and we're trying to clearly you know something out on our end, I think, but we're trying to figure out why?
I think we were trying to keep the elected official statements to a minimum and having someone who doesn't represent us, there seems like unnecessary when we could have someone who does speak about it and be more probably more concise and direct mm-hmm, maybe not increase their exposure as they're looking for higher office and very near future, just wouldn't mind everyone as a public meeting I mean it's the whole world and see the meeting, and it will be on her website.
I didn't actually did this for the district service cab meeting so that people, don't repeat the same issues, ask different people to cover different issues, and but it's not going to be a two minute thing, because they really do need to talk about legislation pending legislation.
Some of the emails like from every agency, like Department of homeless services, is doing an incredible amount of work and moving people around, and you know doing things very differently, and so this is just all time consuming a lot of the agencies or a number of them have once a week calls we have once a week homeless, services called once a week.
One problem I see a tremendous amount of work being done, but there's so much need in our community that I think coordinating it all with you know: agencies, elected officials, CBO's all doing a tremendous amount of work, for instance they're all calling all their clients or everybody's name they have, and then today the mayor's office said they're gonna start calling everybody too.
Do you want to say anything about that about that coordination deal Plano you yeah I, think it needs a real coordination and perhaps through the community board, because we have some data on the buildings.
So a database would be extremely useful and I and I kind of asked for this after sandy, because it's the same exact thing happened and I, don't know how much we learned, but this may be a time to do that.
Do we want to kind of look at the things that have come up and shown gaps, or what do people think it's really a hard thing to figure out what to do when you've never been in this situation before I know for businesses it's going to be a hundred percent different world and you know I think there will be specific needs for that.
So, just from the business perspective, economic development doesn't have a meeting set for May, but in June I'd like to discuss the needs of small businesses, I think we're gonna have a little bit a better idea where you know where the loans all shake out and some of the regulations and have a better idea of what all the needs are that right then, but ideally getting together a resolution that all of the borough or all of the boards in the borough can sort of sign on to would be.
Every area has been hit really hard and right now, I know that the human service agencies are already thinking ahead to the budget.
Think that a lot of our you know, nonprofits and human service agencies and use agencies- would need a little bit more time to figure out exactly what to ask for 21 to 22.
You have some general ideas, I think they do, but if we want something more exactly in terms of the budget part, isn't this just need a little bit more time would be good, so I would say that I am in favor of you know, voting in like July or August so August as long as the come as long as we can meet I would suggest.
I know right now, everyone's concerned about the current budget, but it suggests baby and even in the beginning of May, if possible, starting to contact them and so that they will be ready to come to the committee in June with their suggestions.
So we have the option of voting in August any other questions or comments regarding district need statements all right and we are going to move on to the next agenda item, which is social media.
But the quick headline here is really that, as Susan mentioned in her manager report, there is an overwhelming amount of information that is out there right now in a wonderful way, but in a way that we really need to figure out how to curate and tailor to our to community board three and so we're trying to come up with guiding principles to allow us to move fast, while also post things that are relevant.
However, the other thing that we're trying to do is make sure that we're posting events and local news that truly is local and truly is rep relevant to community board three, and so thus far susan has done most of the work as with as with most things but Michael and I are trying to source various newsletters or various sources that have events that we think might be relevant to in the district.
The other thing I was wondering and again I, don't know if it's possible on these types of media could and probably assume, but it could have like a section for business.
Ultimately it would probably be lost so yeah I, don't I, don't I mean let's see, and if people are commenting that they want different kind of sections, but I think for right.
So we have that information up there, I think to the other question that you're asking about just like posting events or even frankly, things that you're doing that are relevant to the community and Susan Michael, Alicia and I are pretty quick in terms of reviewing stuff.
So it's a reworking of the resolution to deny, because we didn't receive the stipulations, any questions for SLA all right, seeing none we'll move on to transportation, Public Safety Paul's, anything Deb, but we did not meet all right economic development, so I mean we didn't meet but, as you know like the majority of our time has been spent working on this special enhanced commercial district, which we're gonna have to put a pause on right now, one because those city agencies are just not functioning for anything other than non-essential work right now, but also because I think we need to be focusing less on restrictive measures right now and more on how we could be proactive and help small businesses and there's a lot of you know.
So what I would like to do going forward is put together a list of small business needs and see how you know kind of talk with Susan Alicia and just see how the community, but what points the community board can help with all those things.
You need to check in on them just in case, but almost everyone is kind of okay, I think, but some have issues so I'll keep working on that and then the other thing I wanted to talk about was SYEP I want.
You know, decided that the council it the summer so I want I, would like CB 3 to write a letter of you know in opposition to the cancellation it we have already voted on SYEP and that it's part of our budget priority.
You know because we're talking about the July and everybody needs like talk to their City Council member.
It's something I think we need to discuss, because without the pools being open, I really don't know what a lot of these kids are going to do for recreation and they're.
I, don't know if women do here at exact Susan to talk about advocating for this or if we want to carry out the full board, what I'm, what I would suggest?
What I would suggest it seems like I mean the pools are not going to, and you know the work hasn't been done to prepare them, but it seems like a lot of other summer.
We've got a couple of raised hands just all right, so we're better Alicia, first and then Megan yeah I, just wanted to say.
So I really want to know what the mayor's plan is going to be.
The governor's executive order around open meeting law and I just wanted to make sure everybody's read them, and let me know if you have any questions any other old business.
