I'm really impressed with the translation service, and I wanted to thank commissioners alice, my fellow councilmember helena, rivera and manhattan board three for partnering with my office to hold this educational town hall, as our city continue to reopen.
Just last week, the council passed legislation to officially change the department of consumer affairs name to department of consumer and worker protection, and with that comes a bigger mission and in addition, the new york city commission, on human rights issue, legal guidance on age discrimination.
Let's work together to make sure new yorkers know what their rights are, and I look forward to hearing how the department of consumer and worker protection will be an ally to report any instance of discrimination and hold people accountable, and I wanted to thank everyone for being here today.
For this know, your rights town hall, I'm very excited to share and also learn about all the city resources we have to support new yorkers and small businesses that are currently suffering.
We worked in the city council to pass my bill on personal liability protections for small businesses and we have pushed for legislation to be passed to give workers stronger rights during covent 19., but there are also a number of tools out there right now that may help you at your place of employment or may help you find employment during this pandemic.
Very important benefits so in terms of worker protection, I would say that also- and I know that the focus today is about reopening and coming back to work in a safe manner, but all of the new york city workplace laws are in effect right now we haven't stopped answering questions from both workers and businesses.
I mean certainly there's been a lot of interest from businesses in new york city to know what their obligations are and to do the right thing.
So I want to focus a little more on the worker protection piece because it is, you know so important right now that we are all working together to make sure that in new york we continue to make progress in battling this disease, and we have a worker hotline.
The city has been putting a lot of resources into educating businesses and bringing them the tools they need to comply with these guidelines, which I understand it's a lot of information, there's a lot of requirements, but it is very important that we all work together on this.
So that is my call to action to please let us know if you see an issue, we will go out there and educate that business to make sure that again we all continue to reopen in a safe manner and then, just generally, we are all operating all our services and programs are in place.
So there are some general guidelines that apply to all industries and there are some other more specific guidelines for certain types of jobs like construction like manufacturing, but in general, and every business is supposed to first affirmed to the state, by going on to the state website to affirm that they understand what the guidelines are and that they will be complying with them and then post a safety plan in the workplace that tells workers employees.
Those are required to be provided to employees at no cost, so just like any other type of protected equipment, employers are not allowed to charge workers for those face coverings.
So if that is an issue please reach out, and our colleagues from small business services will be helping the businesses to make sure they have those space coverings for free social distancing is another very important requirement, so for most businesses that have reopened- and we are now in phase four of the reopening with some restrictions you know the most probably the one that is the most known is the fact that restaurants are still not allowed to do dining inside the location right, but social licensing is very important and so most workplaces will be limited to up to 50 capacity.
Now, there's no specific requirement as to whether employers have to take employees temperature or not, but there are some models, some guidelines that department of health has published- and this is just to prevent workers from coming to work, sick right so every day and even us as an agency, we have to do the same thing.
So another reminder is like: if employees are sick, obviously they must be sent home and there are laws that require employers in new york city and in the country to pay workers for time they use to take care of themselves or their families.
I don't think that workers should be asked to waive any rights under these circumstances, commissioner, we're getting some questions about paid sick leave as well.
You know, thanks to the council, has been in place since 2014 and it's pretty broad in the way that it covers workers for different types of situations right it is.
It requires a minimum of up to five days a year for businesses to have five or more employees, and yes, five days may not always be enough right, but these five days can be taken not just when someone is sick to take care of themselves or take care of the children that can also be taken when there's a state of emergency that closes schools, for instance, and kids cannot go to school and parents need to stay home to take care of the kids.
So I encourage people to call us and tell us about their specific situation, because we would have to do an analysis of how big the employer is, how many employees in place how much money the business is earning before we can better advise, but in general I would say right now.
If they need more time, so these are all different types of avenues that I think workers should be able to have enough coverage for the 14 days, depending on the law and depending on the size of their employer.
Now, oftentimes, though employers are have misclassified employees, so we always encourage people to call us and to tell us the specific specifics of their situation, because just because someone is labeled a freelancer or was made to sign an independent contractor agreement, it's not what determines the status of the individual right, we would decide if there was they were improperly misclassified and that they should be eligible for basically benefits, but a true freelancer someone who's truly working for themselves and can control the terms of their of their work, wouldn't be covered by this law.
So one of the you know the benefits of our new york city paid sick leave law again, is that it's very broad and workers could use that leave to take care of their children if the schools are closed or they're partially closed.
I believe that the cares act, expanded the family, the one of the laws to provide additional benefits for parents who may need to stay home with their kids right yeah, so under the first under the federal paid sick leave law, those 80 hours of leave that commissioner salus was describing.
Similarly, the state paid sick leave law that went into effect in march also expands some of the uses for the state paid family leave law which again might apply to some circumstances where you're caring for a child there's a number of questions that relate to reporting and confidentiality around that, and how are you know if a worker feels unsafe at their job?
She needs to obviously protect herself immediately right and make sure that she is wearing a face covering, but it is certainly not not a good thing to be in a place, a very small workplace with other people who are not wearing face coverings.
So can somebody use their reasonable accommodation rules to request working from home employees certainly have a right to request reasonable accommodation from their employers and their federal state city laws that require employers not to discriminate against employees who and to be able to accommodate them as long as the job can be done, and it's not a burden to the employer.
I don't have a better answer than that yeah and we have one more question in the q a we might have covered this already, but they're asking what the legal policies are regarding employees, only employers who are only offering unpaid personal time off when you're sick with quoted so again.
If the employer is covered by the law, whether it's the city, the state or the federal law, that employee has a right to get that get paid for the time that they need to take care of themselves.
At that point to the business, it's more of a benefit that it's already available because of the insurance but ben, I think, wants to say something I was just gonna add that for so for the city paid sick leave law.
