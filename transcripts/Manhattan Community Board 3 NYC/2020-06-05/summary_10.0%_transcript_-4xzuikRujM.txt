You, okay good evening: everyone welcome to the community board three health seniors, Human, Services, youth education and Human Rights Committee meeting.
I think it's on the right-hand side today, okay, so for today's meeting I just want to let you know that when Larissa finds the instructions she'll be giving an introduction to how the cb3 meetings are run, virtually it's a little different in some ways, different some ways, similar to the in-person meetings that you probably have been to this me whenever you're ready, sorry, okay, great and also I wanted to recognize I'll do it more later, but we do have some new community board members who are visiting our committee today.
Okay, so, and also another thing is that Thomas Larissa is our secretary, nor in normal times, since Larissa has another job right now at this meeting, Thomas will be taking over as the secretary and he will be picking the minutes.
All right, can you guys hear me yeah, I'm, sorry, yeah I'm, having some difficulties with my laptop I, think problems with the video but Ricky Wong born and raised Lower East, Side Chinatown, formerly New York City, Department of Health Department of Consumer Affairs as well to now in private sector hi.
If you look at lower Eastside appointment, network of a lot of their promotional material is taken right from our district needs organizations.
Writing their district need statement refer to our district needs, we'll be working on this through August and we'll vote on in October, and usually we vote earlier, but since information is changing so rapidly right now, this will allow time for us to finalize it, but then add new information, if necessary after the district needs, will be meeting with agencies.
So you know I'm just about participant kori budgeting that that's City Council discretionary money, it's a so, but the district needs.
So it's the sort of the meet of you know the budget right I think.
We look at the needs and what we want and we you know, may made it wrote a document so this year, as you know, everything is very different and rather than looking at, what's being cut or what's being needed, I think our overriding question is well for a 2122.
So so this year, what I would like to do is you know we have some time to decide on to finalize our budget priorities and district needs.
As Susan said, we can vote on both in October all at the same time, which would benefit us because, as you know, things are changing constantly I mean things last two weeks ago and today are already very different.
You know what our district needs to be should be so they would be people who are working on the ground and not just who could also have a give us an overview of what they think.
We already voted on the coming budget year, we're looking at July a year from now all right, I'm, just saying you know in case anything doesn't change.
Well, this budgets gonna, be finalized at the current budget for next month will be finalized by the end of this month, and we have written letters like we wrote a letter to protest the cuts in Summer Youth, Employment, Program, okay, all right.
So, if you are I mean it, the end of June is coming very soon yeah, but what we had done is that if we were aware of any cuts to programs that we were cut are part of our budget priorities, you know that we had already voted on last year, so we would, we just wrote a letter to say protest it because we had voted to have it, but we are really looking at 21 22, but I think that what happens this, as you know, what happens this year in 2021 will impact we need in 21 22.
Yes, I think you know what I mean right.
Is that correct, or even could be even there could be even more I would say more okay, sorry, okay, so I know that you, since you work at Cooper, Square and you're with the Newark I know you have a yeah we so we need so on this committee we have members who work for different ages, different human service agencies or community service agencies who can put the right there.
We provide us with the expertise, but in Carmen for the seniors, and if the you know, we definitely need your help, but we're also going to bring in speakers who can give us more information beyond what we have.
It's just you right, Naomi here I, don't see: Lila yeah, okay, Naomi, no Yomi will discuss the needs of the public school students and what they see 4:20 over 21 22 and then Carlin code, lastname, :, Oh Cohen.
Oh and okay, Carlin Cohen, is from the chinese-american Planning Council and she will discuss something called the Asian, a neighborhood recovery plan, which is a plan that's signed on by many Asian American organizations, including I, think 11, who are from our area and also the settlement houses in our area so and I think some of those items shall discuss are applicable to the other communities and best to let you know we do plan to meet in July committee members, we plan to meet in July.
Thank you for having me I know you guys are working on your district needs and I'm always grateful that you guys, you know, asked for input.
If it's a community school, so the honey streets, education alliance, those folks are providing supported services to our kids, but it's not through the do II, so I think that's something.
I should be top of mind because the social-emotional supports that our kids are gonna need after this is gonna, be unsurmountable and a lot of things that couldn't come up from this that if we don't address it, it's gonna spill over.
So, given the conditions you're talking about when we write our district need statement and we have to focus on of articulating a few needs and then we will be looking at funding as one of the ways to deal with those, could you like give a few specific needs?
In my personal opinion, I think we need social workers and every single school community period to I would I.
I think that would be my top number one top number two number two would be supportive services like through after-school programs and the beacons and the Sonics and the Y's sy ApS, because that is supports of families.
A question about technological needs for our young people throughout the district I know.
All education programs are going to go eventually into a hybrid form of learning at some point, whether it's a couple days face-to-face in a classroom and a couple of days at home on a computer via classroom, zoom classes stuff like that I I'm concerned that in for the upcoming, not the current, not the of them next fiscal year, but the one that we're for that these families need the technological needs hotspots Wi-Fi more than one laptop or tablet in the house, because there's multiple young people who need to be on classrooms I think that's a huge thing that they're gonna need because I think we're moving towards that anyway, and I think the do is kind of showing their hand.
Families have chimed in on him yeah, so I think we all saw the need for broadband service when we all went remote.
We can't we can't connect every single household with broadband service, but you know the fact that we're number one on a list in New, York City is sort of concerning for me as well, because families, you know what highlighted need was when you know, spectrum and optimum, you know thought they were doing such a great honorable job, giving service to families.
So that's I, don't I know those organizations that if you do contact them and show the need they will connect free Wi-Fi service for households or you know for it like they do like link type of things, but that's gonna require a larger push, especially if you're in a neighborhood that has the least broadband service per household in a city.
I wanted to ask you if you've heard anything from the children that have autism, we have quite a few children in our district that are in these special programs, like the mess program and many of the families are scrambling around looking for equipment for the children.
He'll shut down, and so I know that in the school in which I work there quite like more than 50% of the school, has children with autism or special needs.
Don't I, don't know what we could possibly do right, I think look I, think these were extraordinary circumstances like this.
There was, you know, people can say what they want, but they I don't think anyone can account for having a pandemic and what that would look like.
A lot of the school communities use their PTA s to help pay for devices my son's middle school, for instance the PTA donated money, because for every family that got an iPad, they ordered a keyboard to go with the iPad, and you know in a household with multiple kids that may have to be on classes.
Yes, how successful I mean in my eye, I have a very high threshold for success, so I personally feel like devices should have been in families hands within a week, but you know when you're ordering 300,000 and you need to coordinate families to get information to families.
Oh I could just check my notes: I, don't like your name: okay, so I just wanted to okay, so there's different kinds of questions going on here, so people are having a lot of questions about what's wrong this time and how they could have done better, but also committee members.
If you could address that, you know so, for example, you know something: yeah did you access assessing digital needs, families I think that wasn't done properly.
There was a lot of surprises addressing what type of devices already exist in our home and how many do they need families and know that they need if they have multiple kids in the household, they need to fill out the form multiple times.
So if you have a kid, you know four kids in the household you get one lot, one iPad. How is that going to work and I also think you know just little things like I mentioned before I like not having a headphone, you don't know you need it until four kids need to be on the zone, call at the same time with their classes and you're in a one-bedroom apartment.
So when I think of an example of what it looks like I, think of them and cutting those services will directly impact these families right because they rely on it.
The diversity that exists within areas like Chinatown in the Lower East Side, but also recognizes that a lot of the impact that we saw was really Geographic and the reason we thought it was important to put this together was because we have obviously seen a lot of impacts, particularly economic ones, due to COBIT 19 in neighborhoods, with high levels of asian-american populations, because of a lot of the anti Asian discrimination surrounding kovat 19.
We do plan to kind of continue refining this plan as we see what the ongoing impact of Cova 19 and the economic impacts are, but we also wanted to put together a first draft of it or first go at it early on, because we knew that a lot of decision-makers at the city level, we're going to be, you know, beginning to make decisions about this year's budget and then even looking forward.
That looks like really two major things: providing relief for all of the workers that have had wage loss and replacement and particularly at the city level, pushing for that relief to include community members that have been left out of federal relief, particularly for a lot of immigrant workers in cash jobs, so some delivery workers and other part-time and informal economy workers we've seen that the federal relief has not really been reaching them and so making sure that is something that the city prioritizes and then Karla I just want interrupt you for a minute did committee members that you received this last minute.
If you wish go ahead and then moving forward and Naomi did touch on some of these things, investing in workforce training and placement to ensure that, in long term economic recovery, that there are options available to folks, we don't know what the economic recovery is going to look like and so city programs that support our young people like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, our adult literacy programs or workforce training and placement programs and Umbridge programs that serve immigrant community members and other city programs like that.
We also know that housing and neighborhood affordability will be a big issue because of that interrelated economic impact, and one of the things that we really don't want to see is a that.
We have seen issues with digital access that everything from our young people, which Naomi addressed to actually seniors, really struggling with digital access and being unable to get accurate information because of lack of broadband because of lack of devices and so addressing digital equity moving forward is something that is, you know not only important, but it's highly achievable at the city level, as we think, through what education work and access to information look like and then, of course, language.
All of this is supporting the community-based neighborhood organizations, so settlement houses, social services agencies that are doing this work.
I think an example of this that we saw is with the meal delivery programs, where the city went to try to kind of take over those programs and do delivery coordinated through the city that there ended up being a lot of issues not only identifying seniors who are homebound and needed meals, but ensuring that those meals were then going to be culturally competent, nutritionally appropriate and more and so for us seeing those community-based organizations and social services at the center of recovery.
Dip ton has seen an 11% cut at a time that we know that our seniors need support to remain in their homes safely and comfortably more than ever, dy CD.
We think that now is a time more than ever, that young people actually need this programming support, whether it is after school like the beacons and compass or Youth Employment programming like SYEP and then similarly geo HMH.
Okay, questions for in Karlin, wait questions for Karlin, please raise your hand, Oh, Thomas and then Susan, hey, Colin, call me a dreamer, but is there any possibility of investment from private corporations such as some of these people with the luxury buildings in the neighborhoods and I mean?
Typically, what we've seen is that you know private investment dollars, don't tend to go into asian-american and communities of color as much but I think that is actually all the reason to push for it more at this time.
You know our seniors are going to need ongoing support through the recovery of this.
Of course, the you know in a lot waise we're worried that early data was never collected, and so we've missed that opportunity, but I think, particularly as we move into the next phase, making sure that those systems are in place to do exactly what you talked about and then trying the best.
But what does it look like to actually collect better data, so we really have a sense of where and who and how people are being impacted by this, and that is gonna be really critical again, as we move through recovery over the next several years.
After you know, quote-unquote after the pandemic and so I think yeah we should have someone come from the advocacy community rather than DHS.
Do you think we could invite somebody who can talk to us about what the long-term needs of the seniors are for 21 22, or is it what the asks are and then, after that we'll go to Troy, because he has his hand up all right.
Yes, I just want to know if you guys are inviting anybody for youth services.
For example, you know more than ever, users are gonna need a summer programming and the social emotional support.
Yes, so our the thing is that we want to hear from the ground like what is it that we should be putting into our district needs?
As another agency, that's going to have to cut a lot of youth programming, and today we had you know CPC, which is more a little bit more the Chinatown side, so the next two we should have our is the is a little bit more.
Okay, so I don't know that Grant Street has as many other than the cornerstone youth programs.
Could you talk to them, then here, okay, Paul I, would just couldn't simply add that maybe you want to ask University settlement as well, because they may be one of the agencies that take on some of those young people that are leaving the other educational alliance.
Okay, do you think that they have that, like a you, know, sort of a uniform voice yeah or they?
I know a lot of people been asking about.
