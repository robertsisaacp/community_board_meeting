So now we're gonna go on to our second event. The item, which is our district, need statement this year, we're going to what they talk. You know combine the district needs and the budget priorities a bit, but before we go on continue Susan, could you just give an introduction to what the district needs statement is and what our goal is. Yeah I'll give a very short overview and apologies to everyone who heard it last night. The beginning of the budget process for community boards starts in May, with the writing of the district need statement. We're working on the fiscal year started in July 2021. The district needs statement describes our community, its geographic demographic, socio-economic, any way we can think of when we note the existing conditions and the needs that arise from these conditions. An example might be the number of seniors living in poverty and we document everything, give statistics, and then this could lead to needs such as local and affordable, geriatric care, more meal slots and senior centers or narcs. That's that sort of programs and needs we assess their needs with the focus on the unmet needs or problems, and we can recommend projects or activities to meet these needs. They may be short term solutions or longer term or the community board might not have a recommendation to solve the problem and not every problem can be solved by funding a project. We do not ask to fund programs or priorities in the statement. The district needs statement informs the budget priorities and then in October we all vote on specific budget priorities. In this statement, each committee should give an introductory overview for areas in their jurisdiction, and the one thing we need to be careful of is not to get into a policy document. It should be the needs of our specific district and all information should be documented. Our statement is used by a lot of people. If you look at lower Eastside appointment, network of a lot of their promotional material is taken right from our district needs organizations. Giving grants refer to our district needs. Hospitals. Writing their district need statement refer to our district needs, we'll be working on this through August and we'll vote on in October, and usually we vote earlier, but since information is changing so rapidly right now, this will allow time for us to finalize it, but then add new information, if necessary after the district needs, will be meeting with agencies. The committee leadership meets with agencies in September for this committee. We need with ACS's children, Department of Education HR, a DHS d, YC D, and discuss specific programs that will fit our needs and then in October all the committee's will vote on their priorities and then the full board will Cole ate them and vote on the priorities for the board. All this is separate from participatory budgeting, which is a new invention and really has nothing to do with boards and that's about it. Is there any questions or a number of people here know a lot about this. Like Wendy and Ricky who've worked on from the other end. Does anyone think I'm missing something? Everyone asked a question? No, but yeah. So you know I'm just about participant kori budgeting that that's City Council discretionary money, it's a so, but the district needs. What we're talking about is a different part of money and it's the larger. You know when you hear that you know that oh the mayor and the City Council you know signed on a biannual budget. That's the budget we're talking about! So it's the sort of the meet of you know the budget right I think. Is there a capital and expense budget for each agency? Yes, oh I'm, so committee members, you know this year no every year, you know for those of you who have been on this committee last year and we're part of the process to formulate the shift needs. You know you know what we did. We look at the needs and what we want and we you know, may made it wrote a document so this year, as you know, everything is very different and rather than looking at, what's being cut or what's being needed, I think our overriding question is well for a 2122. What do we need in light of everything? That's happening now? Is there something new or perhaps there is something that's always been pressing, but now, in light of what is happening now and what is you know how we will reopen and go into the future? We may consider that those needs are even more pressing and even need to be highlighted more so there's two different documents, the needs and the priorities, but they go hand in hand. So so this year, what I would like to do is you know we have some time to decide on to finalize our budget priorities and district needs. As Susan said, we can vote on both in October all at the same time, which would benefit us because, as you know, things are changing constantly I mean things last two weeks ago and today are already very different. You know, even though there's Kovach 19, so we could use the extra time I do want to bring in more speakers to help us decide our. You know what our district needs to be should be so they would be people who are working on the ground and not just who could also have a give us an overview of what they think. You know we need to do. You know in two years, not this coming year, not this coming month, but you know in 21 22, so we need their input to design our and that's what our district needs statement is really about. It's what you know the people are telling us- or in this case young people who are working in the community. Are there any questions? No, you would have to unmute yourself if you have a question okay, so we have two speakers today we have naomi pena from immune. Just have one question: yes moving forward since I mean for the past three months, it's been such huge changes. I know that I've been getting them from differ, but regards to changes in programming looking forward into this next budget, because again, there's no guarantee of any kind of vaccine and the changes already being made to certain programs. Was there any type of directive given as to how we should look forward to this next budget year? We already voted on the coming budget year, we're looking at July a year from now all right, I'm, just saying you know in case anything doesn't change. Well, this budgets gonna, be finalized at the current budget for next month will be finalized by the end of this month, and we have written letters like we wrote a letter to protest the cuts in Summer Youth, Employment, Program, okay, all right. So, if you are I mean it, the end of June is coming very soon yeah, but what we had done is that if we were aware of any cuts to programs that we were cut are part of our budget priorities, you know that we had already voted on last year, so we would, we just wrote a letter to say protest it because we had voted to have it, but we are really looking at 21 22, but I think that what happens this, as you know, what happens this year in 2021 will impact we need in 21 22. Yes, I think you know what I mean right. So did you have a specific question about some events in 2021 or budget items in 2021? Hmm right! That's fine! My concern with the budget items, especially certain services for seniors, since most of them have been pretty much on lockdown. Hmm. You know, hopefully, the city being so but again we'll see how that works out. Oh okay, but whatever they need it's definitely going to continue into the following wing year. Is that correct, or even could be even there could be even more I would say more okay, sorry, okay, so I know that you, since you work at Cooper, Square and you're with the Newark I know you have a yeah we so we need so on this committee we have members who work for different ages, different human service agencies or community service agencies who can put the right there. We provide us with the expertise, but in Carmen for the seniors, and if the you know, we definitely need your help, but we're also going to bring in speakers who can give us more information beyond what we have. So we expand our knowledge. So today we have Naomi Pena, who is from CEC one? It's just you right, Naomi here I, don't see: Lila yeah, okay, Naomi, no Yomi will discuss the needs of the public school students and what they see 4:20 over 21 22 and then Carlin code, lastname, :, Oh Cohen. Oh and okay, Carlin Cohen, is from the chinese-american Planning Council and she will discuss something called the Asian, a neighborhood recovery plan, which is a plan that's signed on by many Asian American organizations, including I, think 11, who are from our area and also the settlement houses in our area so and I think some of those items shall discuss are applicable to the other communities and best to let you know we do plan to meet in July committee members, we plan to meet in July. We can also meet in August and we can invite more speakers at each meeting. Susan do we have time in September as well late right? So this is in September you're gonna be dealing with the budget priorities and I, don't see how you could possibly do both at once. Okay, so we have July in August right, okay, very good Naomi. Would you like to speak first sure hi, everyone I hope everyone's having a good evening. My name is Naomi Pena I am one I raised the Lower East Side, even more fortunate that I and raise my poor kids in the Lower East Side and I am cc-1 president. Thank you for having me I know you guys are working on your district needs and I'm always grateful that you guys, you know, asked for input. I think we can all agree that the events as of March have been you know, for lack of a better term. I think a lot I think even the events that are happening across this country. In the last week, husband, I'm, an emotional toll, I know it's taken an emotional toll in my for myself in my household, but one of the glaring things that I am seeing that we need is, as you all know, whenever there's a budget crisis in the city. The first thing that always gets cut is education, even though we still expect our kids to you know excel and do well, and but we always cut them first, and then we wander wonder why they're not doing as great but everything has been cut. I believe the last total was around 700 million dollars in cuts. I could be wrong, I, don't know what the next total has been. All supportive services have been cut for kids, so those programs that usually support children after school or have been cut so beacons sonics, after-school services all have disappeared, they're not being funded, and so it's opening a very it's. This can potentially open a very bad Pandora's box for our children because they don't have anything to do over the summer. Obviously, this is not for now is projecting in the future, but even after school and parents have to work, you know what do we expect our kids to do? They're not gonna stay in the school buildings at 3 o'clock and go straight home. That's not just what kids do so, there's a call that we need to start having a lot of discussion around social emotional support. This has taken a toll on many families. You know, there's kids have been stuck inside for you know, since March they have dealing they've been dealing directly or indirectly, with loss from koban 19. There's a questions that are being asked. You know during covert 19 and even now, there's a lot of discussions. I'm hearing across this district about you know being racial allies and acknowledging what's going on, and a lot of this is really emotional. A lot of this is taking a toll on kids and you know if you live in a neighborhood, you know: we've been living with helicopters from sundown to sunset, which makes me being nearer to impossible. It's been near to impossible in my own home anyway, during Colvin. You know my view is a southern precinct, so my kids now see a direct current mother around the 7 precinct. That's completely blocked off with you know, police and an armored gear. That's all very scary, for these kids and I think not addressing this. It's gonna is gonna, have an impact on our children, and it's gonna show directly in the classroom, and we cannot expect our kids to show up to school in September if they do show up to school in September, if we're back to normal, whatever that normal is and not miss a step and think like they're off to the races and they're gonna, pretend like everything has been okay since then so I think not addressing. That is a huge hurdle. We as y'all, where there is a larger ratio of school security officers to guidance, counselor's I think it's really how like a few hundred. If that in the entire school system we means not. Every single building has a guidance counselor and if they do, it's often related it's connected to our CBO partners. If it's a community school, so the honey streets, education alliance, those folks are providing supported services to our kids, but it's not through the do II, so I think that's something. I should be top of mind because the social-emotional supports that our kids are gonna need after this is gonna, be unsurmountable and a lot of things that couldn't come up from this that if we don't address it, it's gonna spill over. Thank you, okay, so committee members, so do you have okay? This will do some Q&A committee members. Do you have any questions? Please raise your hand and I will call on you. Nobody has questions now. Thomas is raising his hand, okay, Thomas yeah, in addition to the boss of after-school programming and efficiency with counselors. Do you anticipate also another loss of SYEP for the next summer or two? I if the city does not create or the state does not create another form of revenue, they will continue to cut every single youth program in this city because they're, not gonna, proof deem it to be essential. I know the City Council has made some commitments that they want to figure something out. I, don't know what that looks like I, don't you know, I can't tell but I think funding. Syep larly is it's the biggest it's one of the many insults, not the biggest, but one of the many insults of the budget cut, because SYEP is one of the first jobs than many of our low-income students actually experienced in their life. That's what helps build a resume and they're often use that money to help their family or buy their back to school supplies so that way, they're not a burden on the rest of the household. So the fact that cut has created a huge bore, I, don't see it if the mayor, you know the fact that the mayor cut it immediately. It tells me that he doesn't think it's a priority, which we all can disagree that it with that. But the fact that he was willing to cut it so quickly is also an indication that he's going to continue to cut it if he needs to okay, Susan Heidi and then Paul okay. So before these times we had very specific needs were aware of and that we had started prioritizing as children with special needs in the schools. So, given the conditions you're talking about when we write our district need statement and we have to focus on of articulating a few needs and then we will be looking at funding as one of the ways to deal with those, could you like give a few specific needs? If you had to pull out a few to be on top- and they would be- you know- needs to deal with the kinds of problems that you've been mentioning. The first thing, I will say, is a social workers. I think that's critical. In my personal opinion, I think we need social workers and every single school community period to I would I. Would then this is where I think it's a little sort of cross cross-pollination with the coz I, do believe that students in with special needs, are also suffering tremendously, if not double the amount of trauma, because there's a wide range of supports, there's a wide range of services that children with special needs receive because there's also a wide range of special needs and their expectation. So you know you could go from like someone who's, you know autistic but high-functioning to very severe, and you know a lot of these students, for instance, for students with autism. If there's severe autism, this they're not doing well and these circumstances, this is breaking their routine. They do go really well with routine. They not in the school building that with people they don't know, they don't understand why they can't be with people and a lot of the families are experiencing the child rebelling or like acting out and because they don't know it very confused by all of this. So I think this is a little bit. Why again, to reinforce why the needs of why we need social workers, because they can do really well with students like that and they can they have the ability to reach them. I think that would be my top number one top number two number two would be supportive services like through after-school programs and the beacons and the Sonics and the Y's sy ApS, because that is supports of families. That also doubles up as supports for perfect for the students as well, because through those programs, those partners are also keeping tabs on families and they have the ability to provide the religious services if they need specialized, really a services counseling or alright. Sometimes, though, staff workers become, you know a pseudo mentor to these kids that they create relationships with so and those would be my top number two. Thank you, okay, Heidi that you put your hand down. Does that mean you change your mind? Okay, thank you! Paul hi Naomi. Thank you for coming tonight. A question about technological needs for our young people throughout the district I know. Personally, as an academic coordinator, my students have had trouble accessing technology and I'm thinking schools. The do we private schools doesn't matter. All education programs are going to go eventually into a hybrid form of learning at some point, whether it's a couple days face-to-face in a classroom and a couple of days at home on a computer via classroom, zoom classes stuff like that I I'm concerned that in for the upcoming, not the current, not the of them next fiscal year, but the one that we're for that these families need the technological needs hotspots Wi-Fi more than one laptop or tablet in the house, because there's multiple young people who need to be on classrooms I think that's a huge thing that they're gonna need because I think we're moving towards that anyway, and I think the do is kind of showing their hand. Families have chimed in on him yeah, so I think we all saw the need for broadband service when we all went remote. What I wasn't aware and I'm willing to share with this committee is a reporter actually brought to my attention that a report was made by the citizens committee, where they highlighted neighborhoods in New York City that had the lowest broadband connectivity per household and the Lower East Side was actually number one. So it was a perfect storm of circumstances being low-income, not having a device not having broadband or Wi-Fi or maybe just having a household with just one phone with service. Does it mean that you know a whole family? If you have multiple kids can work off of Google classroom on your mobile device because that's not efficient either. The only way Google classroom really works better is on a laptop, because you can cite better everything else. It's wonky I've tried it on my phone and tried it on iPads. It's wonky. You can't download. You can't really upload files. Sometimes you can't even print files properly, so there is I firmly do believe. What I'm hearing I know that the teachers union has a large voice of what the outcome of what September will look like, but what I'm hearing on the ground is a couple of scenarios, one of them being a hybrid form where you will be in the classroom a couple of days of the week and then the rest will be remote. The other is like alternate shifts. You know, like a group of kids in the morning, a group of kids in the afternoon, so I think this is a larger discussion. I, don't know how do you far you want to get into this, but discuss right. We can't we can't connect every single household with broadband service, but you know the fact that we're number one on a list in New, York City is sort of concerning for me as well, because families, you know what highlighted need was when you know, spectrum and optimum, you know thought they were doing such a great honorable job, giving service to families. But yet the fine print said if you had bills prior to that were unpaid, they would refuse you service, which ultimately changed. But now service has only been extended to was 60 days. Then 60 days has already expired, or it's expiring for some families and they're pushing to have deal week. It's a t-shirt, these companies to push to June, but then what? If we have? You have a child that has to go to summer school? What are you gonna do to August? There's no discussion about that and then, if we do go to a hybrid form, whether what is the rustle you're gonna, look like a lot of families were trying to find hotspots. You know through the link and YC we don't really have into those the neighborhood really at least on the south end where I am the New York City Public. Library is closed. So, unless you're gonna pitch a seat in front of the building and do your work, that's not ideal either. So that's I, don't I know those organizations that if you do contact them and show the need they will connect free Wi-Fi service for households or you know for it like they do like link type of things, but that's gonna require a larger push, especially if you're in a neighborhood that has the least broadband service per household in a city. So that is something to keep mind but I, don't know how that's gonna translate and your needs I'm. Sorry, you said there was. We had the least broadband or the most least in the city per household. Make sense to me: are you done mm yeah, okay, the for Lisa and Linda bruh hi? Okay, thank you. So much for your comment and your input is very helpful. I wanted to ask you if you've heard anything from the children that have autism, we have quite a few children in our district that are in these special programs, like the mess program and many of the families are scrambling around looking for equipment for the children. I have one young lady in particular that I've been trying to help get her some equipment, because her son is mute and it has been vote for her to get resources during this coab at time. She has nothing. I mean every piece of equipment, she's had to kind of buy herself one piece at a time and he has to have special things in order for him to keep his mobility because he has a tendency to not be mobile. He'll shut down, and so I know that in the school in which I work there quite like more than 50% of the school, has children with autism or special needs. So how does that help? How a parent's getting help during this time? What resources do you think we should start to look at for like in situations like if this happens again? Are there ways we connect them faster to resources? Or is this something that you can suggest that the community board can write a resolution on to help with I mean I? Don't I, don't know what we could possibly do right, I think look I, think these were extraordinary circumstances like this. Has never happened in our lifetimes. There was, you know, people can say what they want, but they I don't think anyone can account for having a pandemic and what that would look like. No one did so I think I think I think it was completely unexpected and from what I saw deal, we spent the whole time being reactive, then proactive. They were literally trying to figure things out as they went along. They were trying to figure things out. They didn't know where things were like it and it you know, I, don't think they did well. I mean not that this is shocker. They know they didn't plan well, and this is like Theo, II and I've said this to them in their face. They're not organizes they're, not organizers, they're. They just give you information, but they don't know if it's even needed so I think I think it was incredibly difficult for them to assess I. Think the challenge is they just resorted to? Oh everyone needs an iPad. Let's do that and request well and we'll send you one and then one and done my suggestion would be I first want to connect with you offline find out what she needs. How I can help her I. Think if we're gonna I know this is gonna, be a hybrid moving forward. I think we can. We can collaborate on advocating for those families and making sure we find out what exactly they need, because if you don't, if they don't know, they're not going to make it a priority, they're just not, and if you don't mention it to them, it never happened, and certainly, if you don't have it in writing, you can't prove that they knew so I know. There's a lot of needs out there, but the problem is, as you well know: if parents don't know who to ask, so they might ask their teacher, their teacher, then might ask you, know the parent coordinator and then they might ask the principal and, depending on the involvement or the efficiency of these fact, members they might be able to help, and sometimes a manaat', sometimes they'll, say well. I asked in here back I: don't know what to do. You know, for all intents and purposes, there's a culture of saying: I tried, you know no one's asking me I, don't know what to do and leaving it at that. So I think there's. It depends on the school community. There's some circle communities who had did an internal survey. They already knew the families I mean is what they needed: the equipment they and they mobilized. A lot of the school communities use their PTA s to help pay for devices my son's middle school, for instance the PTA donated money, because for every family that got an iPad, they ordered a keyboard to go with the iPad, and you know in a household with multiple kids that may have to be on classes. At the same time, they also gave every single child that needed a I have phone said, and these are all things that you don't realize you need until you're in it until you go all smokes like I didn't realize. I need a pair of headphones like how are these kids gonna concentrate? How I'm doing concentrate an adult if you're still working and take your calls? So it's one of those things that you don't know until you do know and then, if, once you do know, what do you do to get it done? So it depends on the school community. Every certain people places are really organized and get it together. Some dull I'm not an excuse, but definitely sort of want to give you a lay of the land of how these and oftentimes once parents here I, don't know what to do. If they don't know that, there's a CC for them or if you know, there's a citywide call. This is citywide council just like CC 1, it's a citywide on special education and even district 79. They can use those people. But again you don't know what you don't know. So that's been. The challenge is the whole time. People are just being reactive and it's you can never get ahead. You just can't because there's always more and more and more needs, but definitely let's connect offline, see how I can help okay and then maybe we can see how we kind of how we can. They should actually get ahead. Yum Deborah, never glass, yeah I forgot so Thank You Naomi. That was really great. You actually answered most of the question that I had but I guess just even anecdotally how successful within CEC 1 do you think the do II got devices into the hands in our community? Yes, how successful I mean in my eye, I have a very high threshold for success, so I personally feel like devices should have been in families hands within a week, but you know when you're ordering 300,000 and you need to coordinate families to get information to families. The rollout was very bumpy families didn't know they could request a device, families didn't know they can request a device and once they did, they didn't know how to do it then there's some rumors that there was a cutoff date for devices and they didn't know what to do. And you know some households had devices like, for instance, my you know: I didn't need a device, because I was fortunate enough. That I've had laptops for everyone, but then I circumstances happen. I had a laptop that fell the screen, cracked and what you know so there's there was a lot. There was a lot of lack of information because again they didn't know who to ask or the parent coordinator who wasn't sharing the information or the information being shared, wasn't right. Last I heard in district 1. This was I want to say about a week ago we had we had requests. Oh I could just check my notes: I, don't like your name: okay, so I just wanted to okay, so there's different kinds of questions going on here, so people are having a lot of questions about what's wrong this time and how they could have done better, but also committee members. Let's think about you know just when we do it all this translated into some kind of neat and I'm sure you all know what it is. So if we can just think more about that and not ask questions about what went wrong this time, that would be good and Naomi. If you could address that, you know so, for example, you know something: yeah did you access assessing digital needs, families I think that wasn't done properly. There was a lot of surprises addressing what type of devices already exist in our home and how many do they need families and know that they need if they have multiple kids in the household, they need to fill out the form multiple times. They thought it was a one-and-done. So if you have a kid, you know four kids in the household you get one lot, one iPad. How is that going to work and I also think you know just little things like I mentioned before I like not having a headphone, you don't know you need it until four kids need to be on the zone, call at the same time with their classes and you're in a one-bedroom apartment. I, don't know how it's gonna work asset Ali, just so you know Debra I. Think last time, I heard last week we were down to the last hundred families and have an iPad, but again we're almost at the end of May, the end of June rather I'm enemy. So that's still disheartening for me, but there's something there's something we can really do about it I think. If anything we just learn. We can all learn from this of how we can reach our families better and be more proactive than reactive, okay, so I see Tatiana and Susan with their hands raised. Okay I'll just take two more questions of for naomi, first from tatiana and then from susan, and then we will move on to our next speaker, Carlin Tatiana, Tati, hi, Naomi, so I guess my question. I know the future of after-school programs really, but nonetheless, I know how important after-school programs are for students in temporary housing and so I'm just wondering because I've been doing some research about. You know a need being to prioritize admissions for students in temporary housing and also for and also because, if you don't get into an after-school program, the likelihood of getting into a summer school summer, after-school program or a summer camp program is less likely. So I just wondering if you had any information about that, it was in our district and after schools for tempter school programming, for students in temporary housing within the district yeah. So we have one school that always comes to mind because they have sort of been the standout example of what to do with families in temporary housing is PSMs 188. They are one of the two along with PS 15. They have the most families in summer housing. That's literally because of locality. Families live across the street, they are a complete wraparound service. They have washer and dryers there with detergent for families to wash their stuff they have after school. They have extended hours on there after school. Sometimes it goes to 8 9 o'clock. They serve hot dinners and they also do weekend Friday and Saturday programming and the same thing in the summer. So when I think of an example of what it looks like I, think of them and cutting those services will directly impact these families right because they rely on it. If you know anything about sort of the lifespan of being a temporary housing facility, you're required to look for work, you're required to go endless meetings and you have to drag your kids with these meetings, which means you're missing school and, if you're working, that means you're working depending on your work shift, you may become homely, and so you rely on these after-school providers to help feed your children. So that's really the first thing that I think of now talking about emissions me and you can talk offline because cc1 has I can't share all that details with you. We, although we don't get any shine about it, meeting any fancy press conference. We were the first in New York City to have the first admissions policy and it includes a threshold of including students in temporary housing across every single school. But we can talk offline about that. Okay, great Susan! Okay, thank you. Can you in the next few days? Send me your top five capital priorities that you believe are not funded, so we couldn't put them on our agenda for our meeting with BOE. Absolutely thank you. Yep. Okay, Thomas! You got that all right. Okay, thank you! Thank, You, Naomi, so Naomi you're welcome to stay or we're. Gonna have Carly, okay, great Karlin, hi everyone. My name is Harlan Cowan with the chinese-american Planning Council, my pronouns are invade them or she her. Thank you so much for having me join you tonight. It's really a pleasure to be here with all of you. So at CPC we worked with about 30 other organizations that are working in Asian American neighborhoods, including his mace at eleven in CV freeze area to come up with what we called the Asian American neighborhood recovery plan and I. Think that what's important here is to note that we're talking about neighborhoods rather than necessarily Asian Americans as a racial and ethnic group across the state overall, and the reason for that is kind of recognizing number one. The diversity that exists within areas like Chinatown in the Lower East Side, but also recognizes that a lot of the impact that we saw was really Geographic and the reason we thought it was important to put this together was because we have obviously seen a lot of impacts, particularly economic ones, due to COBIT 19 in neighborhoods, with high levels of asian-american populations, because of a lot of the anti Asian discrimination surrounding kovat 19. So we know that you know in lower Manhattan and in Chinatown that as early as February, there were reports of our small businesses and restaurants having loss of 50% in revenue. Before you know- and this is a month before New York ever went on pause and we saw this become a widespread phenomenon. So we joined together to put together this recovery plan, recognizing that the impact in the East geographic areas that have large Asian American populations was going to be different than that facing New York City as a whole. We do plan to kind of continue refining this plan as we see what the ongoing impact of Cova 19 and the economic impacts are, but we also wanted to put together a first draft of it or first go at it early on, because we knew that a lot of decision-makers at the city level, we're going to be, you know, beginning to make decisions about this year's budget and then even looking forward. So for us in the first round of this plan that we sent out to all of our elected officials, we focus on several main areas for recovery and in our minds. It's really important that these areas be addressed in conjunction with each other. Recognizing that you know we have multi-generational families in our neighborhoods. We have residential and commercial that there are just lots of different areas where communities and community members need support. So I'll quickly overview the main areas that we recommended that I'm certainly happy to do a deeper dive into any of them. Depending on where your questions are. One of our main areas was workers and economic security again addressing the idea that we saw large job loss in Asian, American, neighborhoods and large impact on those businesses as early as January, and so for us. That looks like really two major things: providing relief for all of the workers that have had wage loss and replacement and particularly at the city level, pushing for that relief to include community members that have been left out of federal relief, particularly for a lot of immigrant workers in cash jobs, so some delivery workers and other part-time and informal economy workers we've seen that the federal relief has not really been reaching them and so making sure that is something that the city prioritizes and then Karla I just want interrupt you for a minute did committee members that you received this last minute. Even though I sent you maybe a half an hour before they meeting it has an attachment with that plan. Yes, no, yes, oh okay! Yeah! You can read along on that. If you wish go ahead and then moving forward and Naomi did touch on some of these things, investing in workforce training and placement to ensure that, in long term economic recovery, that there are options available to folks, we don't know what the economic recovery is going to look like and so city programs that support our young people like the Summer Youth, Employment Program, our adult literacy programs or workforce training and placement programs and Umbridge programs that serve immigrant community members and other city programs like that. We think, is a really high priority, so that we ensure that community members are able to move through this long term in a significant way and, of course, a concern. There is that, at the city level, we have seen cuts to those programs when what we really would like to see is an investment or an enhancement in those. Instead and of course, that is, you know again something that I only touched on, but something that we're gonna see as kind of a common pattern throughout this. Obviously going along with the support for individual workers is the small businesses. We know that the extra month or six weeks of that economic impact in the lower Manhattan and other Asian American neighborhoods means that small businesses in those neighborhoods are facing an even bigger deficit than they are facing. New York. Why? Because you're talking an additional month of rent, an additional month of utilities and other leases, labor costs where a loss of revenue was already experienced, and so something that we're again they're pushing for at the city level is to designate neighborhoods like Chinatown and Lower East Side as an economic distress zone. We've seen that happen before with disasters like 9/11 and with hurricane sandy and then providing relief in the form of abatements, as well as providing grants for reopening. We also know that housing and neighborhood affordability will be a big issue because of that interrelated economic impact, and one of the things that we really don't want to see is a that. This crisis becomes something that changes our housing or our neighborhood makeup in a significant way because of the impact on people. So thinking through number one. How do we support individual tenants? How do we support NYCHA community members? We know that with the income recertification, there have been a lot of issues for folks living in NYCHA facilities that are technically eligible for relief, but are not getting it and then providing subsidies for commercial tenants that can't afford rent, particularly in mixed use, in supportive housing buildings and then another big area for us is public. Health and healthcare. I'll be really brief here, because this is something that we obviously see an impact on across the board, but in the immediate term pushing for free testing and treatment the contact tracing program at the city level. We think it's very important that be culturally and linguistically appropriate, so that our neighborhoods are really able to participate in and feel safe participating in that program. And then what does it look like at the city to provide comprehensive health care and mental health support, particularly for essential workers who are facing trauma, Asian Americans, who are facing trauma related to stigma and discrimination, and then, of course, supporting our public hospitals. Something that we've been extremely concerned to see is the cuts that happen at the state level to Medicaid, which of course, impact our public hospital systems that supply a lot of the lower Manhattan, a the residents with healthcare services, and so seeing that increased investment in public hospital programming. This was already mentioned really briefly, but or, although ever it really briefly, because it was already mentioned digital language access. We have seen issues with digital access that everything from our young people, which Naomi addressed to actually seniors, really struggling with digital access and being unable to get accurate information because of lack of broadband because of lack of devices and so addressing digital equity moving forward is something that is, you know not only important, but it's highly achievable at the city level, as we think, through what education work and access to information look like and then, of course, language. Access with that, we saw with a lot of our young people, doing remote learning, who either English as a second language for them or for their parents having that additional barrier on top of what other students are already facing, of not being able to have their parents, support them through homework or not being able to navigate instruction in the language that they speak at home and then kind of undergirding. All of this is supporting the community-based neighborhood organizations, so settlement houses, social services agencies that are doing this work. You know we all believe as those community-based organizations that, because we have that deep knowledge in the neighborhoods that we are going to be central to the recovery. I think an example of this that we saw is with the meal delivery programs, where the city went to try to kind of take over those programs and do delivery coordinated through the city that there ended up being a lot of issues not only identifying seniors who are homebound and needed meals, but ensuring that those meals were then going to be culturally competent, nutritionally appropriate and more and so for us seeing those community-based organizations and social services at the center of recovery. We think is going to be really important across the city budget. In this year, we've certainly seen cuts to kind of all of those social services programming that really undergirds this full recovery plan. Dip ton has seen an 11% cut at a time that we know that our seniors need support to remain in their homes safely and comfortably more than ever, dy CD. We have a 39 percent cut, that's largely due to youth programming. We think that now is a time more than ever, that young people actually need this programming support, whether it is after school like the beacons and compass or Youth Employment programming like SYEP and then similarly geo HMH. We saw a an 8% cut and department of social services about the same, and so something that we're really pushing for is, as we move into FY 21 22, as well as beyond, really focusing on building out social services, because we have seen a huge spike in the demand for social services, and if the funding is not there at the city level to meet that demand, then it's really going to slow our recovery process. So I'll pause there and I'm happy to go into any of this further. To whatever extent, it is helpful to the really important work that you're all doing and I really appreciate the efforts that you're making okay I just wanted to note for those of you who are not on the committee and did not receive the email. I sent a link in the chat box. It's like what is it says, something about community-based organizations, release asian-american, blah-dee, blah-blah click on the link and that's the report that Carlin is reading off of and then later on, Naomi sent a link about the digital divide report. Okay, questions for in Karlin, wait questions for Karlin, please raise your hand, Oh, Thomas and then Susan, hey, Colin, call me a dreamer, but is there any possibility of investment from private corporations such as some of these people with the luxury buildings in the neighborhoods and I mean? Has there been any success or attempt to get some private funding? I think that is certainly something that we have to look towards in terms of you know not just relying on government support but really kind of diversifying tactics. One of our recommendations was actually looking at land Trust's, because, obviously what we don't want is for kind of any private support or investment to fundamentally change the character of the communities or have harmful impacts on the communities, but I think that's something that we really have to look towards. Typically, what we've seen is that you know private investment dollars, don't tend to go into asian-american and communities of color as much but I think that is actually all the reason to push for it more at this time. So I think that that's certainly something that we really need to focus on, in addition to thinking through what the government's role in all of this is: okay, Susan. It was an overwhelming amount of information and a lot of things you talked about are things we are also discussing in other committees, for instance, Land Trust is very important. Our housing last night we talked about even particularly the small business needs in Chinatown. So it's covering your report is covering a lot of ground for this committee for our social service organizations. Are there some and haven't looked in your report? So I don't know if it's in the report are there some few top priorities that we can focus on that everybody is agreed on and the reason I asked that, like with SYEP, we wrote what we wrote. A letter protesting comes where everybody focused on SYEP and we may it looks like we may have a little bit of success. So are there a few areas for our social services that we can focus on absolutely and I? Think that is such a great question. So thank you, I think for us. It's a couple of things. Number one would be SYEP and other youth programming. You know we know that this summer is going to look different than other summers. That's just a reality of the situation that we're in that does not mean that we should not be providing young people with high quality programming for the summer and into the school year number one, and for our younger for our younger people. It's gonna be really necessary to allow their parents to work and get back to work and then for our older youth, the high school-age ones. We know that is really critical programming, particularly at a time when their academic experience is interrupted and as they're starting to think about moving into college or jobs or whatever it's coming for them afterwards and then, of course, we know that it's critical income for them and their families as well and so I think that preserving and protecting that funding in FY 21. That's really key. If we don't really fight to restore that programming, I think that we'll find at the infrastructure, the staff spaces will go away because some of the organizations won't be able to sustain it, and so I think that you know that is one critical area that SYEP is the beacons the compasses, oh those second one for me is Senior Services. You know our seniors are going to need ongoing support through the recovery of this. We don't know how long it's going to be until they can safely go back out. A lot of our seniors are already homebound anyway, and so those supportive services look like everything from meal services to support for getting medications, mental health services to combat isolation. The geriatric Mental Health Initiative is just one example of that, but then also health initiatives that come out of the Department of Health and then digital access, because we're seeing- and you know, obviously that digital access goes for our young people too, but we're seeing a real, a real cutoff between our seniors and information and relationships. Because of the lack of digital access, and that's something that you know for fairly low dollar investments. You could really increase digital access for our seniors for kind of the duration of this crisis and recovery, and then I think that the last one is the social services budget in terms of benefits, enrollment and navigation. We're seeing a huge spike in community members that either have not been a part of public benefits before that are now needing snap are needing Medicaid need to navigate unemployment and other changes at the federal level, and so not only making sure that those public benefit programs are fully funded through HRA, but that the navigation exists so that community members that might be limited, English Proficient, might lack digital access themselves and otherwise are really able to connect with them. And I think, particularly as we move into the contact tracing and testing phase, which is likely to go on for some time in New York. According to the estimates that most public health experts are saying, making sure that those navigation services remain throughout. Thank you. If I could just ask follow-up, some of these things are marred, but do you have any idea like, particularly with a number of seniors that we've lost? It is anyone you know. Are there statistics by neighborhood, or you know that we could look at locally and particularly to see where this happened, because this kind of points to looking at the inequality in our neighborhoods I missed the very first part of that question. I'm, sorry I only caught the last so in looking at people that either got sick during the pandemic or that died. Are we tracking that, in a way that we can look at who they are and where they are, so that we can look at this for planning for equity in all areas in the future? Yeah, that's a very important thing to do, and that's actually been. One of our major concerns is that, right now the reporting is actually really based on Hospital data. Only and so the flaws in that are two things number one. It doesn't necessarily give us a comprehensive look at where people live when they've either gotten sick or died due to kovat, and it only covers those deaths that are those sicknesses or deaths that are reported in the hospitals, so places that we're missing are nursing homes, people who died at home, people who are in home care- and the fear is that it's really giving us an inaccurate picture of what the actual situation was as well as what the impact was. Cpc is working with the Commission on public health system, New, York migration coalition and some other organizations on a campaign. That's pushing for better data to be included on that. Of course, the you know in a lot waise we're worried that early data was never collected, and so we've missed that opportunity, but I think, particularly as we move into the next phase, making sure that those systems are in place to do exactly what you talked about and then trying the best. We can to actually gather data from other sources as much as it exists. Hey. Thank you. I'm Carlin. Wasn't there a problem that the data was not aggregated enough? That's been also a huge problem so for folks that saw the data coming out by the Department of Health. It was really you know it took a while for them, first of all to release the disaggregated data by race and then what we saw there is that actually, the largest reported category was other, and so what that says is that either our people aren't collecting race data and it's going into other or because the rain based data was really just split into white black latin x and asian, and didn't break out by racial and ethnic subgroup that when there was the opportunity to either self-report data or data, was being collected from certain places that it wasn't being properly categorized. You know, I, think that we all know anecdotally and by the data that communities of color are being hit harder by Co mid-nineteen than white folks, and we know that, based on not only the koba data, but just the inequalities that have already existed in our healthcare system, but that data is very concerning because it doesn't give us a whole picture. So we've been really pushing for future data collection to disaggregate data into further racial and ethnic subgroups following the city, the outline of the 38 racial and ethnic subgroups that they have collected city health data in before and then other things is that you know there should be other data indicators collected as well, so talking about things like gender identity, LGBTQ status, socioeconomic status, rent status. That obviously has its own complications involved. But what does it look like to actually collect better data, so we really have a sense of where and who and how people are being impacted by this, and that is gonna be really critical again, as we move through recovery over the next several years. Okay, thank you. Paul did you have a question? Your hand was up and down I, had a wonderful monologue, prepared about statistics and then Susan when asked the question so, okay, all right, good, okay! Are there any other questions? Okay, great I just wanted to recognize that our er from Harvey Epstein's office is joined. Us thank you for coming. Okay, Thomas. No I was just saying hi to aura, okay on okay. So what are our okay? So we have all this information. Now, let's talk about what our next step should be right. Now it's about 751! We have inferred, you know we have the reports. We have the information. We can start writing some of it. We still need to invite other speakers to give us more information. What speakers would that be in what areas so we have in our district need statement. We have. We have Health and Human Services I mean I'm. Sorry, we have seniors. We had youth. There was a section on education, various sections on homeless. Then there was a section on health, so it's kind of a mixture of both populations and areas. Could we ask someone to come and I don't know would be from an agency or a nonprofit about the future of shelters for homeless, because it seems that congregate, shelters that we have had in the past are not going to work for the future. Would that be an area that people might be interested in I would think so. I, don't know what they're gonna do Oh Debra I didn't have any ideas about this and Debra seems to have a thumb up, but not sure what that means. I guess just to say that I do think that we should have an advocate speak rather than someone from DHS speak on that you know, I. Think one of the big sticking points of the governor being so hesitant to actually move people into individual rooms in hotels is because how do you get them out? Then? After you know, quote-unquote after the pandemic and so I think yeah we should have someone come from the advocacy community rather than DHS. We have a suggestion. I can look, there's a few people on organizations that are talking about this. A lot on Twitter, but I can look at them and I. Don't particularly know anyone at the one who's really doing this, but I can think about it and get back to you. Who's really doing this, how it's like housing safety net? Something like that. You know before all this happened. Remember we wanted someone to talk. Come talk to us about street homeless. I forgot what the issue was exactly and we contacted Coalition for the homeless, and then they recommended community access. So at the time they were supposed to come to us in April. Of course, we never have April meeting, but if we can go back to them, the one that I'm looking at is called safety net project of the urban Justice Center. So it's like a piece, an arm of the urban Justice Center who's really been advocating on this. There was also a doctor who's really involved in this. My name is Kelly Duran from community access. That's more developmental Carla, who was the person who was coming to us, has worked with us and actually in transportation because of a number of issues that they advocated for I. Don't know for an overall thing whether they would be the best for this, but we can try some of these other places. Okay, I wanted to remind people about the chat box. If you have a question for everyone, please just raise your hand and say it do not put it in the chat box. The top box is only for attendance of non committee members and also, if you're, having technical difficulties you can LaRussa will help you out if you're having technical difficulties, my bad I actually put it in the chat. When you said what was the thumbs up for so the thumbs up is in the chat it was to what Susan said about inviting someone and as a cosign hang on what was just said about having an advocate as well. Okay, great did you have a specific question about it or you just agreed? No, you asked a question so okay, so let me say that Heidi and I will together figure out who to invite and have someone come for the next to the next meeting on that is that okay, Heidi's gonna figure out and make somebody well the two of us together: okay, so that'll be another to do. Susan and Heidi are going to figure it out and invite somebody to come to the July meeting. Okay. So that's for the specifically around well one of the main. Well, a pressing question is: what are we gonna do about these congregate, shelters and settings? And you know maybe the future of sheltering and cb3 and just couldn't would like to announce to everyone. This is not announced broadly, but we got noticed. We now have two hotels with single men being run by BRC in order to have less density in the shelters. So it's an increase in a number of buildings, but the number of people being housed is the same right. Okay, actually, these are people that were not in CB 3 before so our population and CB 3 is actually increasing. Okay, all right Debra. Do you know where, in cb3 these hotels are, could you repeat that ones on the Bowery and ones on Henry Street? Thank you, okay. So what area? What other areas should we take? Carmen seniors? What about seniors? What I was just thinking? Carmen no yeah I mean so far from what I've known any area of the local mutual housing association. We've lost four, so that's been kind of hard to deal with in the meantime and as far as the other programs, they were switched over to just food preparation and delivery. I, don't know of anything else happening right now, except for maybe a few virtual classes that offer perhaps yoga and a couple of other light exercises. I know that our office will offer on June the 17th a, but is it a workshop as it were on with volunteers or legal services on the documents, because, with one of my other senior clients, we lost him, but there's really nothing. We can do at the moment about that. There was no one else that we can call about that. But as far as I'm hearing from my other colleagues I know that distributed masks for us to now give to the seniors. We have had one shipment three weeks ago and we had another shipment this week. Okay, so Carmen I was actually we were asking for July. Do you think we could invite somebody who can talk to us about what the long-term needs of the seniors are for 21 22, or is it what the asks are and then, after that we'll go to Troy, because he has his hand up all right. I can speak to someone at the lower Eastside interagency Council to come and speak about that. Would that be appropriate? Sure you can maybe give us their name, or you know CC me and Susan absolutely, is that Susan? Is that the way to go Susan? That would be fine, I wanted to also suggest along with that. There is no one that knows this better and fights harder than Margaret. If you want to have her come, that would be good too. Yes, it was just talking to us this morning. There's someone from Margaret's office, okay or Margaret, okay, so who wants to Susan? Do you want me to contact them or you I? Don't care one of us, whichever you prefer, okay, I'll do I know you're busy I'll send an email. I'll see you super okay! Try! Yes, I just want to know if you guys are inviting anybody for youth services. I know. We spoke about schooling. We spoke about after schools, but how about something for you services, some programming for the youth after schools, like you, know, that's not involving extra two or three hours after school like a whole program. Louis ID is like in programming. The boys clubs have closed down here and there's really nothing for these kids to do but be out on the streets. Six seven eight times, hello, yeah! Yes, thank you! Okay. What does anyone Henry Street? Do you want to ask Henry Street? Would that be good or No? All right sounds like a good idea. Doesn't anyone Joey in bright, happy, I'm, sorry, Henry Street will be great right, but there's some other nonprofits here that don't have space in the area? That probably yes. So when we invite a speaker, it's not just for them to talk about their own organization, but to talk about the needs overall. Okay, so if they can also speak to the smaller organizations or jet. Actually it's not even about the organization about what the needs for the youth are. So you can say you know. For example, you know more than ever, users are gonna need a summer programming and the social emotional support. Because of all these things are that are happening in order for them to you know, just you know, I've been surviving since the next few years. So that's what we want them to talk about and if the fact yes- and it is focused only on CB 3, they may be someplace else, but we want to talk about programs in CB 3, where we need them where we're losing him where we need to expand yes, so that we do need the specifics. Hey it's outer can ask a question or make a comment sure what about like someone from? Do you ICD we're doing our local nonprofits? Yes, so our the thing is that we want to hear from the ground like what is it that we should be putting into our district needs? Yeah Alliance is also closing all their programming, so that's another loss that we're gonna have well, maybe mm-hmm, yeah I mean say we meet with the agencies in September. We already have a meeting set up with dy CD right, but our I've mentioned the educational alliance. As another agency, that's going to have to cut a lot of youth programming, and today we had you know CPC, which is more a little bit more the Chinatown side, so the next two we should have our is the is a little bit more. The Lower East Side side, I'm gonna, ask Ellen from education Alliance or ask him to send someone from his youth service. Well, they're closing down all of their youth services. Our need we're talking about it. Our needs for July 2021 to July 2022 yeah. Maybe it would be appropriate for them to come, because that way they can say how many students they're no longer gonna service. Well, are they planning to - if they get Reese? Are they planning to they're? Shutting you know them. Oh they're, just shutting down. They just decided to shut down Korea yeah. They were losing money from before and now it's just they've decided to shut down completely so they're gonna partner with Grand Street or Henry Street and give them the names I. Don't know how that's gonna work out, but it would. It might be good to hear from them yeah, but isn't that an educational program from I understand and educational lines goes from five I. Don't know: okay yeah! When we're talking about youth, we're talking about you know up to whatever you like to say up to it from zero to 18 or 21 or whatever starts from zero, so it I just thought. Educational alliances was more geared towards the daycare. What they do curious program yeah. So why don't? Since, let's since Henry, Street and Grand Street are going to be running the program, let's invite them and if we maybe talk to them, if they feel it's appropriate to also invite educational alliance, because if you say that they're going to take on their programs, then we might as well or my feeling is that we can just invite Henry and/or Grant Street. Well, let me find Susan what do you think and I? Don't let's find out, let's find out for sure who's gonna be running the program I mean who's gonna be taking I'll, find out from Henry Street if they were taking them, I think they certainly probably have most programs I, don't know if Grant Street I know has some cornerstone programs, I, don't know what other which other youth programs they have. Does anyone know what the happy sides cornerstone hey Paul did you have an answer to that or you wanted to talk about something else. I was going to go in a different direction. That's answers to this question. Okay, so I don't know that Grant Street has as many other than the cornerstone youth programs. Let me let's find out we'll, have you know one of our big local nonprofits? Come: oh, okay! Oh! Could you talk to them, then here, okay, Paul I, would just couldn't simply add that maybe you want to ask University settlement as well, because they may be one of the agencies that take on some of those young people that are leaving the other educational alliance. Oh and you worked at the door. Well, the doors, not part of cb3, so I don't want to offer any opinion on them. Your mercy settlement is in cb3 the doors. Now we can do that, it's just. You should figure out how many people you want and which are the top people that you want, which how many nonprofits you want on this issue and what are the top ones and I'll contact them? Okay, so we said Graham Street, Henry, Street, University settlement, you, okay, do you want three people? You want three organizations to come. Yeah I! Think it's okay! If they can all speak together. Okay, do you think that they have that, like a you, know, sort of a uniform voice yeah or they? Okay? If they can do, that would be great and whoever's available. I mean you know at least one, and it's one of them. It was just one. Then it's one. If it's all three, it's all three okay I have to have all three okay. So now so just a review. Next, we are finding someone for youth, seniors and homeless population right, okay, anything else on this. Okay, if we have nothing else on the district needs, then its 809. We are going to move on to C a B reports. Did anyone go to any of you have reps? Did you go to a meeting and it you actually did okay? Well, we went to a virtual meetings. We headed over the phone for goo venir. They now are offering no waiting on the testing for kovat, 19 and also antibody testing. So you do not have to make an appointment. You can just go and show up well yeah and ask a question on there. Sure the antibody testing is this from the city and it's from that Roche arrow chg, yes, super okay, any others Bellevue Mount, Sinai, Beth, Israel Charlie- was that the Beth Israel have a meeting. Oh I, don't know! Oh, she yeah. She doesn't seem to be able to unmute herself. Okay, oh hey!

Is that correct, nothing official? It turns out that Smith houses called the meeting that included Catherine Street shelter and she had people from DHS and everyone there except the community board. So that was just something I found out about: okay, all right. Okay, so communications is lacking. I, don't think it was lack of communication. Oh okay, all right, hey Paul was, and that's the I mean Thomas. What's the next agenda item Thomas, you have to unmute your yeah I'm, looking I'm looking. Is it just a vote?

Yes, okay, I should have done it before not a problem. I know a lot of people been asking about. The incident took place on Avenue in early May. That will be addressed in a review: a transportation Public Safety on Tuesday, this Tuesday, the 9th at 6:30 on zoom'. So if you have questions about that incident that specific incident and that review, we will be doing that this Tuesday on the agenda so generally I encourage all committee members to look at the agenda items each month and if there's something you're interested in to both of the committee meetings, it's a little easier now because you don't have to leave your house, but you do have to get on the zoom. So it's where a lot of the work is done and a lot of the information is given out so and then you can also you know most times you know participate in the discussion as well. I really encourage you to look at the UM, the agenda, the other meeting items and please go to the meetings. If you're interested are there any other announcements or new news or old news? Okay, wonderful and so this meeting is adjourned and you will be getting minutes from us in about a week. Okay, so thanks guys, they say: okay, see you soon bye. Thank you.
