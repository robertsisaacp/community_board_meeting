I think there are different ways we can work on it, but hopefully this one is a very straightforward issue and the resolution is pretty straightforward, so megan, if you'd like to sort of introduce the context for it, and then I will bring up the resolution because alex made some comments on it While you sorry so this is, you know, sidewalk cafe, licenses that are issued by dca department of consumer affairs, so usually the process is when you're applying there's certain application fees when you're applying for the first time you know But since Covid-19 happened, they stopped issuing those licenses, but they- and you know I had asked you know attorneys saying like: do they then like what are they doing with their application fees The city was going to go with that versus the sidewalk cafes So then, like the state city is still holding on to the applicant's money and there hasn't been any talk about them.
My only concern is for the places that may close down and those in that mean time so that's kind of where it came from the city's holding on to this money So I you know I'd like for them to return the money to if the applicant so chooses the money to be returned, which I don't think I made clear at the end, so I might want to tweak that a little bit, but that's kind of where we're coming from and happy to answer any questions about that.
Okay, when the when the city opened up the process for the sidewalk cafes, I do not recall there being like all of us , I'm aware of several places that they're sidewalks, I never thought about a fee, I'm not sure how the city can justify it, except under the heading of long-term practice, but given everything that we're going through economically, I have no problem supporting megan's resolution asking that they returned these fees back to the applicants.
I wanted to add, because I guess I what I don't know how to put it, but I just thought of this before the meeting is: I don't want them the dca just to return all the application fees and then to feel like businesses if they are staying, open kind of like lost their place in the line and aren't you know what, if we get rid of this open restaurants program, you know in a year or two from now they want they still want to be like sort of in the line to get their sidewalk cafe license.
it's in the second paragraph also , so, whereas application fees for businesses applying for sidewalk cafe for a sidewalk cafe license are significant, ranging from 2500 to 3 000 for an unenclosed sidewalk cafe to more than 6000 for an enclosed cafe, and whereas the mayor's executive order, number 126 issued on june 18th 2020 and definitely suspended the issuance of sidewalk cafe licenses in favor of the NYC open restaurants program and whereas, although the city suspended payments for sidewalk, cafe renewal fees during the covet 19 crisis, it did not include the return of sidewalk cafe, application fees for first-time applicants and whereas the department of consumer affairs that processes sidewalk cafe license, applications has not communicated with applicants about when their licenses may be issued or when their fees would be returned.
And whereas restaurants in new york city have suffered incredible financial losses due to the health pandemic with many forced to close, therefore, be it resolved that community board three asks at the department of consumer affairs all sidewalk cafe: application fees to applicants who have not yet been granted licenses.
and I think susan could probably comment on this, but he wanted to bring up how the increased drug use on the streets, the drug selling and the drug use is acting as a deterrent to people moving into the neighborhood and well first, I want to say that there is the issue which is separate.
You know you have transportation, sanitation and public safety Things have affected my businesses to some degree, but I think I agree with anisha that yes, like if they're going in community board theories district needs statement anywhere, it should be health and human services.
There are a lot of negative things happening in the community that are impacting businesses and it's not because there are some homeless people on the street in front of the church in the nativity or in front of the luxury condos that were the side of the second avenue explosion.
Yes, it is a problem and because of the productive complaining it you know, the board is going to try and act on it, so that my question is then, which is it sounds like it is being worked on, but then does that mean that we don't need to include it in the district needs or do you think it'll have more of an impact or help your work?
The city could collaborate with the community to create wpa style programs to employ artists and cultural workers for the next three to five years, as the impacted arts and cultural industries rebound dcla should collaborate with DOE to create grants and funding streams for cultural organizations that provide support services, including remote learning and after school programs for local schools.
or I guess we are, we knew, but I didn't know, budget priority process with us, and then we can also think, as the arts and culture subcommittee, about which of these more immediate needs should just be resolutions.
I think that you know we can work together to figure out how to change some of those bullet points and then present it at the october economic development committee meeting and then have the arts like have more arts and culture people come sub community members come to sort of weigh in on it then as well susan.
