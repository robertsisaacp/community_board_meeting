So just keep that in mind too, if you think you're having a private conversation with somebody you're, not it gets recorded and downloaded as part of the transcript of the meeting for those of you joining us with the video reminder to keep yourself muted while you're not talking and when you need to talk, you can either click on the microphone icon or just hold down the space bar, and you need to hold down the space bar the whole time.
I also request that cb3, you know to indemnify all of the open streets projects, making it far more equitable for block associations, lower-income and smaller groups to participate in this important community health initiative.
Testimony session- and so we are going to move now to the electives reports and before we get started with that, I just want to say that we have I should say: Susan has spent a immense amount of time over the past couple of days trying to coordinate the electives.
We don't want to get into a situation like we were in last month where the electeds reports took over two and a half hours, so we are going to be starting, so we've organized them the best way we can, and unfortunately things change.
Everyone has other meetings to get to and other town halls that they're holding and you know the past hour, we've been dealing with emails coming in from people asking for their time to change and we're just going to do the best I can and if they're still on the talk to us, they're still going to talk to us, but we have asked East elected official to keep their report to ten minutes and those ten minutes include the Q&A session.
Think one thing that's going to happen is we're gonna, be communicating this way in the future.
Both the mayor and the governor have pleaded with us that their revenues are down, they have gaps in their budget and if they don't get city and state funding, then they will have to start layoffs, which is going to be a terrible thing for our people, so that is the top priority.
As the chair of the Oversight Committee I have a responsibility for the post office and where they're going to run out of money this summer, can you imagine how many people are getting their medicines by mail, communicating by mail?
Only doing loans over $100,000 and to call him you don't get to write the rules it's supposed to be eligible to everyone, but in this new round we funded or siphoned off or courted off, sixty billion for really small businesses, and this money will be distributed through credit unions, a minority institutions CDFIs which were created for unbanked, low-income people and micro lenders that are participating in the program, and this will be protected and used ugly for small businesses and I know.
There are a lot of allegations about misuse already in this program and as the chair of the Oversight Committee, we are sending out letters for accountability tracking where these loans are going and I call the SBA today, I want to listing up those getting loans in my district I want to make sure that we are treated fairly under this program.
It looks like you're, probably the only question so thank you fundamentally I know you're trying to do a lot and it's very good that you segregated those sixty billion for real small businesses because they really didn't get to access any of the loans.
So since there is this difficulty of accessing the relief in the various forms that it exists out there for the people who are really most in need, and then there is no movement yet on the legislation, even though I know it has been introduced now, even at the federal level about rent suspension.
It's been a deadly disease, the worst challenge, I faced since I've, been in office and it's I've been through a lot of difficult times with all of you with Sandy and economic downturn and, of course, 9/11 I just want to mention one of my signature bills was the 9/11 health and Compensation bill to help take care of the workers took me a long time to pass it.
We have to take care of them and that's a priority of mine legislatively I yield back so Thank, You, congresswoman I think we're having some issues with the QA function and there are former hands raised, but we're already at 20 minutes for the first elected official, so I really want to move on here.
Michael I appreciate the fact that you're trying to get through this meeting quickly, I just wanted to thank congressman Maloney first for her efforts in which I joined and attempting to really repeal the discriminatory and homophobic FDA gay men blood ban.
If you want to donate blood in your gay man, I guess that's progress, but there's still more work to be done, especially since plasma is so important when folks, who have recovered from covin 19 can contribute, and hopefully aid to people's health and research.
I want to thank them for all their work, including distributing meals using you know, leveraging different parts of our districts like the management company at Stuy, Town Peter Cooper, which is owned by Blackstone they've, been donated.
You know to distribute those meals and I'm very happy to be part of that, and then I wanted to tell you about one bill and then I'll, then I'll go which is I, think top of mind for so many people in our district, as the congresswoman noted, so many renters is how you gonna pay the rent.
I'm on I've been appointed to the revenue-raising committee for the state Senate we're going to look at ideas to you know the governor's proposing 10 billion dollars worth of cuts in the absence of any aid from the feds.
Obviously we have to tax the wealthiest, but you know we got to think of creative solutions like who's making money during this kind emic.
You know, bodies for their private needs and you and I have discussed this and yes, you know any child who's here belongs is good, but this I think really opens the door for a very different industry with which does not have altruism as its goal so thoughts on that.
We now require a whole host of protections for women who want to act as servants, including their own medical care, health insurance, life insurance, independent legal counsel, ensuring that they have counseling make sure that they have every medical decision is made by themselves, including whether to carry a child through term or not so I believe we're raising the standard for surrogacy, because so many states in this country and, frankly, the world have no laws whatsoever and that's where women and parents who are well intentioned and egg donors get taken advantage of.
The spectrum from people that have a lot to people that really have basically nothing and families, are just struggling with food security and trying to figure out how to pay the rent, which is due in three days, and it has been really troubling just to see how hard it is for so many families and I know that this is an unprecedented time and we're trying to move as quickly as possible.
Council does not have the capacity to do that right now, as I have hundreds of cases in my office we're coordinating a large network, along with other elected officials who are on this, call to deliver meals and pharmacy runs and to take care of each other, so it has been very challenging, but I think the first virtual stated when office as well as it could and I know that some of you have participated in some of the hearings that we've held transportation general welfare.
So it is really the haves and have-nots and I think that those disparities have not only been brought to light in terms of what we already know that food housing, health care and education, which are basic human rights specially in this city, are not accessible to everyone, but that we also see that in the fatality numbers, which have been absolutely heartbreaking.
I could say that coming from a former small nonprofit and making sure that we're saving things like the Summer Youth Employment Program, when our pools are going to be closed, we don't know about what's gonna happen in their parks in our beaches and our young people need something to do.
During the elected reports, questions can only come from board members, so I know that there's a couple of people who are in the attendee list that have their hands raised.
I currently know thank you for everything, you're doing I'm gonna leave the parks question for probably someone else.
Now they're kind of on board and I think we can use this open streets program so creatively in terms of even saving some of our restaurants.
I know the mayor kind of did his big announcement and many people think that we might not go through with the bill, but until we see a real plan from the mayor, not just an allocation of how many miles are going to be determined by the NYPD.
So I would say, send those recommendations to me, but how we can do it, we're kind of still figuring out the process to make sure that people do feel included, because you all know your communities best and that's what happens when you're kind of you know trying to operate in the midst of a pandemic.
Thank You, council members, I know you have another Town Hall to get to so we're going to do one more last question from you from Valentina Jones.
What we can do is if you want to type your questions into the chat box and make sure to specify who they're for when I download the transcript tomorrow from the chat box, I will highlight the questions that are for the certain elected officials and send them to the elected officials, great okay, here's a question in terms of the people that are working whenever I hear these presentations.
So my question is: who is going to talk to the workers, the workers, with just a variety of issues that, like I, said whenever I hear most officials talk and people from the hospital sector?
So anyway, in terms of the workers who are going to talk to the workers to get the actual frontline story, because I think that's what we're not hearing is the actual people that are out there working and what this situation is like and what their concerns are, especially because rules have basically changed and they know that they've changed no who's going to talk to the workers.
We're also working to make sure that will protect whistleblow, because that is how a lot of the information got out to the public into the world as to the conditions that were going on in some of our hospitals, I mean look at Elmhurst alone, what went down in Elmhurst Hospital and how that news got out the people who were working inside.
So just so you know, if you have anything that you want to flag, please let us know we're always looking for information as to how to improve a system or, quite frankly, if we have to shame them if they are not doing what they're supposed to do, I think, what's going to be the hardest one of the hardest things that we haven't quite had to grapple with?
Seeing you know dozens of people die every night and in addition to the teachers and the students and the families and everyone else who are in homes where there is domestic violence, there needs to be a mental health program implemented.
Let me know what you hear: I'm always interested I'm, always checking with workers as well as people like a dr., Katz and I want to make sure that people feel safe when they're inside what we deem as one of the spaces in New York City, which is a hospital okay.
We want to protect whistleblowers, they're, doing the right thing and letting people know of the conditions, and it is because of them that many of the terrible conditions that existed in some of our systems early on were eventually rectified.
Okay, hi everyone and I'm hope that everyone is healthy and safe I'm on the iPhone, because my iPad and my computer is not working I think I used too much today the morning you know straight through because we had a hearing today, as my colleague Karina was talking about housing and building meeting and we're starting to have hearings about some of the package, a bill that she talked about earlier.
In the beginning of the shutdown people who were supposed to be getting, you know home-delivered meal from the senior centers, and that was going well for a while.
But one of the things that we want to focus on is that we want to make sure that, coming out of this crisis, that our Senior Center are kept home because they are so crucial in our community because, right now they don't really have any part in it.
And we want to make sure that program continued to grow, because the need will continue to grow and, as you heard from my colleague earlier, the budget cut is gonna, be it's devastating and that's why we need help from our federal government and in some of the calls that we have with the congressional delegation and our congressional leader.
It did not happen in this 3.5 and has to happen in the next one, because otherwise New York City the whole could be up to eight billion dollars and, like we're, gonna lose a lot of the safety net program that we fought so hard for the other one is our youth program there's no way that we could just get rid of summer youth program and we're working with provider to figure out a creative way of providing services to our youth during the summer the mayor has set up.
The other thing is that I know there's a lot of discussion about small businesses and sadly it's like our small business got left out.
Now they put in more money in this 3.5, and the good news is that from the discussion with council, congresswoman Maloney, there's 60 billion dollars, set aside for women and minority-owned business, and also to allow smaller bank and credit union and Community Development Fund to help small businesses.
I just wanted to hear any thoughts you have about the devastation that has happened in New, York, City, nursing homes that you know as the governor and the and the industry blame each other.
Requirements demands asks for nursing homes going forward because I think there are media things which are being done, the best they can, but in the future it looks like there were things that could have would have gone better.
Okay, my mom right now is in the nursing, skilled nursing facility, I company R, and it's such a big difference between the City one and the private ones, and so we really have to figure out how to you know, support nursing.
We just gotta get everybody involved and when nursing home I think we have to work to really elevate home health aides, nurses, a they are the caregiver and we gotta make sure they get paid better, that they are treated with respect and so that, because they are so critically needed, but if we don't even pay the minimum wage, how do we attract most people to go into that field?
If you wanted to leave time, hey we'll just close by saying that we heard from the governor's folks that they might entertain yet an extension on the moratorium of evictions, we're going to push for that and we're going to push them to allow us to use security deposits for rent that's a way of actually getting money, not out of someone's pocket but into the hands of some of the smaller landlords that really they too are struggling.
Thank you, I everything that you're doing and so I just want to bring up, because in I understand, you're the chair of the Higher Education Committee and I had a conversation with Epstein about this as well so testing standardized tests are, you know, there's a lot of inequity in them, as it is personally I've.
Looking at the fact that she's, probably gonna have to really have a high-stakes test in late September and so I'm wondering if suni is discussing or if you can raise it with suni, just like these schools and a lot of other schools that are dropping the requirement for a CT and SATs for the upcoming admissions yeah I think that I will make a note.
I am Deborah thanks again for all the work you're doing, I wanted to touch upon what you had said about food distribution and how the city is taken over that from the community, centers and I'm.
Community groups, food banks are doing a great job, even though they're very stressed so I call the office two one, two, six, seven, four five one, five three: if there's a community center that is having a food distribution, trouble that we can work through with the city but the it's, the seniors we've been focusing on because they literally should not be going out, he's actually trying to get on now.
Thank you great, so I know you have our report I'll, just kind of briefly talk about things that we haven't touched on.
The additional eight point, two billion couldn't reflect all localities and unfortunately, in our but the state passed, we gave the governor the authority to do quarterly adjustments for the budget, and you know it's I think it's troubling that we gave up that authority but move forward.
Well, everyone hopefully, is able to recover through a lot from folks around prescription medication and we're trying to during the pandemic to live coverage for 120 days, so people aren't freaked about getting their medication and small business issues are just you know.
If you hear people having concerns about getting unemployment, benefit officers they're having daily conversations with the governor's office- and we can get you that information and if they're you know every week, there's events we're doing I'm doing a town hall along with Deborah Glick tomorrow night around, you know, with the young Invincibles or on Keeney SUNY issues, I'm doing when they Creek around small businesses, I think we're all trying to catch as many people as we possibly can on these issues.
I think we are lucky to have such great colleagues on the east side with the assembly and send in the council I'm lucky to be able to be able to work with them, and if we think we can get something done, we can figure it out together early today, we you know yes, a or two days ago, the governor's office dropped a lot of hand.
Some people might question, cancel right, I, think it's legal, especially with putting a hardship fun together for those difficult landlords, but he's in a lot of power today and you should be exercising it instead of doing cuts, helping regular people.
Thanks for all your work, just instead of focusing on regarding commercial rents, instead of focusing on cancelling rents, which I think would require some sort of federal backstop of money or some sort of real estate tax concession, can we put the power in the hands of actual commercial tenants, and you know make some of these I know you're, not SBA, but if you give, if we're able to pay the rent and give us the funds to pay the rent, then the power is with us.
But you know we understand that, like the more we understand that the landlords are small businesses as well and they need to get their rents as well.
Yes, you know we don't have money in New, York State I have a bill to allow commercial tenants to basically create like a scree tree type program for their small commercial businesses to say the landlord gives some portion of the rent that can be as a real estate production of real estate taxes.
Grier from my staff has been there the whole time and so I understand you've heard quite a bit about you, know: unemployment and food and many other issues we're working collaboratively with all of them and with Elias ready on those things and I'm.
We've got two hundred and fifty percent of what's called fair market rent which, in New York City, would cover rents potentially up to around forty eight hundred dollars depending on the number of bedrooms, and it would be available to people who have lost income or jobs probably have a range of criteria that would allow people to qualify and the goal would be since this is emergency to create a relatively smooth process for people to get that assistance and again that I think that you know we.
But we know there's going to be a need for a lot more.
So as Harvey noted about 200 of us legislators and other government officials, as well as lots of advocates, have called for a hundred billion dollar national figure, with ten billion of it going for New York, and that was addressed to our compression on New York congressional delegation and our two senators, and some of them have responded favorably and have actually put in writing their desire to try to make sure that is funded in the next stimulus.
Sorry, oh just I know that money has already been allocated through the cares act to the states, but I've heard that the governors are saying you know and a lot of senators also saying we can't actually use this money because of all those in place on it, including through the new Treasury guidelines.
You know the effort of providing relief through stimulus bills that are going to cost additional money, so I think one option is, to the extent that they are going back to the drawing board, it's probably easier for them to modify the terms of some of the things they've done already than it is to.
You know: ask the executive branch, through its discretion, to change the terms of some of these things, that we can also ask Congress to go back to the drawing board and modify these programs to the extent they're, not working as they seem to have been intended to be and again.
We believe that the program with, let me take, let me take the two different, the categories you took differently, people who, like the question of how you prove a loss of income, we would say that we would likely to explain how the bill says if you had a substantial loss of income and it's subject to rules that would be put in place by the agency administering the program, which is the state HCR, and we are probably gonna, expand that to specify that certain things, what can it would automatically qualify if you qualify for unemployment if you are certified as facing eviction, if you have had significant, if you lost a job and I would remind you that I remind you, because I would make I would note that proving that you had a job, and now you don't have a job is easier than a lot of the programs that normally your you're trying to document.
So I'm just going to remind my fellow board members that there's a question you wanted to ask, and you have time to just type it into the chat box and when I move along to the electors and if I can just one more quick plug, we have a we're also having a town hall.
Everyone also because I'm, like the last on all of the different levels, besides scale I, didn't even know she said on I'm so excited but I just wanted to say many thoughts, and so many things I type into the chat already, but we cannot be losing this battle against Staten Island.
As a lot of you know, we had talked about the need for absentee ballot applications, so folks probably know that I had made sure to ask for our absentee ballots to be mailed.
I also found out that you know we wanted to have expanded access to absentee ballots for our safety and that also we wanted to make sure we found out that a lot of different municipalities were allowing online applications, but our city wasn't our city, BOE wasn't, and now it is, and so we raised those issues and we luckily got like a lot of phone calls and then things moved along and we actually won.
A lot of other reps have already talked about that our office has been trying to make sure that you know whether or not it's you can't get on the site.
So that was a big win, but the thing is it's like a little late for our state to actually be able to utilize it in the best and effective way, and you look a little bit of a runway for our credit unions for our Community Development financial institutions.
You know our Chinatown businesses started to suffer starting in like early February, and we really need help and I started to ask on the state level for help since then, since end of January, because I start coming and I just I really fear that we're not providing the help that we need, and so we had to think outside of the box, and we have been trying to raise different funds for revolving loans.
It's been really upsetting to kind of think about what would happen if we don't find a solution for folks- and you know, there's six different programs right now and I will tell you.
Oh, if a kind, bigger business is able to return their money, maybe it can come to us, but if that's not the way, I think it should work.
You know, it's not shameful at all right to ask for help and I also want to talk about my rent forgiveness bill reven forgiveness bill that a lot of folks are talking about people talk about as hashtag cancel, rent but I think that it's not as it's not so much as like.
You know basically covered and I just wanted to kind of end on that and give you some time for questions.
I, don't know, what's going on with what, whether or not that's actually happening or not, but then I haven't heard anything about a technical freeze, but I think that we can do a little bit of a check up on that we've.
This is what I think exist so, and the governor and the mayor each have their own individuals who are making up the recovery committee and I want to tell all the community boards.
I know the city council pressured the mayor and I think there's another example of what does the community board in your case 4-3?
I assume this projects going to go forward, but I want you to know that we've been working with them.
I think you have also- and that's going to be a very large project and last time I wanted to talk about Chinatown for a minute.
But if you have some specific needs, please let Brian know because we will try to address them and get them delivered, and thank you very much hope you read our newsletter and congratulations to your amazing virtual community board meeting.
Obviously, we're constrained for space and the city has announced severe cuts to parks, and it seems a little odd because that's where people are going to go for recreation with pools being closed and we don't know what's gonna happen with beaches in other areas.
So that's another place to put focus as team who you know or just make sure that as a board or as a community, you tell them the same thing and then the third thing is the mayor said: open streets will be near parks.
Our next question is coming from Robin Chatel, yes, hi, Gayle Robin, all the work you're doing like your newsletters are just so amazing I wanted to ask you about the East River I know that there's plans to put this community up together, but is there been any changes to the timeframe for that?
Obviously the Advisory Group could say this is different than before, but we can let you know you mean the community board will hear about anything.
I feel very strongly about the health, but I am sure that, as we sit here today, the governor, who will decide what's essential and what's nine when it gets rolled out so on, he said the next couple of weeks is going to be construction and manufacturing and then they'll be you know, an assessment and then the next one and the next one he did say that the industries are gonna rule.
We've had I think four or five of them so far, all of them have had over 200 people and we just want to get those word out to as many small businesses as we can to help as much as we can.
You can look to for additional help, whether your homeowner or tenant want resources for nonprofits, small businesses or freelancers are concerned about New, York's, seniors students or immigrant communities.
If you have any questions about the information presented in the Resource Center or would like to submit a resource to be included, and that's all I got, thank you guys for doing this again, Michael and I'm sure.
Hopefully they will all get their announcement letters and they will be appointed on Friday and if there are any members, any new full board members that are on the line at the moment, I want to encourage you to attend upcoming, make committee meetings check out our website and if you haven't been there already, please make sure you are checking in on the community board three website.
Okay, also I want to thank our elected officials for being on the front lines, distributing meals, checking in on our community and doing the hard work as we are dealing with this epidemic and this pandemic.
I apologize if there are others and I haven't seen you, but I want to thank those three members for doing an exceptional job of going out to the development and making sure that there's food being distributed to our seniors and our very vulnerable community.
The district needs which is for the year starting in July 2021, and you know, I with you, it's going to be very different.
I think I mean I work for a non-profit, I know some of the committee members and board members do, and you know right now.
Sorry I raised my hand for land use that didn't meet I'm, just saying that now so my question is they just started voting again at City Council for your lips and stuff, like that and I know that we were scheduled when of the crisis hit.
I can't raise my hand anymore, so I just wanted you to know to call on me: okay, yeah.
If you look at our you know, our procedures is kind of late doesn't seem like an issue, but it we usually put things on the agenda before the full board.
