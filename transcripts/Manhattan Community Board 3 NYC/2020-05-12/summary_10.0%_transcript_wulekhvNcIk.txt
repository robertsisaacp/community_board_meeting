Okay, after we approved the minutes, the presenters will speak, as always after the presentation committee members will discuss.
Mary may have may not marry- is his backup and then we'll create the resolution and vote on that and then we'll vote to adjourn okay, so first I guess I should just leave that agenda right up there shouldn't I.
I want to switch back to see the full screen now just leaving this agenda here in case we want to go back, hope, you're, muted, okay, sorry, so just go up to the top and you stock shares huh.
That's you David yeah I was wondering I, don't remember, seeing the minutes of the last meeting, nothing that's terribly important, but we're gonna be voting on.
My screen host is able to attend a screen sharing, you're muted, it says: host disabled attendee Xiao hold on one second of okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna I'm, unable that here, let's see if I were doing it, I'm not going to okay, so I think you have to make him a host to allow it.
This is a you know: Italian style, Renaissance facade and we are not we're not touching that facade, so nothing we're doing is on the outside, which is why staff wasn't sure if they, this should be a Commission level hearing or if they could do it as staff, and ultimately they decided.
This blue mosaic tile and the owner feels it's cold and wants to put something warmer, they're more inviting- and we have already in the if you look at G, 101 image, five and image six.
Yes, we can okay and then there's blue tile along this wall and this wall, and this is a ramp that runs down that was parking in the basement and then there's a small steep ramp for loading things on in the eastern gate and the center gauges remains the entrance to the residence so we're proposing to remove this tile or clad over this tile with this with a similar wood that we're using on the interior and this right.
So immediately, when you walk in past this you're going to have see this wall, which is the slats of the same material, and in that instance, we are using the same IPE wood on the ceilings and we're just trying to sort of tie the whole design from when you penetrate the four main facade - when you actually experience the rest of the residence on the interior.
When you enter then see this would that it's just a comment yeah and that tile you know, was put in the 90s.
Most of the restoration work is going to probably be cleaning and repairing some of the limestone, but nothing no modifications to the facade which would include the gate, so the visibility would not increase beyond what it is now in any restoration, the facade is kind of kind of cool like you have I, don't know if you can point to these tribals better at the top of them on that top a lot where it says three public baths, and these little trident sin there yeah they had a nautical theme on that they did pick up on, is analytical themes in that at the top.
Okay, so David did you have any comments or questions.
This is David, I, think I kind of see what Mitch was saying and it would did strike me that anyone know what the original walls were like when it was made, and fortunately now, oh so, but as you said, it's just it's a little bit of a an awakening to see that it's also so modern and this building doesn't look that old.
We we're not even removing that tile because of for fear of any damage that might happen through that process, but it's just the it's the brick walls you can they're on there on the inside of the residence they're just exposed regular red, brick, okay, so there's so.
Okay, anyone else have a question long hand.
Yes, okay, great, let's see if I can do this again.
Okay, I'll learn how to do this next time, I'll be a pro one, more thing, while Linda's pulling that up just I know, there's a few more people that have joined since the beginning of the meeting.
For the meeting minutes and the records, oh thanks for giving us that okay here comes lessees comments.
They essentially said that lefty understands the work to consist of the removal of non historic blue tile from within which you're not actually doing right, you're just covering it over and its replacement with IP hardware funding, as this work appears to become confined entirely to non historic portions of the building and will not involve any changes to the historic Street.
I'll speak with them and I'll reach out to you anyway, and I would love to have that conversation and see if anything can come of it, and you know great thanks any more public comment.
Now you got it okay, so going down to the designation report makes no mention of the blue tile, which I found kind of interesting I.
I, don't know if you want to use the terminology: approval, okay, doesn't leave it as it is.
