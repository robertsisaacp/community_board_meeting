Don't you have to make a motion in a second and ask if there are any amendments, I don't go so last month, michael said that we did not okay, I mean I can if you want, but I don't know- we've never done that before in the past that we you're not supposed to do that: okay, andrea gordillo, yes, herman, hewitt, joe kearns, yep, david louie, yes, alexandra milotano; yes, richard ropiak, richard rodney, washington, richard said yes, but he's on mute.
You know, as we've been talking about the district needs, I wanted to introduce some information and data around unemployment.
I know that we have heard from lesson in the past around specific programs that they run in our district, but I think that we are sort of in an unprecedented time of changes with our in within our economy that are affecting individuals like never before in this committee we talk a lot about small business and sort of larger real estate and economic development things, but we haven't, at least in the past couple of months, talk specifically about how this is really affecting the people that live in our community.
For those of you who don't know us we're a research organization think tank policy organization- it's been around for about 25 years now focused on expanding economic opportunity, reducing inequality and building a more inclusive economy here in new york, and we do that through research by publishing reports and studies that unpack some of these issues in detail, that put forward practical and achievable recommendations for policy makers, and I think, ultimately, that do a pretty good job of shining, a light on issues that have gone overlooked and getting them onto the radar of our elected officials.
So we do this in lots of different ways, but certainly research on the state of new york city's economy is a big part of that, and this is just a tiny piece of what we do if we kind of take a look at the data that informs better policy making, so anish invited me here tonight to share a little bit of that data with you all on your district, specifically the lower east side and and parts of chinatown, and I can share some of the latest data, both a look at where we stood in these in these neighborhoods right before this pandemic and then sort of a sense of where we may be right now because of this crisis, and of course, happy to you know, take any questions or discuss any further, but I did have just a few brief slides to kind of keep.
Thanks anisha yeah, absolutely we've been really busy since march, but I focused on all sorts of different effects of the of the crisis and certainly if anybody checks out our work or doesn't know us before tonight, and you have any thoughts or questions, you can just contact me directly and I can get my email at the end, but I'm also you can find me on cuff's website as well joe.
You know there were about 68 600 employed residents in the community board district about two-thirds are people of color race other than white on the census about 36 percent born outside of the united states.
It was about 3.6 percent in the lower east side in chinatown about a year and a half ago, and one other trend that I won't spend any time on really tonight, but certainly is geared up in my heart in the work that we do at center for urban future, which is that the population of the lorry side has really been aging significantly, as it has been in the whole city, but about 14.4 percent of the population was 65 or over.
It is a factor, certainly when we think about workforce issues, though, because among other factors, age has been correlated with job losses and a lot of older workers have really struggled in the last few months.
I mean it's basically the hardest hit industry in the whole city, and that is where the greatest you know concentration of residents in the district work in restaurants.
So almost 6, 000 people and that's you know clearly the number one I think impact by industry that you would see in the district right now.
Clothing stores really leaps out at me, a particularly hard hit industry again seeing job losses of almost 70 since february, and there it's a fairly large concentration of workers in that, and just in clothing stores alone in the neighborhood individual and family services, which includes a lot of social services organizations which have also seen some pretty serious losses as they've dealt with diminished revenues and other challenges and construction.
You know we're talking about administrative staff, custodial staff, all kinds of people that work in colleges and universities and that's a generally an industry.
Now we don't know what the job losses look like by occupation, but we can kind of imagine given what some of these occupations say about where people work in terms of industry- and I did just want to put this forward because I think it's interesting to kind of get a sense again of where you know where your neighbors work, what kinds of occupations they have rather than just industries.
You know, there's a lot of people that are working in management, they're, probably doing okay right now for the most part, although potentially making tough calls every day.
Although certainly we've seen some new data that suggests that jobs have come back about 20 or so of the jobs that were lost from february to may started to come back in june, and that seems to be closely linked with the success I think, of the open streets initiative so certainly worth you know paying attention to that.
The second comment: much earlier, you said something about people employed at the age of 25 and over, could you could you define that a little better sure I mean so this is looking at a data on I mean there's a couple of cutoffs.
So you know that's a separate category, that's tracked in the data and in this case we're just you know, rather than there's a large number of residents who are not employed, including a large number of those 65 and over residents that we talked about before so we're focusing on people that are generally speaking in the workforce and seeing either are they working and if so, where are they working?
Take a take a separate look at this sort of 18 to 25 band and where those folks are working, I think you know our colleagues at at henry street have a lot to say about that, but you're absolutely right- and I think you know, among other things, we've seen two general trends I can just mention across the city and I'm sure you all you know can see this playing out in the in the district as well.
Anecdotally, all the time- and you know it includes everything from graduating, with a cuny college credential, but working in food service and not in a field that aligns with the degree and that's a significant challenge that we hear about quite a lot and certainly for folks with a high school diploma.
I don't have this data just for the district, but you can see you know the by far in a way, the greatest job losses have been in full service, restaurants, both new america.
You know total numbers and also the share of all jobs lost since february, but but right up there at the top is performing arts, it's actually even higher in terms of the share of jobs that have been lost, and I think you know olympia to your point.
You know, I think, there's a there's a multiplier effect here, because so many artists work in the arts and may appear in the data there, and I can actually give you those numbers.
I think, if you ask me kind of just you know, bluntly who's faring the worst right now: kind of industry-wise, it's food service, retail and and the arts I mean those are the big three.
Thanks for the presentation, this is fantastic in the beginning, you mentioned a figure, I think 17 percent of residents in the dish in the in the community that work in the four harvest industries.
You know in part because lori said, is actually particularly vulnerable to those first two categories: about seven percent of lower east side residents, work in restaurants and about seven percent work in retail, where it's a little bit lower than some of these other hard hit.
Whereas in previous crises, like the great recession, which you know, hammered jobs and finance but did not barely touch jobs and restaurants in new york city, at least it also is, you know, previous recessions have kind of borne out the idea that that tourism is relatively recession-proof and obviously this particular crisis is wiping out those gains as well.
You know globally, on you know in just one community here in new york, gaspar, your next for your question and for your presentation and then I'd also like to note that david has posted some links in the chat that everyone should look at as well.
You know, learned from eli, so much about the people who reside in the district and where they work, what kinds of jobs, but there is a lot of information about the businesses in the district that are employing people outside of it and that's significant as well.
So that might be a little bit about where my question is eli, on what you might be able to say about employment losses for the categories of businesses within the district, as opposed to the residents who work anywhere in the city in those industries.
Certainly, I think you do see those same two top categories: restaurants, retail, definitely a big one that doesn't pop up when you look at occupations, but absolutely as a factor are those cultural venues of which there's so many and it's everything from movie theaters to you know performing arts centers that have all.
I do think that the tourism related is another big category where it's not just employing people who live on the lower east side, though many do, but is drawing workers from all over the city.
You know part of the strategy and I know and we're huge fans of lesson at the center for an urban future, but it's around you know pooling the demand within the neighborhood to try to create local employment opportunities, but that's also targeting folks, where you know some of those barriers may be a little bit lower and there's a way to kind of go from point a to point b for a lot of the jobs that have been most insulated.
Stick around for this part too, just to hear about what david and gaspar are going to discuss is that you know when we think about recovery, and you know how we'll move forward as a city and as a community district workforce development has come up as something that's an important piece of an equitable recovery for the economy and, obviously lessen is our.
Also, you know by the time like by next year, we'll also have the 14th street tech hub, we'll sort of be starting to move a little bit more.
So you know I'm the partnership director for the lower east side, employment network and I'm joined tonight by david garza, the executive chair for the network, but also executive director for henry street settlement, and we just have a very kind of pretty straightforward presentation just to kind of give you all an overview of what workforce development industry actually is and the state of it under the current previous to the pandemic, but also now under the current duress and crisis of the economy and then try and wrap up with some recommendations that we have gathered and gleaned from the workforce.
Recovery group that david garza is actually a part of led by new york city, employment and training coalition and then last also a little bit about what lesson is up to during these times.
I think that at this point, I'd like to hand it over to you- and this is where we're gonna kick off the orientation and introduction to what workforce development industry actually is.
I was fortunate enough to be around when the network was conceptualized and when it was founded and when it was launched- and here we are 12 more than 12 years later, having accomplished a thousand job placements in the district and we're going to do as good a job we can tonight of trying to be really concise and hopefully open it up to questions, because as community-based providers that make up the lower east side employment network- we're really you know every data point that eli shared there's a human being behind it and that every human being behind us either trying to feed their family or trying to raise a child or trying to take care of a senior or trying to keep a roof over their head.
We generally serve the residents of the neighborhood that tend to be either marginalized or not connected to the labor market, but the field as a whole is really responsible for that for connection to the labor market, for training and education, as it relates to employment opportunities for advocacy and then for retention and support services and the circles you see on the on the first slide really represent all the stakeholders and new york city is, you know in many ways one of the most dynamic cities in the world for workforce development opportunities and possibilities, and that density and that kind of vast spectrum of possibilities translates into a system, that's represented by a vast number of stakeholders.
You have us community-based organizations, you have the education system, you have philanthropy, you have government, you have the workforce investment board and then you have a number of intermediaries, partners and data, and research and analysts like center for urban futures and our friends there, and you know we frequently partner and connect with center for urban futures, whether it's jonathan balls or christian or eli, just to really kind of meld the data with the story and see how the kind of work hits the street.
If you will so like many things in new york city, I think some of our greatest advantages can also materialize as real great challenges.
So that's just to give you some scale in relation to the numbers that eli shared and I think it underscores something when we get down to either like the need statement or recommendations that there's considerable opportunity to invest more in workforce development.
So, as I began to mention that you know, new york city system has a number of assets and strengths and a number of challenges and liabilities on the strength side, henry street and the organizations that make up the lower east side employment network.
The eight of us are amongst 200 community-based organizations that provide job placement and career services to new yorkers who need that support either unemployed, underemployed or have been disconnected from the from the workforce we represent and serve about half a million people in new york in new york across the city system and out of the lower east side organizations.
I think some of the assets of the system are there: lots of creative programs like the lower east side, employment network, where our mechanism was a response to anticipated economic development and largely all of these phonetic stakeholders put community-based organizations in a position where they're more likely to compete for resources than to collaborate and I'm proud to say on the lower east side.
You know in their own lives or their in their own households that can materialize as obstacles to employment is another really important role that the community-based providers on lower east side play and then, of course, advocacy and analysis where we get to look with a little bit more proximity and granularity to what's happening in the neighborhood.
You know in the solutions, I think largely our workforce development system in new york provides a really vital service, because if someone is trying to accomplish those things that I mentioned before, whether it's a roof over your head or food on the table, a job is a necessary component.
First and now the economic trauma and triage period, which we feel is going to be at least you know, number of years long and then the recovery and rebuilding, and so we feel that we're just getting started and there's going to be lots of opportunities to provide really necessary support to the job seekers that we serve next slide.
We can creatively to extend resources to provide people with vital skills and training that they'll need and we'll come back and circle and talk about that a little bit more on our recommendations.
What the funder has challenged us to do with the funding at stake is to pivot and find a new sector to of the labor market, to connect our participants to that's, going to be very difficult in a short period of time, we're fortunate that we were able to leverage some of the ppp support to create a longer runway and right now we are diligently looking at other sectors like advanced manufacturing, industrial food, prep or commercial, food, prep and other sectors that we might be able to pivot to.
So, as gaspard mentioned, I'm on the board of the new york city, employment and training coalition, I've also been part of the state level workforce, recovery strategy group and I'm also on a nycha post, covid recovery group and a lot of the concerns and the recommendations that are being made are consistent, and so that is to invest in education and training now to try to identify public works and infrastructure projects where we can anticipate job creation and therefore know where to prepare people and attach them relief programs, because I think some of the challenge here is: we have to do the triage, but then we have to do the investment in long-term recovery, but there absolutely has to be some relief in the absence of job opportunities and then, of course, small businesses and support for other businesses that are that are amongst the stakeholders.
Thank you to the committee to invite us to present to you all and ultimately the point I think was to try and orient some of those of you dive in a little bit more about what workforce development actually means.
This is just a visual of who we are, and in the interest of time, do you want to pivot into q a because I think that the most important facets have been touched on already, and we will be coming back before the committee in the fall to present to you about what our fiscal year actually looked like.
You know not only stop the bleeding but hopefully build up some resiliency, it's our future bleeding and then the other component is training that the one thing we have right now is time, and we really reject this notion that, because there are not as many open jobs available, that there is not an appropriate investment to be made in workforce development, we know that technology is going to be needed.
We know construction jobs are going to become available if certain political results materialize, there's largely going to be public works projects or infrastructure projects, so to get people the credentials and skills they need now is really imperative, because for a neighborhood or a city to capitalize on any large-scale investments like that, you have to be ready to go and it would be really catastrophic if we waited and sat in our hands and didn't make the investments to be ready when that came about.
So we think really training is imperative and then support for small businesses, whether that's wage subsidies or other creative ways to get people to work and help businesses get back on their feet.
Certainly you know cuff has facilitated some of them about like what the growing sectors of the economy are and if we do live in, certainly in manhattan, one of the most unequal districts you know, we've always had you know underemployment or people who have been left out of the labor force, but now we have so many of them in a variety of different skill levels and how we sort of appropriately get folks back into potentially better wage and good jobs of many kinds.
I will give an anecdote on some workforce funding, because that is where I think some of the advocacy and the needs statement needs to go that we have seen like one of the one of the city council initiatives, for example, is cut 26 percent a lot of private.
And so the advocacy point is you know I call them on-ramps right, because a bridge with no on-ramp is a bridge to nowhere, and so I think the advocacy point is to build on-ramps to programs, because you know some of the information that eli pointed out, like 26 percent of people have less than high school diploma.
So it's really hard to kind of stack and find the accountability for you know where it stacks up to the department of small business services, has some training dollars as well and then there's areas and departments where things are very purposely funded like, for example, department of social services like we have a jobs plus program in the district which is embedded in public housing.
That's the best possible, I think, solution, because it's the on-the-ground organizations that really know what's going to make the difference- and I just I'm so struck by that previous point, that gaspar mentioned, because I hear about this all the time you know for lack of a metro card, because I need to take that immediate job that doesn't pay well, but because I need the cash in my pocket right now, and these are the barriers that or child care is a huge one.
I think we learned a lot and we'll probably have some follow-ups for the specific district aid statement, so I'll probably be in touch with you about that so feel free to pop off now, and we have a couple more things that the committee needs to take care of thanks.
There is no good answer or definition for small property owner, I think, probably because nobody wants to actually define it because it'll exclude or include people, but we did find a couple of proposals at the it's at the bottom.
Could we just say due to the increased cost of doing business, which is a general all-encompassing term, because there's a lot of factors that are affecting small businesses in many ways, so if we can just or we can go through- and I can dissect that and give you comments on that, but I don't want to use up that time if I don't have to- and I think that was I think- on the merchant organizing additional opportunities for city support.
Is you know the city looking to reduce the cost of doing business in the city, because that's what I'm hearing from a lot of the small businesses- and this was before the pandemic- where it was just there were too many too many things had to deal with, and everything was too expensive for them from labor, which I think we all appreciate the minimum wage and all that and all these other items, but those do roll down and affect the business.
I think we can sort of summarize that sentence into like the rising cost of doing business in new york city yeah, because I you know the payroll is definitely the number one expense for at least I know for hospitality.
I mean, isn't this just sort of addressing our needs, you know so maybe we could even say small landlords that provide affordable housing in their buildings.
Maybe aleister could help us with the term of art, but I don't know that small landlords defines it, but I, but I would agree, I don't think we can come up with a definition of how many units are under people's control or not under people's control.
Okay, they are not necessarily landlords yeah, they have property owners, but the stuff- and the other thing is where the city sticks, affordable, housing, commercial spaces, with commercial taxes that doesn't gives affordable rentals to small business people.
As I mean, I think there are going to be a lot of unexpected challenges that we don't fully know that come up.
So I'm not sure if we could present that as a proposal to new york city, because not everybody is going to college okay right, you can afford it.
You know in the building trades, so if we could propose something that the city would probably look at, I'm not sure they're going to do it right away, but it's a thought proposal that could be presented as part of the workforce development future process yeah.
I think that is somewhere along the lines of what lesson and the new york city, employment and training coalition is looking for, like a more centralized funding stream or like significant program through this recovery period, that will upskill and train people a variety of different skill levels.
So the last thing that we wanted to circle back to is the special enhanced commercial district, which you know right before the pandemic.
It was going to restrict the size of some stores in the east village, and that was basically I mean there were a couple of different points, but it was really about like size and frontage, and you know, for the most part, a pretty strict restriction on formula retail.
But andrew asked for us to discuss this as a committee again this month, and so it's still, you know on the table, obviously, but I think we need to sort of revisit how we want to move forward with it.
I wanted to clarify something that you said your reading of the fact that this would restrict small business growth is actually not correct it would it would actually it could help small businesses, it's more, what it will happen with the landlord side, but the small businesses will definitely benefit by that, because, among the reasons that pushed us from the planning perspective to come up with this solution was also you know a lot of speculatory vacancies in the district and stuff like that, and so I think this is.
I think if you were kind of going into this with the thought process of we've got too many bars and restaurants in the neighborhood and it's inhibiting other types of retail from moving in well, that's kind of you know: we've had at least I mean 25 places go out of business in the last month and a half, so vacancies aren't going to be an issue anymore.
We shouldn't abandon this in any way, but it should be revisited when back to a more of a normal trend, whatever that may be in the future, and things have kind of plateaued, because we don't know where things are going right now and I think, with a 20 unemployment, presenting something like this to officials, we might be looked upon as a little bit.
So if we feel like in within the next two months that it's the right time to start talking to people again about this- and you know maybe how we want that to work, because I don't know if the same narrative is the narrative that people might respond to again.
You know okay yeah, because she I think again.
