Manhattan community board, 3 health, seniors, human services, youth, education and human rights committee meeting today is august, the 6th thursday- and this is our monthly meeting our today main a major item on our agenda- will be the district needs statement.
So we have quite a few guest speakers with us today to talk about how the health needs of our community and also before that some finishing up on youth and particularly the child care issues in our community.
Regarding the zoom meeting, larissa yeah, sorry, I had to unmute myself, okay, I welcome everyone and thank you for attending.
Yes, david train, yes, eric diaz, yes, shirley, fantasy, oh she's, like tatiana durio, paul rangel, I know he's going to be absent: heidi schmidt, yes, okay, ricky, wong, yes and carmen perez.
Thank you, thomas got it so sorry I was wondering like why is may not speaking to me here we go okay, so thomas, are you able to take the minutes or here to take the minutes?
The first part will be about education and I guess the child care issues and that the speaker will be allen van cappell and he's the ceo and president of the educational alliance, then the second and then we'll have questions and answers, and then the second part will be all about the health needs in our community and today we have three speakers.
But I want to talk just briefly about our decision making going into it, because I think each one of them are sort of systemic issues that many of our community-based organizations are dealing with, and they may have to think through very similar decision points, as we thought about earlier this year.
We operate our community-based sites in nycha buildings and in new york city public schools in new york city, public schools are no longer going to allow new head start programs to start operating ps 188.
We struck a deal with ps, 188 and the principal swanny ramos in this past year to open up several classrooms at ps, 188 on houston and fdr drive, and the city said: we're no longer allowing people to open up new classrooms in public schools, and we said why, and they said, because you are now a direct competitor to the city's head start program and as we expand our head start footprint, we're going to use those spaces in public schools.
We did the right thing in new york, we increased the minimum wage to 15 an hour, but what that did was it knocked people above the head start threshold of 24 000 a year, so there are families that are still working poor, who should be in the head start program, but they make more than the 24 000 that would qualify for them to enter into that program.
The other issue in regard to that is that we're allowed to accept 10 of our students above the economic threshold, but we fill those seats up in a second and really what we need is advocacy on the federal level to increase the head start: income eligibility right to 30, 000 or 35 000 for families who still need it in new york and should qualify that'll get people in there.
So facilities was an issue trying to find qualified teachers and keep them, because the city is paying way more and is out bidding us for those teachers and fewer people qualifying financially for a head start rendered us to make the decision to get out of the community-based site.
20 of those kids are four-year-olds, who will now be going into kindergarten at new york, city, public schools, and there are 32 two-year-olds, all of whom have been offered a seat at the manny canner center this september, and with the exception of six families, all of them have accepted their seats at the manny canner center, with the exception of six families, we are working with head start, who are bringing in an interim organization called cdi that they work with nationally to come in and try to run our community-based programs.
Is over, they are not putting a priority on fixing those classrooms until kovit is over, and we have worked with lots of people within the nycha program, but we're not able to get those sites running so today.
I was really pleased when susan spoke to me about coming today about talking about the issues around prevailing wage and lifting the cap on head start programming, trying to fight for teacher parity, so that community-based organizations are given the money they need by government agencies to compete with the city and hire the qualified teachers and supervisors that we need to run these programs and to also demand that knight should do what they're supposed to do for all of their tenants, whether or not their residential tenants or community-based organizations trying to serve their residents, which is to provide us with the same level of maintenance or quality that we would expect of any landlord in this building.
We simply cannot continue anymore to protest private landlords and demand that they give us good service when we're not demanding the same from nycha, and I think it would be an important statement for this community board to make on those three issues and I'm happy to answer any questions that any of you may have, and I thank you again for giving me the time this evening.
The committee has taken positions on pay parity in the past, so you know I don't really have any specific questions, but I would like to be able to follow up with alan to get some documentation so that when we write our needs that we're able to document some of this be delighted to work with the with the committee in any way to document this yeah, I think the the nycha I mean all the other cbo's have the same complaints about the niger facilities, whether it's the senior centers or the youth programs.
So if we raise that to thirty five thousand dollars a year, that at least would make a lot of families eligible for our programs, and maybe we wouldn't be suffering under enrollment for years, which is what we've been suffering okay, so it looks like for now we'll follow up with the nycha facilities and oh one more thing: is there a a lot, a net, a loss of child?
For the last three years we have pumped one million private dollars each year into that particular program to try to fix those sites and whatnot- and I understand, look people think it's a big organization, I'm the one who has to raise that million dollars every year.
I know how hard it is to raise that million dollars we have tried, but even with that extra million dollars a year into those sites, we were not able to do what we needed to do in order to turn them around, and so, unless there is real systemic change, I think whoever takes over those seats are going to suffer the same issues as we're suffering.
I think some a new organization could not go in right now and say I want to start offering sites at ps 188, for example, because they would only be able to go in there if the city put out an rfp for those classrooms and given what's happening now with covid space is at a premium and it's hard to imagine that the doe is ever going to allow organizations to take over their classrooms.
It just sounds very concerning to me potentially, but I mean I mean susan potentially, that may be what ends up happening, but again it's hard for me to imagine where they'll be able to offer those sites, they can't go into lillian wald right now and they're gonna face the same facilities, issues that we have and they couldn't go into the public schools.
I went with cushman and wakefield and walked our district twice, trying to identify potential commercial space for us to be offering those programs and it didn't exist if that's going to be different now, because there's going to be so many more empty spaces, potentially okay, so we need to follow up any other, any other questions seeing none.
It used to be called hull, and now we call it batanzas health center at henry street settlement, and as mentioned, we have a site- that's opened two years in bushwick brooklyn, so the majority of our patients are 95 percent minority with over 60 percent of that being hispanic latino.
In particular, we have hiv services over 400 hiv patients, in addition to providing on-site oral health and on-site behavioral health, which is a nice combination to be able to be doing one-stop shopping and our podiatry program is done with acupuncture, so I'm so proud to say that we try to strive to have east meet the west whenever possible at our health center next slide.
So that's just a picture of one of our health affairs that we have in front of 280 henry street next slide so batons is it feels that the top four priorities are really behavioral health, chronic care management, addressing the health disparities through something which many of you may have heard: social determinants of health and really managing our new normal, which is telehealth.
So what we have found often is with the children and teens the health care providers and first responders, as we have and many of our patients present with existing mental health problems and, as alan had mentioned earlier, we have many patients who live in the nycha buildings and are part of the north environment and those socially isolated.
Patients are the ones who are at the most risk and, of course, people of color many of our racial and ethnic groups that the tanza serves are the ones that have a high risk and have mental health problems next slide.
We think care for nation and management really is the means to help us create better health and that's to provide ongoing support to patients so that they can keep engaged in their care and to empower them to be part of their own care.
So that means having care coordinators, patient navigators, social workers help them with scheduling their appointments, identifying all the services and screenings that they need, and that includes cancer screenings.
I know that hospitals often get the limelight and particularly during the covet 19, but I can assure you we have over 1400 federally qualified health centers, and we have made a tremendous amount of impact in terms of trying to address the covenanting and keeping our patients out of the hospitals and that's the kind of thing that we really need to have an awareness of next slide.
What we think have been the major advantages of having tele health access to care is no longer restricted at, and some of the social determinants of health that have been various are no longer barriers, such as transportation and communication and language.
So the challenges we see for telehealth really is access to internet and wi-fi our patients want to be seen in a virtual environment, but we were just as surprised to know that many of them do not have the capability in terms of the technology to do so, we still need to have face-to-face visits for the chronically ill and we don't want all our patients to become telehealth patients and the biggest challenge for health.
Only during this public health emergency, we don't know what's going to happen after that, extended emergency expires and again, as I mentioned care coordination, what I call the glue to keeping patients engaged is not a reimbursable service next slide.
Third, we need to address those health disparities through social health determinants and focus primarily on the people of color and improving the health outcomes for minorities and fourth, we need to really now manage the new normal and telehealth is here to stay for all of us in health care, and we need to continue to educate, raise awareness and find ways to sustain this next slide.
You can just talk okay, maybe then we can go back to it, yeah, okay, so we have served over 60 000 patients per year and 90 are asian americans, so we're significant provider to asian americans and for federally qualified health centers community health centers for new york state.
So a couple of a couple things I want to raise so thanks for scrolling down okay, so number one is just the keep scrolling help me kovid's effect on social supports.
Everyone's gonna need increased mental health services in the coming year to cope with all the stresses and disruption, as the kova 19 crisis continues, these stresses will only magnify and get larger and even as the economy recovers or fails to recover for the community and for the patients at highest risk.
You know from the city level, the state level, the federal level for all our service agencies, health, centers settlement houses, everyone's provide who's, providing services.
That's all what julia talks about social determinants of health next maintaining community institutions, so everyone's going to have to have needs.
You know we really need to continue to address health inequities and do what we can to support the institutions that exist, so they can remain.
It's also kind of a community health center, but under the umbrella of the new york city held in hospitals corporations.
As we've said in terms of like health disparities, I think it's important to collect the data, especially from a public health point of view, represent these minority communities that often aren't studied enough.
So I think it is important for people to know that the governor does have that testing available kind of.
So I think we're going to see the fallout in the coming months and years, just in terms of people, not you know, being able to keep up economically, whether it shows up as housing or through their health, so things that can help support that in the community would be necessary.
Okay, this question is for julie, julie, have you had any issues with reimbursement and reimbursement rates for the telehealth visits, knowing that most of your patients are probably medicaid and undocumented aliens?
I know our primary state association ducanes fought very hard with the new york state department of health to allow federally qualified health, centers and perinosis very well as well to actually get reimbursed at the enhanced rates.
Yes, okay, yes, yeah, okay and I know at batanjes, as I mentioned, we literally had to just jumpstart our telehealth program.
Okay, great susan yeah, I'd like to at first ask about substance abuse since we're seeing so much substance abuse on the street.
So I would imagine, there's been a lot of kind of drop off in terms of care, but I can you know I can ask more about with the people who run it.
Sorry so, like I said, I'm not directly involved with that program, and so I don't so you know I'm kind of speculating, because I know that we all were just forced to go to telephone health, but you're right I mean they.
Obviously, we could all prescribe suboxone remotely through you know, through our computers at home right so, but a lot of it was also you know, people would come in and also you know, get social work and you know support just in person when they came in also so so that's I think you know part of what may have been lost during this yeah.
So, like I said, I need to you know, find out more to see what happens with my colleagues who actually run the program, and I think our providers epitonzas would be the first to say there is nothing like a face-to-face visit, particularly when you're dealing with a substance use disorder issues, because that social support and, as you know, as les said, it's critical to get that what I had termed the care coordination and case management- that's what they need.
We want to be able to offer that, for everybody, give them the right advice and then the second part is when a vaccine comes out, making sure that you know the poor, the people that we serve, the working class you know are able to get the vaccine.
They have programs in place where, if there was like an emergent issue that they would actually set up, you know mass vaccination sites, usually at doe schools to basically just get people in and out and get them.
Is that the new commissioner still planning to see patients, because he is a clinician which is kind of unusual for a health commissioner to do because it's a pretty big job at the health department, but he's very committed to that, and you know this is just kind of a direction that they've kind of taken, so there are going to be a lot of big changes coming at the city level regarding public health.
Okay, so we're saying that, in terms of you know, I'm just thinking of our district needs statement.
You know some of the substance abuse or the tobacco use are the issues that we should be watching for and may I think alan who really started off the conversation.
No, I agree 100 and one other thing I would just add, especially with the being that there's a 20 21 needs is you know the whole flu season's coming with kovitzel around, and you know that also being very important and how we address that as a community together yeah.
If you wish to stay around for that, you can but you're free to go, and if we have, I mean you know we, the materials you gave us were very good and it was very well organized and if we have any additional questions we can ask, and if you have any additional materials or information you want to give us, you know, feel free to send man, susan, an email, okay!
We could just take those presentations and you know almost transfer the the needs to paper very easily, I'm offering the office to do that if you'd like, unless someone else wants to do it, oh only because I think it'll be so easy.
Okay, also david has his hand up yes, david yeah, so one of those presentations kind of scared me when I got the strong sense that the community health centers are going to go under.
I mean I don't know if there's a source of how much of the population relies on it and what is likely to happen if we rip health care out from under that segment of the population.
I just want to ask if so susan has offered the office's help to write up this health section, but if they need more help or because you know things are coming up, okay, can you consult?
You know those are people who might have been in programs during the day.
You know with any of their patients because I'm wondering if that is increasing, you know, as people are dealing with so many issues like rent and jobs and mental health issues.
But you know it's also mentioning it for what not just the district needs for next year, but for what we're actually dealing with right now, don't just talk about another topic, a little bit just to update everyone.
