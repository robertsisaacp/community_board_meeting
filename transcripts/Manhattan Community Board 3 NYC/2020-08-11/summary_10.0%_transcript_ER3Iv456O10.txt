Me last time I did this, I kind of turned it this way right, so we had that's more interesting, wow, okay, so we are now recording welcome everybody to the meeting of the cb3 landmarks committee.
I think you guys are amazing and both of the topics on our meeting tonight have come about by grassroots efforts by members of our community and the organizations they belong to village preservation, lesbian, east village, community coalition- so you guys are unbelievable.
Is there uh-huh and sandra sandra's here I know I think not david right, david was going to come in by phone, so david, if you're here make yourself known, so we have what we have so may I have a motion and a second to approve.
It's the initiative regarding the national register listing of the two buildings in the east river park, and we have richard and deborah presenting, and you guys I'm gonna make you post.
We reported to this committee on our new york state, historic preservation, office, application for the historic east river park, track house and tennis center comfort station, and now I want to provide you an update and review the results in 2019 lesbi was invited to be a consulting party for the east side, coastal resiliency project dealing with the east river park, reconstruction for flood protection, which I know most of you, are familiar with.
After initially focusing on the east river park's fireboat house, which was already listed as eligible for the state national registers of historic places, we turned our attention to the track house and tennis center comfort station, which you see on this slide here: two distinctive structures from 1938 that are threatened with the complete demolition, with complete demolition in the current east coast, resiliency plans.
After reviewing the building's fine architecture and researching their history, we decided to bring them to the attention of the new york state historic preservation office, also known as shippo as potentially eligible for listing in the state and national registers of historic places.
In conclusion, I want to note that these are the only two remaining buildings of five such structures that once populated east river park, it seems imperative to lesbi that we not lose these as distinctive links to the past and as two of very few examples of art, deco buildings on the lower east side, we're open to any ideas that might serve to mitigate the effects of the planned new construction, which could include raising the buildings and adaptively reusing them.
They weren't didn't, provide us a lot of detail on what they're doing right now, but they did say that they were reaching out to you, know the city administration and going to work with them on possible routes to remediation.
So if the city doesn't want the buildings to be listed, you know they won't be listed and the shippo's role is really advisory here as well.
At this point, so it's a little bit sketchy, but it seems as if there's not a lot of teeth in this designation, except for hopefully to you, know guilt some of the parties into doing the right thing and having some kind of a meaningful mitigation for these buildings yeah.
Look at the building so that we're pleased that they've agreed that they are valuable buildings and that they're recommending that the city consider mitigation along the lines of the section 106 process, but we just don't know the outcome so we're hoping to go to parks and asked for a resolution from parks which has been really working on this project to consider the adaptive, reuse, preservation and adaptive reuse of these buildings to recommend that from the city.
Obviously we know that there's support here for the work and we're just interested in hearing from the committee what you know what you recommend at this point of other courses of action for us and we do want to get the support of you know the local elected officials- and you know some of the other organizations going forward to push the city to do the right thing here.
We didn't give a put in for formal requests for evaluation, but we kind of feel that the buildings are a little bit borderline in terms of individual, landmark quality, and that's why we wanted to go and being that this is such a political, hot potato.
This project that you know we wanted to go with the national and state register listing, as the best way to you know, bring the buildings in some measure of recognition and protection.
Well, you know, I think the buildings are great and it's absolutely amazing that there is an intact, the interior as well as amazing carrier yeah.
If you're interested in pursuing this with you know with the actual escr, which is what is all being done in parks, so it's parks that will need to write a resolution if they choose to do so.
I know you don't normally meet this month and this is a joint request by our colleagues and team members with east village, community coalition and lower east side preservation initiative and for our brief presentation, that's coming up.
So, as I said, this is was a joint request to be on this agenda tonight again, thank you to everyone in the public for being here, we're gonna go over together a bit a very brief history, which a lot of people here know far better than me will go over the conditions past and present of this hazardous and emergency condition building and then the action steps.
Next slide, please harry again, and what the history of most people know is: charis el bujio, the community center in the 70s when the building was taken over and while there's not enough time tonight to go over the immense amount of programs and educational experiences that were offered.
next slide, please sarah yeah and it was, as probably you all know, better than harry, and I it was landmarked in 2006, with huge community support and next slide.
The singer, who owned the building at the time, started to strip off some of the architectural detail even before it was landmarked in the hopes that it would compromise the integrity in their or not get landmarked, and if we're able oh there, we go okay, hi.
I don't see her anymore here: okay, harry, oh no you're, not you're, not richard moses is a host right now, if you have your, if you have the powerpoint and you want to share it well, we I think we ought to wait just for her to get back on, because I'm hosting the meeting how's everybody doing [Laughter].
East 10th street, the fire department, con ed and the office and of emergency management had to come on the scene to see what was going on the building because of cracks- and I know we're waiting for linda, but I we want to respect everyone's time and carry on I'm sure.
I think it goes to show the importance of taking care of our landmark structures, as well as the possible dangers and hazards that can accompany an older building being left to decay, and so that's a lever of power that the city has at its disposal, which we're not aware it's been utilized.
The loans have been taken out, which I don't know if this presentation is going to have, I might have to speak about it over 50 million dollars in loans on the property under getting financing for the property, calling it an apartment building which the accuracy document on the right shows, and yet the building is tax assessed as a as a school which doesn't comport and just shows what potential lack of transparency that the owner has been representing next case next slide.
In addition- and I'm sorry I had I edited the slide right before laura goes now in the current condition, which is terrible since 2015 on public documents, the owner has paid over 500 thousand dollars in lobbying fees.
Right now, the solution is to secure the building, to discourage these excursions and any further damage to the landmark and sarah has explained what happened when photographic evidence of the break-ins was forwarded to the dob, an inspector found a locked gate, and that was enough.
I think okay yeah and, as laura mentioned, that the threat of fire is very real and you can see what happened to another lower east side landmark the norfolk street synagogue three years ago caught on fire, because some teenagers were planning were playing around in the building and the building has current has subsequently been demolished and delay marked.
And finally, you know, I think we have very basic requests for the city at this point that we're looking for the city to secure the property so that teenagers and whoever else cannot enter and can't do any more damage to the outside.
It can't be given back to the community, as promised by the mayor before his re-election and so again this is one of the most historic buildings in the community and also has a very close place in people's hearts for many reasons and has not been treated the way it should be by the city, including really the buildings department and the landmarks preservation commission, because in our view the proof is in the pudding.
In conclusion, the only thing that I would want to add is that there was one suggestion from a resident that the community board write a letter to the lender, describing the sorry condition of the building the vandalism and trespassing that are allowed to happen.
It's another action item to potentially consider that I think just didn't make it into the this earlier draft of the presentation, and I don't want it to get lost in the shuffle thanks.
To think that somebody is actually taking a pickaxe and tearing the building down from the roof up.
You know we filed complaints, I've written the community board, we organized the town hall where we had 99 people come to the town hall to express concern about the building and how they would like it returned to our neighborhood and it seems to be frozen in a moment of time and that no one takes any action and it's just it's like a horror story.
It's waiting for something to happen, and I think that we need to try to draft either a resolution asking lpc to move forward with demolition by neglect.
Dob needs to issue a warrant that the police department can enter the building.
You know I can look for that carolyn, but I don't have it handy: okay, there's a an aerial photograph that shows the location of charis and all of the buildings that surround it and the number of people's lives who would be affected if that building it caught fire.
So I talked with 3-1-1, I filed the complaint 9-1-1 and they did send nypd and they called me- and they just didn't- do anything this thing still tilts every afternoon and sends lights to me when there is wind- and this is like real danger- and I don't know I'm happy to hear that you are drafting a desert today.
Until when we write the resolution olympia, one thing you may not know is on the on the landmarks preservation commission's website: there's a violation form and any time you see a violation on a new york city landmark, and we see lots of them on this building, go on there and fill out one of those forms.
Yes, I think that the letter to the lender is a great idea that way, if you know he's already gotten 50 million dollars the owner on based on it being a residential property which it isn't right.
Okay, I'm just surprised that no one has done anything to support this, that this has been going on so long well, some of the people who've been watching this for a very long time can maybe speak to that I mean I think some people have tried, but you know I don't live in that neighborhood, so I'm not as up to date on the day-to-day happenings right me either.
Yes, since you mentioned, and thank sandra for those important points about the letter to the lender, making them aware of it in case they're not aware, and as far as the elected officials go, you know, many people have been involved doing different things to the best of their ability.
Yes, yeah, I think, what's really important about this image- is that it shows the densely populated neighborhood that surrounds this building and their residences, that you know it would be such a tragedy to lose a beautiful building, but it would be a far greater tragedy to have people made homeless or killed because of actions that are not being taken by the city.
Yes, I'd like to know what is the expected planned follow-up for the proposals to the city, I guess harry your office will be doing that.
What's happened with the building it goes on and on and on we're asking all the history which you all probably know.
If passed to the lead lender of the owner to make them aware of these issues, I'm going to take it, you know, take your password, I'm sorry, you have to say a fifth, no I'm taking that out.
With a long history of serving the people of the lower east society's village, including, but not limited, to restoring the not-for-profit organization known as charis el boheato to the building located at 605 east 9th street, now carolyn, perhaps this point about the police could go into the this bulleted list yeah.
We need to demand for charis right now, because it's crumbling and somehow they think it's okay.
No, it's a real hazard and I don't know exactly made that point in our in our whereases and I think we've talked about the damage to the building, but I don't think we've talked about the hazards right.
Let me say that we should say it in the resolution, and it may be that there's enough of that up in the beginning that we didn't read and this, whereas got a long list of whereases, that's why I don't want to really read them because they'll be here all night good as long as we stress that there is new evidence for which they demand immediate action.
You know new hazardous things, whatever okay, I think that's covered, so I do intend to specify that this should go to dob and ltc.
Don't worry, linda, oh sorry, not to interrupt in the middle of the resolution, but there there's also just a question about whether keeping the scaffolding up is something for when whether any of these issues might be something that could also be raised at transportation and public safety right.
Could I make one suggestion one of the things that helps to obscure the kids going into the building when they climb on the scaffolding is the signage that's attached to the street light that it's right by the gate, and it's made it very difficult to document with photographs when you see them climbing over, because the signs help to obscure them.
I think linda is right that so that has to be evaluated as a safety issue, and we really can't do that transportation committee yeah.
Okay, I mean the question is: do you wanna have a stronger call as a bullet point to the ribleage administration, to reacquire the building or to this thing that somebody said in the pre presentation about demolition by neglect?
I would like to know if you can say to send a copy of the resolution to the lender.
I think you're good enough to say that they're not going to immediately do anything so they'll claim they don't have a budget right, but we'll just put a little fire.
