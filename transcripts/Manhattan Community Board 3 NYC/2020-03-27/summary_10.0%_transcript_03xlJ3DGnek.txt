Just gonna have to grow my hair long because okay, I'm going to go to the barber again yeah mark wisely did his last moment - that was mark, like I'm being grounded for life.
It's like if there's one country that we are gonna need the help of you know they can make these fucking masks.
Can you guys hear me do okay here we go stepping into I, don't know I and raising works in these meetings.
Hey the feedback is terrible: okay, where's Susan, is she c3m yeah, yes, okay and sounds mi sees you know who it sounds.
Can everyone hear me thumbs up hands raised or if you give me okay, great, thank you.
Okay, yeah, so clintus want to explain how we're going to do this tonight.
I think for these larger meetings, that's probably gonna work best, at least to start with that we mute everyone.
If you open the manage participants, just a screen pop up on the right hand, side, yes, and at the very bottom of that, do you see the raise your hand option now, No, let's search yeah, so it does.
That is something that ever if everyone wants to keep that open in the right hand, side we can kind of see messages that they, you know as we go through the meeting as well, and then we can unmute you.
Yeah I, don't see that on my screen, okay, see mute, stop video invite chair, screen, reactions, Oh, maybe more participants.
So the first thing up on the first item on the agenda tonight is a resolution for immediate support for New York City, small businesses impacted by the corona virus and so you've gotten an email from the office.
This only went out to the executive officers of the community board, so I will read it and you can read along as well okay, so, whereas New York City is facing health emergency, unlike anything seen in over a century, whereas measures to slow and stop the spread of CoV I D - 19, while essential and justified have caused significant economic hardships, whereas required aid and support programs for countless small merchants and their employees will be substantial, whereas all levels of government must work collaboratively to provide needed.
Community board 3 recommends the following actions: to provide immediate relief for all restaurants, hotels and small levels, commercial establishments, suspension of all fines and associated payments for a period of six months, automatic non free renewal of all city and state operating permits and business field filings for a period of six month.
Oh okay, okay Michelle actually raised her hand as well all right, thanks, yeah I said I actually had a question, not an amendment yet, but is there a specific reason why it's only street-level businesses I know it includes hotels and other businesses, but there I feel like there are a lot of other like nail salons or like hair stylists that aren't necessarily street level.
What's your response, I can't hear you hold on Meghan she's, actually, myself, okay, yeah, so one of the one other quick thing.
Instead of all street-level commercial establishments, just put all commercial establishments affected by the k√∂ppen 19 crisis, if that's acceptable to everybody, okay, who's, Paris, David, I think you might have to unmute yourself, okay, fucking sure, which way it was this is it's pretty gets pretty wide open this way.
What's the word public accommodations or something like that at least I think you might want to help us out with this term?
Maybe one of the other people with their hand up has a has an idea right now, so everyone, let's give this a shot and see if it's chaos just that way, we can actually have a discussion with not having to keep up with ruse on you to do so.
We got it from Tim Laughlin, but we do have the liberty to amend it because they're, not the same categories of things, right, I, agree about the all commercial establishments affected by the Cova 19 virus agreed with Michelle, because I we do have below-ground businesses and second-story businesses that are small businesses.
So that's like a vast categories of businesses, and maybe we should be saying, convert all commercial establishments affected by the co19 virus, which include eating and drinking establishments, hotels and other service businesses, so that we're more inclusive yeah I mean our like cuz I.
There's, no people don't try to define like how small is small right, I mean I, don't know if you want to exclude New York City relief for larger businesses.
Let's go back to the language, that's on the resolution so right now the language reads that therefore the first therefore be it resolved community or three recommends the following actions: to provide relief for all restaurants, hotels and old commercial establishment affected by the cove in nineteen biros.
Okay, though I mean you hear, is not bars or clubs or music venues or you know, which I guess not eating, but they're drinking.
Okay, all the damage, you know, Jackie raise your hand.
Thank you, I, don't know if we resolve this, but if we haven't I mean we don't have to enumerate every business, we say small business mention the ones you've mentioned and say smooth some hands.
He says the name of the program is forgiving fines, the New, York City amnesty program online, so I think you can ignore anything like that.
The first therefore recommends the following actions: to provide immediate relief for all, and you were saying commercial businesses well yeah, so get it rid of restaurants, hotels, yada, just say for all small commercial businesses affected by the covert 19 crisis, because I mean it could be a right.
Okay I'm, not sure if there are small businesses that aren't commercial and that might be a little redundant but yeah Jackie is with two exclamation points, even though you muted people, if there's passive noise, your microphone state, it looks like whoever has iPhone has a lot of background noise and your mic stays open.
So if you're muted, you muted yourself at the moment, I can remove everyone if we want, but no I'm saying that, like one stays completely so if people stop talking you'll see it go to that particular person, David I, can't unmute!
Harvey wants to open this new office and have a black party I, don't know if they will still have it under the conditions, but this will give them the option but to have a whole meeting.
Like probably, we see if I have a little longer discussion about how we're going to handle a lot of things if the situation is transferred drastically that we don't want to have committee meeting well, I think we plan to do that later in this meeting.
Okay, so I'll go ahead and do it, but I I'm, just kind of, as you know, point of order object to a future of discussing and modifying and then at the very moment of supposedly taking a vote.
If you're watching this to, please make sure you check out community board website as they're, going to be updates on meetings and times to login to our meetings as we go, live or and we'd use the zoom tool as much as possible and if there's any other product that you have that will allow you to log into our account to see our meeting online.
In fact, I've never really done a live, meaning online before so, and I know that this is all new to the office as well, so I'm, so very grateful to Susan and the staff here, as they've been really like, jumping in and getting support from the city of New York.
During this time it is very difficult, as she's had to run out and go to Best Buy and go pick up products and things like that and a lot of stuff is just being done just like boom at the split second, so I thank her and that all being said you know we're gonna have full board this way, and so we look forward to seeing with that all is well.
It look like we have Susan, we'll discuss the other meetings that are going to take place during her report.
I'll, let her share with you how that's gonna work, okay, so next we have that's it for my report.
Unfortunately, you're right, it is a glitch yeah with last week how meetings are going to move forward and streamlining them so that we're not having unnecessary meetings and making people either suffer through unmuting themselves or first before the world ended.
Currently we don't want people to sign up for something exists so before the other thing that susan may or may not be talking about, is that we don't know yet from the borough president.
As far as the description was concerned, so you know, after consulting with Susan, she thought it would be a good idea to bring all the descriptions to the executive committee for a discussion before we just started using the new church.
If you could always just send your edits to one person and then that could be distributed blindly for everyone to look over or we could combine different edits into one page like we did with the bylaws I think that's probably similar, but anyway we're not going to be using the committee request forms for the following month.
So if we, you know, still want to look at them for edits, there's plenty of time and as far as taking committees off the website, we can't get rid of committees without a vote.
I've just made a decision that we will meet with the night chest section: a subcommittee as needed, and right now we don't really have anything on an agenda for them, and so that being said, I don't want to take them off the website.
I, don't know if we're going to say that we're gonna take more time.
I just might suggest that SLA committee chair official email, so Alex should get it in the mail in the email and if she wants to consider it, she can, if she doesn't, you can just let me know either way what your decision is to make any updates or I'll try to look tomorrow.
So people can see these things without actually going to a meeting they're, not things that they're looking for input in clearly anything may be employed or resolution.
As far as the new members, all interviews have been cancelled, I think they, the borough president, is going forward on appointing new members, but I'd like to remind everyone that we haven't had new members and they prefer I, don't know how many years- and you know, they're- certainly dealing with a lot of other stuff right now.
Think that's all I'm prepared for right now feels like I should have had much more, but it's just because I've been busy where he actually had to go out, make disinfectant and disinfect the office, which I do every time someone comes in so this kind of where we're at right now was just you know.
As far as knowing what we're doing, we go back to my home for the attendants as the next item on the agenda, so Susan I know that we're all sort of learning this new system and not sure if you mean Alicia and maybe Clint- should have a conversation about the full board meeting on Tuesday.
Yeah I think you're gonna do how many questions they're answering and with 50 people.
You know we'll have public people, you can't do a blanket on whatever a mute we might want to do a small experiment.
Yesterday they mentioned it that the other guy from gales office sent over the sign-in information for them to use his account because he's had that feature that maybe something we will need to discuss and we can go with a higher version, but right now, I, don't know if this basic version we have is allows that no I'm sure it just not.
That would be good because I think particularly for the full board meetings not being able to control that it's going to be kind of a mess.
My spacebar you're talking, okay, you hear me now and let me unmute.
The reason I put the review on there is because it's coming up the review is through March, so after the full board meeting next week, we should be sending you the attendance for the last six months, okay and then get a report on them.
So we will not be able to give comments to parks on that I believe it goes to the design Commission tomorrow, but sometimes things like that happen, I anticipate that we're gonna be meeting not only next month, but every single mode, because there's just so many things going on and we've already got one resolution for next month.
Maybe you serve us where you go ahead and mute everybody and then your ear and then yeah as if it was like we're gonna, be the whole minute.
I know it was just a glitch fine for a small meeting.
No right now, it's still set to allow participants to I'm you so go back to the thing where nobody will be allowed to a mute and then unmute just me and Al. Okay I got the little pop-up.
