Okay, thank you linda, so we don't have to like that anymore.
Okay, as linda mentioned before, and the chat box is really only for checking in and also ask technical questions.
So, okay quentin, you are already unmute thanks, jackie, so good evening.
I want to start by thanking you, jackie and the community board and land use committee, as well as the local elected officials, that for their support over the past six months, and I also want to acknowledge the five tenants of 70 mulberry for the continuing commitment and working with dcas over these past couple of months as well.
The second was to actually help the vendor actually identify stakeholders in the community, such as the preservation group, such as businesses such as residents to be able to engage in this process, and the third was is to actually receive the final report from the vendor.
Okay, thank you just to understand, because a vendor could be anything yeah.
Other committee members, do you have questions lisa linda, you are milled yeah.
Okay so looks like she is not going to ask the question she's trying to unmute.
Thank you lisa, and do we have other committee members want to ask questions?
Thank you clinton and I, before I opened up to the public session, I should have mentioned that each speaker has two minutes to ask questions or make a comment.
I would like to support what the community members have been saying: the community board members in terms of getting some kind of preservation assessment of this site.
I do feel like that to have a public discussion of what the community wants to do with the site.
You really need the context of knowing what's possible in terms of preservation, and I think that it it's just really going to inform that discussion.
Without that you know the potential costs and benefits of preservation versus other options are going to be hard to determine so also just as a as a as a member of the community.
I would really feel like I would put my kind of personal support behind preservation, but I also think that to do it, you need to do it in an informed way and understand its implications and really make that part of that community outreach process that I'm that I'm very glad to see you doing.
I think it's outside of the community envisioning process and the information that would be gained from a preservation assessment is really critical to the discussion.
So while I can't go into the details of exactly what is going to transpire once we get to the third floor, that is part of the plan to stabilize that, so there are no kind of safety issues or site security issues with the building, and I just had a other question which is in terms of the facilitator: how will the rfp be distributed and what is the field of consultants that would be considered sure, so the are the scope of work or the or I'm calling it the scope of work.
So that went out on the 10th, as I mentioned in my remarks and those proposals are due back this friday, the 24th could that be shared or let us know where that is that are sure it actually goes out through passport.
So if you are registered in passport and you met the criteria, it already went out to you, but if you would like to see, I don't know, I'm not sure if, if you know of an actual business or nwb that meets those criteria and has not gotten that, if that is the case, please reach out to me and I want to make sure that they get that statement of work and we can.
Church is a landmark and developer plans to build 100, affordable units, and this is going to be their first time to provide the details of their plan to cp3 and the presenter is miss jessica, loser, jessica, hi, jackie, thank you, hi.
I think I've met you before too hi jessica, hi, lisa, hi, everybody I spent it feels like a lifetime ago, but jackie.
I I spent about 10 years or 12 years on the lower east side, representing representing chelsea and also working for the community board and also had the the honor of being on the on the cb3 commit subcommittee, which it was an honor for me, but I'm here tonight representing st augustine and thank you for letting us present now we're not here asking for a resolution or for any approvals, but just as we as the church is developing their plans, they wanted to keep the community board informed and part of the process of the the application's already been shown to the council members office, and we just want to keep everybody informed.
If you could tell us a little bit about the state of the church, the state of the congregation, and then you know how covet has made things you know better or worse, your call father nat.
Thank you, father nat, and just to the really I think the big takeaway is that, while the church does need an infl, an influx to their resources and into their finances, they want to do that through the development of affordable housing and and so that it's not just financial resources for the congregation, but that it's an asset for the community, and that was an important part when the vestry was.
The other point that I wanted to highlight is that we're here, obviously, because the development plans are not going to be fully as of right, but the we're not asking for a rezoning rather we're asking for an envelope waiver.
It's a very tightly constrained site and so a height waiver will allow the future affordable housing building to use all of the as of right floor area on the site.
Our goal here was to take all the available floor area for the site and create a massing, a building that would allow us to fully utilize the number of affordable housing units that are available, while also taking advantage of errors, which is an acronym for senior housing.
So the result, the program is 130 units with about 5, 000 square feet of ground floor, retail and 4 000 square feet of new community facility space that would be used by saint augustine church, and you can see the two massing studies on the left and to the right are just the typical floor plates for how the building would lay out on the various stories- and I think this is actually a good transition point for jack esterson with think architects to talk a bit about the thought process that went into the massing that's being proposed and specifically, as it relates to the historic church right.
Yes, yeah right thanks everybody for having us one?
We are, you know, not really considering it's obviously not developed architecturally, but it's kind of a baby step to look at the height and the mass thing, and perhaps the interplay of masses interconnecting the use of at least two different materials to sort of break down the mass of the building and make it more empathetic with the church.
I believe it's a seventh floor which then hops up as a dorm, what's referred to as a dormer, and the image on the bottom left is indicating a seven-story setback that kind of wraps around the building and it's about at the same height as the church steeple and we're using two tones to indicate that the lower portion I mean we're not likely to use the 19th century schist stone that was used to build the church.
It allows the church to finally stand on its own independently and there would obviously be a restoration required at that corner with the cornice, and we don't really know what the stone is like underneath and then the undertaking really part of a preservation program for the for the church building.
It's which is required for lighten air, but we also add jack that by pushing that annex a little bit back that will allow the endicott accessible now to have direct communication to the church, because, right now we have to go to the basement and at least go up via an electric chair.
So this gives context we are making every effort to, while using all the far to also be empathetic architecturally with the church in mass and in detail as we move forward and that that'll take it'll manifest itself in many ways, both large and small in every decision will be looked through the lens of how does it relate and work with the historic church building, and I think that jack do you have anything else I do just before we open it up not to the design portion, but before we open it up to questions again at the beginning of the presentation jessica mentioned, this will be a 100, affordable project.
I wasn't listening that to that very well, but it's okay, just a quick question before opening up what is the envelope waiver that you are seeking, so it's a special it's basically, a department of city planning special permit, that's specific to historic, landmark buildings to allow a waiver in certain bulk rules, but no increase of floor area to accommodate the unused floor area specific to that historic structure.
Yes, so I mean that would have been helpful in the beginning of your presentation to say that, even though today you're not asking regio that's, why we're reviewing this project and then it would also be helpful like to receive the details that pertain to the euler.
I'm sorry, jeffrey just a quick question and it may have been addressed earlier on the ownership structure of this building who's going to own it, and I don't imagine you have the management structure worked out, but the ownership structure?
Thanks for the presentation, I just have a few quick questions, so you said you're gonna be using the mix and match program.
Wait well past that, because the subsidy mortgages that go into these projects typically just get rolled over for another 30 years, when the term comes due so okay, and are you going to work and try to have a nycha preference, because this site is so close to the vladic houses?
I think most folks answered most of what I was gonna ask, but I just have a couple of clarifying points since you haven't determined all the amis, the ami I get my question was: is the deep do you anticipate that the deepest level of affordability for the senior units will be at 30 percent of ami?
Okay, I mean I'm asking because you know 30 is still high for many seniors.
Some of my questions were asked, but I guess I'd like to understand a little bit more how the church is benefiting from this proposal.
Yes, I forgot that if you really think about the consideration, it's an upfront payment, long-term payments to the lease and about in the four thousand square feet of permanent space that is defused to the to the church upon completion all right.
Are you intending to become so in this proposal in order to fully utilize the available floor area for the affordable housing, it ends up being 21 stories, and what I want to understand is because you said the rule is that you cannot, you cannot add far, but you may need to just go higher up.
Because if we were to propose an as of right building, it wouldn't be tall enough to accommodate all the floor area of the entire site, because essentially we have to shift all of the residential floor area to one side of the site along madison street, so that the as of right, zoning envelope wouldn't be able to make use of that so we'd be we'd, be leaving affordable, housing, undeveloped, okay, so basically the current situation would give you less square footage.
I know you're freeing one of the windows, but I would like to understand this better sure yep.
So I I you know, I reached out to valerie's house before the meeting and also linda reach out to henry street settlement, so that the neighboring organizations are aware of the this development plan and I'm going to open up to the public to take four five questions.
There was some mention of a preservation plan for the church other than restoring that gothic window and the wall in that area, where you're removing the one-story building.
Yet that's actually going to be one of the next steps we're going to do, but with kovid you know everything we've been working on in the last three months has been delayed, so once we have that needs assessment report, it'll include items like repairing gutters, doing any masonry repair that might be needed, but overall we don't anticipate any large scope of work, be beyond restoring the window as we're proposing, simply because the church is in fairly good shape.
You know even 10 years after the building is built that the church's preservation is right, been accounted for so yeah, so it actually would affect our ability to get a cfo or a permit for the new building.
Has there been discussion about any level of community engagement around you know the retail space and also are there any additional amenities that you all might be considering for the building and then last but not least, I know that you said there's a space that you're considering four thousand square feet for st augustine.
You know, after we have a more developed plan, we'll have much better looking renderings and details to share, but just conceptually there's two outdoor recreation areas that are proposed.
We do as well david, although I'm wearing like a t-shirt and my hair isn't, but I think we actually did meet about a year and a half ago, it's your office when we first got engaged on this project.
Okay, olympia, you have one more question: yes, just because of what the marriage asked and it reminded me of some other eulers.
So one more comment for your next presentation: I understand that you said that you're gonna have some public space amenities, but it sounded like they're gonna be restricted to either the tenants of the building or the congregates.
So it would be important to understand if you have amenities for the overall surrounding neighbors, who will be impacted with the additional 10 floors right, so you're correcting to clarifying that the amenities spaces are specific for the residents and the congregation we currently are not proposing any amenity spaces that would be open to the general public yeah.
I looked at it many times I haven't been inside yet, but soon, and I admire also your efforts to you know highlight it and make it will certainly be better than what's there now it looks to me like a what do we call this thing again.
I just want to echo what people have been saying and say that the ami of all of community board 3 is 58 and in this area it's likely much lower and mix and match allows up to 120 ami, maybe higher.
So and as you probably said, I mean it's a little bit of a discussion of ami versus subsidy amounts, so it's kind of a negotiation that happens, but so far hpd has been very proactive in pushing us to to propose lower amis and still make the budget work.
You would have to do that anyway, but it would be helpful for us to get an understanding before that in and also next time when you come back to cb3, please send us your plan prior to the presentation, so I could share with them the committee members for them to read before the meeting.
I just wanted to be sure, because I didn't know that we were talking 74, 7-11 yeah, so I, in addition to bugging you here, I chair the landmarks committee and we hope to see you at some point in the future.
I did not receive any emails from the committee members since the june meeting, so I just assume we will not be adding new items to the dns and we want to finalize it this month and also the dns will be loaded together with the budget priority in october, and I mean on one hand we don't want to keep editing it and on the other hand, we want to leave ourselves some time in case anything unpredictable happen in the next two months, so we can still add it to a dns yep.
I cannot see it so jackie while we're trying to put this up one thing that I think is missing and I don't know if it's in another document from jim is.
I think it's mentioned when we're talking about funding the community groups that do the community based organizations that kind of provide services that protect tenants against that type of behavior in the in the first stated need build to preserve, affordable housing- and- I guess also it's sort of alluded to in the cobid paragraph as well.
It's a little bit of a gray area, because you want to frame this document in terms of needs so like.
So I don't know I have to work on that sometime between now and october likely next couple of weeks, but I'm just I'm gonna note that at least as kind of one of the ideas for the for the for the big theme of the intro paragraph is addressing the budget cuts specifically yeah.
Sorry, I was doing it myself: okay, jackie, yes, linda!
