So, okay and I'll refer to the numbers so that you know thank you, oh herman just signed in.
It's often a lot of the same, but we've also asked every committee to try to tailor at least a paragraph or two just something related to conditions that have arisen because of covid19 and, like alex said, you know she put together a great like draft paragraph of what that could look like.
We don't know what the licensed business landscape will look like.
This is the impact that will happen, but you just you know you can just have a line that says this is what we're going to be watching and then it almost serves as a reminder for next year's district needs statement on those metrics or markers or whatever issues you had to say.
Okay, do we need to ask for a more specific intervention now that we've had a year to digest the changes to the landscape of you know, liquor, license and well all sorts of licensed businesses, that's kind of a safe way.
I think to phrase it because there's so much unknown but again, like I said, I think what you came up with once you make that change to the to the num gross number of licenses versus concentrations is quite strong, so that might be maybe well.
Maybe the committee should just look at and you know I mean what we can we can discuss if there needs to be changes, but I think on the office end, we felt pretty good with that.
We have suggested over time because it's kind of a static committee in terms of what the yeah the needs are for the city they're right here, they're the two bullet points, strict adherence and use of existing tools, and I wonder about the existence.
So, in this case, if it feels like those two, those two bullet points were pretty narrowly calling for enforcement of particular legislation, and if it's feeling irrelevant at this point, you may want to remove it and re that based around like that, the need is some sort of interagency or legislation, legislative action that effectively addresses violation of stipulations or saturation of licenses in certain areas.
You know what I mean like you can fill it down to what the underlying need is and get rid of the superfluous discussion about particular legislation and what you could also do.
You know that we've recommended to other committees if it feels like something's, not working, you may want to just like identify the need and then at a later date.
Maybe you want to think about like a separate resolution that calls for something specific to change for an existing law.
Does everybody agree that we maybe should make those needs more general than they are right now, although essentially saying the same thing, many members, does anybody want to be heard with respect to that?
Intro initial paragraph makes the most sense, but that's been what other committees have been doing all right, so I'll do that and I'll reframe the needs and also the recommendations and I'll send it back out to everybody, okay before august meeting, which is when we have to vote on it.
Okay, what one more thing this procedurally unusual from the past is, I think, we'll try to finalize it in august, but technically that'll be when the committee stops working on it, but we're gonna actually vote on the district lead statement as a full board at on the same time as the budget is in october, which is unusual, so just you could have in the back of your head.
We're going to move on to the applications now, starting with number three, which is yes, which is 95 avenue a aka, 445 east 6th street.
Ravi okay sounds good, so this is a alteration: application, changing the method of operation of a two-story venue separated into two separate businesses and combining them into one business, presumably to mirror the existing small business at 445 east 5th street.
We heard this application originally in 2010 and approved it as cn flagos and last heard it november of 2018 when we approved an alteration to change the second floor from a cuban restaurant to a vegan, texas, barbecue, restaurant and whiskey bar with the following stipulations, operate a full-service, vegan, polynesian restaurant on the ground floor, which is what existed there at the time at a vegas, vegan, texas, barbecue restaurant on the second floor, serving pooch within one hour, closing on both floors operating the storefront at 4, 45 86th street at the bidders bar have hours of 5 pm to 2 am all days have a sidewalk cafe, and this is a little bit incorrect because it says with hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m. All day.
When we heard this alteration close, the facade at 10 pm play recorded background music not apply for an alteration without first coming before us, not host pub crawls or party buses not have unlimited drink specials not have happy hours, not have weight lines outside and also have someone responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside the this application says.
I mean basically we're just we're just preparing for what I expect to be a really terrible economy for who knows how long right now we operate the three businesses in one.
It's very high, and I just don't think that in the future, for god knows how long it's going to be possible to sustain that, so my team and I sat down and decided- we just want to operate one business in all this, because then we don't need all that staff in order to make that operate.
So two clarifications before I see: if there's anybody who wants to speak to this in the audience, the virtual audience or ask questions, is 445 e6 street still going to be a separate little first.
I've never been in it, so I don't know if it's attached, because I couldn't get from the plan, so is it just going to operate as one continuous space, but there's going to be like still a separate bar and a separate entrance at that location?
Well, I don't know, I can only say that has no recent complaints or sla history that we would approve the alteration or deny it unless they would agree to the following stipulations and then I would propose almost the same stipulations as existed before so now it would be operate as a full-service vegan spanish tapas restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food to within one hour of closing on both floor, and I would put the I'm gonna have to put this as a separate ellen unless you can fit it in at the bottom.
Okay, but with that little back room we want to use for private events for teaching classes, and maybe, if we get run over on the weekends, if we're busy enough we'll use it on them for those nights.
But we will still keep the liquor license on that bar okay, then I'll just put both floors at both addresses as a full-service, restaurant and bidder's bar okay, that the hours will be 5 pm to 2 am all day that the sidewalk cafe hours will be 5 p.m, to 10 p.m. All day, can we can we make that 11 on the weekends?
Mondays through fridays and 11 a.m, to 2 a.m, saturdays and sundays, yeah, and I'm specifically, referring to the outdoor cafe you're going to operate.
But I think that's something we'll discuss okay of the committee members.
So it's a closed facade with no open doors or windows recorded background music, no promoted events scheduled performances or events with cover fees, no pub crawls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait live staff outside and then we'll go to the discussion of whether or not we should keep the hours of operation for the sidewalk cafe the closing hours the same or extend them in any way, and what the applicant is asking for is to extend them to 11, saturdays fridays and saturdays.
Okay, I think we should stay consistent because I'm sure other people is going to come and ask for that extra hour, which we have diligently withhold all the time that we have been issuing.
So if what he said, which is 10 tables 26, but I don't think we broke it down, I know that we did discuss how they would be set up and the tables on east sixth street.
Okay, anybody else want to be heard with respect to this, so it's just jesse, I think, did we hear from you?
I agree it's nice to be consistent with the 10, but do these times warrant a exception to our consistency in going later- and I mean- and I mean that is a legitimate question for us to consider- I don't I don't know, that's why we should discuss it.
Does this open the floodgates or are we saying, like case by case on this case he has a he has experience with no complaints, it's on an avenue that you know that isn't on issues, no one above that's why we made this exception.
I think, I'm with clint that this can I'm okay with this being an exception, and you know a decade of the being in business there with little complaints going to 11..
Sooner or later I would like somebody to come and not fly and we're somebody's going to say yeah, but you're, not ceo, fragrance and you're, going to want to know why and we're going to have to explain that the, but that's my feeling, so that's how I will vote where, as the time comes, the other thing is.
I was going to leave what we had agreed to before, but clint is right that we've amended sort of what the standard is that, as the fla has amended it and generally we ask people to serve food all hours which takes into account that you're going to be shutting down your kitchen, so that doesn't know that yeah sorry, I was just going to clarify.
Okay, so does anybody want to add any other amendments or suggest any other changes?
Everybody said I we're going to move to number four, which is also an alteration application of robbie's, which is for 111 east 7th street, and it's also to change the type of restaurant.
So when I try to look up and I'll get to that, just let me go through my history that I have and then I will get to that and I'll ask you to clarify so also at this address we approved a beer wine license in may of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full service, vegan restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 a.m, monday through friday, 3 p.m, to 2 a.m. Saturday and sunday, not using outdoor space, closing its facade at 10 playing recorded background music, not applying for an alteration without first coming to us not seeking an upgrade, not hosting pub calls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, having happy hours to 7 pm, not having weight loss and having staff outside, and the alteration proposal is to change from a vegan indian to a vegan, mexican or vegan filipino restaurant.
There's no answer about the facade, and I don't know if I'm thinking about the right storefront, but I thought that it had open windows, no tvs, recorded background music, no promoted events, schedule performances or covers no security, existing sound proof, proving no punk calls or party buses, no happy hours, no wait line staff outside, and this said that a license was issued.
So I just want to, I think, understand which location it is and when the license was actually issued and what the license is for, because it also seems to be unclear about whether it's a wine beer license or a gear license.
East we were first approved in was it 2017 18., either the end of 17 or 18 as the vegan japanese, with a midnight beer and wine license okay, 5 pm to midnight 7 days a week, our we opened that place our chef passed away, and then I came back to you guys and said I want to turn it into an indian restaurant.
The resolution will say what the applicant is applying for what the elements of the application are, what the history of the application is for this storefront and when the license was issued, and that, given that this has been an existing business, that's only seeking to amend the type of food served that we would approve this with the essentially the same stipulations governing its method of operation and those being as follows: operate a full-service vegan filipino restaurant serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 12 am all days not using outdoor space.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm thinking of the last one having a facade that closed with windows, that closed doors or windows that close at 10 p.m or whenever there's any amplified sound, but having recorded background music, no dj's live music, promoted events, schedule, performances or events with covers no pub calls or party buses, no happy hours, no alteration without first coming before us no upgrade without coming before us there's in the whereas clauses they should indicate within 200 feet of two churches: two houses of worship, no happy hours, no wait lines and a deaf person responsible for overseeing crowds and noise outside.
Thanks guys have a good night we're moving on now to number five is the applicant for number five at city orchard, 174 first avenue here I did not see anyone's sign, I'm looking just to make sure.
I know there's a few people who have joined the meeting a little bit later so, if you've joined, can you please sign in the chat box with your name and affiliation or if you're here for an item or just interested but yeah at the moment?
Yes, okay, so we're moving on to number eight, which is 503 east sixth street, I guess frank signed in and also somebody named joshua rickel.
Is that right there you are yeah okay, so this is an application for a tavern with full menu recorded in live music, consisting of small jazz and acoustic axe, no outdoor space on the first floor in basement.
Staff outside this applicant has operated an indoor outdoor beer garden at 272 missouri street in brooklyn, since 2014 with an op license issued november 13th of 2014., and I counted 23 ops within 500 feet of this location.
There have been issues with the various businesses being next to each other, specifically, what used to be club coming what the prior business was then 509 and 511 all together, and the hope for us was that we wouldn't end up on a residential street even up close to the corner, with more businesses that were going to close at 4 a.m. That was the issue that we had with the person who applied for the tavern, even though it had daytime operating hours and he lived across the street.
It was also the issue that existed for chola noir, which ultimately got a license from the sla, but we heard it multiple times and it reduced its hours somewhat, but it also had a it wanted to have like a restaurant pseudo bar bar gallery, but ultimately, restaurant bar business on this side street that we were hoping to not add to when we already had a history with issues, a history of issues with the number of businesses and the types of businesses over time.
I think our hope here is that I mean we've denied the last thing, but and we denied the thing before it, but if we have to approve something, it would be something with more moderate hours and yeah more of a restaurant than a bar, because we already have those on this side street and pineapple club of the hours that we ultimately gave them were, or that we ultimately agreed to were 12 a.m. Sunday through wednesdays and 2 a.m, thursdays through saturdays- and they were the most recent approval in july of 2019 of that block.
I'm not sure what the sla approved when no, when we heard noir they changed their hours of operation I'll, let you know what they changed them to, so we heard them initially I mean they could have gone to the sla and asked for anything.
I think at this point ago, alex buenos aires is a 12 a.m, license yeah, but then nobody has occupied that basement spring and really, I probably reverted back to residential, although I don't know if anybody's actually brought that up.
Okay, so then we'll go to the making of the resolution, and before we do that, can we can you just speak, please and I'm speaking to the applicant about why it's classified as a tavern with a full menu in a kitchen more for the historical perspective, this area, as I'm sure most everybody knows- was little germany way back in the day I have german heritage and my family passed through this neighborhood and saloon.
It didn't sound like you were ahead, because the sla asks are you going to be a restaurant with a full menu and a kitchen, that's open all hours and tavern is minimal food, organic candy, kitchen or less of a full service kitchen with some kind of food all hours.
Okay, I just want to get through part of the making of the resolution so that I know where we're headed.
So the resolution is going to state what the application is for the elements of the applications, the location since it's relevant to our discussion right, the location of the residential street, the history of the location, the number of ops, the history of the applicant, and we can include that the applicant now lives in the neighborhood since he he mentioned it.
Now, with respect to the stipulation, it's restaurant, with a kitchen open and serving food, all hours right, seafood, continental, we'll get back to hours, no outdoor space, facade closing at 10 pm and I'm sorry frank- is the questionnaire correct, because it's different from that.
There's a small stage in the background would just be like you know, jazz axe during the weekend, though, which he they shouldn't have had to begin with, but I guess we'll speak to that may not be able to understand okay, it's not integral to the business.
So if you're saying that you would rather not- I understand you know all right, so we have to address hours and music so no alteration without first coming before us, no pub crawler party buses, no happy hours, no wait lines, no staff outside no unlimited drink specials.
Do you want to discuss that and going to the committee, I'm okay with those hours good, ellen and herman, I'm okay with that, though, so?
What type were you and thinking of I know you said- live music in the back?
Does anybody want to speak to it or ask any questions with respect to it?
I personally would like to discuss that some other time, because is there anybody from the building that we have one line right now that could attest to the fact that they would not be disturbed or have been in when other business was there in the past?
I think that it was just a stealth operation like not even heard by us all right, yeah, okay, I'm also uncomfortable with approving any kind of live music for this location.
I know he says he soundproofed it and I it sounds like he actually did a decent job, probably with it, but I would like to have some more assurances from either the people that live above or something else once he's open that it's not going to be a problem, because we we've had live music in these old buildings and it echoes or carries through spaces that are very strange in these old buildings and can bother people three floors up yeah I mean I can understand that I'm also willing to you know limit it to you know much earlier in the day.
Okay, so I think we can only approve it at this stage and I'll finish, drafting the resolution with recorded background music, no djs, no live music, no promoted event, scheduled performances or events with cover fees.
The last op that we heard for this location was approved in september of 2015, with stipulations to operate a tavern serving food all hours having hours of 5 pm to 2 am sunday through tuesday 5 pm to 4 a.m. Wednesday, through saturday having a closed facade with the entrance door closed at all times, not using outdoor space, installing additional soundproofing, if necessary, consistent with the recommendations of a sound engineer, employing security all day playing recorded music and having djs and live music consisting of acoustic piano or guitar, but not having promoted events scheduled performances or covers installing a sound system consisting of distributed speakers to minimize noise and base not applying for an alteration not having happy hours.
That said, it was a 25 foot bar is at proposed hours or 11 a.m to 4 a.m. All day a prep area serving small place all hours, a close facade, no tv's recorded in live music and dj's at entertainment levels.
I have a vision of just creating something magical and special, and you know it's changing times and I really want to have a place that people feel comfortable in coming to and it hasn't been that way for a number of years.
Okay, you know magical and special is what the guy who opened the box, but I feel like he's been magical and special to us.
Is there anybody signed up to speak to this and then I'll ask the committee members if they have any questions or comments?
Okay, so is there anyone else that wants to say anything on this item before we move on okay committee members, do you have any comments or questions?
I mean, as we sort of stipulated there, wouldn't be any scheduled performances or ticketed events, and, as you also noted, the diagram has a piano for live acoustical music different times.
Yes, what they, whatever they said, which was, I think we just read- live music consisting of live acoustic, piano or guitar, but will not have promoted events scheduled performances or any event which recovers you'll be charged, and if you tell me that it's okay, that they have on their website, something that says you know: acoustic, piano, 8 pm to 11 pm or whatever it is on their website, but that's not considered advertising by a nightlife or club promoter, we're okay with it.
I think I thought you said the example was a dinner, but you know so I'm saying that's different from this method of operation, but that's an example of a not promoted event to me is promoting like a special dinner or a dinner event, as opposed to other promoted events, but if you're saying all you're doing is putting on facebook or your twitter account or your instagram that you're you have piano on saturday night, then that's not a promoted event.
The number of ops, the history of the applicant, that he lives in the building and operates the business that was mentioned and what his history was, as he stated in his in the questionnaire and then that we would approve this, given that it was a tavern with a full on premises, licenses similar or the same stipulations.
Events with cover fees not applying for an alteration without first coming to before us having happy hours to 9 pm, not hosting pub crawls or party buses, not having unlimited drink specials, not having weight loss and having staff outside the last applicant had stipulations with respect to installing additional sound proofing, if necessary and install and installing and maintaining a sound system consisting of distributed speakers to minimize noise and bass, does anybody want to be heard on whether or not we should include that or omit it?
We denied an op license for this applicant in october of 2017 and then approved a wine beer license in november of 2017 with stipulations to operate a full-service cheese focused restaurant, serving food all hours having hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m. Sundays 11 a.m, to 12 a.m, monday through tuesday, thursday 11 a.m to 3 a.m, friday and saturday, not using outdoor space.
It also looks like there are open doors in the picture that the applicant can speak to that one: tv, recording, music, no promote event, schedule, performances or events with cover fees, no security, no sound proofing.
Yes he's here, it says connecting to audio and we can't see your picture, but we can hear you yeah, but I'm speaking to him, I don't think he hears me.
No, it says connecting to audio, so I don't think he can hear us well, as you know, as you said, alex we originally wanted liquor at this location, maybe 18 months ago.
Anything else you want to say with respect to the application same operation, there'll be no changes, anything we're doing.
Arguably I know that was still maradona's license, because she he opened a different business in the location and was the manager in the and your client was the manager, but even then it took those additional two years.
Okay, so then does anybody want to speak to or be heard with, respect to whether or not to approve a full license here?
Given his given location, given his history, what we just discussed, I know it is a small space and it's it is a somewhat limited menu, but I think I could be okay with it.
Yes, that's correct and then it would be, whereas even that the applicant and when the license was actually issued for this location, so it would be.
A full-service cheese focused restaurant, serving food, all hours of 11 a.m, to 10 p.m, sunday, 11 a.m, to 12 a.m, monday, thursday 11 a.m, to 3 a.m, friday and saturday, no outdoor space, closing the facade at 11.
