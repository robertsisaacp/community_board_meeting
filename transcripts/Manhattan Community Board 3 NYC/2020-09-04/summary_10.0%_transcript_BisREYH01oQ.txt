hello all welcome to the Manhattan community board, 3 health, seniors, human services, youth, education and human rights committee meeting.
This is our monthly meeting and on today's before I start the meeting and talk about what's on our agenda today, larissa will just introduce what it is that you know some guidelines briefly, since I think we're all very familiar with the guidelines just to review pulling those up If you are not a committee member, please make sure that you sign in with your name and affiliation.
So I guess one of the things I would want to just state in this initial paragraph is about the amount of learning loss that has happened with these students, regardless of their grade students with disabilities, students in temporary housing students, enl students, whatever in all the different categories, that the the onset of like blended learning and online school has created a huge education equity gap due to due to inadequate access.
I don't know, maybe this isn't the right place for it, but I think it's an important thing to think about right here when we're talking about this If you read through, we do have statistics about the amount of people in our community.
Some people just got just got in from work I would also need time to read it because I was in meetings when it was sent so can, and you did offer that so I'm wondering if we could and then people started talking making comments right away, no shade, I'm going back and asking if we could, if we could do that, because you know shirley's reading I did earlier, but I think we should just wait until people have tried to read it.
Okay, hello, naomi we're talking about our district needs statement and people are taking some time to read it.
Maybe it's worth mentioning earth kind of a repeat as well as this being for next year, that it's focusing on unmet needs which will later be dealt with in budget requests, but not budget requests here or policy statements here We, you know, may take actions or may endorse policies or you know, and then there we will also be involved with the budget priorities.
That's the you know the budgets, the budget priorities of the different agencies that are involved in funding these helping with these unmet needs.
So, for example, I know carmen had a section about newark's and she talked about funding for newark's, so that'll be important but that'll be for the budget priorities.
So that's not to say anything else is not important, but you know we just want to have a theme and make it more a little bit more focused just to let you know in terms of what the need for the new school and we've talked about it, a lot, how we need more new school space.
I don't even know what's going to happen with the with those actual projects that are happening like in Queens, that they were building schools, because we are such a budget deficit.
So then the second thing is about the the issue of youth perk of the particularly the head start programs that you know there's this phenomenon where families are no longer qualified for the programs because of the income requirements.
If this is the law that's passed and now the dycd is gonna have to up the money on salaries they where they'll probably take the hit at, is the amount of young people they're allowed to take into programs like they'll lower the amount, so they don't have to pay per seat depending on the program So I think that may be where I don't know.
Our first section is just like a demographic that we, you know some demographics on the seniors which we lifted from last year, and then we have five different four different concerns.
You talked about the funding they needed any questions about this whole senior citizen, we're basically beholden to what the city can offer.
You know more drugs, people seeing more drug use on the street, and so it's that's a symptom of a health problem that needs to be fixed, and maybe the health problem is being made worse by everything.
You know it's different from the other needs that we're talking about the mental health and the drugs and the chronic illnesses.
