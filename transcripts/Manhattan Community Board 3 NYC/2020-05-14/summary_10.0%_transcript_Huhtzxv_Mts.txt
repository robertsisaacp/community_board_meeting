So if you're on a computer or other type of device, you just go into the participants tab at the bottom of your screen and go to the bottom of the list and click the button that says raise hand and then we'll know that you want to make a comment.
He has been taking a lot of his personal time to help us with this assumed technology in I cannot speak up on behalf of all the committee chairs, but I think we all share the same appreciation for Michael again.
Some of our important community nonprofit organizations I remember going to PS 23 when I first landed in Chinatown, and these nonprofits are so critical in our community cpc's Chinatown Senior, Center, Chinatown manpower project, CMP, HT, Dance, Company, Museum of Chinese in America MOCA, a United East Athletic Association, since the fire on January 23rd that devastated the structure of the building.
You know we were having conversations the elected official and the community board representatives about with the city about how they were going to move forward.
So you know he had asked for a special forum on this, but of course bringing this to the community board, which plays this role in so many important issues in our community is really a great and appropriate way to do this so appreciate all of you adding this very important issue to the agenda and I also appreciate Adi Cass being here to present this evening.
You know I'm not going to sort of talk about what my thoughts or priorities would be for this other than to say that I am very committed to making sure that any decisions that are made are fully vetted and have you know real opportunity for the community to have input, and you know at times and what it matters along the process and that it be you know, transparent process and that your community is respected as the city moves forward.
I love seeing everybody here and I just want to say thank you to our Community Board and our Community Board, who worked very hard to get this together and I want to say a couple of words of thanks to all of the tenants who have been in constant conversation with us on v-cast and I also wanted to say that I really appreciate the words that Margaret spoke and also what Brian had just said right now.
I think that one of the biggest things we just want to make sure of is that, of course, you know, we know how precious and how important this site is to our community and still is it's literally in the center of our community, and it's like the heart right and at the community space and I think that one of the things that you know our community had prompt gotten promised by the mayor was to make sure that it stayed our community space and that we would be able to have what it was back and I.
Think that we have to make sure that we address that fear and we have to make sure that people actually see what's going on and I know that you know folks wanted to have a town hall and we pushed for it.
I want to say that I commend Brian and Margaret and media for pushing with all of us together to try to get that Town Hall together and we're still working on it and we're still trying to get that date because I think more than ever, I think it's really important that we have community input and a time for us to really be able to talk about things together and be able to address some of the issues that we have.
People are afraid that you know that promises are being broken and so I think that we just need to head on, say it out loud and also be able to have these conversations very straightforwardly, because you know we have said that you know over and over again that we want to see like what's going and Saudi cast today is coming and presenting for us and I just want to say thank you to D cast for being willing to do that and I think.
You know, be able to have the community be able to give input and what Brian said is very true, that we need transparency and accessibility and an open dialogue for us in the city.
Everyone I'm glad that we have in this meeting today is really important and I want to say thank you to our local elected officials for the input and leader commitment and making sure you know that anything happening and the future of 70 Mulberry Street is being transparent and is real community input, a collaboration in feedback, so I want to thank you.
That being say, I just want to thank everyone for having this meeting tonight and now looking forward to working with the community and all the little fishes, we have the congresswoman Thank You iris.
In the last few weeks, I have been hearing a lot of community members are asking so many questions about this building and there are also some speculations on the street, but I think some of them may not be true, and tonight we are very happy to have a representative from dicas to give us an update on the demolition of the building and also tell us what to expect for this site in the future.
I just want to let all the participants know he is the executive, Deputy Commissioner of dicas I hope I get this correctly right.
Together we will go through the status of the building and the current activities that are happening on site after our presentation, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have so to start, I wanted to provide some information on the building so, as we all know, 70 ml Barry as a city-owned building located on the northeast corner of mulberry and Bay yard Street in Chinatown.
So, as we all know, there are five nonprofits located at 70 Mulberry that provide community services to local residents, Chinatown Senior Center, who operates a Senior Center, the United, aesthetic Association, who provides youth services to the community Museum of Chinese in America, who operates a museum Hg Dance Company who operates a dance studio and Chinatown manpower project who provides educational and training services and shortly after the fire we work with them and neighboring community organizations to locate temporary space for them to continue their service.
Joists that you couldn't actually the nails pulled right out in Wrightsville, so I want the pews and stand so you could tell that you can't use these floor joists and that's basically a whole system.
Thank you Joe. So we are hearing a lot of screaming in the background, so now that touch a little on redevelopment to the miracle minute following the fire that the city will rebuild the side and return the tenants to the building and that commitment remains.
Thank you so much Quintin and also Joe next I'm gonna open up for the land-use committee members to ask questions and so I see some going on the chat box.
A one question I think everybody wants to ask is about investigation of the fire, so I wonder if there's anything I'm dicas cashier with us tonight, she were so.
That was not clear in your presentation, sorry and then the second thing you said that this will show you you're going to demolish the entire building and then in your first slide, you enumerated certain considerations, including the last point.
Yeah first question is: have you done any initial consideration of what the maximum floor area could be according to the new code for this property compared to the existing building?
We would do a really a kind of visioning process to understand what the community wanted this site, its to be I mean look like and then that we would go from there.
I was really just asking a computation based on the square footage of the site, and that me, if they are in the neighborhood I, don't yeah I, don't know what it is offhand I don't know if anybody does, but I mean that could be done in like very right and we have and I personally have.
Maybe he knows about the answer about the API, because it's very important that was asked it's a 6.0 and Michael Prados wants to ask the question: Jackie Michael I.
But in order to understand- because you know in our community there have been various instances of deed restrictions, of the places that were previous schools or other things, this location right now as it is, it would require no Euler, because there are no restrictions.
We would like to be able to have our input so that the rebuilding of the 70-mile Murray will into account the space usage the need for programming into that plan, so that the building is reflective of the program services that we providing to the community.
Okay, so I have something times to 90 seconds until January 23rd Chen dancin, to serve thousands of New Yorkers through performances, classes, workshops for visiting school groups outreach the hundreds of community children each week and support for dance artists, local artists and visiting artists.
Weather is going to be expansion to include additional space added organizations, but this is importance for this building to stay in the community and it's important for us five tenants to come back and continue our surface clean Quintin did mention where we are right now, but we're nowhere.
Mixed I would like to ask Nancy from MOCA to say thank you to the members of the Manhattan Community Board, three Land Use Committee Jackie Wong.
We believe that the building should be preserved for the and respected for their historical significance and the agriculture of the architectural design, so I'm, hoping that when we have these conversations when we rebuilt the building that all these things are kept in place and kept in mind and just not change it into a monstrosity within the neighborhood, but keeping it in place and keeping it in Sen said open to the community and open specifically, as well as all the members who have been in occupy the building before we hope and we look forward.
Five of them is asking to create more new space with current zoning and also and also want to see the current tenants to be able to move back to the future building and also once the future building to be remained for exclusively for nonprofit use and also, they hope, the key architectural elements and could be honored and also incorporated into the new design.
I can tell you from my lifetime experience in construction that were I to start tomorrow morning on this between design environmental engineering impairments, the fastest that we could do this in the private sector would be for a new building like four years and the public sector, where I used to work and build things for the city and for the state you're.
But besides that you know, we did do a course analysis and it would cost us more to restore what's there and then build up on top of it, because no matter what I do I have to put a new foundation in and I have to go up with new columns, new beams and everything in the inside just to brick on the outside the red brick, most of us going down, it's all coming down and the rest.
Yet in this district there are no local landmarks that tell of the italian-american or the chinese-american experience and I think that this is a huge oversight on the part of landmarks and I've, been petitioning them for weeks to try to pay attention to this actually for years, but most recently acutely for weeks and for a number of reasons, this building should have been a landmark long ago.
Mitchell addressed many of those reasons: architectural innovation, the first New York City public school, designed by CBJ Snyder, the first, the home of the Chinatown history project, which became oka and then the central community center.
What's currently built, a very modest rooftop addition could be, how could house more community space and I think it is really essential to say this needs to stay a community center and given the overwhelming significance of this building any proposal, any proposal for the future of this site needs to consider preservation and even land marking as an option.
I'm gonna go to next person, I'm here, oh yeah, sorry I was trying to unmute myself, so I just want to say that you know the mayor said that it was going to be restored.
You know we do not need another big glass of the tower in Chinatown and we definitely do not want our tax dollars going to do that and that's all I have to say Thank, You, fanny and I really agree with you about the community engagement points.
The other thing is you would really you know you really would want to change the way your entrances to the building.
That is a is a right to begin with and I think even for the community and people occupying the building you may want to it, be to restore it, make it look relatively the same, but yet take away two fire escapes and have interiors their towels and everything to leave to the outside and utilize the property.
I mean yes, you can, if you need to stabilize the building, I have done that before the facade, but you would take it only down to the brown break, the red brick, it's too common and you wouldn't want to match.
But fundamentally my concern Jackie here is that it sounds like there are a lot of decisions that are made without any discussion, and maybe they would worth of a public discussion because they're, not you know mandatory if they are, there is discretion here made by dicas, and so it's great that we're having this conversation.
Another conversation right, I, agree with the Olympia I think they should stop demolishing Wow, so I'm for the interest of time.
Everyone I'm here today, just to shift on my support for time, town's, iconic, 70, Mulberry, Street, community space and all of the tenants displaced by the fire I mean it goes without saying that the fire blew a huge hole in the middle of Chinatown and rebuilding 70.
I advocate for restoring the historical structural facade, as others have said, in whole or in part, and the significant structural architectural elements of the building the city has to have the will and the imagination to create something special on this corner in the heart of Chinatown that will serve as a beacon for our community and cemani Mulberry Street must remain a space only for nonprofits keeping in line with the current zoning regulations.
Next, we gonna go to Korra whoo I'm from UAA hi, everybody so I'm, a member of the Yui, a you ain't and a big part of my life for the past seven years, I've attended the 70 mulberry and you know worked out there with my team for quite some time.
The speaker's won't answer that question so I think the community visioning process is the is the first opportunity and a continued engagement with both the local residents and the community to decipher and determine what's gonna happen at 70 mulberry we're committed to continuing to provide the community with up-to-date information on what's going on at the building.
When you talk about the conditions of the building, you know we take that back and we will address it as we think through the next part of the rebuild process.
How do we trust the city of New York when you come to us, and you tell us all of these things about schedules and expenses when we have, you have proven to us that you let the jewel of our community dissolve the way it did in front of our faces.
Now that plan was signed by 42 community groups, from Chinatown in 2014 and since then by another 18 books, folks at the Chinatown and Lower East Side community organizations, including community board 3 as a resident of community district 3, who worked for many years in Chinatown and as a published historian of Chinatown and in particular of its architecture that consider 70, Mulberry Street, not only to be the most beautiful building and in Chinatown, but also I, find it a unique design in all of New York, specifically for it's in our well tower with its diagonal windows.
I just want to say that I think that moving forward the next time that Dee cast comes to us or to any part of our community, that they should come prepared with information about how they are going to engage the community.
It is not enough to say that we will engage them, but you need to work with those tenants and interested stakeholders to come up with a community engagement plan that is representative of the Chinatown area and all its diverse needs and I feel like we shouldn't accept anything less.
Think a lot of good reason and if you come back with a real plan, you know.
Maybe we can like try to work together in a bit: okay, yep, so Linda do you I'm sorry, Linda has a hand yeah a brief point.
We need to put both of them in that resolution and I just want to add that normally I really I myself as a member from scraps from Chinatown as well I normally would really support the preservation of building of a historic nature, especially I really have a love for brownstone buildings, but for this particular site, I agree with the certain preservation is opinion that brownstone buildings are due to last.
They say I'm opinion to us for the comparison I mean just general like feeling about it, but I also want to mention that, from my general observation, China can really in need of community space.
I'm, sorry, yeah, I think the resurrection Utley include what's clear from the community that we should demand that there is some type of community engagement before the city continues to deconstruct the building beyond what is obviously necessary to protect the safety of people and the building surrounding it.
I know heard from a lot of speakers, but I really wasn't always able to distinguish the public members from the actual tenants of the building and I heard both sides of those who wanted preservation in those who wanted more space.
But can you just give me a summary of what the tenants who actually occupy the building had said because I'm just trying to struggle with those two things so from I understand from the what kind and said I think most of the tenant wants a bigger space.
After the school closed in 1975, the building became home to five Chinatown nonprofits and cultural institutions, Chinatown Manpower, HT, Chen and dancers, Chinatown Senior Center, operated by the Chinese American Planning Council and United East, Athletics Association, and the archives of the Museum of Chinese in America, all of whom are currently displaced and as the diversity of community uses and services.
These organizations provide to Chinatown residents include, but are not limited to programming for seniors vocational training, workforce development, small business assistance, dance performance and education, archives and artifacts from 40 years of MOCA, curation and collection and youth education and athletics programming, and whereas the Department of Buildings and Department of citywide administrative services have determined that there has been extensive fire damage on the top floors, as well as additional water and structural damage to the remaining floors and building shell, and that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full demolition and whereas Chinatown Menezes is an important cultural destination in New, York City.
Yet 70 Mulberry Street was one of the only spaces in Chinatown that supports and houses nonprofits and cultural institutions that provide cultural programming, education and training to the community and whereas Chinatown has very little community facility space and the neighborhood lacks accessible spaces for community meetings and whereas in a January, 27th 2020 statement, Mayor Bill DeBlasio committed to rebuilding at this location and working with current tenant organizations as the process unfolds and whereas, while demolition has begun at 70, Mulberry Street, the process and timeline for planning a new building and starting new construction is unknown at this time and whereas, in this challenging time for city finances and operations due to kovat, 19 and budget shortfalls, isn't particularly important to make sure that there is a well-conceived plan to ensure these vital resources are returned to Chinatown community to the Chinatown community as soon as possible.
The city should formally commit to redeveloping the 70 Mulberry Street space for community use as soon as possible and therefore be it resolved.
The city should establish and share with the community a clear and transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of a new 70 Mulberry Street space, which will include regular community outreach and appearances or the community board to receive input and ensure community needs are addressed and the community is represented in the planning process and therefore be it resolved at the current tenants will have a right of first refusal for community facility spaces that are at minimum equivalent size to their pre fire units with rents, cap pre-fire rates and therefore be it resolved at for guaranteeing community space for the existing 70 Mulberry Street tenants.
The city should ignore all opportunities for additional community serving uses at this location, all of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity and therefore be it resolved that any redevelopment should include commemoration of this building's importance in the history of our city.
The resolution is not I, don't think it makes it clear that demolition I think that we could parse out a little bit more of the fact that it's not absolutely necessary for a folk to have a full demolition from what we've been discussing and then also the things I mentioned before, about keeping it in the public trust and ensuring that public facilities and institutions land use remains the same for the whole lot in perpetuity Mike.
So I think that you know we should be clear that it's not just presenting what the city decides, but creating a process outside that residents can be engaged in or stakeholders can be engaged and to give real meaningful.
No, if people can, unless you want to I didn't know, I was still on my word version that a city of New York am ownership of the building and that is used to that is used to be continued into perpetuity.
We already have fun the perpetuity as a community facility, so you want a city to have the ownership of this building.
We have said that every step of the process of moving this building forward toward to a redevelopment be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants, residential neighbors elected offices and community pottery, that the participation should be at every sorry, okay, every phrase of the planning from decision about it about either the renovation wait.
You have it yeah I, think that the IDA renovation I think there's a typo as a redundant versus the reconstruction to redesign the construction and, finally, the administration and management of the final building that this community engagement process became immediately and that dick has returned to Savitri with a more specific plan describing how this participation will be accomplished in no later than July meeting of the Land Use Committee that the city must do everything possible to expedite the reconstruction of the property with the goal of reoccupying it within three years.
You know making a decision on this one way or another, but I just want a flag that you know one thing about it, so we'll look out for about setting into stone the e land use in perpetuity.
You know ground floor commercial uses for small Chinatown businesses that are struggling right now, and you know those don't have those could be small spaces, they could be serving the local community.
However, what has become clear today is that we could say when I said the hearing the community wanted you to understand, you know and have input on that decision-making.
This is not a you look, I, don't know what we can ask, but I think make it more clear, because right now we're just mentioning what they stated, but we don't clarify that this is this.
The point is that how do we merge two documents and also I think certain, like that, the wrestle we created has more or less have some assumptions based on some assumption that a building will be demolishing I think we can add a certain language that we want a city to be open about test I mean I, think the only way we can ask that is if we come, you know, Linda said it.
I was thinking we can add, or we're asked somewhere in there something where's there a strong community support for preservation of the building.
Also like to say that you know this is a very critical and crucial time in Chinatown, and you know the stakeholders, residents and community organizations really need our support because they are going through a substantial amount of hardship right now due to covert 19.
The historic you know, integrity of this community and so I, don't I feel like I, haven't seen enough at this point to convince me that this is the only way I think we need to speak with a sense of urgency.
I think it's completely inappropriate that there was absolutely no community input and the city has just decided to demolish the site point-blank.
Is there any process that, because someone mentioned that they reached out to landmarks, I, think an expert from the National Building like a woman who's?
I. Don't think we have any issues with the third either and I have an issue with the fourth right I also when we mentioned to take that last sentence out this, whereas is saying this is the position of D cast, so maybe we can say and that the that D casts has determined without community input that the most appropriate course of action at this time would be full commission, and should we add in here I heard that this building is listed on the National.
Sorry, I, added and dks, as determined without any community input up the most appropriate course of action at this time would be a full demolition and wouldn't help for us to say and therefore is in danger of, or has been, he said, is now being or is now being planned for complete demolition, replacing that last part Lisa yeah and is now being community input.
Why I asked that question, because if it was transfer lis irreversibly and in fact we could not be having this conversation, what became apparent in the presentation today is that they made a cost analysis and that was conduced them to decide to demolish I'm, not entirely sure I want to I mean the financial consideration is the only thing because they also talk about like trying to expand the spaces, but you can expand the spaces and protect the building.
Sorry well is easy, Wow, so I'm looking at it says the building can be rebuilt or restore that's what yeah I mean you go to that mean I just want to say that I had him literally safe, restore and he committed to it, and it was literally the day of, and he promised us.
It's messed up that you know the city is telling our elected officials that things and have legitimate community input, and then they don't.
Gonna rebuild the whole building, but, like you know, when you're, when you're rebuilding as to make something whole.
Yeah I like that, therefore be resolved better actually, but thank you Michael right here.
Let's just move on: where were we were the second, whereas right andhe's, not for a year okay time for news, I, don't have prob with this parable, but I think maybe too vague.
Is this that what we want to use, or should we say the city should commit in writing to restoring I think redeveloping this, but I?
Sorry, you said redeveloping and retaining in perpetuity and I like community use better than community facility, because that does keep the open, also affordable, housing.
Okay, the city should establish a shared with the community, a clear, transparent timeline for planning, design and construction of the new the space, and this one I would suggest we replace with two of the ones I write, I, suggested, I agree, which was it these two?
Okay, I think I, know that's ambitious, let's hope at least we can ask for.
As you know, what happens when the agency projects get stuck between administrations, but that's okay: Lisa, can we add something like a lease?
What could boys I think I, don't know, I think that we've said that the process move had cooperatively starting immediately and that the whole thing be done in three years is about that we could do, but if anyone has any other suggestions, I'm open okay, if not, then we just gonna go blue didna Linda!
So if not no comments, then we're just gonna move to the next clause on that which one okay, sorry, that the current tenant will have a right of first review so for community facilities there that are at minimum or equivalent size to the pre-fire unit, with friends, kate, at the pre-fire, we're saying if like if somebody gets the same amount, they'd be paying the same unemployed.
Are we comfortable with this restoration, /, construction or yeah, and then we go to the next one I'm after Karen guaranteeing community facility space for the existing seven in mauritania, the city opportunities for additional commute serving use at this location of which it should be guaranteed in perpetuity?
If you know people in the community want that and really are asking for that, then that's a conversation, but nobody did I'm.
Well, if you retain the ownership of the building, city typically does not own like housing, but it this way.
Euler I mean it's a little bit of a cheap way out of having to define their terms, but it does my you know my point: is we're not going to lose an opportunity by not mentioning it now, instead of community facility, we could say in perpetuity for the public good or something for community use, as it said before, right like trying to try to leave the language a little just big enough.
It's continued in perpetuity for community use, I'm just wondering like if we say what would be the difference with if we say to retain the ownership of the land as opposed to the ownership of the building, because you saying you're likely to be a land lease rather than actually just like that, yeah, because if the city of the land in perpetuity that also implies that whatever it develops above the land wouldn't be, is not gonna be entirely privatized.
No because you could own the land and leave it, but you also have like folk in perpetuity for community use, so I mean I.
The shitty city should work with the community when exploring I think its gathered above we're saying that we want them to have community input.
Yes, like you, suggested yeah, no I know I, just I could not remember what was captured you're getting all Jim. So if we are okay with the changes, can we have Michael, maybe with yeah I?
Thank you, whereas while demolition as 7e Mulberry Street, has already begun and is scheduled to finish in October 2020, the process and timeline for planning a new building and studying new construction has not been determined and whereas, in this challenging time for the city, finance Sisson operations do to cover 19 and budget show, for it is particularly important to make sure that there is a well-conceived plan to ensure these vital resources are returned to Chinatown community as soon as possible.
Thank you, okay and then ball that we're at border, whereas and then therefore be resolved, that the city of do retain ownership of this building for community use in perpetuity and therefore be further resolved, that every step of the process of moving this building forward to move moving this building forward toward we development be done with the full, meaningful participation of the prior tenants and residential neighbors elected offices in committee.
Okay, therefore beaver the resolved after guaranteeing community facility space for the existing 70 Mulberry Street, tenants, the city strip explored or opportunities for additional communities serving uses at this location of which should be guaranteed in perpetuity.
But thank you so much for staying with us and I know tonight is not easy, and this is a very passionate topic and subject and I think the conversation would go on and we really wish the dicas will come into a process to engage the community in creating a plan for this site, and so tonight is the first time that- and we have a meeting in three months so I hope this time we can do it in a shorter time and also I want the fame or the members who spend their time tonight and share their opinions with us.
