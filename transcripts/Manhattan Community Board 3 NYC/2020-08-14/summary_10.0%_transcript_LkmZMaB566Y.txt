So if you want to revisit the joy of community board parks and rec meetings, you can do so at your leisure and trevor.
They had asked to speak before the agenda item and I know there are folks who want to speak when the topic is going on.
Okay, two minutes see I'm talking about right after the parks manager or right before the agenda item we're going to move escr.
So I'm going to ask committee members first, I just want to thank jamil for the quick action and response to corlear's help after we emailed them yesterday or the day before about issues there yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Okay is your hand raised to ask a question for the parks manager or for a public session for a public session gotcha, and can you do aixa and nancy?
Yes, we can okay, so I'm mark richardson from tennessee united for lower east side, I'm just going to read an excerpt from a letter that we recently sent to the mayor's office edc and the department of parks and recreation regarding coastal resiliency.
There was significant movement building to move these projects forward to recent months, but the current covet 19 public health crisis has seen the the edc and other city agencies pivot to work related covet, 19 response.
We urge the city of new york, the edc, the mayor's office of resiliency and the department of parks and recreation to restart all resiliency projects as soon as possible, so that they can remain on schedule, meet federal spending guidelines rather deadlines and provide the protection.
Nowadays, since probably the last couple of months since may, the beautiful, clean, safe, pier that we come to love, has drastically changed into a place where we witness open alcohol and drug use during broad daylight, very loud parties nights on the evening nights, especially on the weekends, constant trash trays of food left behind broken glass and everywhere, and many of the times people would set up some tables and open fire to block the open access of the passageway.
That way, we have a look at what's being said and done, and also to be part of the solutions and part of the process and not be excluded, like second class citizens, because, as you know, most of the waterfront on the east river is public housing.
First, it does seem like a lot but they're, all very related, so I believe will is here from edc and he's going to give us an update on the status of the waterfront projects that run from pier 42 to the brooklyn bridge, great yeah.
From a lot of folks who are on the call today asking that we resume the the critical coaster resiliency projects as soon as possible, because, obviously you know it's critical to get those projects underway as quickly as we can there's another hurricane season coming this year.
So I'm really happy to report that, as a result of the advocacy from folks in this room and from the from the groups that I mentioned as well as others not on this call today that we are going to be resuming design work for the bmcr brooklyn bridge to montgomery coast, resilience project that we actually resumed design about two or three weeks ago we had a number of meetings in the past.
So my updates here today are going to be pretty quick about all of going through all of the projects really briefly and just where each of them is in terms of the status and then I hope folks can join us on september 10th, where we're going to be going through the most up-to-date designs for the resiliency project, so to go quickly through the the four projects that are on the list here so beginning with bmcr, which again we have a number of projects on the waterfront here.
We're really excited to be finishing up with package 4 this year and we'll keep everybody updated with any progress on that for brooklyn bridge esplanade, which is the excuse me everything between the seaport area and a little bit north of the brooklyn bridge that project we had completed design earlier on this year before covid, but because of the current fiscal situation, we have not yet been given authorization to proceed on that project.
But edc is going to be working on two projects at pier 42, there's the permanent park on the on land portion and a temporary activation of the deck, the over water portion, which will serve as additional open space during the closure of east river park or the east side coastal resiliency project.
So we anticipate beginning sewer, work and bulkhead work, probably within the next month, probably just after labor day, so we're going to be beginning with the hard infrastructure work on pier 42 and after that, continuing on to the to the park, and you know everything that goes with the park.
Again, it's going to serve as a temporary recreation area for for folks who live in the neighborhood during the construction of east river park.
42 has two sections, and I know you mentioned it and we'll get an update from esdr with the upland and the temporary deck those are related but separate projects with different funding streams.
The all four of the projects I mentioned actually have federal funding involved and all four of those projects have federal funding with deadlines associated with them so generally the way that that the sort of flow of money works when we're building projects like this with federal funding, is that the agency spends the money first and then the agency gets reimbursed by omb at the city's department of or office of management and budget, and then the and then omb the city gets reimbursed by the federal government.
I have bad internet here, but I think you said construction will begin, I'm referring to the pier 42 in september and if so, what I'm hoping is that I'd like to set up another zoom meet this time for bouvier gardens residents, and I request that maybe you reach out to other from laguardia and from vladimir to set something, because if construction is going to begin, I think it would be really helpful for bouvier to know exactly what's going on.
I know that they probably have more specific questions, because gouverneur gardens really fluctuates right up against pier 42, but as well as at the entryway, and so we're gonna have some questions that I think we could follow up on and we were really great for you and alda when you presented to us before this whole culvert, really imploded and I'd like to continue that before construction begins.
But I do have outstanding concerns about the security and about emergency response, because I think you might have recalled the image that I sent and I do have others where, when we have a ambulance leaving the park area and going along that esplanade, and then we have police and fire trucks going in and there you know this.
I think yeah construction is is beginning honestly, a little sooner than we anticipated, because there is work within the pier 42 project, the sewer and bulkhead work which physically connects to work.
Nonetheless, though, I'll circle back with the construction team, because I think once we have a better idea of what the permits look like what the sort of times and dates schedule of construction, I imagine that you know we'll be able to talk about light and noise mitigations and that kind of stuff we'll be happy to reach out and get together anybody who's interested in speaking further on that further.
On that point, I think for the yeah like thank you, for you know acknowledging that I may not have the answer right now, but you know obviously it's very constrained there at the entrance.
So you know, there's not all converging right there at once, and I think it's you know, I'm sure that the ddc in part you know, would echo this in saying that it's going to be a challenge, but you know, obviously we need to tightly control and out of that area and ensure health and safety for the residents who live up in and across the area from there, but also you know folks who are in the park to get to emergency services.
So I will get back in touch with the construction team and see if there's a potential, for you know for speaking in greater detail about the construction mitigation, and I might request as well that we use the form of community board three or that I think that could be good depending on what the timing is of the next meeting of this committee and when construction starts, because I know it's after labor day and I'm not sure how far after labor day well, I want to also add that we've raised the issue that interest for quite some time.
But at some point I want to erase it as a separate agenda item because that's a very it's not just dangerous emergency vehicles, they doing pedestrian bikes alone, and we really haven't talked about a solution or implementing anything since no absolutely- and if you don't mind me addressing that really quickly so again, because there's so many projects happening there with escr, pier 42, upland, pier 42 deck, the resiliency projects and the given that there's a lot of underground infrastructure associated with that including sewer work we've you know, we've been working with our partner agencies to stage that work, so the basketball city, the sort of pedestrian drop-off area that you were that you were just mentioning that will come after the underground infrastructure construction as concluded at that site.
So that's going to happen after pier 42 is built most likely, but we're having I'm happy to be happy to give you an update on any more specifics with timing, but that's the best.
I want to say maybe february, but I could be wrong, but nonetheless I can make sure that you know I can distribute that presentation around again or send it to trevor.
Who can send it out just to make sure that you see what we've presented and some of the comments we receive regarding the regarding the innovation here, you're correct in that it it is, you know we are doing it in a temporary fashion in order to make it quicker to implement, but unfortunately it does rely on our completing of some of the bulkhead work and sewer work upland, because pedestrians to get to the temporary deck are going to have to cross what is essentially going to be another construction zone so for a combination of completing work that is in the way of people accessing that deck and doing the work on the deck itself.
I don't know how all of a sudden there are 100 cars that are parked there right now, but we want to make sure that it doesn't stay that way on these more pollution, more pollution for the residents in south, pretty smith houses, who I today's not a good day for me.
Thank you absolutely, and I think you know that, and I think in regard to and specifically in regards to the parking, we were really glad to be able to work with this committee to remove, I think, 70 parking spaces from from the design of that project under the esplanade in order to create more open space.
So I guess my question is you know, forgive me if you've already pointed this out in previous answers, what do you, what are the things that you think that you're not able to resume due to the pandemic?
You know in order to use the federal funding in time, but yeah, like you, said for brooklyn bridge esplanade, which is still on pause.
Using this funding, everybody's, obviously had you know pretty significant delays due to coded so we've been working with the federal delegation as well to push for push for some additional time, but nonetheless, we're point well taken we're proceeding on three of the four projects that have federal funding in this area and we hope to get us back to work on the fourth one soon see one last question from christina and before christina goes.
I see a message from and forgive me if I mess up your name, if you could put in the chat box what agenda item you like to speak on, but let's go to christina and I think that michael just any more hands rings after that one.
Where can we go to find like the latest presentation that you have because I went to new york, city.gov lmcr and I don't see any of the pdfs up there or the powerpoint presentations rather, and so that's my first question and then the second question is, I mean I think, like you know, the residents of knickerbocker village would be interested in having you know meeting with you on the design project as well, and I guess this is like a general question like I don't know, if you have the answer to it, but a lot of the residents here, don't necessarily have access to zoom or like a computer.
So I just sent michael the link and, if you scroll to the bottom, there's a list of pdf presentations, so the regarding access, I think, yeah, it's a huge challenge christina, and I think you know all of us in this room are kind of contemplating this like.
I know you may need to stay on we're going to move to our presentation thanks everyone.
Okay, yes, val, wanted to ask her a question prior to this presentation.
Now we received a response from a representative of ddc and it says, since this issue was first raised, ddc and parks team have taken a look at the history of the events at the outdoor amphitheater and worked with the design consultants at akr to observe and assess noise associated with.
New york city parks is willing to engage in discussions with lespp community board, 3 and other local stakeholders about what a feasible set of practices and thresholds should look like as this project progresses.
If that works, just tell me what okay, thanks elda, all right, yeah, I think just slide two, please with the what we need to get it up first, so hold on like q.
We just wanted to put this up for everybody's reference, there's not much of an update any not many major updates that we have to share this month, based on what we, what we presented last month, we're still in the procurement, so the pre-construction phase and we're waiting for the contractor's contract to get registered and get their notice to proceed out.
Everything that we talked about last month- and I put all those in here as a reminder for everybody, and wanted to reiterate that really the bulk of the work that that's the reason that we were not able to answer a lot of the questions right now is really pending on the contractor formally being able to be on board and provide us with their first round of deliverables and from there we'll be able to provide more details.
What the dust control air quality noise mitigation, all those plans would look like everything was the dominoes will start falling from that point on and we'll be able to share all that as we move forward so again, just wanted to ask where everybody's patient and patience and bear with us a little longer we're getting closer to these milestones.
One of them is our industry, the building construction industry, and you need to wait and give it a little more time to understand the sort of overall impacts that covet has had on major infrastructure and capital projects like ours and many others out there so we'll be sure to keep everybody updated on what as information becomes available overnight.
There are program managers for construction, they've been brought on board towards the end of last year to help ddc manage the construction over this of this project and oversee the contractor's activities and everything that goes with it and there's a core group of community engagement, folks that we have here desiree castle from asiantv literal group, is going to walk us through some of these slides.
Not much has changed since our last presentation, but we wanted to get a few minor updates out there and I'll mainly make ourselves make sure we're available for questions and we'll be back again next month and the following months as we continue so with that mike.
If he can unmute desiree or if she can do it star six, she should be able to do it and after that, okay, great after that it will be john bench- and I think leah and from my team, ddc, ophelia, rivas and fey lee would also be jumping in and available for questions thanks, everyone, great that's where you have it.
So after the relocation and after the coordination, that is when the ddc contractor will actually start the construction for pa2 again, we have kind of the tentative schedule and the phasing that we presented back in january to the community boards and then an updated schedule is pending notice to proceed for the contractor.
So through the website which we'll be launching in september and that public inquiry tool, we will be able to push out information about the project and also make sure that any questions any inquiries about the project are answered in a timely manner and accurately because they're going to the right places through this public inquiry tool that we have that will be available through the website.
Fencing art program, which is under development, we'll be launching a community art contest in the fall and winning entries for that contest will be placed on our construction, fencing which will be surrounding the park and other various sites that are under construction as part of the esker project and we'll be presenting a little bit more about that at our next meeting.
So we are looking at possible shorter term spaces, as opposed to going right into a long-term space, considering social distancing, and although, if you could advance to the next slide, that would be great and I will turn it back over to q to lead the questions.
Thank you for that update, and I just wanna before we get on to the next item, just remind everyone that we are bringing this team in every month and they've been here every to the community board every month at least a year and a half, and they will be back next month, so we're going to try and keep the questions limited to what we are discussing and if you have something they'd like to you'd like to ask them to bring to the next meeting to in the chat box.
One is still wondering if there's confirmation on the plans to return the compost, pile from lower east side, ecology to this space or any space within the east river spark area- and two is- I remember- a january 23rd, 2019 city council hearing where council member mark levine questioned very hard, lorraine grillo of ddc, to confirm that the monies for this park would be assured and that's why they weren't going to do the state alienation plan.
I think you had to drop off, but faye and ophelia from ddc are here and can fill in for anything that I have not addressed so on your first issue, k about the east river park and lorisat ecology, center and return of compost.
He hasn't been given a notice to proceed yet we're waiting for that, but that is the area from 15th street to 25th street, and I think you were asking that you haven't seen details of what the wall looks like.
I've asked for those maps to be shown to the parks committee so that we have some idea of what we're facing with the time frame, and I was told that you couldn't release those maps because the contractor hadn't been chosen yet, but I really do think that it's unfair to the residents of this neighborhood for you not to share those maps.
I know they have changed a bit but provide as much as you can in september, because I know they've been updated somewhere all right and the third phase of your project is the parallel conveyance system.
It's supposed to run from corlear's hook where the receptor gate is to be located underneath the swordpark housing parking lot, then, underneath the williamsburg bridge to columbia, street avenue d to east 10th street across avenue c to 14th street okay and now you're, saying that the time frame for that hasn't been determined yet john.
Just today, it's going to disrupt our neighborhood a lot and I think people sort of would like to have some frame of reference about what they're going to be dealing with and when yeah, of course, so usually typically, whenever the bid packages as they're coming out and as we get the contractors on, we come back to the community with consistent updates.
They go into the east river, you know and that there are outlets within the bowl work that allow the water to access the river okay from the river up to support the new park.
I hear you on that parallel conveyance issue and I'm going to ask for that to be a topic for september, because this was just supposed to be an update, because we have a lot of things on the agenda and the main focus was supposed to be internal recreation, and I know the whole team isn't here to answer those questions.
So that's my two questions: the community construction leg, design, the education background and whether you're addressing bellevue, because I think the other thing is bellevue is, I can't remember the exact title, but the fire department and the police department have some kind of special wording for bellevue because of just how what an excellent emergency room that is, and just how well they took care of any patient they got through the door.
I mean it joins the va wall at 24th, but our project limit goes up to 25th and I think bellevue is going to build their flood wall from like 25th to 30th and then and while you have it'll be almost like right.
No sorry we're going to the public now from any other board members, so for the public, who want to ask we're going to give you a chance just keep in mind that you have other neighbors who are in line to speak and we still have agenda items and they will be coming back every month.
The broad answer is yeah liquidated damages are always part of the contract and incentives are included in both the pa1 and da2 contracts and tony to your point, let's make sure we reflected on our notes because we're going to ask ddc- and I assume, there's some standard way- they do this on projects without those incentives and also penalties.
I've also looked at some of the bid documents for construction of this park and I do not see a compost yard design in these bidded out contracts, so we're hoping to discuss this further in the september meeting, but I just wanted to make that brief comment right now.
The other issue is the community advisory group established by the city council, meets separately from this group and meets in behind closed doors, which no other community board members except trevor or the public are barred from those meetings, and I want to know what the justification the city agencies have for, barring the public from receiving the information that the cag receives directly and third, I'm a resident of east river housing carolyn got it wrong.
Yeah, I'm sorry did you hear the first part or no oh you're, sort of participating out all right just I was just telling tommy that to be very careful about you know getting into back and forth with people just to indicate that I'm not the only community board member on the cag.
Just to keep that clear, that's the only thing and I'm going to let the city officials answer the other questions if they want to.
Again, it's always up to the judge's ruling right, but until then we're going to keep moving with forward with the project and, as trevor said in terms of the kag so d, it was not the city or ddc to decide whether the cag meetings are closed doors.
I think the issue that trevor is reinforced is that we're as a community board we tend to like the transparency thing.
Thanks for the presentation, I'm a lower east side resident and I access daily what would be phase one of the project, and I just wanted to reiterate the question already asked by or the demand already made of the community board member for the updated plans, it's impossible to it's not easy to find them online, and given that we have no other outdoor space anywhere that there are no recreational facilities.
I'd like to know whether the website that you promoted is also going to offer resources on alternatives and other options available to the community.
You know, impacts to the public and alternate options, and, as I mentioned, we are looking at a community information center, which will also have a lot of that same information available to the public as far as the ccls, so the ccls will be able to provide very local information.
You know, meeting with people to you know, take a look at a certain area to identify an issue, so they are very familiar with the community and they will be able to address any concerns.
We have one last question from diane before dan speaks I'd like for the escr team to prep for the next agenda item who's going to present that and diane I'm going to get to you in a second as well, make sure we're about ready if you can pull up that screen I'll, have the internal experience and start sharing the screen for the next item so diane, you want to go ahead.
Actually someone else asked my question already and I couldn't unraise my hand so beautiful, so we're just going to wait for the next period, all right, if you want to begin.
These are slides that are very similar to what we've shown last fall and earlier this year, actually just before covet hit, and so we're happy to come back today to give folks a refresher provide an update on things that have changed so far in terms of progress we've made, but wanted to remind folks that what we're solving for here is the fact that construction will disrupt access.
For folks who know what our typical capital process looks like, it usually takes anywhere from two to three years for us to design and build a project so again really trying to think creatively about things we can do so.
I want to remind folks touch a little bit on the issue of permits, specifically talk about some of the completed improvements, we've made and discuss upcoming improvements, and I do want to remind folks that one of the primary ways that we are aiming to address recreational need is by ensuring that the project will be phased.
I know the ddc will be coming back with more specific information, but the city has committed to ensuring that portions of the park will be accessible at all times during construction, so this is sort of the something to keep in mind as we think about access to open space.
This includes everything from installing new turf sites, sports coding, existing existing parks and playgrounds, making spruce-ups painting installing movable solar field lighting and the like again not going to go through this in detail, but it will be accessible online.
It actually is online already, but it is sort of buried in one of our existing presentations, and we can talk a little bit more about this if there are questions later moving specifically to permitting- because this was a really big topic of discussion- last fall.
We wanted to address this because, as some of you know, east river park is home to a lot of athletic facilities.
This does mean that we are doing a lot of planning for spring because that's when we anticipate that a lot of the closures of the park will start impacting available fields, but big picture just given where we are with covid right now.
We have been accepting applications for the fall and are waiting for a green light for team sports to be permitted from a health and safety perspective, so in east river park we know that softball and baseball are really popular uses.
Once the east river park fields begin to close and again we're thinking that we'll probably hit sometime spring 2021., so we're aiming to address those shortages and to make sure that local use leagues can stay local because we know kids have a harder time.
You know which teams may be most appropriate in terms most comfortable with the transportation on the ferry and such we think that it can be part of the solution, and so that's something to keep in mind in terms of how we're solving for field play and permitting, and I'm going to include this slide that we shared previously, because we always get questions about well.
So here's a list of completed improvements that we made last fall and some early this spring, I'm not going to go through each of these bullets, but a lot of these are sort of quick improvements that we try to make again avoiding a large capital project which could take years because we wanted these to be in place in time for use during escr construction.
Here are some more examples and that sort of gives you a taste of some of the work that we've already completed and what we're anticipating completing a lot of this work will be going on this fall and will be completed by next spring, and so, in addition to painting and sports coating we're also putting in new field lights, installing new barbecue in some areas.
We're also actually going to be installing some new barbecue grills there as well- and I think we're really excited about this, because this the footprint of the bath house was previously inaccessible, and so this will be new public open space that folks will have access to.
We know that a lot of the folks who will be impacted by this project are nature residents, so we wanted to make sure that we did some work in open spaces that residents use outside of parks as well.
We are also going to be reconvening a meeting of the neighborhood tree planting task force, haley hicks who's, the project manager for that and who joined us last month, we'll be reaching out to folks looking to schedule a meeting sometime this september, quick update on green thumb, gardens one of the things we're also doing is making resources available to community gardens in good standing, providing materials equipment, anticipating that they may see higher usage when parts of east river park are closed.
I think there are a couple things like sidewalk message, boards and certain size benches that were impacted by procurement, that we won't be able to offer, but most of them will be delivered to gardens pretty soon we're just working on their delivery schedule, and then this is something that will from edc had addressed earlier, but that we wanted to make sure we talked about in the context of escr mitigations and access to open space is pier 42, where this will be new open space at what has been an industrial waterfront site for a long time.
In addition to everything that we're doing as part of esker, I did want to fly some of the parts capital projects in the district that will be completed soon, there's a list of what's coming 2020 and as well as 2021 and then the last thing I have is a sort of placeholder url for we've shared this.
Looking for a ball field, we're going to have a site with a map and a drop down menu where you can choose, you know what type of activity you're looking for and it will highlight which nearby parks and open spaces you can go to enjoy whatever it is that you're looking for so that website we have the url here.
That's the that's what you need to look for, then, I'm not going to open it up for the whole meeting, because I don't want to find it.
No sir, just diane, okay, I'm gonna have one question from diane: I'm going to ask a few diane hi alda, you talked about ball fields and you know other sorts of recreation areas, but there's no update on the greenway.
Thank you, diane, and I agree we kind of let that one sort of fall off the radar, but I'm going to ask for it to be discussed at the september meeting trevor.
The mate and staff has been really hit hard, but if, in the next presentation you can talk about what we're gonna do or what parks is planning just in terms of open space, mitigations that are not sports related just places for people to go and relax or to sit around, I know some of the turf field.
Let me know, if not I'm happy to follow up in the september meeting on where things stand sure and I just want to make sure we focus on.
I don't have a date for you right now, because I think we also want to get the barbecues in before we open that space, but we'll definitely be in touch with your office when we anticipate when we actually have a date and we'll let the community board know as well, but we it is wrapping up.
If you want to raise your hand, so michael can identify okay go ahead, ishmael you're on a two-minute timer by the way how's it going trevor hello, everyone.
I mean there's dozens of barbecues going on at the same time and I know they're not supposed to barbecue and but I don't see anyone really enforcing it, so I just wanted to share that as a resident of the two bridges, neighborhood and downtown area, and that's my time.
Before I mean initially, this skateboard is just people destroying it, but we're looking for some sort of a resolution to keep this place safe for families and available for the seniors who also like to use it because they've also been kicked out of many areas and if you think about the limited space for seniors, because this is less than a half an acre.
Last year, when we had the party folks leaving out of there, the police department closed the back of it to prevent people from exiting the vote to going towards pier 35 and causing damage that way, things have sort of changed with the police department.
That stated right now, there's a sign that says the park closes at midnight extremely difficult to enforce, but we want to make sure that we can have a closer time at midnight, at least to so.
So what I'm asking for is basically the bullet point of we'd like to have parks enforce the closure time at midnight.
So I'm going to ask the community members if they have anything additional, because those are the only bullet points.
We've gone through things like that with conference square park and also with community gardens, and what I've been told by the police in regards to the plaza is that we had to have signage posted okay, and if I don't know, the determination is to whether or not your area is you're, saying it's not listed as a part there's a park in it, but it's not listed on when you call 3-1-1, you have to put an approximate address which sort of skews through the data 301.
I wonder I wonder trevor if we could have maybe even a some kind of a meeting with coalitions around parks to talk to the police in general, because I think the dead body part really caught my attention and you know it's not just vandalism, it's.
That's the reason why I'm doing this at this point I know susan, his own has a question and I'm doing a lot of talking.
I just thought it might be useful for people to know that there has been a meeting with the community board the council office and all the agencies, and- and you know, trevor gave a blow-by-blow of what's been going on.
You know during the interim and close the back gate, because there is a great big giant back gate to close to close, pier 35 and the rest of it yeah we're going to ask for that in the resolution and that's what we're going to focus on, because it is okay, it's 9 15 and I think, we've expressed all of our concerns.
So what I'm hearing I'm reluctant to say after hearing michael's story about bathrooms that- and this is for our committee members to listen, because this is what we're going to bullet point, that parks and this language will be cleaned up work with community members and elected officials.
I almost drifted off there and, as you know, we're going to clean this up, we're just trying to get bullet points so that the committee members can sort of listen and we're going to vote on this, but park parks works with community members and elected officials to find a way to physically close the park at both entrances.
The police had asked for a closing time and they needed because it's beyond 11 and it's before one so we're asking for a closing time of midnight, which is a bit late, but I think it's fair, since the official closing time is eleven but we're asking for a closing time at midnight and it parks work with the I'm just going to say community members to figure a way to get bathrooms, and this isn't the best language.
Yes, okay, I think the main things I remembered were the gates and the closing time.
We still have one item and once again, if folks want to stay on to talk about different things, that can this shouldn't be a long discussion for committee members, michael.
Based on the comments from last time, we just changed this because we're asking all of these to be open for community use, so we're just kind of describing how they're used now so stanton street building are used by park.
