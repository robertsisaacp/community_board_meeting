All right folks, so again for those of you who might have just joined the chat feature tonight is being used for attendance and for technical issues. The chat is only fine michael. Can you mute everyone? There's an echo [Music]? Okay, all right! So again the chat's only going to be used for attendance, as well as for technical issues, the chat's only coming to the two hosts of the meeting and zoom myself and trevor holland. So we're the only two that will see any messages so we're trying to not have a second meeting go on while the verbal meeting is going on in the chat. So that's why we do it this way, so just use it for attendance and, if you're having any technical issues, we are probably going to keep everyone muted. Since this is a very large meeting and we're going to use the raised hands feature to to unmute people. If you want to ask a question or for board members for attendance issues, we'll do that as well. If you are on the phone, it is star nine to raise your hand and star six commute and unmute yourself. Once we give you that option, if you are on a computer, a tablet to access the raised hands feature you go down to the toolbar, where it says, participants and open up the participants window, and that will show you the raised hand feature. So the way we're going to run tonight's meeting is typically the same way. We run them in person. We have a large agenda tonight with a lot of presentations from a lot of city agencies. We will hear those presentations, after which the chair of the committee, which is trevor, will take questions and comments from committee members, first and other community board members as we have been joined by a few of those and then afterwards we will open up the comments and questions to members of the public. So I believe that again we're going to use the raised hands feature for that. So if you have a question, make sure to raise your hand, but we ask that you wait until we ask for questions from the public to raise your hand, because if you raise your hand while we're looking for board members, it gets a little confusing to run the meeting. I believe trevor, that's everything we are recording the meeting and it will be posted, probably tomorrow, not monday, on our youtube channel. So if you want to revisit the joy of community board parks and rec meetings, you can do so at your leisure and trevor. I will hand it over to you. Well thanks everyone for tonight's park, recreation, waterfront and resiliency committee meeting for august. Typically, we do not meet in the month of august, but all the things concerning with covid and other related issues. There are a lot of things going on, so we decided to have august meeting. We do have a packed agenda. Hopefully it won't go as long as it looks, because a lot of the items are very related. We are going to move things around just a bit just to make it more efficient, but first we're going to start with the approval of last month's minutes, which is also our way of taking attendance for committee members. So ryan you are unmuted. Can you ask for people through approved amendments trevor? Holland? Yes, kathleen webster? Yes, david adams; yes, your own altman, yes, carlin chan, yes, brian gillum, yes, valentina jones! Yes, michael moreno, carolyn, ratcliffe, yes, robin chatel, josephine velez, yes, troy the less! Yes said everyone ryan! Yes, that's everyone! Sorry! Okay! Thanks just a note about the racehand feature and for speaking, we did have a couple. People send me emails who requested to speak beforehand. They had asked to speak before the agenda item and I know there are folks who want to speak when the topic is going on. So after we do. The parks manager update we're going to go to the speakers who have signed up or who have sent an email or a text early on. If you wish to speak, I know val's the only other person about if you want to speak before esr or during escr. I don't know what your preference is I'll speak before. Okay, three minutes right, two minutes: yeah. Okay, two minutes see I'm talking about right after the parks manager or right before the agenda item we're going to move escr. That's what I'm asking right before the agenda item. It's good! Does that work for you, okay, perfect, okay, all right! So jamal! You want to give an update on the parks in that area. I'll just raise your hand for me, so I know which person I need to unmute. Hello, hey, hello, yes, good evening, everyone so storm-related issues. Majority of the properties in the district are clear debris. East, river and coalith hook was were severely damaged by the storm. We still have staff on site, still removing debris right now we're having significant staffing issues throughout the district, so bear with us regarding response time, because forestry right now for the for the parks department are based in queens and brooklyn because they had they were hit the worst by the storm. We're having some serious issues with homeless issues at saturday, coleman and east river and capital projects, luther garlic and first park are near completion and that's it. Okay, there's a lot going on in the parks. I really want to keep the q a for the parts manager. Pretty brief. So I'm going to ask committee members first, I just want to thank jamil for the quick action and response to corlear's help after we emailed them yesterday or the day before about issues there yeah, I'm sorry about that. Currently, right now we have a lot of equipment out of service, so we've been borrowing from other districts to get things done in district three. So if you could bear with us, hopefully we'll get some stuff back next week, so we can really start cutting throughout each river and call as fuck any other committee members and michael, I can't see everyone's hand, nobody's raising their hand. That's always the reason that they have broken equipment in community board. Three okay, I see one hand raised from oxia and nancy ortiz have been messaging me that they want to speak during public session. Okay is your hand raised to ask a question for the parks manager or for a public session for a public session gotcha, and can you do aixa and nancy? Do you want to speak before the agenda item or right now? I want to speak now all right, I'm going to kill you up to the folks who are also going to speak now. First up is mark richardson. If you can, you guys hear me. Yes, we can okay, so I'm mark richardson from tennessee united for lower east side, I'm just going to read an excerpt from a letter that we recently sent to the mayor's office edc and the department of parks and recreation regarding coastal resiliency. We are writing to you regarding several major waterfront projects within the two bridges neighborhood in lower manhattan, specifically the brooklyn, montgomery coastal resiliency, east river esplanade package, four, the brooklyn bridge esplanade and the upland pier 42 projects. Members of the two bridges community have spent many years attending countless engagement meetings and community board free meetings to provide our input on all of these projects. We have dire. We are in dire need of resiliency infrastructure to protect our neighborhood against the type of devastation experienced during super storm sandy in 2012, as well as the more general vulnerabilities to climate change and already rising coastal waters. Fema has identified a hundred year, flood plain that encompasses over two dozen buildings in the two bridges neighborhood, most of them residential. These projects are intended to provide protection for our entire community and are particularly important because many of our residents are among the most vulnerable for a variety of reasons. All of these projects were in various stages of planning and pre-construction, and they, notably all rely upon a stream of federal funding. There was significant movement building to move these projects forward to recent months, but the current covet 19 public health crisis has seen the the edc and other city agencies pivot to work related covet, 19 response. We urge the city of new york, the edc, the mayor's office of resiliency and the department of parks and recreation to restart all resiliency projects as soon as possible, so that they can remain on schedule, meet federal spending guidelines rather deadlines and provide the protection. The community deserves without more delays. Thank you. Thank you. Mark no problem next up is grace mack hi, my name is grace mack, I'm a long time resident mom with three tonight. I want to talk. Actually let me start tonight. I want to talk about pier 35 and the closing time, as well as the enforcement regulations. My name is grace mack. I am a long time resident mom with three kids who lives at 82 rucker slip, which is along pier 35, the waterfront area, I'm also a co-founder of p35, as well as a broad member of tough elias. Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight about the issue. For my family's past time I enjoy taking my kid three kids and our grandparents to pier 35 to ride on the gliders. The porch swings go bicycle riding scootering low bubbles and sometimes the ten special family, pier 35, sponsor events like face, painting, balloon artists and silent disco night. We enjoy going to there because it's still tranquil relaxing as such a well-designed open recreational space. Nowadays, since probably the last couple of months since may, the beautiful, clean, safe, pier that we come to love, has drastically changed into a place where we witness open alcohol and drug use during broad daylight, very loud parties nights on the evening nights, especially on the weekends, constant trash trays of food left behind broken glass and everywhere, and many of the times people would set up some tables and open fire to block the open access of the passageway. This just this past saturday, we experienced hearing continuous fireworks since 10 a.m. 10 p.m. So we're asking plein for your help to please set a closing time and enforce peer regulations with more patrol. Please restore pier 35 to what it was and what it was meant to be a peaceful and safe place for families and seniors to enjoy their exercise bike and show along the waterfront. Thank you grace sorry to catch you, but we're going to try and keep this at two minutes for everyone. I need to ask christine from the louise ecology center. She wants to speak now or before the escr presentation christine you should be unmuted. Thank you. Yes, I actually will not speak tonight. Thank you, okay, thank you. So we're going to move on. I assume that the other speakers are. I want to speak in front of an item. There's been we're going to change the agenda. Just sorry, I thought I saw and that's that they wanted to speak now. Okay, I said nancy, I think I'll go with. I saw our hand first, you want to speak now, yes and I'm going to speak, I'm going to speak for nancy and myself and I'll try to keep it under two minutes. I'm gonna read what nancy texts me to say on our behalf: nancy ortiz, president of the atlantic houses edc, has to do better with engaging the waterfront developments. These meetings should be brought to the waterfront developments residents and include their input. This is because your meetings are where they are. I mean we're doing virtual, but when the meetings need to be done, they should be done by the world when we're physically meeting again, they should be done near our developments because we're the ones that live there, not the people that live where you have it. In sarah roosevelt park on behalf of the residents of smith houses, I would like to echo the same sentiment. Our residents from smith do participate in fact, the last meeting that they had at 82 rutgers at the two bridges community center. They started with three tables and had to put up another six smith was definitely president at the meeting, because people could walk to the meeting and be there. Some people took the bus, but it was very easy to get to. I think that if you have true community input, then the meetings need to be in our community, where it's reachable, either by a quick bus ride or by people being able to walk to the meeting. That way, we have a look at what's being said and done, and also to be part of the solutions and part of the process and not be excluded, like second class citizens, because, as you know, most of the waterfront on the east river is public housing. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you alexa, and I do hear you and I, when we resume our meetings, because obviously the location you pointed out is very easy for me to get to I'm gonna see if we can get a meeting along the waterfront when we discuss particular item michael where's, the anyone else. No those are oh yeah, that's it! So next up we're gonna switch to move the edc items which are numbered probably from two on up. First, it does seem like a lot but they're, all very related, so I believe will is here from edc and he's going to give us an update on the status of the waterfront projects that run from pier 42 to the brooklyn bridge, great yeah. So, like trevor said, this is going to be pretty quick good evening. Everybody, my name, is: will fisher new york city, economic development, corporation edc, it's nice to see everybody again hope everyone is staying, healthy and safe having a nice summer. So last time last time I was here to speak with the committee. I was talking about how, as mark mentioned in the excerpt from the letter, that he read how generally edc, had paused all of the projects that we're working on citywide in order to focus on covid response. So, like I mentioned at that meeting, edc has been working with the city's department of health to manufacture test kits for kova 19, to manufacture, surgical, gowns and face shields, etc. So we were prioritizing that and had paused capital construction projects such as the ones that I'm going to talk about here in a second. But you know we've heard from from folks such as yourselves, and we were very glad to get letters from community board three from tough, less from the lower east side power partnership as well as other correspondents. From a lot of folks who are on the call today asking that we resume the the critical coaster resiliency projects as soon as possible, because, obviously you know it's critical to get those projects underway as quickly as we can there's another hurricane season coming this year. And you know this is top of mind for folks, in particular because of the the federal spending deadline that's associated with those funds. So I'm really happy to report that, as a result of the advocacy from folks in this room and from the from the groups that I mentioned as well as others not on this call today that we are going to be resuming design work for the bmcr brooklyn bridge to montgomery coast, resilience project that we actually resumed design about two or three weeks ago we had a number of meetings in the past. I'd say six to nine months where we went to a number of the buildings down on the waterfront there, including smith houses, including 82 rutgers, including lands in two to do individual competitions with buildings and tenant associations, as well as meeting with the community board. So we have a lot of feedback that we gathered during that time again, both from individual buildings and from community board three. So we are going to be bringing a revised design submission to the september 10th meeting of this committee. So my updates here today are going to be pretty quick about all of going through all of the projects really briefly and just where each of them is in terms of the status and then I hope folks can join us on september 10th, where we're going to be going through the most up-to-date designs for the resiliency project, so to go quickly through the the four projects that are on the list here so beginning with bmcr, which again we have a number of projects on the waterfront here. Obviously, we are prioritizing resiliency, because public health and safety is obviously the top of the list. Again, thank you to everybody who pushed us to continue the project with that community advocacy. It really helped us to work with with the rest of the city to get things moving, so the project has resumed work on the design phase. We are again coming back to community ward 3, this committee, with a preliminary design, an updated preliminary design on september 10th. This fall. We anticipate getting to the 75 design stage, which means we will be finishing up with the project design by early next year and ddc. So edc, that's me is designing the project, while ddc the department of design and construction is building the project. We are working really closely with them and including them in meetings etc, so that we have a seamless transition hand off when we go from design to construction, but all signs still point towards beginning construction in next year, which is calendar year, 2021. trevor and others, should I go through all four of the projects, or should I take questions one by one? Sorry go through all four okay, so next I'll talk about the east river waterfront esplanade package, four as well as brooklyn bridge esplanade. So these are the esplanade improvement projects that edc has been constructing that you all have seen phases of appear gradually along the waterfront package. Four is the section forever. Will you please remind me of the of the intersections between which package for us of catherine so about the brooklyn bridge? Correct thank you so so that section which you've all seen you know still between pier 35 and the brooklyn bridge, still being under construction. That is because we were far along in construction. We are able to resume project work on that, so hunter roberts, construction group, our contractor, is out there continuing to work and we anticipate all of that project being done. This fall that's by november or december of this year, but since it's being completed in phases as it is safe to open small individual phases of that project to the public will continue to do so. We're really excited to be finishing up with package 4 this year and we'll keep everybody updated with any progress on that for brooklyn bridge esplanade, which is the excuse me everything between the seaport area and a little bit north of the brooklyn bridge that project we had completed design earlier on this year before covid, but because of the current fiscal situation, we have not yet been given authorization to proceed on that project. Like I mentioned before. Obviously, the city is in a difficult financial position. We in terms of getting projects restarted, prioritized resiliency work and prioritized projects that were already under construction. So again, bmcr is moving package. Four of the esplanade is moving because that was already under construction, but we have not yet been given approval to move forward on brooklyn bridge esplanade. So we will keep you all updated with that and then the last project that I have to update on sort of goes together with the updates that the escr team will give later tonight, including ddc and parks. But edc is going to be working on two projects at pier 42, there's the permanent park on the on land portion and a temporary activation of the deck, the over water portion, which will serve as additional open space during the closure of east river park or the east side coastal resiliency project. So in addition, because those projects like I mentioned, have to do with resiliency work, we have been given the green light to proceed on those as well. So the we anticipate beginning on pier 42. We anticipate beginning bulkhead work, which is the sea wall that runs along the edge of the the upland parcel, as well as sewer work, which will tie into sewer work being done as part of east side coaster resiliency. So we anticipate beginning sewer, work and bulkhead work, probably within the next month, probably just after labor day, so we're going to be beginning with the hard infrastructure work on pier 42 and after that, continuing on to the to the park, and you know everything that goes with the park. We anticipate completing that project in 2023 the upland park and then the second part, which again is the temporary activation of the over water deck. Again, it's going to serve as a temporary recreation area for for folks who live in the neighborhood during the construction of east river park. We anticipate that being ready for in time for summer 2022 and those are the updates for the four projects. Okay, thank you well just to clarify. 42 has two sections, and I know you mentioned it and we'll get an update from esdr with the upland and the temporary deck those are related but separate projects with different funding streams. Correct, that's correct, I'm gonna go to committee members and I guess the best way to do this is to raise hands for committee. Members doesn't look like anyone on the committee has questions for well and normally I would have a ton of questions but we're trying to keep these meetings a little more manageable. So I'm just going to keep it very briefly since you're coming back in september, but I do have a concern about the brooklyn bridge astronaut project, which obviously, that entered designing ready to begin. My understanding is that had federal money also, and is it? Can you explain that federal money, because the last thing we want to do in this environment is lose valuable, federal dollars, since I don't think we're getting any anymore anytime soon? So can you explain that federal portion and I believe the borough president and the council member also allocated funds for that yeah? That's correct, so yeah. Thank you for the question. The all four of the projects I mentioned actually have federal funding involved and all four of those projects have federal funding with deadlines associated with them so generally the way that that the sort of flow of money works when we're building projects like this with federal funding, is that the agency spends the money first and then the agency gets reimbursed by omb at the city's department of or office of management and budget, and then the and then omb the city gets reimbursed by the federal government. So there's sort of a multi-step process there, by which you know you complete the work and then the federal government repays you for that work. So for the case of all four of these projects, but particularly brooklyn bridge esplanade, which we are not able to start yet, yes, you're correct, there is federal funding involved. I don't have the spending deadline off the top of my head. Maybe you do, but it's there is funding from lmdc. That's the lower manhattan development corporation. They were awarded funds following 911 from from hud to do various improvement projects throughout lower manhattan and recovery projects. So there is, there is indeed federal funding associated with that. We are working with omb to see if we can get that project moving. Like I mentioned before, there are a number of sort of things that we prioritize. First and foremost, is public health and safety and resiliency. So we were able to get that the you know the bmcr project moving, but we unfortunately still are working and don't have the green light on brooklyn bridge escalante. So we'll continue to keep you updated with that. Yes, please just keep us updated and if we, if we need, if groups need to advocate for that, our resident association, especially the ones in the air and need to advocate for the fact that we need to put the message out because losing federal dollars is not something we want to do in this environment. Absolutely and sorry, I should have acknowledged you you're, correct, also that the borough president and the council member do have money in that project as well. Thank you. I'm going to go to the hands I see raised in the first one has tan has been up for a minute and that's frank and after frank will be dante right. Frank! Thank you. Can you hear me? Sorry, hey good. How are you will so thank you to the community board members here and thank you will so. My question is gonna be twofold. First, I'm gonna piggyback on what aisha and nancy from vladic were speaking about, which is, I didn't hear it fully. I have bad internet here, but I think you said construction will begin, I'm referring to the pier 42 in september and if so, what I'm hoping is that I'd like to set up another zoom meet this time for bouvier gardens residents, and I request that maybe you reach out to other from laguardia and from vladimir to set something, because if construction is going to begin, I think it would be really helpful for bouvier to know exactly what's going on. I know that they probably have more specific questions, because gouverneur gardens really fluctuates right up against pier 42, but as well as at the entryway, and so we're gonna have some questions that I think we could follow up on and we were really great for you and alda when you presented to us before this whole culvert, really imploded and I'd like to continue that before construction begins. So I ask you to reach out and set something up for us and then my other question is related to the entryway, which is, I don't know whose jurisdiction it is. But I do have outstanding concerns about the security and about emergency response, because I think you might have recalled the image that I sent and I do have others where, when we have a ambulance leaving the park area and going along that esplanade, and then we have police and fire trucks going in and there you know this. Is it's not wide enough to move? So I'm just concerned that I'd like to just hear, if not now, but in the nearest future as possible, what the plan is for that. So that's it! Thank you great well yeah. I think that's a completely reasonable request. I think yeah construction is is beginning honestly, a little sooner than we anticipated, because there is work within the pier 42 project, the sewer and bulkhead work which physically connects to work. That's happening with escr, so we don't want to delay the escr project. Nonetheless, though, I'll circle back with the construction team, because I think once we have a better idea of what the permits look like what the sort of times and dates schedule of construction, I imagine that you know we'll be able to talk about light and noise mitigations and that kind of stuff we'll be happy to reach out and get together anybody who's interested in speaking further on that further. On that point, I think for the yeah like thank you, for you know acknowledging that I may not have the answer right now, but you know obviously it's very constrained there at the entrance. You have the city facilities at pier 36. You have the you: have the extra excursion vessels leading from pier 36, you have basketball city, you have the park and you have construction sites. So you know, there's not all converging right there at once, and I think it's you know, I'm sure that the ddc in part you know, would echo this in saying that it's going to be a challenge, but you know, obviously we need to tightly control and out of that area and ensure health and safety for the residents who live up in and across the area from there, but also you know folks who are in the park to get to emergency services. So I will get back in touch with the construction team and see if there's a potential, for you know for speaking in greater detail about the construction mitigation, and I might request as well that we use the form of community board three or that I think that could be good depending on what the timing is of the next meeting of this committee and when construction starts, because I know it's after labor day and I'm not sure how far after labor day well, I want to also add that we've raised the issue that interest for quite some time. It's been interesting. We thought we had a design and basketball city had their own design, so maybe not in september. But at some point I want to erase it as a separate agenda item because that's a very it's not just dangerous emergency vehicles, they doing pedestrian bikes alone, and we really haven't talked about a solution or implementing anything since no absolutely- and if you don't mind me addressing that really quickly so again, because there's so many projects happening there with escr, pier 42, upland, pier 42 deck, the resiliency projects and the given that there's a lot of underground infrastructure associated with that including sewer work we've you know, we've been working with our partner agencies to stage that work, so the basketball city, the sort of pedestrian drop-off area that you were that you were just mentioning that will come after the underground infrastructure construction as concluded at that site. So that's going to happen after pier 42 is built most likely, but we're having I'm happy to be happy to give you an update on any more specifics with timing, but that's the best. I know right now. Thank you and to frank's point their escr. Will also talk about construction mitigation as part of their project because pier 22, so you have the additional layer of ucr communications. The next hand I see is dante and then aixa and didn't mark all right. So my question has to do with the upland. I mean sorry, not the offline, the over water portion of pier 42, and when will the community see what that the temporary programming will look like and have any input on that as well as why? If it's temporary and probably not that much, why can't it be available by next summer? 21 thanks great so and I'll speak first, and if the parks department would like to add anything, please feel free. Although yeah so they're good questions, the we did jointly with the parks department come, and I don't remember when it was exactly. But we came with a design presentation for the for the deck activation project. I believe it was sometime in the spring earlier this year. I want to say maybe february, but I could be wrong, but nonetheless I can make sure that you know I can distribute that presentation around again or send it to trevor. Who can send it out just to make sure that you see what we've presented and some of the comments we receive regarding the regarding the innovation here, you're correct in that it it is, you know we are doing it in a temporary fashion in order to make it quicker to implement, but unfortunately it does rely on our completing of some of the bulkhead work and sewer work upland, because pedestrians to get to the temporary deck are going to have to cross what is essentially going to be another construction zone so for a combination of completing work that is in the way of people accessing that deck and doing the work on the deck itself. Unfortunately, it is, it is pushed out to the summer 2022.. We were delayed on that project, as you can imagine, because of covid, something like four or five months. So we are, you know, scrambling to try to keep on schedule here and we're confident that summer 2022 is within reach, but you know we do have other work upland that we have to do in order to make it safe for park attendees to get out to the deck. Well, I know you've presented that same design and gotten input from governor gardens is that is that designed available on the website? I will send you the current version. I'm not sure the version that presented at that time, probably is. I think, ptc gave some comments so I'll make sure that you have the latest. I just want to say that I actually have a slide showing the design later on right. That's what I was going to say is that we're going to leave any further questions to that to the next presentation. This was mainly about edc projects from here 42, just a summary of everything, so we're going to get into a little more detail about those in turn that interim deck in the next presentation. I want to go to aixa and then mark for questions okay. So my question is: when is our backyard and smith going to be totally clean? When I passed through the other day, it was a little bit better, but it's still the access to the waterfront for the residents and smith, and given that this is a pandemic one more time. One of the things that people really need to have is some fresh air. Salt air is the best in the world to make sure that people's lungs are clear. I have a lot of seniors and it looks like a junkyard, a better young junkyard, but it still looks like a junkyard in my eyes, and the access to the river is really confounding and really a parks department should ask d.o.t to put a light on the corner of wagner place so that people can cross safely to the river. That's like I'm saying. Thank you well yeah. So it's a very good point. I think you know it's clear that open space and access to the outdoors and access to the waterfront is more important than ever. I, like I mentioned before it, has been a series of difficult conversations with omb in terms of getting various projects started after we were forced to put them on pause because of the pandemic and associated fiscal problems with the pandemic. We did prioritize in those conversations the resiliency work, so we are happy to be moving forward with bmcr with the with the coastal protection work, which is what we prioritize in those conversations, but you know we're certainly still pushing for to be able to move forward on brooklyn bridge esplanade as soon as we can. There is the federal funding there. I unfortunately I don't have a date right now, because you know we are still waiting to get approval to move forward on that. But you know definitely take your point. It makes a whole lot of sense and you know we were glad to come speak with you all about bmcr, and you know I hope we can keep in touch regarding the timing of all of this, so I'll keep you updated and well to that point. Where did you say that package four was going to be complete because a portion of that obviously extends the cash flow right? So package four should be complete by this fall and like into open portions of that as they are completed since it may be bit by bit, but all of it will be completed by this fall. I explained because I walked out where I used to looked at every day. Area is a bit challenging and it has turned back into a parking lot for with government emergency employees and anytime, you open up a little bit of space and find the parking spot. So I know that's edc's responsibility. I don't know how all of a sudden there are 100 cars that are parked there right now, but we want to make sure that it doesn't stay that way on these more pollution, more pollution for the residents in south, pretty smith houses, who I today's not a good day for me. This week we lost a young man, 911 related causes, and so bringing more pollution to our community is not acceptable. So I just want to leave it at that because I'm you know he was old enough to be my child, and so I would just say that cleaning the backyard of smith should be prioritized like yesterday, and we would appreciate that. Thank you absolutely, and I think you know that, and I think in regard to and specifically in regards to the parking, we were really glad to be able to work with this committee to remove, I think, 70 parking spaces from from the design of that project under the esplanade in order to create more open space. So you know, thank you all for your patience and you know appreciate your understanding of the delays due to covet, but you know we are hoping to get to work as soon as possible. It's going to be a great project down there once we're done so. Thank you. We have another question from mark richardson hello. Can you hear me? Yes, hey mark, hey, how are you so? I guess I'm happy to hear that you guys are resuming some work, but I guess my question is: it sounds by implication that there's some there are some things that won't be resuming. That would otherwise might be if we were not in the pandemic situation. So I guess my question is you know, forgive me if you've already pointed this out in previous answers, what do you, what are the things that you think that you're not able to resume due to the pandemic? That might be at risk due to these funding deadlines and are? Is there any discussion of that and any like mitigation being contemplated around managing those risks? Absolutely well. Thank you for your question. Mark I think yeah I mean the quite frankly. The funding deadlines are, you know, are an issue. I think we were glad. We were glad to be able for three of the four projects that I discussed here tonight, which again all have federal funding. We were glad to be able to resume work after only three months of pause on those so that we are able to move forward. You know in order to use the federal funding in time, but yeah, like you, said for brooklyn bridge esplanade, which is still on pause. We are in kind of a tight spot there and you know for everybody's background. You know it's no secret, but you know the mayor in a you know, as of a few months ago, announced that, due to sort of the economic slowdown associated with coronavirus, that the city was facing a 9 billion with a b 9 billion dollar deficit between fiscal years, 20 and 21.. So it is a real challenging moment for the city and you know obviously keeping basic city services as well as health and safety projects that promote health and safety and resiliency are number one on the priority list. But of course we are you know, especially when there is money on the table that we do need to use by a certain time. You know as much as we can. I will add as well that we've been working closely with congresswoman velasquez's office, in particular, as well as senator schumer's, honors and senator jill abraham's office, to advocate for an extension to the federal funding deadline for the resiliency work, because you know there have been across the country for every for every agency that is implementing these sorts of resiliency projects. Using this funding, everybody's, obviously had you know pretty significant delays due to coded so we've been working with the federal delegation as well to push for push for some additional time, but nonetheless, we're point well taken we're proceeding on three of the four projects that have federal funding in this area and we hope to get us back to work on the fourth one soon see one last question from christina and before christina goes. I see a message from and forgive me if I mess up your name, if you could put in the chat box what agenda item you like to speak on, but let's go to christina and I think that michael just any more hands rings after that one. That's the last one: okay, christina hi! How are you nice to see you good nice meeting? You too just had two quick questions. I know it's been a while, since we've seen any sort of like design. Where can we go to find like the latest presentation that you have because I went to new york, city.gov lmcr and I don't see any of the pdfs up there or the powerpoint presentations rather, and so that's my first question and then the second question is, I mean I think, like you know, the residents of knickerbocker village would be interested in having you know meeting with you on the design project as well, and I guess this is like a general question like I don't know, if you have the answer to it, but a lot of the residents here, don't necessarily have access to zoom or like a computer. So I don't know you know how can we make it a meeting where we can get as many people to participate as possible? And that's that those are my questions. Thank you right. Absolutely great questions. So, first the the presentation that we gave so actually first regarding the design and updates to the design, so the round of outreach that we did, which included four buildings along the waterfront as well as community board, three lasted more or less from october to october of 2019 to february of this year. So we had that sort of four months of working with the community and getting feedback on the projects, and then the design, team and engineers were working in march to incorporate some of those changes. And unfortunately, at that point in march we had to go on pause or we went on pause in kind of early april. So we're just get back up. Unfortunately, march and april we should have the we should have the updated designs on the the september 10th september 10th meeting this kit of this committee, so next time next month, we'll be back here to present the updates since that time. Since we heard a lot of feedback on the on the programming and on you know what sorts of play, equipment and benches etc should be used on the waterfront. So the next big update will be on september 10th. Currently folks, who are here on the call and the general public, can find all of the presentations we've given on bmcr on our website. And that's I'm sorry. I can't I can't put it in the chat box right for everybody. Well, you can put in the chat box to me and then I can send it out to everybody. Okay, I'll! Do that so I'll put the link in the in the chat box, but so yeah all of the presentations that we gave on bmcr during the most recent round of public outreach are on our website. So I just sent michael the link and, if you scroll to the bottom, there's a list of pdf presentations, so the regarding access, I think, yeah, it's a huge challenge christina, and I think you know all of us in this room are kind of contemplating this like. How do we ensure that you know folks, especially seniors and other folks who might not have access to zoom and folks who don't speak english as their first language? How can we make sure that everybody has access? You know we are really looking forward to getting back in person and doing in-person meetings, but until that time you know we are sort of constricted to online, but we do have translation services available through our design contract. So if there are particular design materials that anybody would like to see translated so that others can so that others can view that and also anything on our website can be printed out and shared with neighbors. So I think christina it's a great question. We really want to make sure that we're reaching as many people as possible right now. Unfortunately, we do have a lot of restrictions in place around public gatherings, but you know we do appreciate any feedback and any help that you all can provide and helping us get. The word out on that on all these projects. With that we're going to thank you we'll see you in september, you'll have some of those study deadlines available contemplate for not only projects that are funded, but also for the workforce. So thank you. I know you may need to stay on we're going to move to our presentation thanks everyone. Thank you. So parks who's doing this presentation they have our powerpoint. Do I need to give them access to show it. I think ddc is gonna, go first and then and then I will we have two presentations. So do you see who's? Do you want to do val's question? Can you hear me mike? Can everybody hear me I can hear you here hold on one second trevor? Okay, yes, val, wanted to ask her a question prior to this presentation. Do we want to do that sure? Let's do it now? Are we up to the escr? I wanted to do my public before then yeah, so you're up, okay, I'm here on behalf of the lower east side power partnership. We sent a letter on july 29th about the sound from the plan east river park amphitheater, which is part of the east side coastal resiliency project. The concern was that acoustics be arranged so that none of the apartment complexes that would have to endure events where the sound in the apartment from the amphitheater is so loud that it sounds like the resident is on stage which sometimes happens. Now we received a response from a representative of ddc and it says, since this issue was first raised, ddc and parks team have taken a look at the history of the events at the outdoor amphitheater and worked with the design consultants at akr to observe and assess noise associated with. On that a lot of the noise. We found that many of the past instances of excessive noise was associated with unpermitted outdoor open-air events or events. Operational controls such as establishing a not to exceed noise level for amplified sound at the amphitheater and enforcement of compliance by new york city parks. Pet, are the primary solutions to responding to noise concerns. New york city parks is willing to engage in discussions with lespp community board, 3 and other local stakeholders about what a feasible set of practices and thresholds should look like as this project progresses. So the lower east side power partnership looks forward to working with the city to ensure that we don't have that noise issues are addressed because that's very important for the quality of life of the people that live over. Here I can tell you I live over here and when there's something at the amphitheater, it's like it's in my apartment, so we look forward to working with them and we thank them for a response. Thank you thanks, val yeah. Thank you so cue. I muted you because of background noise, so you need to hit star six on yourself. Can you hear me now? Yes, we can great hi everyone, q and miri from dvc culture resiliency. Thank you val, thank you so much for that notes and bringing that up and the updates we're also looking forward to working with you and everybody else on this amphitheater noise issue. I totally agree and understand that it's a nuisance it has been, and it will continue to be if we don't figure out a way to address it. There's, as I mentioned, there's some things that we can do with design, but that's not the only solution. Unfortunately, this issue, most of it, some of it, is designed some of it is operational. So it's a collective sort of effort that will have to work together and figure it out. So to be continued on that. It's ongoing efforts, obviously the entity, the design and the rest of that. I want to quickly kick us off with the first slide mike I'm not able to share my screen, and I don't know if you have it up or not. I'm calling through my cell phone, nobody ever say hi, so I don't have anything to show he wants to share a screen here hold on one second, can he share a screen mic, or is that not that too complicated? I'm not able to so I'll? Just have my team. Do that so desiree? Do you think he can share the screen or leah he's on the phone? You can't share a scream, so tell me who I need to give access to and they'll be able to see our screen. Give me one moment: is that leona? Yes, one! Second, please check your screen. Please check your screen before you share it. I do something wrong trevor. No, we we've you, it's the! I think. Sometimes people don't realize that their screen is on cue. I have the presentation as well. This is all the so I can just share my screen. If that works, just tell me what okay, thanks elda, all right, yeah, I think just slide two, please with the what we need to get it up first, so hold on like q. Before we get the screen up. Okay, although you should have ability to do that now there we go okay, great, so not much! We just wanted to put this up for everybody's reference, there's not much of an update any not many major updates that we have to share this month, based on what we, what we presented last month, we're still in the procurement, so the pre-construction phase and we're waiting for the contractor's contract to get registered and get their notice to proceed out. So they can have the green light to start kind of the sort of pre-construction activities which includes giving us their schedule and starting to develop their plans. Everything that we talked about last month- and I put all those in here as a reminder for everybody, and wanted to reiterate that really the bulk of the work that that's the reason that we were not able to answer a lot of the questions right now is really pending on the contractor formally being able to be on board and provide us with their first round of deliverables and from there we'll be able to provide more details. The schedule kick-off dates, whether when the time frame of the first mobilization and construction activities will take place. What the dust control air quality noise mitigation, all those plans would look like everything was the dominoes will start falling from that point on and we'll be able to share all that as we move forward so again, just wanted to ask where everybody's patient and patience and bear with us a little longer we're getting closer to these milestones. That would allow us to share more information, and this page is just a summary of responses that we provided in the past a few weeks. Couple months wanted to just have. It appear as a reminder that the project hasn't been as we are right now. The project really hasn't been impacted by covid. Overall, the flood protection system is still still being planned to be delivered within time frame and our funding is still in place and committed federal funding, city funding. Everything has been has been committed and so far there hasn't been any impact that we know. But again we need to wait for the contract to come on board and the city is assessing kovitz impact. Obviously everybody knows on multiple different levels in multiple different areas. One of them is our industry, the building construction industry, and you need to wait and give it a little more time to understand the sort of overall impacts that covet has had on major infrastructure and capital projects like ours and many others out there so we'll be sure to keep everybody updated on what as information becomes available overnight. Construction is also a major concern for everybody. We totally understand- and we really appreciate everybody's commitment to the neighborhoods and following up on questions and concerns, and just asking again for a little patience and time to bear with us. So we can get these questions properly answered when we have the appropriate people on board. So with that, I'm going to hand it off to my consultant team, hmtv and liro. There are program managers for construction, they've been brought on board towards the end of last year to help ddc manage the construction over this of this project and oversee the contractor's activities and everything that goes with it and there's a core group of community engagement, folks that we have here desiree castle from asiantv literal group, is going to walk us through some of these slides. We have short slides, just maybe another 5-10 minutes, but also we have a few other team members that would jump in and walk through. The bullet points again. Not much has changed since our last presentation, but we wanted to get a few minor updates out there and I'll mainly make ourselves make sure we're available for questions and we'll be back again next month and the following months as we continue so with that mike. If he can unmute desiree or if she can do it star six, she should be able to do it and after that, okay, great after that it will be john bench- and I think leah and from my team, ddc, ophelia, rivas and fey lee would also be jumping in and available for questions thanks, everyone, great that's where you have it. Thank you trevor yep trevor. Can you hear me? Okay? Yes, we can all hear you, okay, fantastic, thank you and I apologize normally. I have my video camera on, but I am in a low service area, so I can't do that right now. So thanks q for kicking that off, if you can go to the next slide alder, that would be great perfect. Thank you. So, just on the left hand, side of this slide is essentially what q had mentioned in the previous slide. As mentioned at the last month's meeting, the construction plans will be submitted by the contractor for review and approval and that kind of includes the site, safety and public health plans and some of the other noise and air plans. So again until the contractors are on board, you know we will not get their plans until that happens. Just for an update on the construction scope and the estimated time frames again. Much as this is a repeat but for the early package, which is scheduled for a construction start in september of 2020, the relocation of the leicester, compost, yard operations. Ddc is coordinating with the mayor's office, dsny and parks on that. So once that happens, then the ddc contractor could come in and then do the site prep and the interim lawn and the tree transplants. So after the relocation and after the coordination, that is when the ddc contractor will actually start the construction for pa2 again, we have kind of the tentative schedule and the phasing that we presented back in january to the community boards and then an updated schedule is pending notice to proceed for the contractor. We do have an update again. It's a tentative update on the different parts of pa2. So again, tentative pending the contractor notice to proceed ass or levy is looking like. It may fall around fall, 2020 to fall, 2021, stuyvesant, cove fall 2021 to 2023, and then murphy brothers fall 2022 to june 2024. Again, you know where we actively tried to phase the construction so that not all perks would be offline at the same time. So we are kind of doing this phased. This phased approach with cybus and cove, then we'll have kind of two phases within its own phase for project area. One again, that's scheduled for a late fall start it's currently in procurement and then the parallel conveyance project that time frame is to be determined and again once we have that for you, we will come back and notify you of that. So I am going to now pass to melissa johnson who's going to give you an update on the community engagement efforts and strategies. Thank you thanks, desiree and alda. If you could advance to the next slide, that would be great. Thank you. As part of the east side coastal resiliency project, we have a very robust community engagement strategy and program for the project. A big part of that program is that we have a section 3 and mwbe sub consultant on board, and there is currently a plan and development to ensure that section, 3 and mwbe firms and hiring is considered throughout the project and that consultant will be attending future community board meetings and cag meetings, and we will have a large presence at different events throughout the course of the project to ensure that we are fulfilling those goals as part of our outreach to stakeholders and the local community. Our strategy includes a couple of key communication tools, including a website: a web-based public inquiry tool where the public can contact the project team and the community construction liaisons that are assigned to the project. So through the website which we'll be launching in september and that public inquiry tool, we will be able to push out information about the project and also make sure that any questions any inquiries about the project are answered in a timely manner and accurately because they're going to the right places through this public inquiry tool that we have that will be available through the website. Our community construction liaisons will be introduced at future community board meetings. There are currently two ccls starting in the near future and they are multilingual, spanish speaking and chinese speaking. A big part of our outreach strategy early on too is our construction. Fencing art program, which is under development, we'll be launching a community art contest in the fall and winning entries for that contest will be placed on our construction, fencing which will be surrounding the park and other various sites that are under construction as part of the esker project and we'll be presenting a little bit more about that at our next meeting. Also, as part of the project, we have in mind a community information center right now we are assessing a few different options with that due to the current covid situation. So we are looking at possible shorter term spaces, as opposed to going right into a long-term space, considering social distancing, and although, if you could advance to the next slide, that would be great and I will turn it back over to q to lead the questions. I'm sorry to the rest of the h t v team. Thank you for that update, and I just wanna before we get on to the next item, just remind everyone that we are bringing this team in every month and they've been here every to the community board every month at least a year and a half, and they will be back next month, so we're going to try and keep the questions limited to what we are discussing and if you have something they'd like to you'd like to ask them to bring to the next meeting to in the chat box. But I'm gonna committee members first and I see kay- has her hand raised okay. Yes, thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I have two questions. One is still wondering if there's confirmation on the plans to return the compost, pile from lower east side, ecology to this space or any space within the east river spark area- and two is- I remember- a january 23rd, 2019 city council hearing where council member mark levine questioned very hard, lorraine grillo of ddc, to confirm that the monies for this park would be assured and that's why they weren't going to do the state alienation plan. So I'm just wondering thoughts on that and is this money guaranteed? I mean we were afraid of extenuating circumstances like who knew it was going to be this pandemic, but we were assured that there would be money so your thoughts, this is aldo from parks. I will take a first step at answering. I think you had to drop off, but faye and ophelia from ddc are here and can fill in for anything that I have not addressed so on your first issue, k about the east river park and lorisat ecology, center and return of compost. I, the big picture, what's happening is we have signed so the lorry psychology center's existing license with the parks department for use of premises at east river park had expired on august 3rd. We did sign an extension with them to get through to the transition period for both the seward park educational uses, as well as moving the compost uses. As part of that agreement that was signed, we did include language about entering good faith negotiations about lori's psychology, center's general return to east river park. More specifics will have to come out of the negotiations as part of that license agreement, but that is included as part of the overall premises of the latest conversations that we've had with the laurissa ecology center. So that's what I have on east river park and the compost on money for this project overall. Yes, that is committed the funding. Is there we're still moving forward with this project? I don't know if anyone from duty is anything. Thank you thanks elder correct hi, this everyone sophily rivas, so just so we're clear, ddc intergovernmental affairs. So just so we're clear, we were allocated federal funding which has been secured and also city council, the city funding. In terms of the way the budget works. Once something is allocated to a city project, it is locked in so you can't. For example, you can't move it to another pot. Once it's passed, it's passed the money's there and you can only use it for whatever is allocated, and we secured that so it's secure as far as we can. As far as we know, we're moving along with the project and no covent impacts have been made thus far and that's why a lot of projects have been stopped because of kovid, but if you realize escr continued and we're going to continue to push the pro the project along because flood protection is important. Thank you. I just will you make sure that, as the negotiations go forward with lori's psychology center, that our chair is also immediately informed because, while the lower east side- ecology center has its you know- needs to have that conversation with you? It does impact the community which we have a separate compelling interest with. All that goes on. Thank you, okay to your okay, to your point, because this is a big item. I'm going to ask that this be a separate agenda item for september, as opposed to discussing it under the myriad of issues that we have in escr. So more than likely we'll have the holes in the audience in september, trevor board members with their hands up include clara and radcliffe, and valentina jones alex carlin. Are you said carolyn or carly carolyn? Okay? My first question is: it was my understanding that ddc plans to begin this september implementing project one. Is that the installation of floodgates from avenue c to 14th street to 25th street okay as a frame of reference. When you presented plans to 73 parks about the area of brooklyn bridge montgomery street, they showed us detailed drawings of the type of flood barriers they plan to install along the waterfront. Okay, we've never had anything presented to cv3 parks. That indicated what type of flood barriers you're planning on installing from the slide that I just saw. It seems like now that your fate or your project, one begins around ass or levy. So could you please explain yeah I can I can jump in. This is john lynch, I'm with hntb lero working with ddc. So to answer, and thanks for the question that the first project that's out is what we're calling the pa2 project that q had shown on the slide. So we have a low bid contractor for that hasn't. He hasn't been given a notice to proceed yet we're waiting for that, but that is the area from 15th street to 25th street, and I think you were asking that you haven't seen details of what the wall looks like. Unlike is that right? Yes, yeah, that's correct right, so you showed us very specific. You know. Plans for the area south of montgomery. Okay has shown us a specific plan for the area from 14th street to 25th street okay yeah. I understand your question so further south in the park, the park's being raised a number of feet in order to provide flood protection, so the flood wall itself is actually there's no wall there in many of the locations is what they were showing right, but for 15th street 25th street. It's a it's above grade to a certain elevation to the flood. Elevation and it'll consist of a concrete wall above sheeting and then it'll have gates where we do things like cross, the fdr drive or cross city streets swing or roller gates to enclose in the case of an event, all right. When are you going to show us what the plans for and what it looks like yeah? I think we can. I think we can do that. We can circle back with q. We have we have the construction plans, we have a low bid contractor, so we have a full set of drawings for that we could provide so the flood walls were shown in the pdc presentation. To her point, we have seen those flood walls. There are from 15th to 25th. It wasn't a long, pdc presentation that we had. It was a very long presentation. However, our focus was obviously for cv3. I know cb6 has been shown those presentations, but if you want to drop a link for that, I did see it today earlier. If you want to drop a link for that actual presentation in the chat box and michael can send it out to anyone that would be really nice. Okay. My second question is okay. You have shown two maps at a webex meeting that showed the phasing for the construction for the east river park. I've asked for those maps to be shown to the parks committee so that we have some idea of what we're facing with the time frame, and I was told that you couldn't release those maps because the contractor hadn't been chosen yet, but I really do think that it's unfair to the residents of this neighborhood for you not to share those maps. So when are you going to be able to share them carolyn? Which maps are you referring to? Are you talking about the phasing of the construction? I'm talking about the phasing of the construction? Okay, those are also on the website. We'll share that link as well. That was shared with cv3 parks and back in december, the plans of the phasing stages of construction right when they were shown at the webex meeting and in the july meeting. When I asked about why those maps weren't being shown, I was told that they couldn't be shown because the contractor hadn't been hired. Yet I did check well, we don't have to be planned related to the construction, but we did have the phasing stages of what will be done in what areas when okay whoa well, we should like. Okay, I couldn't find it. I checked cb6 website, you know I couldn't find anything there either. So, at any rate, I would appreciate a link as to where those maps would be available. Sure I'll share the link to the pdc deck that will show you the flood wall and I'll share the link to the deck that showed the phasing stages slides. Yes, I would appreciate that. Thank you very much, and also for the september meeting. I'm just going to ask if you have any updates to that map. I know they have changed a bit but provide as much as you can in september, because I know they've been updated somewhere all right and the third phase of your project is the parallel conveyance system. It's listed as being the final phase of the project from what's been presented in the past. It's supposed to run from corlear's hook where the receptor gate is to be located underneath the swordpark housing parking lot, then, underneath the williamsburg bridge to columbia, street avenue d to east 10th street across avenue c to 14th street okay and now you're, saying that the time frame for that hasn't been determined yet john. Does the phrasing timeline show the power of conveyance work yeah? So this is john lynch from liro hmtv so of the four projects you're referring to the parallel conveyance project and that one has not yet gone out to bid so that one has it hasn't gone out to you know the potential bidders yet, unlike the other three projects where they're either they we haven't received for the big park, we haven't received a bid yet, but it's in procurement, this one's about to go into procurement for the pc package. So I don't know, I'm not sure if that answers your question, but it's the timeline is to be determined because we haven't yet let the contract out and if, after you do that, then the con. You know the contractors you'll have a time frame, but you don't know exactly when you're going to take the the bids for the project and when you'll get to construction. Thank you, john. Just today, it's going to disrupt our neighborhood a lot and I think people sort of would like to have some frame of reference about what they're going to be dealing with and when yeah, of course, so usually typically, whenever the bid packages as they're coming out and as we get the contractors on, we come back to the community with consistent updates. However, with this it takes time, as you know, to create a contract to put out a bid. It has to go through legal and then we have to get the contractors to bid on the project to see. So it's a lot of legal, a lot of back and forth. So it doesn't. It's not a quick process, be patient with us as soon as we have that available, we'll always come back and share. You know in a timely manner, as we've been doing with the other packages. So we hear you and we understand right well. One of the major concerns for our neighborhood are the storm sewers and how they're going to connect to the parallel conveyance system? Okay, because right now those storm sewers empty into the east river. My understanding with the construction that you're planning for the escr is that the fl, the support the bulwarks will go all the way down to the bed of the river. So are there going to be outlets in that for the streams to empty into the river as they do now? Are the streams being connected into the parallel conveyance system, because when I've asked questions about the streams in the past, I've sort of been blown off and considering the fact that my neighborhood is intersected by myriad streams, I'd sort of like to get an answer? John, do you want to take that one, the you're asking about this, the scope of the pc package, I'm asking whether or not if the storm sewers are going to feed into the parallel conveyance system? My understanding from the way the storm sewers were presently is that they go. They go into the east river, you know and that there are outlets within the bowl work that allow the water to access the river okay from the river up to support the new park. Okay, that will no longer be possible unless you're installing outlets, or are you instead having the storm sewers diverted into the parallel conveyance system, which will feed into the receptor gate? That is what I'm asking yeah. I think the intricacies of the design for parallel conveyance, which is gonna going to help drainage in the area. We would have to go back to the designer. To answer your question, I think I don't think I would like that question carolyn. Let's do this, because there are people who are quite a few hands raised in cuban communities right. That's fine trevor! That's the bulk of my questions. I hear you on that parallel conveyance issue and I'm going to ask for that to be a topic for september, because this was just supposed to be an update, because we have a lot of things on the agenda and the main focus was supposed to be internal recreation, and I know the whole team isn't here to answer those questions. Okay, so I'm going to go next to michael I'm sorry! I don't know well I'll see you on the other board. Member with your hand, up hi. My I have two questions. You said the community construction liaison. I just wanted to know their education or expertise background, and there was a point where I thought it went to like 25th and didn't go to bellevue, and then I saw something that said it did go to bellevue and I think that you know for anybody that knows anything about healthcare. Emergency rooms. Bellevue is one of the top 10 emergency rooms in the country bellevue's or is right there. On the first floor, if they got the patient into the building the staff we got them taken care of, because they got taken care of on the first floor. So you never really heard that somebody had a problem on the way to the order. Oh, I was right inside the door. So that's my two questions: the community construction leg, design, the education background and whether you're addressing bellevue, because I think the other thing is bellevue is, I can't remember the exact title, but the fire department and the police department have some kind of special wording for bellevue because of just how what an excellent emergency room that is, and just how well they took care of any patient they got through the door. Thank you. So I can take the first question about the ccls. So ccls are community construction liaisons. The liaisons that we have chosen for this project are senior liaisons who have worked on ddc projects before who have also worked on new york city d.o.t projects, so they are experienced in community outreach and working with local communities to resolve issues that come up on projects. One of our ccls has an urban planning background and the other has a background in cultural conflicts and has worked with several different assembly members offices in the past sort of as a district liaison. So generally, you know they are very community oriented and for this particular project, because it is a large, high-profile project. The ccls are very experienced ones who have done this work before for ddc and other agencies. You said the first one urban plan and what was the second one? Cultural conflicts, oh cultural, okay, and you said they speak. Spanish one is spanish speaking and one is chinese speaking. Oh okay, great! Thank you. Oh wait about bellevue, yeah! Awesome! Oh okay! Go ahead, yeah to answer the second party question. This is john again from hntb lirro. The project ends at the va hospital right by absolutely. It doesn't go that far north okay, all right! Thank you! Hey val yeah! Oh, this is faye right. Our escrow project goes up to 25th street and the flood wall will join the va wall at 24th, but there is going to be a separate project for bellevue, where they're also building a flood wall around their hospital, so there's a project underway that will protect them and it's separate from escrow, okay, great, but it's underway, so we're looking at bellevue and the fire department police department. Thank you. That's excellent! That's an excellent emergency room, excellent yeah! It's almost going to be continuous because escort ends on 25th. I mean it joins the va wall at 24th, but our project limit goes up to 25th and I think bellevue is going to build their flood wall from like 25th to 30th and then and while you have it'll be almost like right. We've discussed this and I get it because we kind of want to keep this focus on cb3. There will be a flood law at that hospital. The project ends at 24., but I want to give the people we have. A big time goes to bellevue. One of the biggest populations that goes to bellevue is cb3. I understand val, but in previous discussions wow I understand, but in previous discussions, which we've done and we've discussed many times, we've talked about the flood wall at the va hospital. They have their own flood wall system that will integrate in the escr. That is nothing new. That is something that's been going on for quite some time, so they're building their own system, and I really want to give a chance to the folks who have their hands made. I just think it's important, I think saving a life is important all right, so let's go to the next michael. Do you see the next person yeah tony appearing? Is that a board member? I'm sorry? No sorry we're going to the public now from any other board members, so for the public, who want to ask we're going to give you a chance just keep in mind that you have other neighbors who are in line to speak and we still have agenda items and they will be coming back every month. So thank you. Tony go ahead thanks. I understand that the contract calls for the contractor to work out the details of the schedule and the sequencing and construct in conjunction with the ddc after the time of award, but I was wondering what kinds of constraints have been built into the contract like. Is there a cause for liquidated damages, or are there incentives for early completion thanks? I think I'm back on you. Oh, can you guys hear me? This is john again yeah. That's a great question. Yeah, the there are liquidated damages built into the contract they're both for substantial completion, meaning the end of the project, but there will also be associated with the completion of the three parks in the in the pa2 area and there are incentives built into the contract as well. Sorry, just I don't develop, but can you share those with the community or no well? The contract hasn't been. The notice to proceed hasn't been given. So if ddc wants to share that information, I you know they. Can I I'm a consultant that works for ddc, so I just, but you know the broad. The broad answer is yeah liquidated damages are always part of the contract and incentives are included in both the pa1 and da2 contracts and tony to your point, let's make sure we reflected on our notes because we're going to ask ddc- and I assume, there's some standard way- they do this on projects without those incentives and also penalties. So thank you tony for that question. At some point, christine, that's smile christine, I think, you're on the phone at the headstart. Six yeah, I un, muted myself, and all I really wanted to say on my comment- is that the ecology center has not renewed a license agreement with the parks department, because the license agreement that was offered really gives us pause. That parks is really excluding a future of the compost yard from east river park. I've also looked at some of the bid documents for construction of this park and I do not see a compost yard design in these bidded out contracts, so we're hoping to discuss this further in the september meeting, but I just wanted to make that brief comment right now. Thank you. Thank you christine tommy. Thank you. First, I wanna just for the information of everybody on this call. Somebody raised the issue of alienation before and just for everybody's information. Next thursday august 20th there'll be a hearing at state supreme court in a lawsuit entered by more than almost 100 members of the community and local organizations regarding the city's failure to sequel alienation, which was supported by every one of our state legislators. So that should be considered at some point during the timing. The other issue is the community advisory group established by the city council, meets separately from this group and meets in behind closed doors, which no other community board members except trevor or the public are barred from those meetings, and I want to know what the justification the city agencies have for, barring the public from receiving the information that the cag receives directly and third, I'm a resident of east river housing carolyn got it wrong. We were part of the euler process and, as far as we know, our board of directors have denied you access to our property. So I'm wondering what ddc or edc, or whoever is responsible for the combined sewer. Are you doing a workaround? Are you re-engineering or how are you handling that part of the project since a co-op has not approved or is going to deny you access to our property? Well, first, let me add something and just time to be very careful when you start to talk about committee board members, we really want us to be back and forth, but I am not the only member we were member on that. In fact, there are people who are on this conference called right now who are part of that by the community who are from cbc and cb6. So I just want to make sure that's clear and the kag is also established by manhattan borough president and along with the city council member as a direct result of indications. Yeah, I'm sorry did you hear the first part or no oh you're, sort of participating out all right just I was just telling tommy that to be very careful about you know getting into back and forth with people just to indicate that I'm not the only community board member on the cag. In fact, there are people who are on this call who are all macaque, including michael and other cb3 members and all other cd6 members. So but no other member of community board three can attend those meetings. It's not a community board cag. We did not initiate it and you can talk to your borough, president or city council member about that particular. But there are other community board members on that cat. Just to keep that clear, that's the only thing and I'm going to let the city officials answer the other questions if they want to. Thank you trevor. This is ophelia again so in terms of alienation us as ddc and the consultants. We abstain, because that's between city law and the mayor, the mayor's law, so we're not familiar with the lawsuit, and we can't comment on the lawsuit, that's between the lawyers and city law and they are determining. But, as you know, we move forward until we hear anything further we're going to keep moving forward with the project. Again, it's always up to the judge's ruling right, but until then we're going to keep moving with forward with the project and, as trevor said in terms of the kag so d, it was not the city or ddc to decide whether the cag meetings are closed doors. The cag was formed and it was asked by city, elected officials tdc just granted this, because this is what they wanted during the negotiations. Ddc is remains neutral in terms of the kag. We are like paying the bills so to speak, we're paying the kag, which is pratt center to facilitate the meetings. However, we don't decide who's on the cag, like trevor said that was decided by the elected officials and there are community board six and three members on it. There's also nycha, there's also non-profits, so the elected officials decided a well-rounded group to represent the community so that that's not on ddc side and in terms of making it public or private. That is up to the cag and the elected officials to decide whether they want to open it up into like a public forum or a public. Viewing ddc abstains whether or not yes or no making it public, so ddc again wants to remain neutral. When it comes to the kag, we will provide updates in the cag, we'll provide information about the project and we'll support them and also like pay the bills because they fall under us to you know manage, but in terms of like dictating what the cag does or who's on the cag or who can see it? That's not that's not us and michael. Can you drop a link if you could find it to the minutes from the cag meeting? I believe the first minutes are up. If you can't find it it's no big deal. I don't have it readily available, but I can see it it's on the escr website and if someone from the esr team can provide it to us even quicker, that would help. It would be helpful because I know the minutes are on there and you can see actually everything's on the website, so everything's that jack, the the slides of the construction phasing and the the minutes for the academy. Okay, thank you and I wanted to ask tommy. Were you talking about eastern housing, okay? Well, the city does plan on setting up a meeting with east river housing co-op board again to talk about options, so that should be forthcoming. Okay, thank you and I know that's a private discussion between you and the e-figure co-op. So once you have a resolution, you can come to us if we don't have a resolution. Come to us also michael who's. Next, well, a board member just raised their hand, so we'll go to her first k, webster hi. Just briefly off of that, you know just given the history here, I'm wondering if we can't ask either to have the community board members on the cag who are willing to say they are. I don't know any other way to offer the community access, and maybe it should be taken up with the rural president, but partly to move things along a little faster. But you know people are not feeling some people are not feeling a lot of trust and we're all about the transparency thing. So it's a suggestion do with it what you will, but, okay to your point, we spent two hours talking about making this a public meeting. It's not just you it's the actual, and it was two hours of talking about them. Well, they, even though we didn't talk about much else except for that, so even that is really good for people to know that you're not trying to be not transparent. So thank you so much. Okay. This is fake and on the website. Besides the minutes to the keg meeting, there's also the roster of all the members of the keg, so that's public. So if anyone wants to know who's part of the cag, it's on the website. Thank you. I think the issue that trevor is reinforced is that we're as a community board we tend to like the transparency thing. We may not like all the answers, but we like the transparency thing. So thank you. Thank you. We do too. Thank you. Next is I'm sorry if I'm going to say this wrong mary, callum tyrion, hi thanks yeah, that's good enough. Thanks for the presentation, I'm a lower east side resident and I access daily what would be phase one of the project, and I just wanted to reiterate the question already asked by or the demand already made of the community board member for the updated plans, it's impossible to it's not easy to find them online, and given that we have no other outdoor space anywhere that there are no recreational facilities. Everything's closed right now, because, in spite of you saying there is no effect of covet on this plan, there's a huge quality of life effect on profit on this plan. If this is starting in a month, it would be really helpful. I mean that's hyperbole, but we need the maps of what's going to happen, what access we're going to lose and make alternative plans within the best of our abilities. The other thing I would like to say is on your issues of community liaison and outreach and public information. I'd like to know whether the website that you promoted is also going to offer resources on alternatives and other options available to the community. In the absence of green space. Again in a pandemic situation, and also if these ccls, who to whom you referred, are actually from our community and then can provide information specific to the residents who are going to be struggling without access to the park or any park. Thank you, mary. I'm going to answer this or answer part of this before we escr team completes it up. Next is the mitigations that we talked about for various months about the open space loss. So if you stay tuned as soon as we get the last question, then we're going to have a whole another agenda on about what they plan to do, to make up the law space I'll leave the rest for the escr team, or I can answer the question about the website and the ccl. So the website that is currently up that many of you may have just gone to when the link was posted in the chat. We are working on revamping that website to be more construction friendly, so it will have information about upcoming impacts. For example, you know announcing closures, announcing interim options, for you know where people can identify park, space and recreation space during those closures. So we are working to put out as much information as we can about. You know, impacts to the public and alternate options, and, as I mentioned, we are looking at a community information center, which will also have a lot of that same information available to the public as far as the ccls, so the ccls will be able to provide very local information. They will be on site every day, working with you in your community. They know the project area. Well, they have a lot of experience on the lower east side and you know they will be there every day. You know they are often outside. They spend a good part of their day outside talking to community members. You know, meeting with people to you know, take a look at a certain area to identify an issue, so they are very familiar with the community and they will be able to address any concerns. Sorry trevor, I stepped away for a minute trevor. I think you're muted. We have one last question from diane before dan speaks I'd like for the escr team to prep for the next agenda item who's going to present that and diane I'm going to get to you in a second as well, make sure we're about ready if you can pull up that screen I'll, have the internal experience and start sharing the screen for the next item so diane, you want to go ahead. Actually someone else asked my question already and I couldn't unraise my hand so beautiful, so we're just going to wait for the next period, all right, if you want to begin. Yes thanks everyone, my name is alda chan. I am with new york city parks, and I am here today to provide a supplement to vdc's presentation about what's happening as part of the esr project. We were asked to come back to provide information on what's happening in terms of the neighborhood recreation improvements. These are slides that are very similar to what we've shown last fall and earlier this year, actually just before covet hit, and so we're happy to come back today to give folks a refresher provide an update on things that have changed so far in terms of progress we've made, but wanted to remind folks that what we're solving for here is the fact that construction will disrupt access. We recognize two parts of east river park, as well as some of the parks north of 14th street, and that people need a place to play and relax during construction. We know that's the case. We've been tasked with finding ways to provide recreational opportunities for folks during construction, and so we've really been trying to think creatively about how we can get that in place quickly. For folks who know what our typical capital process looks like, it usually takes anywhere from two to three years for us to design and build a project so again really trying to think creatively about things we can do so. Our agenda gonna go through an overview of the strategy, something that we've shared previously with this board. I want to remind folks touch a little bit on the issue of permits, specifically talk about some of the completed improvements, we've made and discuss upcoming improvements, and I do want to remind folks that one of the primary ways that we are aiming to address recreational need is by ensuring that the project will be phased. The ddc presentation spoke to us a little bit more broadly, but specifically for east river park. I pulled one of the images from one of ddc's earlier presentations, so I think faye had shared a link with the board and that's being disseminated, but this is a draft not final. I know the ddc will be coming back with more specific information, but the city has committed to ensuring that portions of the park will be accessible at all times during construction, so this is sort of the something to keep in mind as we think about access to open space. In addition, I wanted to share this overview map of additional physical improvements that we've committed to. This is there's a lot of information on this map. This map is going to be posted online. It's actually the same. App that we've shared previously earlier this year, there was a version that we shared at our open houses for folks who were there last summer. So this is still consistent wanted to remind folks that this is the big picture approach that we're taking. This includes everything from installing new turf sites, sports coding, existing existing parks and playgrounds, making spruce-ups painting installing movable solar field lighting and the like again not going to go through this in detail, but it will be accessible online. It actually is online already, but it is sort of buried in one of our existing presentations, and we can talk a little bit more about this if there are questions later moving specifically to permitting- because this was a really big topic of discussion- last fall. We wanted to address this because, as some of you know, east river park is home to a lot of athletic facilities. Switching back to the draft phasing plan that I had shown earlier, we anticipate that a portion of the park will be closed during the first phase of construction. The orange is what ddc anticipates will be offline during the first two or two and a half years or so, and with east river park coming offline and sometime in late fall. So probably sometime in november from a sports and field use perspective, we do anticipate that there will be little of any impact on our fall permitting season. This does mean that we are doing a lot of planning for spring because that's when we anticipate that a lot of the closures of the park will start impacting available fields, but big picture just given where we are with covid right now. I do want to flag that right now we do not have permitted team sports. We have been accepting applications for the fall and are waiting for a green light for team sports to be permitted from a health and safety perspective, so in east river park we know that softball and baseball are really popular uses. That's one of the main things that we hear a lot about the city, I'm going to remind folks, has committed to accommodating all local youth leagues within local sites. Once the east river park fields begin to close and again we're thinking that we'll probably hit sometime spring 2021., so we're aiming to address those shortages and to make sure that local use leagues can stay local because we know kids have a harder time. Moving around adult leagues, have access to transportation, so we're doing that first by making sure that we prioritize the fields that are open locally, go to these youth leagues. So if you look at this diagram here, the areas that are in orange again are anticipated to be closed first, but we do have fields three and four open and just north of here murphy brothers playground, which is in cv6 but has two t-ball fields, so we'll also be taking that into consideration. In addition, we are also installing new turf sites for permitting use, so we completed tanahi earlier this year. This is a photo of the turf site that was installed. There are three additional turf fields that are going to be installed. This fall that's robert moses, st barton and petersfield. These three fields are in cb6, so they are north of here. We recognize that. It's not exactly in cb3, we are having continued to have conversations with the permit holders about who has who has more flexibility in terms of transportation, which fields might be more appropriate. We are thinking about our fields from the whole borrow perspective and trying to rejigger usages throughout the borrower to accommodate the need to keep certain users local. So that's how we're planning on solving for that. In addition, we are adding additional capacity at some of our existing sites by installing movable solar field lights. We deployed some of these at roots in the fall of 2019 to see how they would work. We've purchased the lights they're awaiting deployment again right now we don't have permitted field play, so we have not installed those yet, but once we get the green light and have been told it's safe, we will be installing solar field lights at these six sites. In addition, last fall the city committed to make certain doe fields available and we're continuing to work with city hall and ue to make this a possibility for 2021.. I don't have too much of an update for you right now, because our dewey colleagues are very focused on working on the fall school reopenings, but this is something that we are continuing to work towards and wanted to remind folks that this is part of the suite of commitments that the city is working towards to mitigate some of the recreational impacts. Another thing that's still sort of in the mix in terms of a potential solution, if we can find the right group, is that we've had really good conversations with governors island. A lot of these pre-covered we'll have to think about. You know what the health and safety impacts look like and how the pandemic looks next spring, but they have offered access to the fields on governor's island and we had started to explore. You know which teams may be most appropriate in terms most comfortable with the transportation on the ferry and such we think that it can be part of the solution, and so that's something to keep in mind in terms of how we're solving for field play and permitting, and I'm going to include this slide that we shared previously, because we always get questions about well. How do I know who which fields are permitted and who has access to it? I wanted to remind folks that all of our information is posted online. There's a url here where you can get access to all of that. But again there is no permanent field play right now. People can drop in and use the fields, but we haven't been releasing permits because of coping moving on to some other types of mitigations and improvements we've been making. In addition to fields, we've also been thinking about ways that existing parks may see higher use and could be spruced up to be more welcoming and to take on additional use. So here's a list of completed improvements that we made last fall and some early this spring, I'm not going to go through each of these bullets, but a lot of these are sort of quick improvements that we try to make again avoiding a large capital project which could take years because we wanted these to be in place in time for use during escr construction. So I have a couple of examples and for folks who have seen this before. Please bear with me that this is, I guess, a refresher for folks who are less aware of it. I talked about tan he's turf previously, but we actually did quite extensive work throughout the park. We worked with d.o.t to repair the sidewalks. We repaved the basketball courts. We actually did sports coding on them as well. I don't think the photo captures this, but we did a pretty extensive face, lift on the site. Overall, I think it looks really great and again, I think it's pretty exciting that we're able to do that without going through a really extensive capital project at coleman. We did what we called sports coating, but it's actually some painting. It's like a more durable surfacing to spruce up our spray shower. We painted a comfort station helped. We found this sort of underutilized space, remove some of the fencing put in picnic tables and created a picnic area. So these are some of the things that we've been trying to do with our existing resources to just spruce up existing sites, al smith, recreation center, again refreshed the basketball courts and the handball courts repainted the exterior at brooch. We finished returfing the fields refreshed to handball court and we've done a lot of sports coding and painting at sites throughout the district. Here are some more examples and that sort of gives you a taste of some of the work that we've already completed and what we're anticipating completing a lot of this work will be going on this fall and will be completed by next spring, and so, in addition to painting and sports coating we're also putting in new field lights, installing new barbecue in some areas. So a lot of things to look forward to and hoping to get as much done as possible. This fall, but definitely aiming to have this in place by spring of 2021.. One of the things that we're really excited about is the improvements that are coming online at little flower playground and at laguardia bath house. The backhouse structure was removed as of late last year early this year and in addition, we had done a lot of repainting of the playground, structures, turf installation. We had started and had hoped to get done this spring but covet hit, but we're really excited that we've been able to get the work started again this summer, we're putting in the final touches, so that should be done pretty soon and we'll. Definitely let you know when that is ready and open to the public. We're also actually going to be installing some new barbecue grills there as well- and I think we're really excited about this, because this the footprint of the bath house was previously inaccessible, and so this will be new public open space that folks will have access to. This is not going to be a turf field, that's permitted, so this is for anyone who wants to sit around. You know throw with his frisbee exercise, whatever we're not going to be permitting games on this, so keep an eye out for that. In addition to what we're doing at some park sites, we are also doing some targeted improvements at nycha campuses, I'm going to be similar type of quick painting, sports coating, spruce ups. These are going to be done by spring of 2021 at reese, we're painting the amphitheater at wald, we're sports coding, basketball courts at campus, 2 we're doing improvements to some planters at stuart extension, both at essex and broome. We're going to be painting some of the courtyard areas and at al smith we're going to be sports coding. I think it's baseball and basketball so keep an eye out for that as well. We know that a lot of the folks who will be impacted by this project are nature residents, so we wanted to make sure that we did some work in open spaces that residents use outside of parks as well. We gave an update on neighborhood tree plantings last month, but for folks who missed that parks has committed to planting a thousand trees in the neighborhood prior to escort construction, starting or even being completed. We did about 320, I think it's 319 last fall. We had been planning on doing some this spring again covet hit, so we weren't able to miss that planting season, but we will be on track to do about 150 plantings, this fall and more to come in 2021. We are also going to be reconvening a meeting of the neighborhood tree planting task force, haley hicks who's, the project manager for that and who joined us last month, we'll be reaching out to folks looking to schedule a meeting sometime this september, quick update on green thumb, gardens one of the things we're also doing is making resources available to community gardens in good standing, providing materials equipment, anticipating that they may see higher usage when parts of east river park are closed. We are still in proceeding with this and working on the delivery for the materials for folks who are less aware about what this was. We shared actually like a menu of resources that gardens could pick from, and so we were in the process of procuring and getting those delivered to our warehouses when covet hit, and so we got most of them. I think there are a couple things like sidewalk message, boards and certain size benches that were impacted by procurement, that we won't be able to offer, but most of them will be delivered to gardens pretty soon we're just working on their delivery schedule, and then this is something that will from edc had addressed earlier, but that we wanted to make sure we talked about in the context of escr mitigations and access to open space is pier 42, where this will be new open space at what has been an industrial waterfront site for a long time. We know that this is a long-awaited amenity for the community members. There was a master plan that was done and completed in 2014, with a really grand vision of how to transform this space. As will mentioned, there was first the upland project. This is a snapshot that I pulled from one of edc's consultants, previous presentations, showing that the primarily passive open space that will be installed in what is currently an asphalt parking lot. It will include a playground there will be lawns and picnic areas, trolling pads, as well as a comfort station or restrooms, and part of this work was to demolish a shed, but it did not include access onto the deck itself. So, as part of the conversations are on esker- and I would definitely give credit to the community board members and to the council members, for you know, really pushing us to think creatively. We started to have conversations thinking about whether or not we could have access bring access to the deck itself and so late. Last year, earlier this year, right before covet hit, we came to the community board with an update on a plan to activate the pier 42 deck. This is the same plan that we showed then, and so this is really meant to provide access and activate what was previously meant, not meant or not, going to be publicly accessible by the end of the pier 42 project. The programming that you see here reflects what we heard throughout the esker design process as usages that people were really concerned about losing and that they wanted to make sure that we provided access to. So there is a soccer field. There are four tennis courts: four half basketball courts, adult fitness as well as picnic tables and we'll talk a little bit about that. The timelines for this we're really excited about this being able to move forward and that we were able to galvanize enough like interest and support as part of the conversations around this. In addition to everything that we're doing as part of esker, I did want to fly some of the parts capital projects in the district that will be completed soon, there's a list of what's coming 2020 and as well as 2021 and then the last thing I have is a sort of placeholder url for we've shared this. Previously, we are working to finalize and launch a website in coordination with ddc, so perks's website is going to be where you'll go when you're looking for any type of recreational experience or park, if you're looking for say a spray shower or looking for a playground. Looking for a ball field, we're going to have a site with a map and a drop down menu where you can choose, you know what type of activity you're looking for and it will highlight which nearby parks and open spaces you can go to enjoy whatever it is that you're looking for so that website we have the url here. It will let you know when that map is live, but we'll also link the ddc website, and the ddc website will also be linked to that so coming soon. I want to make sure you guys know. That is something that we are planning, and that is the end of my presentation. Thank you for that presentation. I know we have seen that in some format before, but considering the kind of a delay. It was nice to get a refresher, we're gonna, do the same as we've done before and go to committee members and michael I'm having a little difficulty seeing anyone other than caroline I'm just trying to get in and right now. Carolyn and david adams are the only two committee members. Well, let's start with david this time since he hasn't spoken yeah I was you can hear me yeah, david okay. I was wondering if there's any difference, whether it have remote schooling or not, would that affect the availability of parks they have to take that. I consideration that there have been a lot of public discussions about it. I don't know I can certainly follow up on that, but I don't have anything to report right now. Thank you. If you have something I believe we meet our september meeting may be on the same day. School starts or around that date. So if you could have that information by the next meeting it'd be helpful. Yeah we'll follow carolyn you're unneeded, yes, quick question: do you have a map for phase two? You only showed phase one yeah. I think that the one of the links that fey shared from ddc's full presentation should have sort of the full progression. I think udc's materials actually show you anticipated year by year. It may be slight, I'm not sure if it's fully accurate now, but all that information is part of dbc's slides that they shared previously. Okay. So far, it's not in the chat, it's not so the link that they put in the chat leads to this page, which is every presentation that they've made to a public meeting. However, parallel to your point, you know I perused this list. While alder was presenting- and I didn't- I don't see the meeting that you're referring to- I don't know what date it was or what what organization it was to, but this list seems to be in date order and as far as 2020 is confirmed there mike yeah, it's the cb3 parts committee meeting of january 16th. That presentation has the slides that carolyn is looking for. Okay, so calvin. That's the that's what you need to look for, then, I'm not going to open it up for the whole meeting, because I don't want to find it. That's what I wanted to know and then the pc deck is above that the one that shows january 21st where's his pdc final design vote that deck would have all the visuals as well. You know with the flood walls etc. Okay, so is the link to the site being shared the link. The link to this page was already shared in the chat. I will share it again. I cannot share the link directly to those slides but I'll share the link to this page again. Okay, thank you, michael. Do you see any more committee members? No sir, just diane, okay, I'm gonna have one question from diane: I'm going to ask a few diane hi alda, you talked about ball fields and you know other sorts of recreation areas, but there's no update on the greenway. So you know, closing sections of park is obviously gonna interrupt. You know continuous access to the greenway, and I know that in the agreement that the city signed with our local elected officials, there was a promise to do some study on a bikeway, and we have also heard a lot of interest from runners asking where their runners, walkers etc are going to go. When the greenway is partially closed and I believe it's going to be completely closed one summer. I think that's something that gdc mentioned in the fall. So do you have any updates on what we can expect as an alternative to the greenway for pedestrians, runners and bikers. I don't have an update for you today. I think we'll make sure that dot or someone from duty is available to talk more broadly about the thinking around this, and I they were, I believe, working on a study to look at one of the avenues and I think they will probably be prepared to share some information on where that study is. So. I will try to make sure that someone's here next month, to provide more information on that. But that's right, we haven't. We haven't addressed the greenway in a while. So thanks for bringing that up great, thank you because I'm actually on the greenway right now- and there are a lot of people out here. So I think this is going to be a big public interest. Thank you, diane, and I agree we kind of let that one sort of fall off the radar, but I'm going to ask for it to be discussed at the september meeting trevor. Can I ask a somewhat selfish question so all that in previous presentations there was mitigations planned for corleers, and I didn't see that on this round and I'm wondering why that is. I know that the previous mitigations were painting of our playground and we just painted our playground two years ago, so it really doesn't need repainting, but we've also been rejected twice now for capital funding, because the elected official we went to was told by steve simon at parks that oh, that will be taken care of by escr myself. There are a couple slides that I took out from previous presentations for like additional painting work. We've done just because I thought it might be a little too repetitive, but remind if I can follow up with you on what additional mitigations that those may have been. I'm sorry, it's been it's been a long couple months and I do recall some of our more recent conversations, like maybe our last meeting, where there were there was interest in things like picnic tables, so those are still things that are on our list. You know are those are things that we wanted to get done through our in-house resources and staff we're slowly getting around to doing a lot of that work, this fall and this summer, but with covet a lot of our internal resources have been stretched. Quite thin hasn't helped that we had a storm to deal with recently. But yes, look. Let's follow up on the additional things I there are some things I remember, but I want to make sure that I have a full list of what we may have discussed previously. All right. Thank you and I'm just going to add a few comments before we move on to the next gen item. This has been a topic, not nothing new, but I just want to make sure we're prioritizing local use for the permits and, if that's still your priority. Yes, we are prioritizing local use, but, like particularly local youth, I think we're going to start with local use as the top tier and then sort of move from there. If we can accommodate all the local use in the local sites, then- and we have additional capacity, then we'll start thinking about things or user groups aside from adults. So we are now looking at probably impacts in the spring and so we're still trying to figure out whether we're going to have a fall permitting season. But our permitting folks had started talking to permit users as of last fall. You know we kind of have a good idea of who, which groups like which types of fields or what hours and where they can go, and you know who's open to travel and who isn't so. We still have all those in mind. I know that we in the past we've been asked to provide like a schedule of what the permitting looks like. It is a little premature for us right now, but these are things that we have it in mind and that continues to be how we aim to prioritize for the spring. Thank you and just two more questions. Pier 42, the upland portion, not the deck, is also federally funded and will was on earlier from edc to say that this project will go forward. The community spent many years of advocating, maybe even decades, advocating for this because it's a brand new park I just want to recon, or have you reaffirmed that this is fully funded for p42 in the uptown portion? Yes, it is fully funded and one of the things that you there are a lot of things in the slides, but a lot of it did not talk about just open space for people to use. It was a lot about sports and permitting fields in our next topic. We'll actually talk about pier 35, which has been really overrun by people. It's become the number two spot in the city for photographs. I don't know how that happened, but we just don't have as many and I know you can understand this. The mate and staff has been really hit hard, but if, in the next presentation you can talk about what we're gonna do or what parks is planning just in terms of open space, mitigations that are not sports related just places for people to go and relax or to sit around, I know some of the turf field. Conversions will allow that, but they don't have seating. So if you could just talk about that at the next meeting- and we made comments to the pier 42 intern deck on, I believe we visited at least one residential building and you've come to cb3, and we just like to hear the status of those comments. One of the things we I remember talking about was possibly some barbecue areas in in a legal place. We seem to have a big problem on the waterfront with that and lots of fires underneath the fdr, which is really problematic, but I think this may be an opportunity to put some that are far enough away from housing and it's what people have asked for. So if we could just talk about the comments that have people have made before covertatus, certainly so I we can come back and focus a little bit more on passive spaces. Recreationally. More broadly, I think for pier 42. I didn't focus on this, but the upland portion is going to be more of a passive meant to be a more passive quiet space. There will be a playground, but the rest of it is meant to be more strolling lawns and quieter lawn areas for the pier 42 deck. We unfortunately are not going to be, including barbecue. Underneath that shed structure, we are including picnic tables, but we are. We are not including barbecue in this particular area. We are trying to incorporate barbecue in some of the other improvements at existing parks that we're doing, which will be actually coming online sooner. So, in addition to a little flower playground, we're also going to be putting some in dry dock as well, but not pure 42. I'm trying to remind remember there was some discussion about adult fitness, so I think the adult fitness at this site is meant to be more for adults. I'm trying to remember what additional comments there may have been if there are ones that come to mind specifically trevor. Let me know, if not I'm happy to follow up in the september meeting on where things stand sure and I just want to make sure we focus on. As I remember, there's a slide- that's not in this deck, so I actually had pier 35 as a place for people to go for open space. People apparently took that slide to heart and hundreds of people using that park, even right now, which it was not designed to handle that type of capacity. So just want to keep that in mind trevor sorry. We have a hand up from somebody on the phone that wants to ask a question sure and that's going to be the last question you want to identify yourself, michael. If you want to zero five nine, the last three digits go ahead. Please identify yourself yeah hi good evening. This is patricia from council member margaret chin's office. I just have a couple of quick questions: laguardia bathhouse, you mentioned that you were installing the turf. Is there an installation date for finishing that installation and shirt park extension you mentioned courtyard courtyard painting. Will that be at both buildings and again? Is there a target date for that, so for laguardia's turf? We are really close. I think we're just finishing up the details. I don't have a date for you right now, because I think we also want to get the barbecues in before we open that space, but we'll definitely be in touch with your office when we anticipate when we actually have a date and we'll let the community board know as well, but we it is wrapping up. I think for most folks who are walking by you can see that a lot of that turf is done now. I think we had some detailing and some additional scenes that were still not finished as of last week, but we'll keep you posted on that in terms of seward. There will be painting at the courtyards at both I'm trying to remember this site now at both essex and broom. Yes, it will be. I think it's going to be the sports coating type quality painting, so it's a little thicker and more durable and yes, both of those sites and the timeline is targeted for having that work done next spring. Okay, thank you and thank you once again for providing that update. We hope to see. Well, we will see you next month to provide more updates on not only the escr project itself, but also intern recreation. So thank you very much for those who are following this meeting we're about to move for a mexican island which is a discussion about pier 35., michael. I know I have one speaker which I did not wasn't able to but speak. So I'm gonna, let him speak. I know he wants to speak about pier 35 ishmael. If you want to raise your hand, so michael can identify okay go ahead, ishmael you're on a two-minute timer by the way how's it going trevor hello, everyone. My name is ishmael alvarado, I'm a resident here at 82, rutgers and two bridges I actually face. My window faces the park, so I get to see it every day daily and day time and night and I participate in the workouts there, and I bring my kids and my wife. We go out there and we socialize there as well. It has become a nightmare every night watching like the park, basically bombarded with lots of people barbecuing drinking partying to like three four in the morning and mostly on the weekends, but every night it's there's a lot of people there. So the only time I really see security or parks. People is basically during the normal working hours, but you know they should go there to try to keep the place clean because lately we've been having graffiti and when I go there with my kids. There's lots of like drug paraphernalia or empty bottles or not lately, but there was a lot of fireworks there. Actually, some of the fireworks hit my window and put little cracks in my window, but you know they just should do something on keeping the park a little more cleaner, a little more secure, adding, definitely adding more garbage cans with the amount of people coming there. I don't think we have enough receptacles to maintain the garbage. That's coming there, especially in the evening time when it seems like a lot of people, seem to gather there, whether it's underneath the fdr or on pier 35 itself. So I just wanted to give you my input on that. It's a beautiful part I enjoy it. I enjoy the things that the friends of pier 35 do there. We enjoy the space, it's just that it's been getting like a little bit like the wild west. There, especially like in the evening time when it gets dark and on the weekends it gets really packed with lots of people there. I mean there's dozens of barbecues going on at the same time and I know they're not supposed to barbecue and but I don't see anyone really enforcing it, so I just wanted to share that as a resident of the two bridges, neighborhood and downtown area, and that's my time. Thank you all right. Thank you, ishmael. So the next agenda item. We don't have a set resolution for this, but we have talked about it in detail and I'm going to apologize because I'm part of that group and, to a certain extent I've sort of neglected that area. I know we've met with public officials about improvements for this era, but the main thing is: it's really been security and making a safe place for families, which is not it's no longer is especially at night. It is a park, although it's a sort of hybrid area as edc, actually controls the land parks as a maintenance partner and also provides securities, but it's sort of left out of the loop of being maintained properly, although I think things are going to change just for reference. There were 37 911 calls over the last few months. Three bodies found in the east river, along pier 35 and pier 36. They did not make the news because it wasn't on the hudson river side and 276 311 calls having to do with noise, fireworks or other complaints within three months in that particular area. So it's been extremely challenging. There's also both here, that's behind there. The place has been destroyed and parks is well aware of the damage that it has caused over the last few months of where it's completely changed. There are, in addition to 82 records, this also lines in one and lands in two which face that area. The residents have made dozens, if not hundreds, of calls to 311 about this particular space. The place every morning is full of garbage, and I understand parks can only do so much to clean up, but it's really become a problem. Ironically, it's next to the department of sanitation, but there's only two garbage cans on the entire pier at the end of the garbage, and when you have an overflow of garbage, you get rats. So we have a big rat problem to the extent that the brand new sprinkler system that was installed last year, which we enjoyed because we didn't have to water, the plants ourselves, was eaten by rats within a few months and now they're going to repair it and there's multiple rat barrels, because every morning people throw raw garbage on the ground. I've lost quite a few volunteers who were willing to clean the park, but when it's a daily thing, every single day, people basically give up so we're looking to do. We've talked about this. Before I mean initially, this skateboard is just people destroying it, but we're looking for some sort of a resolution to keep this place safe for families and available for the seniors who also like to use it because they've also been kicked out of many areas and if you think about the limited space for seniors, because this is less than a half an acre. This is a quiet place. There was a quiet place and they are routinely kicked out every single evening by folks who take over space. There is a closure time for this park. However, it's difficult to enforce because there are no gates, it's an open space. Last year, when we had the party folks leaving out of there, the police department closed the back of it to prevent people from exiting the vote to going towards pier 35 and causing damage that way, things have sort of changed with the police department. So it's been a bit challenging to close, but we're looking to do is actually close. The park, based on this time. That stated right now, there's a sign that says the park closes at midnight extremely difficult to enforce, but we want to make sure that we can have a closer time at midnight, at least to so. We don't have giant 400, plus people in the park, with djs at four o'clock in the morning, basically affecting all the residents that are all either low or moderate income along this park area. The other issue, especially when the party boasts leave, is there are no bathrooms at all in the area. So when you have parties at two and three o'clock in the morning, people are drinking, they put a strain on not only the park, they think they're fertilizing the plants but they're. Not anyone who does park work understands that they're not fertilizing the plant. If you've ever volunteered to clean up a park, you know what you're gonna find, especially when hundreds of people every single weekend come there to party. It's not only become a site for people to take pictures, but for some reason it's become a place for people to have parties any given night. Their cars lined up triple double parked along south street. I'm not going to say what happens, but you can just take use your imagination and if there are a lot of people in the party area and cars are lining up, there's activity going on, there's a stress in the police department. We understand that so we're just trying to find solutions for that with there being no bathrooms. The buildings also have a strain because people really need to go to the bathroom, so they knock on residential buildings. Dozens of people knock on buildings. Saying can we use your bathroom and when the when the security guard says no, they will use any planting area that you they can find. So the solution that we've come up in various meetings is just try to enforce the closure time to the best we can. This will at least eliminate the parties that go on there, especially on the weekends until three or four o'clock in the morning. So in terms of writing a resolution that you were not able to do beforehand, the only thing that parks edc and the police department other than putting up multiple signs is to have a closure time. That's actually stated on the on one of the beams underneath the park and to add appropriate signage identifying the park because it's not identified when you call 3-1-1 it's not listed as a park. Yet we've been anyone who knows about getting stuff on three-in-one. It knows it takes a lot of time, we're still working on it, but it's still an issue, but we think this will alleviate a lot of the open drug use, a lot of the open alcohol use and a lot. To be honest, a lot of the open drug sales that happen in this park at night. So what I'm asking for is basically the bullet point of we'd like to have parks enforce the closure time at midnight. We've talked about other things like adding big bellies, but sanitation promised us. They have not been delivered so there's only two garbage cans in the entire area and to figure out a way to get some portable bathrooms in the area so that people don't review themselves all over the new planting base. So I'm going to ask the community members if they have anything additional, because those are the only bullet points. I have it's very simple, but I don't want to continue on unless I hear I want to hear from some committee members, so, okay, yes, I'm very familiar with open parks, and all of that I'm just wondering. If you I mean it seems to me that it needs pep to make a commitment to patrolling, because if you have portable bathrooms it can present its own difficulties. So I think yeah it's a it's a tough thing, but I would just ask for pet patrols. I think what yeah what we learned? It was two officers being below 59, which I'm sure you're aware of, and they typically stop at six david agreed on some evenings to patrol till 10, but the bulk of the complaints and what we endure is later than that it happens in the overnight hours. We many of us who live in the building, wake up to three o'clock in the morning and there's a bunch of people down there so and then that's beyond pat and there's been a discussion of whether it should be the police or pep or who was jurisdiction. I agree with you in bathrooms and k I'd like to talk to you offline about what we can do about bathrooms, because I don't know the solution for that. I hear what you're saying and I can take that out of it. I was just trying to think of a solution. No, I don't I hear you, but maybe michael you might have yeah. I can't raise my hand so I'll just I'll just interject I mean we, you know we got parks to put a porta potty into court leaders. You know a couple years ago because our comfort station is under construction and prior to that, has been closed for decades and it was great for a little while. But you know if it's not maintained and not emptied regularly, that's an issue, but then we started having an issue with vandalism- and you know, kids get bored and the easiest thing for them to do is tip over a porta, potty and start jumping all over it. Then we had two porta-potties in a row burnt to the ground by an arsonist, since they melted to the ground. So then parks decided they, wouldn't they weren't putting a porta potty back in the park, at least until a further date, when they can be sure that it might be safe or secure fire marshal. We think caught the arsonist, but we're not 100 sure for right. Now the only place to go to the bathroom in our park is a quarter party that is behind the locked fence. That's meant for the construction workers who are doing the two capital projects thanks, michael thanks for nothing, I'm just wondering if, even in the resolution we can say meet with tenants, etc and come up with a solution. You know even those barriers with a sign that says, if you cross this, you are trespassing. I mean I think the residents have it's a public park, but the residents have the right to sleep and not be used as a latrine and not be harassed to use their bathrooms, but yeah carolyn, you're, muted, carolyn. I unmuted myself. Okay, can you hear me all right? We've gone through things like that with conference square park and also with community gardens, and what I've been told by the police in regards to the plaza is that we had to have signage posted okay, and if I don't know, the determination is to whether or not your area is you're, saying it's not listed as a part there's a park in it, but it's not listed on when you call 3-1-1, you have to put an approximate address which sort of skews through the data 301. When I pulled it, I actually just went to the open data website and if anyone has any skill with that site, let me know and just physically pull the calls that were nearby and that's how I got to 276., but we are working on getting signs. Yes, we are working on getting signs, that's what I was told in order to get police to respond, I mean we've had everything from people knock down fences and I relate to the people that used to put the diapers and you know, pee on the plants I've been through, that it's not a lot of fun and also that, when neighbors are upset because of the noise that eliminates when people don't respect their neighbors, but at any rate, I think, if could you put in the resolution about the signage, because that's one thing that seems to resonate with the police and with the path. I wonder I wonder trevor if we could have maybe even a some kind of a meeting with coalitions around parks to talk to the police in general, because I think the dead body part really caught my attention and you know it's not just vandalism, it's. If there's when we had a murder in our park, I felt like that requires a little more rigorous response. So to be right to be fair, the police have been very proactive. It's just that the environment that we now in that we're now in is a little different than recovered, so it has been difficult for any type of enforcement. We also have the problem with people getting drunk and they get they jump the gate or sometimes the gate is open to the water and then they fall in and then we all hear the helicopters and you're looking for a body a lot of times. They find it. Sometimes they don't we're just trying to prevent. We want to get into a preventive mode living here, because we've seen what happens- and we just don't want certain things to happen, but I'm going to give some credit to pepin police, because they've been proactive, they've asked us to have to write a resolution to give them a little more power to enforce stuff. That's the reason why I'm doing this at this point I know susan, his own has a question and I'm doing a lot of talking. So susan you're, on your hand, is raised and your mic is unmuted. Okay, thank you. I just thought it might be useful for people to know that there has been a meeting with the community board the council office and all the agencies, and- and you know, trevor gave a blow-by-blow of what's been going on. So the things some of these things that can be done, like the signage they're already in the process of doing, I think gates, which we talked about, if it's possible, will make a big difference and the signage for the signage for closing time. Actually, as trevor mentioned, came out of the meeting they want. They want this. A resolution from us to help have an earlier closing time that can be enforced. That's it oh, okay! So trevor we got an earlier closing time or are we talking about enforcing their current closing time? I thought there was a closing time already. There is a closing time and, to be honest, I forgot whether it says 11 or 12 on the sign. That's 33 feet up on the fdr column, so we're just trying to they want a resolution at a particular time. I thought midnight was fair. I think 11 is a little early, but I mean that could change, but I think midnight is fair, allows for most residents to use the park, we're just trying to make it a safety issue so that we can get the park close just from 12 to six at night and open it up at six, where the runners and the bikers and exercisers can still use it, and the sign is already posted, we're just trying really trying to give the police a little bit more enforcement, the gates that tom can square locked at midnight and maryland the problem they gave us was who's going to lock and unlock that's what they said was we. The ninth precinct came and locked the gates at tompkins square park at midnight, the years because we had they had to. Are they still doing it? I don't think we're doing it now, but they did it for quite a few years and who opened it in the morning parks. I think. Okay, they opened it about six in the morning. Okay, I see patricia sand, patricia you're unneeded, I mean you're unneeded now patricia. Thank you. According to my notes, because I was also at the meeting- there was an issue with signage: all the signing just posted there does say midnight, but it's a very old sign. According to ralph mussolino signage can only be made for park closing at 11 or park closing at one. So that was the issue that they were hoping. Cb3 would decide at this meeting. You're absolutely correct, and thank you for clarifying that I just thought 11, the official closing times are 11 or one, even though on the post it says twelve, so they needed a resolution from us to say twelve. That's the reason why we're talking about this, I just think eleven is a little early and one's a little too late. So it already says twelve. We can get a resolution saying 12. right susan, I guess that's irrelevant. I thought we were going to vote for le 11, but I'm I must be remembered incorrectly and as far as closing the gates and that kind of thing they the parks, has staff that closes all the big parks they didn't have the staff. That was the issue to do an additional thing. Like pier 35 and trying to get that done was the problem right and that will be part of the bullet point that we right about finding a way to actually physically close to park where they're in the falls park, staff or police last year. Because of all the party votes, the seventh precinct just did it by default. They closed the back of it because there were obviously five six hundred people exiting the boat all drunk going through the neighborhood going to gouverneer and planet mines in one also, can we remember this the next time we talk about parks, open borders, parks, open borders or lowering offenses, let's just get our hand up again from margarine's office. Sure hi am, I still am I unmuted? Yes, oh great, okay, so the issue with the gate, pier 35, has no gates and it's designed for an open as an open park, but at the very back where it continues to that part of the pier behind the sanitation building. There is a gate and that's where the closing and opening of that gate corresponds to the dock master and the dock master is also supposed to close the docking gate. So the question was: where was the dock master all this time? According to our first meeting, the dock master, you know. Well, nobody was there because of covet. So the first meeting, the doc master new york city doc, said okay. Well, when party boats come back, we're going to there's going to be more etcetera. So the big question here is: can someone maybe bash security from basketball city help to assist? You know during the interim and close the back gate, because there is a great big giant back gate to close to close, pier 35 and the rest of it yeah we're going to ask for that in the resolution and that's what we're going to focus on, because it is okay, it's 9 15 and I think, we've expressed all of our concerns. I just want to go to the next part of yeah and locking walking the park. Parks has a problem because they don't have staff with the trains stopping service at 11 o'clock park staff has to return home, so their parks has no one to close the park. That's another issue they can open, but they can't quote, and the seventh initially said they agreed to it and would do it and then he sort of backtracked and said it would be difficult based on manpower but we're. So what I'm hearing I'm reluctant to say after hearing michael's story about bathrooms that- and this is for our committee members to listen, because this is what we're going to bullet point, that parks and this language will be cleaned up work with community members and elected officials. I'm going slow ryan. I hope you're capturing this. No, I can't hear you ryan sorry. I got. I almost drifted off there and, as you know, we're going to clean this up, we're just trying to get bullet points so that the committee members can sort of listen and we're going to vote on this, but park parks works with community members and elected officials to find a way to physically close the park at both entrances. This is the back of pier 36 in the front of pier 35.. The police had asked for a closing time and they needed because it's beyond 11 and it's before one so we're asking for a closing time of midnight, which is a bit late, but I think it's fair, since the official closing time is eleven but we're asking for a closing time at midnight and it parks work with the I'm just going to say community members to figure a way to get bathrooms, and this isn't the best language. Because michael has scared me tremendously, definitely to add to the to add bathrooms to either the pier 35 cert site or someplace nearby trevor. What I would I mean, we probably can't get this specific in the resolution, but I think I think that area is big enough, that you might want to request those trailer bathrooms that actually lock before covet. We did have some commitment from elected officials about providing some of that, but nobody has any money. So I'm looking for cheap and easy quick solutions- port-a-potties are pretty cheap. Closing times are pretty easy right here. I'd love to see that, just for everyone's knowledge, there was a bathroom plan for that area along the esplanade and got cut from the packing street development portion, which we were very upset about. But there was the whole area was planned to have a bathroom, but once you take that out, then everything sort of messes up- and I I'm drawing a blank season- was there anything else that they were asking for trash cans, trash cans, oh yeah. That would help I'm sorry. Can you hear me? Yes, okay, I think the main things I remembered were the gates and the closing time. Yeah start off the result, with kind of the description of everything you said was going on. Okay and the other grind to your point, is that the department of sanitation must they promised us the big bellies trash cans, but they haven't delivered them. So we just want to make sure that they get those big values in as soon as possible. Then you want to ask direct parks to work with sanitation. Our direct parks work with sanitation, too, is basically going to parks, got it direct parks to work with sanitation to get the big bellies installed as soon as possible. We're also asking for parks to increase their rat mitigation program, so they don't have to repair a very expensive sprinkler system that got eaten through in less than three months. So is this reso going to parks, edc and nypd? Yes, did you want to add something susan? I just wanted to confirm where you wanted yeah and man yeah nypd and maybe even the part of pet police too. I don't know if we want to ask for an extension of ours. I think they're a bit strained at the moment, but and now so that's it. Does anyone have any questions or comments or suggestions? Anyone have a better way to get a bathroom in the park, yeah without it being burned or vandalized or tipped over or tipped over with someone in it and it's locked, zip tie. I know it's late, a scarecrow concept, so committee members we're gonna. Do it this way, ryan based on those bullet points, if you wanna do a vote and on michael unmute as we go along, so you want to call on the committee members ryan. Yes, I'm sorry we're voting on the bullet points regarding pier 35, which we just talked about, go ahead. We need a motion. Someone want to motion to it. Okay, I heard suit motion and so michael seconded caroline. My motion go ahead. Brian wait! A minute! Excuse me: what's the motion we're voting on the resolution that trevor just basically narrated to us about cop spot? Okay, hey trevor holland? Yes, hey webster, yes, david adams, yes you're on altman, yes, carlin chan, yes, ryan, gillum, yes, valentina jones! Yes, michael mourinho, yes, carolyn ratcliffe! Yes, robin chatel, josephine velez, yes, troy velez! He was just on, but I believe he dropped off. Somehow don't ask for him again troy, because I did just see him he's not showing up on the connection on the attendee list. It looked like he was at work based on how he's dressed, so he might have had to drop off for some reason: okay, [Music]. Okay, what ryan is that it? That's it all right! Thank you. We still have one item and once again, if folks want to stay on to talk about different things, that can this shouldn't be a long discussion for committee members, michael. If you want to screen share, I think you did you get that, but do you want to edit it as we talk about it, or should I be doing that or do you want ryan to do that ryan? Are you able to edit ask, or do you want michael to do it go ahead? I can listen and edit that's what you're saying like yeah I mean if you want to edit it on your side. I mean I'm sharing the screen, so people won't see the edits unless you share your screen. I already I does anyone make it bigger. It's very small. On my screen, just keep in mind that we've discussed this at length for the past three meetings, we're just making some minor changes based on comments, so this shouldn't be a long discussion, we're not going to revisit the entire document, just a couple of issues that were raised at our last meeting with regards to this. Yes, we're just trying to figure out who's going to edit, because we have to track changes on this. Well, you know I'm like I said I hope all there may be. Some word changes, but you know I hope everything's been incorporated. Yes, oh okay, so if you want to kind of scroll, what I did is I everything that was approved last time was accepted and cleaned up. So when you go into the parks building, we should look at that. So hey there. I just go back up a little bit to get that paragraph above. Can you just go up a little bit, so we have that paragraph above okay, so it has said, needs rewording, turn into an ass. So I just reworded that, based on the comments from last meeting about renovating and reopening for community use base, and so that has been changed and then, if we look at the bullet points, this is still has thing. So you know would like confirmation from the that this is all correct for sdr. Based on the comments from last time, we just changed this because we're asking all of these to be open for community use, so we're just kind of describing how they're used now so stanton street building are used by park. Workers only restrooms are open to the public hester street used by parks workers. I believe the actions and the restrooms are open right is that right, kate? Yes, there are restrooms open to the public and hustlers. I should add so if you could add after sdr used by park workers, if you just put restrooms there I'll remember to update that sorry that wasn't clear to me that put it in where it says: huster street building used by parks workers. Yes, that's fine I'll, remember that'll remind us to update that allen. Street mall we're saying we were alone. Susan hold on one second ryan. Was that clear? She didn't need me to add anything that it already put in restrooms. That was fine, okay, so for the next one allen street mall, the rfp is going to supposed to be released next month. So we just thought we should check back after the rfp is released to check that wording. Seward park house was updated per the comments from last month of laguardia house's laguardia house. Playground building was updated for the comments from last month, but we also want to check it in october to make sure the demolition was complete and then tompkins square is updated, and that was confirmed at a budget meeting. We had with parks. So any questions on that section. Maybe we can scroll, then we can scroll down this. None of this was changed, so keep going, keep going. None of this has changed. The recreational use has not changed the rodents. I'm sorry. I didn't take out the that's no change from last month. When we get down to maintenance, you can keep going the wireless we changed last month. This isn't this, isn't the latest one? This doesn't show my last comments. This is the one you sent me at the end of the day today. I know I know that it's didn't save. It didn't save my comments, all right, if you hold on just a second, you want me to bring up the. Is it the text that I sent you last night that you lost well, I used that, but I just threw in some if you just hold on a second, let me let me see if I can find it. Okay, let me just read it now: you better go ahead and read what you put in. I don't know why I didn't say, michael all, right, let me find it hold on one second come on. You want me to look for it. No, I got it. I just found it. Okay, I'm just gonna copy it and put it in the word document, and then we had a lot of trouble going back and forth between our google document and the word document and that's what the problem was almost there. So I just have too many windows open. So this is what I wrote and sent last night which susan it sounds like you made some edits to you, which is fine, because this wasn't my best work, so I can read it. You want me to read it it's up to you. We can see it. We don't think we need to read it, but I think what susan was mentioning is that she may add to this yeah I just added to it. I got new statistics from the furman center, so I just added to it that parks are used by the seniors and youth in our district, and I put in the percentage of youth and seniors in cb3 living below poverty, and I think, with something like 39 percent and 49 [Music]. So does anyone have any comments about this paragraph for what season just verbally added uncle? Michael, let's move on, I don't think there are any other additions. Everything else was finalized before the last meeting. It's just showing and the libraries is all updated. I don't see anything here on the compost we didn't. We never put it in and I sent everybody an email. We there was two things we were going to put composting in santa sanitation if it was necessary, but then we found out that the funding is restored for starting in january, and this is for a year susan. That's not what I understand from christine about the compost pile and I think we have a very fundamental disagreement that this doesn't belong in parks, because I think that's what parks is trying to say that parks are not working parks, and this has been here for how many decades and it's I think I think christine- has to have that if I'm correct trevor correct me, if I'm wrong christine asked to have this put on the agenda for september and voted as a separate resolution. Yes, but there are two issues here and one is bringing up and I think that's been lost a bit is that what you just said is that it's no longer a district need because there's funding for it as to whether it goes with parks or sanitation. There's a whole other question, but it's no longer a district need. Is that the correct understanding, yeah in terms of funding? That's susan's understanding that you know what I got from christine is that was the funding to start back up in january, which program we got 2.86 mill restored to do a community based composting fiscal year, 21 and department of sanitation has promised to bring back 50 drop-off locations, I'm getting from her that and I think it's bears on the composting staying remaining in east river park or having a sighting. If it's in, I know, there's another site being considered. Perhaps, but it's about the fundamental issues like can. We have compost in our parks, especially one that it should essentially be grandfathered, and I think this there's a whole section of people who lost their. You know desire to have the park not be done at all or done differently, and this is the one thing that keeps sticking and I don't know why it can't go into our district needs statement and I sent something to susan with footnotes of the yin yang. It's probably too long, but it's it costs like nothing to put it in our district needs statement. I hear kate and that's why I made it a separate agenda, because sometimes you discuss it so that it would still go into our district needs statement. This is we're trying to get this done. It could possibly go in there, but just for technical purposes, because the years as I've we've been doing this, I'm still a little foggy of district needs. Susan, you guys are going to do what you want. I'm just saying that thing about it being specifically on the park is specifically what I was asked to put on the agenda for next month. Okay have a discussion that it would be possible to put it in our district needs statement, because that's the statement that- and I can go into a lot of things about that- that's my question. I'm happy not to discuss it tonight because it's late, but I raised this a long time ago and okay, I hear you and the answer is yes. This is september. That's all it's also 9 38 and we're going to say yesterday yeah we took time on other things. So if we want to make our meeting shorter, then we should time every section, but we don't, and it is what we have to do so. As long as I agree, I'm good september, I have a we're going to slot a whole bunch of time just to talk about that, including adding it to this technique. That being said, we've gone through the entire document. I don't think there's nothing else to discuss our agenda. It's a bit late. We will meet in september talk about this for attendance to enjoy the meeting ryan. If you want to take attendance and someone either has a bird or a broken alarm, I can hear in the background, no, I think, there's a fire somewhere in my neighborhood, actually I'll mute until it's my turn. So this is a vote to adjourn before you do that. Do you mind a grammar correction on your document? Very quick, you know where you're talking when you talk about equipment, you see you use the word it. You really want to use the word they. Thank you. Thank you, louis ryan. If you could make a note about it versus today, I have making a motion to adjourn to some second nap. Let's take a ten minutes. Second one. Second, so sorry who was the second david adams? Yes, ryan, gillum? Yes, valentina jones, yes, michael moreno, carolyn, ratcliffe, yes, robin chatel, josephine velez, yes, troy villas; okay, we're done all right! That being said, everyone have a good night, not everyone. I didn't hear myself called yeah good night, everybody marlon you're, good. Okay, thanks.
