I know there's others in the public who I've been asking about a potential agenda item for next month and wanted to speak about it for two minutes.
There will be two resolutions put forth, but first we are talking about these hundred miles of streets program, that's being implemented as a result of this unprecedented time and pandemic I believe there are representatives of Councilwoman, Carlino Rivera's office that are here, I, don't know who will be the one actually speaking to us, but you will have two minutes to start to explain to us the push behind this program and the pilot and anything that you can offer and I will start with whoever's.
A lot of the need for it came out of the conversation she was having with doctors and medical administrators as chair of the hospital's committee, people who are really concerned about the lack of social distance, and we are seen on our city streets over the last month.
At that hearing, the department transportation was a question by council owner of era, speaker Johnson, another number of other members of the City Council about the concerns that Mayor DeBlasio, and yet he had raised previously about implementing an open streets program, Council under I.
You know, right now there have been about round 10 miles, roughly of me a little bit more than 10 miles of streets that have been opened.
If you go to the New York City Department of Transportation website, there is a link on their website on how to fill out the survey suggesting streets and hours of operations in the capacity they can provide and I don't want to get too much into that kind of operational.
I think they'll probably have more specifics about that kind of aspect of the program, but getting to kind of, like the last major points that I wanted to add on what kind of streets that the Councilwoman envisions this program in going forward with and how we are going to continue working as a council office with the ochi because do T are the experts when it comes to having the traffic engineers and the surveyors and Road people who can manage and can implement these things and bring the supplies that are needed.
That's doing a great job on this that you know around kind of the visioning, because we believe the main thing this part needs to do, and we hope this program will do in the days and weeks to come, because we do think that you know we're expecting streets to be announced.
You know on a daily weekly basis is that this needs to address equity in terms of open space, a lot of parts of the city of New York.
Unfortunately, just do not have the open space that even areas like community board, 3 and I think a lot of us in Canadian board.
Inequity is also in terms of expanding and keeping open space effective, but with through this bill and first are through this program, and so I know that's what the Councilwoman has spoken to depart DoD about in terms of identifying streets.
She is working with other members of the City Council to encourage them to go to their community boards and to their community groups and ask them what streets do you think could potentially work to get those to do tease the deal, so you can do their road analysis.
Think we're here just to really listen to see what kind of streets you guys want to see in your neighborhood and at the same time you know we acknowledge that this is an emergency.
Members are important part of that conversation, and we think that you know if there's issues that you guys see with any of these streets that are being implemented like let us know let deity know.
If there are so many exemptions for different types of vehicles to drive through the street, I mean just looking at the website, its local deliveries, pickups drop, necessary City service vehicles, utility vehicles and emergency vehicles.
I shouldn't use the word police, but how it should be managed and like it was just a little bit disconcerting for me to be really excited to be walking down the street, and then you know a gigantic truck was facing me down and I had to get off the street.
I suppose, if there are so many exemptions without a lot of clarity, because people will take advantage of it, okay for you to leave the vehicles, that would probably mean like carnet or Verizon if they need to get through, maybe there's some repair that they have to do what else?
Is that all right, if I just comment on that real quick go to Germany yep yeah, just a couple of points I mean I would also like definitely acknowledge, like what Michele is seen and I got, certainly something that, like he's gonna, have to be worked out throughout this process.
I think involving the community to make sure that there is that you know that there are clear so there's clear, signage and clear understanding the months officials that these are five mile-per-hour shared streets, basically for the fuse for the few vehicles that are permitted to access the street temporarily I think it's going to be part of an education effort that we need to do.
Well, I think it's going to become more of an understanding, I think we've seen in other cities across the United States, where this is being implemented that it there is effective implementation that streets in other cities are seeing those you know, delivery vehicles and other service vehicles accessing it and are not.
I think that's where it's really important, where those community groups that are coming in, because if they are noticing, you know that there's a lot of need for a coned repair activity for Verizon activity, I mean God knows my Internet's been on the fritz for the last weeks.
You know in ours where open streets may not be as necessary like late at night earlier in the morning.
I mean I, certainly think that it's a it's going to depend on each street specifically, which group is doing the organizing.
I think they're gonna have effective tools to communicate to the city to the right enforcement officials.
So you know, that's certainly our position, our offices position and you know again continuing conversation as these streets of all, because honestly they've only been here for a week or two and I know we've all you know been going through and seeing how different transportation changes have happened in cb3.
You know to make sure the programs work effectively, I believe Susan, that a question I.
So I was told by the mayor's office that they're gonna start having social distancing ambassadors on the street because of all the complaints with a B, since these are places where pedestrians are congregating, but we still want people to social distance.
Just because, like the program is pretty new and we certainly have the same question ourselves, but we haven't heard anything out so I'm just gonna turn to do tea if they have anything at this point Jennifer at the moment, I haven't heard any updates or details on that problem or haven't reached certain social decision ambassadors when I do have that info.
I saw Jim Shelton's hand raised first Jim, hi, yeah I, just I want to follow up a little bit on what Susan Jeremy we're just talking about.
You know, looking at the current d-o-t guidelines for the program and I understand that they're evolving, but currently, as the program exists, you need to have a sponsor community organization and one of the requirements is that they staff they provide staff or the street, but there's additionally, no funding available through d-o-t and I just heard from Jeremy that there is some movement on possibly having other options to facilitate that, but maybe it'd be helpful, maybe Jen to hear a little bit about how do tea is thinking about that because there's lots of organizations or streets who might identify, but there isn't necessarily two people power to staff for 12 hours.
Do you want to just point as a clarification, the first round of streets that were open there on the parks, those are being run by the city right now?
The first thing I'd like to sort of understand, is the purpose of safe streets, because I think we're all looking at different definitions of what this street program should look like I know.
So the first thing I'd like to hear is a clear definition of what program I'm supposed to do under the safe streets.
I know the bill in the council, but I want to know about for this particular program, because I think it would be helpful to let people know that you're going to see some traffic on the street and it's not just an open place street and you've sort of touched on this and the whole equity issue, which I think we're going to face with a lot of the requests for the for these streets.
Actually, you know seemed like we approved it, and this is good the open street if, after you know, day 1 day 2 after a while, it doesn't work that we do.
You know as possible to help with the social distancing, and you know, as I mentioned before you know any Street that doesn't have a community partner I'm going to try to see what other you know.
I just got an email that the city is considering using restaurants, letting restaurants use some of the spaces and I know a number of community groups, and particularly business groups- and you know, are discussing that and I.
Think Tim is you know it's the part of the second resolution that Tim from the Lower East Side partnership has is about discussing other ways to use a space, so I think that's going to be evolving about that as far as groups.
The list we have right now are ones that, with a few exceptions, are ones that individual residents suggested to the two council offices and that's that's a list that was on the website since then, the only ones we have from groups, Jan Lee's email that I think Michael will share later with a plan, that's from a group and then Jimmy Carbone suggested 7th, Street and I'm sure he would have enough people in his group to do that.
So my question is just a follow-up in addition to bedding, what is the definition for success so if it requires a lot of support from community etc- and there seems to be variations of this experiment and there's a process to this experimentation, how do we define what is successful and what you know that would look like I can give one answer go answers, so we have a tremendous amount of complaints about lack of social, distancing and I believe because and I believe.
They had a very short, very short conversation, but one of the things they said was you know, particularly from the second street, being accessed, to be able to respond to pick particularly fires east of that of Avenue B.
Pretty often, how are we going to, or this do t do- a community outreach in terms of letting residents note that this street may or may not be closed.
It's important for people to know they don't want to go off the next day, because one person in a particular neighborhood said: hey, let's close the street without letting residents know so for VOT and I guess the counselor's office.
Could you put up signage flyers or something like Susan suggested, I think that's the most effective way and probably supported means to put them out in the streets: oh yeah, on the street itself or at the corner.
Considering some installation I mean people, it's like everyone's at time work now, mm-hmm, okay, I opened that back.
Thank you, David once again, final shot for any that can committee members or community board three members with any follow up questions for the two presenters: okay, no hands, so the public has a lot of opinions to say tonight.
I. If you could raise your hands and I will call you in order, I want to limit your time to public comment to two minutes, each maybe less.
Okay, all right, I see one two, three, four, five, six one, two three four five, six people that would make that want to make a public comment.
For being my you know, being the person mayor of the black and helping manage things, maybe that's a good way to get young people involved this summer is d-o-t planning or any group planning some kind of training video that volunteers can watch.
Okay, I just wanted to raise the idea that if there is a concern of safety issue on Avenue, B I think there is a need.
Next person welcome before I move on does do T or the council woman's office want to address Jimmy, but I think he just means simply made a recommendation.
Alright, next person I have one sure well with that being said, then, as far as it related to the enforcement of the safe streets, you know it could be a potential recipe for disaster, depending on the who.
A disaster we've seen some of the you know, brutality, that's gone on and again most people have good intentions and wanting to preserve the health and the public health of the neighborhood and the community.
You know we obviously have been very concerned about on my PD involvement in any sort with social distancing measures, open streets or otherwise we had a letter kind of condemning the situation with officer Garcia on Avenue D.
When it comes to the open streets program, you know again we're working with do T, so I can't speak with, and we're advocating for things to do.
So there's a long experience around the world on doing this thing, so naturally, I strongly support the open Street project and not only to ease the pedestrian movement and to allow for more space for safe physical distancing, but I think we also need to think about what's coming up next and that we have to prepare for the needs of people.
People are walking in the street because they have to if you want to keep six feet away from people, you're already walking what sorry somebody's yeah all right.
You know you have to if you want to save six feet from you in most of the East Village and a lot of the city, so by closing these streets, while we're not making it a hundred percent safe, we're making it a whole lot safer than it is right now, I also want to say on bikes and walking together we see it on summer streets every summer.
It is a huge transition from the bridge from Brooklyn into the neighborhood to the park and, right now you know it's almost impossible to walk down that street safely without being close to people.
It's a very narrow street we've been advocating for a very long time for bike paths there, but for right now, I feel like it's really urgent, that this is particularly a street that we need just to be able to go safely through the neighborhood.
It's you know, there are bars, yes, there's a lot of stuff going on, but we really need that space to get through the neighborhood.
We have before open streets and I think that the model that we have there - the issues with the limited hours is a really good model, because if we consider the potential reasons why we might want these streets for transportation, for recreation, for just the ability for people to leave the house and still have still maintained space having a network like this, where there's basically it's a lot easier to sort of have a few choke points where we limit access and slow cars, it makes it a lot simpler to maintain and it makes it a lot more sustainable.
That's closed during weekends for bikers and pedestrians, and the one thing that I haven't heard about is: we need enormous amount of signage, big signs that would indicate to drivers what the rules are when they're in effect, so that people know that the street has a special use.
That's been brought up already today, but yet no signage is definitely big issue that we need to talk about and I have one recommendation and that's East, Broadway and I think it was on a list but I'd like to second that East Broadway from Grand to Essex, Thank You, Tommy I appreciate that grants is expect all right all right.
These do not seem like big asks and Jeremy Unger for you all for Carlene his office I'm wondering if there's any discretionary budget I know the city budget is tight right now, but like this is such an important issue like the social distancing, is not happening.
We can use a lot of the younger people who want to get community service points or folks who are looking for jobs, training to be part of this great community network and help people get the recreation space that they need, while keeping them safe.
I, don't have a dog right now the council and has a wonderful pug, who has certainly I think with appreciate more open streets as well, but that you know I'm, not the councilman's budget director said I want to comment.
So it's basically, you know if you want to add something that they cut something else, and so we're in this really difficult situation right now with the budget, you know, I certainly think it's gonna be something we're gonna, be looking at really closely to see how that can be implemented with this program, The Alibi.
Thank you, I, believe the assembly members short on time, I will, if you wanted to say anything right now, please go ahead.
I know you can only be on for another 10 minutes who we need to do better job social distancing and we need avenues, but I just raised the issue aside streets too, because this crosstown opportunity for social distancing is there as well and so I just I just really wanted to open those two I think the suggestions are having you be a really good idea: I think that they?
You know I mentioned sixth Street in 10th Street, just because they have access to the park and of people doing social distancing and going to the park closing off the streets, something they would both be near.
Tompkins Square, if you're doing from Third Avenue all the way to a nudie or to the river I, think those are opportunities as well and wondering what people, and at least what parks is thinking I know we have apps to keep talking to them around east west, as well as north south Thank You assembly.
I think he he's absolutely right, but, however, you know some of the comments about opening one lane might be a possibility, yeah.
You know, in addition to that I'd like to just make a comment about how the whole program is being rolled out on one hand, I'm a huge supporter of open streets.
Dan T as his hand raised Dan, T, yep, I, think I just unmuted, but my Internet's, a little spotty so much okay, excellent, so I have a lot to say: I mean a lot of those streets that were on the list where my I wrote to the both council, members that are in this community district and I so Trevor.
So that would be my biggest push and I think that should be an NYPD staffed one, but as far as I'd like to love to echo all both as a connector to the park, but also expanding the park and I would suggest taking away parking, if not one directional lane the traffic of all four sides of Tompkins Square Park to be open streets to expand the park.
I'm not representing the parks department but I am my job is to patrol the park, so I've seen the necessary need for more park space around the parts that are already existing and so yeah Avenue B and since it came up, I think that the live on Rivington, Street I think that the ours should be expanded for the hell Square area, because if those restaurants plan to open and want to expand open streets would be the excellent way because they could have more seating and then do it legally, instead of the illegal drinking operations that are happening right now.
Totally support like to why you guys talk about I will I want totally like if we come man like a front glass, three on Bruce, Lee and funk when she to Delancey and then fun on the street to LA, know well presented like because our the street arm I'm Bruce tree and then the Archer is kinda like most of the times, not very like driving three I taste it like a also.
The public portion I want to thank everybody from the public that have offered comments and commentary tonight and questions for car Lena's office, because woman's office and the Department of Transportation I know this is an ongoing matter, but for right now we are actually going to move to the resolution, and that will be just committee discussion.
Only so I believe the public will be on mute for this entire time, but I think Susan wants to say something before yeah I was wondering if you want to look at the criteria first, because I'm not sure all the board members, oh Michael, just put it on okay, yes, I think the criteria is I.
Let's look at the criteria so now, as we move on towards dealing with the resolution itself in the streets that we want to think about being closed, can we pull that up a little bit so the first page back to the first page?
So if we want to give some input into what those streets are, they're actually want to see our draft resolutions and may not even wait for the right so I think for tonight we really just got to focus on the streets.
You yourself, I can't do it for you, Allen Ellen, okay, Ellen, when I guess, when I don't know, if you're having technical issues or something like that, all right, yes, Seussical XL, go back, see Cooper, Square, Cooper Square also has buses Cooper squared off to this Cooper and I.
People were very upset that the first round of streets did not come from the community board, since there is going to be another round very quickly, because that's what the community is asking for, and city council really pressured the mayor to do this.
I think we could make this kind of a wish list that, as things change, perhaps like given the suggestions, for example an Avenue fee that, rather than closing the whole street one lane or removing Part B, or something like that.
Partial I think that, given you know, it's a Susan's point that we didn't have a lot of time to quote, but this street the streets- that's not really.
So maybe if we as community board members decided on this the list of streets that we'd like to see something happen, and perhaps we add that language to the resolution as well can I suggest it might be helpful to read the resolution.
Right, no I think the second one is and if there are further recommendations, come back to the city, I mean it's just an option of ours to say we don't recommend anything or you know whatever.
Susan I was gonna, say what about the one you're not gonna get Avenue, because that's right, Fire Department is saying no, so there's no chance, but what about using the one language, maybe you could get yeah I was gonna suggest that we that we, someone had already suggested it earlier an hour ago in the conversation about language I, think it was Michelle.
Michelle potential like solution to increase social distancing, something I mean okay, let's say it's hard to do this on the fly, whereas some streets will not be acceptable.
Yes, we shouldn't because we're putting that statement I think we need to put Avenue beyond that on the bullet point list, whereas some streets that will not need agency criteria for approval to be closed as designated safe streets are going to need enhancements to allow adequate social distancing.
You know street calming measures like fiction cons or to be discussed at one point or you know, or the things we're talking about now about increasing basically extending the sidewalk space that we want them to.
I know is Troy's suggestion of foresight, Street between Houston and Delancey yeah I mean were there others, because, although B was mentioned, the most be always organizes the most and I.
Okay, I need to adopt the broom between orchards and Chinatown's, known for its extremely narrow streets and sidewalks, and as someone who walks the neighborhood every day, I can't even social, just missing now so I'm pretty sure, with more people coming out for walks daily walks, and that really would be it's impossible now.
So there are a couple of streets that I would like, but I don't really know because I'm, not an expert in terms of traffic right in terms of those specific streets, I haven't stirred outside done a survey, for example.
All right, Michelle go I, have I know you have a fee sure, so I would actually for Broome Street suggest doing broom between Forsyth and Alan.
Michelle said I think eventually, all of these are gonna get vetted, and these are community recommendations so whether they get put in or not is from the city at this point, so we might as well take advantage of this time to throw in every street we could possibly think of where take out any street.
You know what the situation is on those streets like you're, Michelle or Darrell and I.
I would ask and again I'm not advocating against any of those suggestions as long as their priorities for the community and it's my fault and everybody's had a lot of say here tonight and from the Committees of the public and I think that's what makes it a priority if they believe that this street should be closed for social distancing issues, yeah, absolutely, let's give it a shot I.
That's my, but that's my there in the situation where we need the space, all right, Thank, You, Susan from the committee, any other any other streets.
That's gonna be ongoing for a while and who knows how this metamorphosizes over the next few months and what this really does for us, but it gives us I, think our priorities have changed now, as a transportation committee I think this kind of shifts of itself up to the top a little bit before to what we were discussing before now we're going after different things, just because of what this pandemic is done so from the committee.
Is there any other streets we want to put in, and we just say: okay, we look at adopting this resolution and voting on.
Think what I took out of so far was a lot of the public is saying with signage and enforcement was the outside of what streets needed to be chosen.
Therefore, be it FURTHER RESOLVED, the city should return to community board 3 with any additional proposals for safe Street designations going forward.
But above it it's not a bad idea, but the concern be to get input about like additional streets or you know, are you seeing unsafe streets or would it be when there is an actual street proposed that we would want them to be informed?
No, once the street has been like okay by the city that they should know like that, Street the people who live there or the businesses, this is the street.
That's gonna be close, we're letting you know ahead of time that this is what's about to happen.
Can you repeat that from the show Michelle did you get that yeah I got it so therefore be it further is all that the Department of Transportation conduct outreach the communities before, though, to inform them of what streets will be closed in one, so this would be like as they're approved, so that streets that have been approved for closure, yes or some sort of approval process.
Tim. If you're on the line, can you talk about this resolution that you have in front of us sure thanks Paul, so, firstly, I just would thank the committee I think it was a long but robust discussion about open streets just quickly.
Sure before I ask the committee a couple questions and I guess this is for both Tim and first Susan I know we had a brief discussion earlier.
The other thing, I would say is, as the weather is getting warmer we're having more and more unsafe, non-compliant use of businesses in the street and I think what you always want to do is make a way for them to be compliant and safe.
Any of the committee members can chime in I also sit on SLA, so I hear we hear from the committee a lot and I am pretty confident that they would be, and the black associations neighborhood associations all over would want to have their voices heard in this process and I understand that there's a time sensitivity to it, but I think there's also a history of sort of opening a can of worms that you know like Pandora's Box. You can't put the monster back in once.
Yes, it's Street side parking, but as you launched into it Tim you were saying you know, measures that the community board has been comfortable is supporting in the past.
