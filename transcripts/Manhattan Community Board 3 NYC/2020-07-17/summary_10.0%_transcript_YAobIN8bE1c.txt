Troy, don't be interesting meeting but nice way to get your feet wet, also like to thank Michael who is running production on loosen meaning he has done it for every meeting and it requires a lot of work because he has to pay attention to all of what is going on in the chat and who needs to get on and then phones in addition to pay attention.
We do not have any resolutions plan, although there's a lot of information, that's going to be presented first thing I'd like to do is approve the minutes from last month, and this is the way we take attendance for our committee members Michael.
One of the things we're probably going to discuss at the August meeting is to Brooklyn Montgomery close to resiliency project, the community that we discussed - the exact last night briefly, but basically the projects along the waterfront and two bridges, or also known as a brooklyn montgomery coastal resiliency project was a had some issues with funding, but it appears now it's back on track and that construction should start at the end of this month, a community board, along with a number of other neighborhood groups for letters, and we received a response that they were going to continue this.
They are coming to the board in August to talk about the project as we left off at design and we're going to restart that community engagement sometime in August.
Just slightly first I want to make sure that we have the teams that are ready to present available, so the first team that would go up with the department sanitation to talk or give an update on the staging, the TLC staging at basketball city, I, don't know who's here for that Joshua Goodman.
Just want to provide an update on what's going on at basketball city I know.
But you know, as we all know, our neighborhood has narrow streets right and you may have seen in the early days of the pandemic through perhaps April or May taxi drivers lined up because they wanted to get this work in the morning right and more at this site than at any other.
If you sign up for this program- and you say, I need kosher food, it comes from basketball city, so that means it's not open Saturdays, because we don't do kosher food deliveries on the Sabbath, and so, as a result of that, we sometimes have a little more capacity.
chair and, if you'd like to share with everyone, please feel free if we could post that now and Michael can send it out we're gonna go with some questions and I certainly have a few, because one of the folks who witnesses those cars at 5 o'clock in the morning and seen a whole bunch of fights and a lot of other issues is generally calm down.
But there's still some issues and what I'm gonna give the committee members a chance to speak on this I think I saw Tory's can raise I, don't know if that was for this issue is for this issue.
So there's a few questions in there, so there is a bathroom as actually to open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. we're, hoping that if folks are not there overnight, there's no reason for them not to use those restaurants right yeah.
We have told them that we will issue tickets, and that was a great example of something where, if you see it, let me know in real-time: our enforcement agents will walk right down the block and say turn the car engine off or here's a ticket.
You know I, think that the program will continue long term because, as we reopen, our seniors are going to be the last people to get back to normal this site.
Okay and I'll follow up with you in a separate conversation, because I'm really wanting to keep this as informational, but that's also a large space for the community and I know that the city is looking for ways to keep kids socially distant, and that is one space that could handle a lot of kids, especially if we're going to be talking about daycare or summer cubes or other things.
Let me know at any time sure Michael did you say anyone else, I, don't see anyone else, all right, Thank, You, Josh, well, I, don't know if you're gonna stay on for part of the ESC I, don't know if there's another rep from Sanitation I'm, not sure but I whatever I think whoever's supposed to be here is gonna be here, but thank you for giving us the information on that and if you have any updates, we'd surely like to know you can email us in real time.
There will be opportunity to ask questions, but since we have not heard from this team in quite some time, we are really going to limit this to a presentation and some general questions where we can get an understanding of where this project is right.
They are going to give this presentations with presentation which does not include the ESC our project itself, as well as the Emergency Management intern flood protection presentation, I'm gonna, ask -: are you on?
That we haven't really provided too much details and we're hoping to give you folks a better understanding of what's going on with the project, and it's Trevor mentioned we'll be coming back regularly now from now on, to get more information out there and be able to be available for questions and move on for moving towards the construction.
So I'm going to go through the presentation, hopefully I'll, be able to preemptively answer a lot of the questions that we received so far from many different avenues, but I think Trevor said we'll have a general or maybe a short Q&A at the end that we can discuss.
That's the facilitator, we'll talk about that a little bit, and obviously through elected officials and the community board committee members here too happy to discuss that afterwards too.
But overall, we've received a lot of questions about the current project status and what the timeline is where the project is so far in the past several months what's been going on, will the Park East, River, Park and all the other parts in cv6 area?
Talk about that also will give you an idea or presents a little more details about our outreach and engagement strategies for the next few months, until construction and also for the next five years of construction phase and after I'm done, our colleagues at the emergency management will be presenting their interim flood protection measures.
That said, we still need some time to understand the overall impacts of kovat on the city's major construction projects such as this ESC, our project, to be able to figure out what that really means for our project schedule.
However, due to at the request of the community, we were able to defer that to the spring, so we could have that area open and working with a lower Eastside ecology Center later in fall instead of spring, and that's that has that has not been impacted by covert and just because we received questions on that.
I wanted to be clear that was deferred proactively by the project team by DBC at the request of the community, and we were able to accommodate that without having to impact the rest of the project schedule that comes after that.
The early package is that's what was plans for Springs I got deferred to early fall sometime in September rain and we're coordinating with the city team with our deputy mayor's office dias, and why parks there's a there's, a big group behind that to help with relocating the lower Eastside ecology, centers compost yard operations to the new site.
A number of trees are currently being assessment identified to be transplanted into the community from the East River Park into the community, and we'll be able to provide more details about that to project area to is essentially cv6 community board six area of the northern piece of the project and I put this in this order.
There's a lot of legwork, a lot of mobilization, a lot of coordination that has to happen before we actually start construction and that's a collective decision with DBC and our city agencies, our partners and our consulting team, and once we determine that exact time frame for each one of these areas.
Obviously the website and other methods and let everybody know well in advance before construction starts on any area of this project.
Yet at this point, we're just four project area: two we're just at the sort of pre award meeting step right now and we haven't ordered the contract, the this scope to the contractor.
One is a couple of steps behind in the procurement phase from project they're here to and that's currently targeted for late fall, and the fourth component of that is the parallel conveyance that includes the sewer and drainage improvements through them throughout the whole project site, which incas the whole project, footprint and community board three and six, and that's the final one that will come after PA, one the timeframe hasn't been determined yet and where we think we're estimating sometime in the late fall to early winter time.
While we move along with our sort of behind the scenes, pre-construction activities every time, it's like peeling, an onion every time that we reach a mini milestone behind the scenes, we'll be able to provide more details on construction timeframe and the specific construction areas for the project, and they also, we might want to remind everybody.
Back in December and January, we presented general construction phasing diagram to both community boards and residents in the area that was prepared by our consultant team agency.
We need to have the contractors on board, and one of the very first deliverables by the contractor is for them to propose or issue their projects, get their construction schedule to us, and once we get the construction schedule, we do our review, there's meetings and discussions and from that point we will be able to determine exactly the date for the start of construction.
So we'll come back with more details as we move along and again I'll be sure to provide well advanced notice, and we have a host of different avenues that we be able to communicate with folks that I'll share in the next slides.
This is also a general overview, not many details still available for this subjects, but I wanted to talk about a little bit and I'm going to turn it to our consultants agency, V Leo, here to quickly speak to this slide.
This has been just has any other construction project: construction operations, noise, air quality site safety, construction, States, the construction site safety- all of that is, although that is always a concern for any residents and any project team, regardless of the location or the project type, and we want to be sure that everybody understands that we are will be following all the regulations and local laws and codes that we have to require, and we want to we'll be sure to provide the information and these plans once there once they're developed to the community, so everybody's aware of what is required from the contractor and what they need to comply with and ongoing.
So, just briefly going through a few bullets here, as we get ready for construction to start in the fall, the contract is required to submit a site safety plan which would include Co bid, as well as a bunch of other things like noise quality and air quality.
In some cases we need to do work at night because they were closing lanes of the FDR Drive, for example, but we're gonna be monitoring that so as to keep that to a minimum I, don't know if there's anything else, you want me to go through the queue, but I think that's pretty much.
If you have any questions with regards to that, I would defer everybody to Pratt, Center and happy to put you folks in contact, and our goal is to still maintain our presence with the community boards and other avenues that we had during the design as well in the cat group.
Currently, the web site covers the design phase predominantly and we're expanding the website to include additional tabs and dropdowns and sections that we could utilize during construction, we're adding a little more background and history to the project website.
Our goal is to roll out our new website and our social media accounts with our first round of social media posts at some point during this summer, in advance of construction, so bear with us we're still coordinating the website, update with our IT departments and the rest of the city team and going through that coordination and step by step, update and we'll be back, and we can give you a demonstration on in one of the upcoming community board meetings once we go live with that communication materials just as any other project at DVC, we'll have a wide range of communication materials.
These signs they're also intended to provide information or the independent flow protection components and how the systems function as part of the unified approach to this coastal resiliency project and, like I mentioned the scope, is on a separate design track and will present the conceptual design at one of the upcoming community board meetings right now, our design team, that many of you are familiar with the a krf team and their consultants, are working on this and we're hoping to provide a separate presentation at some point within the next few months before we finalize design.
Yes, oh okay, great, thank you for the opportunity to give you a quick overview of what our plans are for the outreach on this program.
We would also try to find opportunities once the community engagement is underway and depending on where kovat takes us, we could also do outreach in those areas promoting local businesses to help you know, staff or supply services and equipment to the construction and the program management team.
Thank you trying and again we'll come back with a lot more details on that, but I just wanted to share high-level information to let everybody know.
The next bullet point is the community construction liaisons, as we first met of CCOs. This is another item that this program is being developed right now and just trying to define the step by step and day-to-day process of the CCL.
Sure many of you know, construction project construction is typically a gradual process, as time goes by the operation of the intensity of it increases.
If we need to add more CCS, we'll look into that, but for the time being, we're starting with two and we'll definitely be sure to we're bringing on details that are bilingual to be able to communicate with a wider group of residents.
They have developed this that I've been working with this tool for a number of their past construction projects, and it seems it's been very successful and seems to be a very helpful tool for our project here and essentially it's a inquiry, management and response management system, and it helps us better, manage and organize questions, concerns and increase that come in.
It has multiple languages that you can choose to translate and as a be able to have the ability to either just open the site and pop in your question or concern and a couple of fields that may it may or may not be required and submit that or you can create an account and have that saved under your account and every time you need to access that you can log in and pick up where we left off.
Our goal is to have a staff by at least two locally hired administrative folks, and the CCS will be available there in person, either by appointment or through a rotating schedule, also wanted to mention that privately before I forgot, the CCS will be based on the project sites construction sites behind the sense which is not obviously open or accessible by the public.
If information says session, we were hoping to reach out to the schools and partner with the local schools for field trips and use this space as an educational center, with exhibits and posters screens and whatnot and, after all said and done, and set up develop some sort of a system that we can offer this space back to the community Corvo, no, obviously for any monthly membership meetings or community meetings that the community organizations might need and will hostel figure taxes amount to the sort of criteria for finding this space was to look in an area that's halfway centrally located halfway between Community Board, six and community board three to be fair to all the residents and this project stretch and we landed on Alphabet City area.
The timeline is still being determined, we'll come back again in the next couple months with more details as we move along and the last item I have here is an art program that we would like to roll out to the community for the construction cents.
Procedurally, is someone from parks here going to sort of give me that give a answer, those questions or do you want to ask?
Okay, so yeah, sorry about the previous audio issues, so I know that there were a number of questions about the law, reset, ecology, Center.
So if you could just introduce yourself- oh yes, all the community parks, I and the part of the project team I think I recognize most of the folks here from many years of community 3 and eser meetings on the Laurie side, ecology, center I think there are actually a couple issues, but I'll answer the compost one first.
So, as you mentioned, part of the early, the package work will be the relocation of a compost facility, so I think one of the things that the city has been pretty committed to all along and that we continue to be committed to is ensuring that the compost operations can continue during esker construction.
Think one of the questions or inquiries that we've gotten from the community board previously as well as Laurie, said, ecology Center has been about the ability for the compost facility to remain at its current site for as long as possible, or until we actually need to put the flood protection in there.
One of the things that we do want to flag and I'm sure DDC can speak to this in more detail is just the sheer complexity of a project of this scale and so having an active compost operations within a large scale.
Constructions would be something that would be very disruptive and I think put the schedule for delivering flood protection, which is definitely the city's priority at risk, and so I think one of the things that we want to make sure people understand and I think.
But you know if we're thinking from south to north the entrance for the construction vehicles for this project, a lot of them they'll all be coming from Montgomery Street, which is the only particular access, and so when we think about Montgomery Street, there is the pier 42 site, which is just south of the existing complex art.
As part of the first phase of this site as well- so that's another thing to think about just in terms of how much is going to be going on in terms with construction there's also the ferry stop, which the city is committed to keeping open, but that's just another sort of logistical challenge and making sure that people can access that safely.
We want to make sure that they're there construction vehicles can get in and are an unimpeded way, but also that you know people are safe users of the park pretty shortly after the ser on pier 42, the Honorable.
You know that they have some maintenance work happening for the underside of the unit's word for age, and so they will also need to be accessing that portion from Montgomery Street and so just from last year, construction logistics perspective.
I, don't know Christine, maybe on I, don't know if she I don't see her, but we are hoping to start the actual discussions about a license agreement for the use of Seward Park house, which is where they'll be going for the educational program and, as part of that also start good face negotiations about what an agreement will look like with Valerie sod called you Center for returning to Easter Park.
Finally, at a point where we're certainly still responding to kovat, but as we get more details about what the Seward Park house looks like, you know what the relocations that looks like we can actually start talking about details, so I don't have more than that right now, but you know we are committed to this we're going to be having conversations with the Loess on ecology, Center and all the thanks for covering that and I just wanted to add to what Aldo said about the construction operations, which is very thorough thanks for that also, the construction phasing plan that we have up on the website and that we presented several months ago over there this year.
Thank you, I see three more committee members and then we're just gonna take a couple questions from other committee members, but I really want folks to understand it.
Are you putting together a covent plan for the community so that people know what the rules are for the construction workers?
It would be really great, since you can't open a community center to have some kind of you know this video set up that we can actually see they couldn't see the construction as it as its unfolding, but I guess.
That I talked about three scopes early on to have that discussion with them hear what their plan is, what their experience has been in the past several months and we'll be able to come back with more details and show you what that criteria is or what that means and if it's going to have any scheduled impacts.
So that's one of the unknowns right now, but so far we're not anticipating any impact, our schedule, but we'll let you know the details of covert operations thanks for persons on the cold quickly, I'm talking also on a personal level.
We have to comply with the mayor's restrictions, mayor's guidelines and this and the governor's guidelines so whether they're on our construction sites or part of this project or not, there's just as a citizen as someone in the area they're required to comply without that all those required requirements, so we'll be sure to include all that in any sort of guideline or documents or requirement sets that we put in place with the contractor, but it would, it will be universal for all of them.
In terms of noise and the funding just speak to that, because I think people do want to know no I actually understood again, it's an existing condition.
To that we tried to accommodate and coordinate, and a lot of them are moving forward, so the canopy right now again, it hasn't been cut from the project, the canopy we started the preliminary design we presented that earlier, the early earlier this year or I think it was December when we had that granted they were working group.
Let's do this obviously needs some advocacy and probably a discussion at a future cb3 meeting, since we still have some time on that I mean that's one of the notes that we have to make sure we follow up along, but I'm gonna go to Carolyn next I don't want to keep it on me.
Taking all these comments and questions, but we will have follow-up on that I think that was it for committee members, so there's a clock up, but I'm really going to ask for folks because I know there.
I think we need to consider community over cars and to be thinking about changing that program and I'd like cb3, to be thinking about that and advocating for that and also he talked about dust monitor and I'd, really like to know how they're going to monitor and what they're you know are they going to say on a windy day they can't put in fill which would delay the project indefinitely because it's always a windy day along the river.
So if we could just stick to what she asked, we're gonna go a little bit over that time, because I know you have to go into detail, but we're gonna limit the question and answer the two minutes.
Let John explain that a little bit on high level, but again when, as we get closer to that time, with contractors coming on board and verifying the work, the scope that we had set forward, the schedule that we have set forward, we will at that point, be able to come back and give you more details why this nighttime work needs to happen.
Thank you and I know we're not going to be able to get go into detail for every answer and you can always submit to the folks who have presented Michael who's.
We have to figure out the studying and the planting season so aiming to you're back to your question, I get where you're saying, but it's a lot easier for a contractor to manage groups, small groups of pedestrians walking over the bridge to access the salon, space versus active, highly active construction sites.
Maybe it's more about think point out, because I just want that you guys to make sure you guys are thinking of this on July 7th about 9:15 p.m. right in the enkarans going from pier 42 into the park.
You can bring back to the community board for safety access, because that was a really seemingly minor thing, but it stood out to me because for my understanding, that really is the only way to go in and out of the park during construction.
It's just that we really have a lot of other items, but I will try and work you back in depending on how long the flood protection is I, know you shot through this, but there's still other things we have to talk with, and this is all eser stuff.
So with our engineering team we and the mayor's office a resiliency in City, Hall we've gone through a planning process that started last year and we were wrapping up right around the time of coal bed.
As you know, we were asked to look at the Eastside coastal resiliency project area and determine if it would be feasible to design and implement an IFP M project, while those long-term measures are being constructed.
You know this could be happening during the coastal storm season and we would possibly be not be able to protect during that season and then during a coastal storm activation, the multi block and the site level would likely see very large traffic and pedestrian impacts, and you see some estimated costs at the bottom.
If you know, I don't want to take up too much time here, I thought you were going to take a break.
You know capital, construction or any addressing of things like the drainage in a way that is going to be a permanent solution for that NYCHA might be doing, but I have no knowledge of what NYCHA is doing.
We just asked for this study to be done, so we could take a look at whether the area could get Internet protection, so this is separate from a lot of the work that's going on in NYCHA for the whole city.
You know they're looking and think they're gonna provide long-term flood reduction with their projects so and they have all the findings that we had it.
A part of our study as well so I see thank you, Mike Lucy Carolyn, and that should be it okay, so we're gonna go with those for right now, after Carolyn yeah go ahead.
Okay, a quick question about the image that you showed for the Stuyvesant Cove area and the interim flood protection, because the bulk of our water that came during sandy came straight down, Avenue C straight from the East River, and it was like between four to eight to four feet, depending on where you were in the neighborhood.
If you could go to slides, 23 and I could start speaking about it, there I think okay, so these highlights are showing the low points of the alignment and I think you're talking about the area all the way to the right.
Guess what I'm really asking, because I think what Carol tried to ask in a certain way is that what we need to understand is that this type of interim flood protection plan really only that goes up to about four feet: any storms over that, even if you're going to deploy them the water's going to overtop the barrier, and if you have a low-lying area or high area, that's above a certain height, you can't necessarily install the or this mate this system may or may not work and I think just trying to make that clear.
I know that some people are just finding out about this, but it just and I could probably speak for a lot of committee members who have too many evenings of meetings of community engagement and for quite some time.
So maybe we need to do more as a community board, but this project is going through and q.
This people will walk out their door with their children to go to the park and there will be bulldozers and they won't understand what's happening, and all of you have a civic responsibility to acknowledge that and to know how many lives and heartbroken sorry Jennifer we've, given you giving you your time to speak.
We really think that everyone knows about this project, because just at the time we invest every single night on Thursday after I can assure you they don't, but we're gonna make the community aware, because we don't trust you all right so doing that.
Will this interim flood protection study be available to the public so that we have time to look it over absorb it, and you know: ask follow-up questions.
Secondly, I'd like to know where any outside engineering firms consulted or used in your study, or was this all in-house but and let me ask my questions and then finally, because when we had an outside independent consultant review eser, he came up with several serious problems with the current plan, including the flood glades floodgates, the amount of fill the failure to consider a hundred year storm.
Sorry, though, sewers are in the middle of those projects, let's back up a little bit, I'll answer the questions about the 9jq.
When are you going to walk into the park and talk to people who don't come to meetings?
Great idea by Wendy that we've taken on and started I know that there are a lot of questions about trees or, if next time it is today we're speaking specifically about the tree planting times worse, Haley's gonna give an update on where things are.
Okay, so I'll go ahead for those of you that don't know me, my name is Haley Hicks and I work with NYC parks in the tree, planting program, I'm, managing all of the tree plantings in response to es CR and all related community correspondence, including the tree planting task force.
We plan and ask questions and provide suggestions, and this helped us kind of focus in on what the community wants to see with these tree plantings.
So, lastly, you know if you have any questions about street tree planting or you want to attend the tree planting task force meetings, please feel free to reach out to me.
If I need to thank you for that update and could be brief and just giving us what's going on one of the main questions and I think you have answered it is that we do have funding for these trees and they will be planted, but when I try to do other things, what I'm running is you're meeting my computer.
So can you just put your email address in the chat box and then I'll dispose everybody yeah I will do that right now and I'm going to ask for questions from the committee.
We gathered a lot of feedback based on like you know what types of trees won't want to see go in and where the community thinks they should go, and we got a lot of feedback that tree canopy should be going in closest to surrounding East River Park.
We're gonna go into a discussion about district needs, so if any one who is not a committee member wants to sit and listen to some very dry stuff, you will do it hopefully think finish.
So if you're taking a look, I just want to make sure that, because I did change some stuff that, if anything, needs to change, no I, think you stuff quite a while ago and in the notes too so yeah.
A little bit right, yeah, Seward, Park, Seward, Park, House bathrooms are now open and space is being used by the lower Eastside ecology, Center I, don't know if you want to put something in there.
Okay, so Susan you're just trying to separate that out, so it says reopen for community use and you want a new sentence.
You know, there's a action going forward, got it conversation, I would suggest we take that whole thing out, because everything's either done or funded or under construction.
They came in with you know an $8,000 or small CPI grass and planted all these beautiful things, but then there was no maintenance plan, so nobody, a lot of times already died, I think so.
Sorry do we want to say anything in here about the return of the compost as it is sort of an institution on the Lower East Side, and in that Park in district needs, yeah I, don't I, don't I think that's kind of a separate thing.
It's something that's incredibly important to the community, but it's not the same kind of district need where we're seeing the amount of park space person, yeah I, hear you but I do think that it is in part under Sanitation, but it actually, the compost itself is used in parks and I.
So if Christine you have a question about district needs because of with regards to what K is bringing up we're gonna think about it for a minute.
If you can respond so okay support tonight, all right, so we're going to join the meeting, we're gonna, let Ryan take attendance.
