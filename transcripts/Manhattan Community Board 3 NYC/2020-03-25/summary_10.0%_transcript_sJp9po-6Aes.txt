I want to thank Clint, Meltzer and Joe currents for their help in getting us situated with this technology that we're using and their help in putting together the little guide that we sent out yesterday to you all and a new, a new way of us doing business, and we don't know how long anyway, we don't know how long it's going to last so, hopefully, as we continue to use it more and more, we will get better at it and work out any kinks and bumps along the road.
So what I'm gonna do is we heard from Andrew from the mayor's office Assemblymember Glick assembly, member Epstein, senator hoylman, senator Cavanaugh, councilmember chin, who told us they were going to be I, mean I, councilmember, Romero, who or who told us that they were going to be on the meeting?
Andrew, hey, alright, you want to get I'm going to let you go first from the mayor's office to give you a report so go ahead, and if I could just ask all of the electives and reports, I know you.
But if your question has been answered already by somebody else asking it just feel free to, let me know and we'll skip you and go to the next person all right and your dad yeah.
Yes, for the hi Andrew thanks for that report, I'm curious about what's happening or what the city is doing to follow up with parents who maybe don't have the technology to get their kids online or to even know that these meals available I, don't know, I know that the city was emailing everybody, but is there you just fill me in on or fill us in on, what's happening with that population of people who maybe are not clued in electronically to all the things the city's doing yeah?
First and then we're going to backtrack and do to people who are representing electives who couldn't join us so I know that Assemblymember Glick and Epstein we're planning on joining us either on it.
I just want to go first, but I mean I, see b3, it's good to see you all and I know it's a little odd that we're all doing this way, but I really appreciate you taking the time to meet the people and virtually and talk about so many important issues that are going on I mean the states in a mess.
We all know that right now we're about a week away from the state budget being finalized, and hopefully, if Congress resolves something in the next day or so we can get an agreement.
So the lots of cuts that are gonna be really hurtful over the next months and potentially years to come so I think just it's not a fun time.
It's not a good time, but it's a real situation with the revenue falling apart and you know not sure what the next incomes coming out of extending the filing dates for taxes, which is important to do New York is gonna, really suffer.
There's a lot of help, that's needed, and if you hear about things, just get it to us and we will figure out how to make sure that someone who is our whether it's food insecurity people afraid about the rain people, commercial business, is not sure how they're going to be able to keep their employees going or how they're gonna pay the rent.
We all need to figure it out together, and the hope is that if we keep communicating and keep talking, keep sharing information we'll come up with solutions, that'll be better for most of New York, but thanks everyone and I hope everyone can do the best they can with social distancing and it's a half climb with family.
So my question is about the two main concerns that we share from most people, that is, the rent is due on April, 1st and I know.
So this is one question and the other one is I know the bill was made public yesterday about the federal bailout people who I mean New York is full of gig workers that apparently are not covered by any unemployment and they're desperate they're desperate.
I do think it's a we're talking a lot about at the state level to figure out how we can protect as many people as possible on the rent side.
I. Think, what's good about the moratorium, you know hopefully people's our my letter last week and Brad's letter last week tried to create leadership on this around getting a moratorium going that we got 90 days.
Is we got a little time very one to breathe, so I know Ryan's coming do a professor a lot of folks, but luckily there's not no court case can be started as a moratorium on evictions and hopefully by eight ninety days or before ninety days we will be out of the crisis and won't be able to figure out what federal dollars available.
What City dollars are available to people who need help with rainy weather, there's a rent subsidy available right now there are things called one-shot deals and people have rent arrears, they lost their job and they can and they've now got a new job.
I, don't know because we don't know how long this is gonna last, whether that's gonna be sufficient or whether the city will have enough dollars, so we're gonna have to we're going to play that a little by ear and once we get past this, the second thing about making sure gig workers, it's something that we've been talking to the governor a lot about I know not just me, but I'm sure every city and state elected official has been saying.
I, don't a simple answer, because I'm not sure we can we're going to have the resources to keep the lights on at this point and that's really the question, and so, if we don't have the resources to keep the lights on, you know and then we're gonna have to start following more state employees or making the situation worse.
So, let's move on to Michelle Coopersmith's hi I, said a question if the Assembly is considering raising the 2% austerity cap in order to deal with this, and if there are any creative solutions about raising taxes on certain folks in order to try and compensate for the budget hole that you described that yeah.
Don't really understand why, especially since we could even say that they don't apply now, we could start them in January next year in people with special millionaires and billionaires won't even feel the 1 or 2 percent an increase in the income tax, but you know he's the driver in the budget in the state budget.
It so I think there's gonna lot of people who've been talking about revenue both in both houses and we've been pushing hard and long.
Think you know things like rent you know, holding off on rents of course makes sense in the mortgages as well, which is where I am, and a lot of people in the community are but I guess, I'm, assuming that you all are thinking about the domino effect of that right.
Think both on the Senate and we said we're going to see how many, how much federal dollars are gonna be put on the table, especially on health care, I, think the biggest problem we have is right now in health care and we're seeing the need for additional hospital services.
You know how do we have bonding authority to make this the financing work better for all of us and that's the question that no one has an answer to today, but we will have a need to have an answer by the end of the week.
But you know I think, probably by the weekend we will be back up in Albany and hopefully have a sense of what it looks like, but I don't have high expectations that we're gonna have enough resources.
If we cut back to the city in the city, we're just telling the city that they'd be able to turn the lights on so I think this is a real crisis overall facing and my answer is always if we can find new revenue sources and that's going to be the message I will continue to forth at Albany and I know that my colleagues will do that.
I know: Brad's been a real leader, Deborah's been a leader, you know, if you lean, we've all been trying to push this message out for our community I'm, just not clear it's coming through across the state, because there are lots of other districts that aren't like ours.
The board could say we want to put policy out of the budget a lot of things that board could do to help our state elected officials and then in the end, will help the city elected officials.
You know in this really difficult fiscal time and I hope that that's what CB 3 will continue to do because TV three has been a leader on these issues: Thank You Harvey.
The plans for what's happening on the testing ground well, I think that they, because the availability of tests is so reduced thanks to the slow response and actually the federal government saying no to the World Health Organization's offer months.
I've heard him discuss that as really the next step, because we think there are a significant number of New Yorkers who have been somewhat sick but have recovered and may have had kovin 19, and that would be very important to know, but you're right at the moment, they're not doing test widespread testing unless you're turning up with some symptoms at a hospital.
Thank you again, I'm wondering if you support senator sorry assembly, member yulie news bill to suspend rent payments for 90 days for residential and small business.
This is an emergency, so you know we I agree with the bill, but if it's not rolled into the budget, we're not going to be taking up individual bills, including my piet√† tare tax, which Brad hoylman and I have all right: Thank, You Assemblymember.
Everybody who filled it out and keep filling it out so we've been working, but you know just like all the other electives and all of you, we've been answering hundreds of phone calls with a great staff from the top to the bottom of Manhattan, and one of the things that I focus on over the weekend was because I have contacts when we save the garment Center.
Edc is doing the bedding and then they're sending those that are vetted to the Department of Health and to the OEM Office of Emergency, Management I think there's still a problem because departments that are working with the seniors that are now going delivery.
So I put a lot of focus into making sure that the health care workers have what they need and I think the city still needs to step up.
I think you know that it could list to 300 people together and then 500 to listen, and so we're very glad that so many community boards are using it and we're very glad that a hundred percent you should be very proud all twelve community boards are now virtual I, don't know if that's true in all the borough's I know it's true, Manhattan and I want to congratulate you and just finally, just some very local we're getting a lot of calls for I have space, because obviously the hospitals you heard earlier may be that the hospitals have to expand either fifty percent or a hundred percent.
We have brought those to the attention of the city, but there are websites where you do need to make sure that people know about them.
We are going to hold a virtual meeting with Pratt center there, of course, the facilitators of the community advisory group for the part before the end of the month, and we are continuing to make sure that the Lower East Side, ecology, centers compost yard his return to the park I feel very strongly about that, as does the mayor when he was asked about it.
So I think you know I could go on and on because there are so many calls coming into our office, but I think those are the issues that I wanted to be bring to your attention.
We have gotten quite a few requests for food from residents and buildings in community board three and we have been responding to them I think satisfactorily, but let us know I'm very focused on making sure that people food and we have gotten you know- I- have to say a lot of support from the mayor's office, we're giving them a lot of support, but we are making sure that every single person who contacts us gets an answer.
I know this whole county initiative thing came on for census, but since Kelowna just wanted to see what the update is with that I know some extra money trying to see the update later yeah I, haven't heard I, mean I, think we're all just trying to fill it out.
First of all, you know I just want to say I gal said it well, but you know really is great, that the board is convening- and you know this time when everybody's so dependent on the government responding well and not only to provide service and resources for all, but also information.
It's really great that you're, you know providing this forum for everybody, so I think Debra and Harvey gave you a pretty good sense of where we are with the biggest item at the state level, which is the budget.
Just think that need has obviously been you know, magnified massively by the public health crisis so and I think I want to emphasize.
There's been a lot of focus recent on this question of how people are going to deal with the fact that they can't pay their rent because they've been displaced but I.
Just there's a separate but related thing, which is, we really do need I, think it's an appropriate response to the public health situation to be trying to find ways to prevent people from having to live in congregate, settings and live in public places.
So I think that need is more urgent than ever and I continue to advocate for to address that either through the you know, through the standard budget process or through what I expect to be very substantial amounts of emergency funding that are going to come our direction.
In Albany that haven't been mentioned, we did expand unemployment, benefits and sick leave to make them easier for people to access by eliminating some of the restrictions on getting them, including you know, normally sickly, if you have to actually because if we sick to get it, but we made it clear that people who are you know, quarantined or otherwise, isolated also and as a result of that can't work could also get it get those benefits, and you know we made it easier for people to get unemployment, but again, I agree with Deborah Glick that we have a lot more to do to reduce barriers for those kinds of programs.
You know giving executive kind of unilateral authority, but many people thought that, in the midst of a crisis, it was important to do that and again I think you have seen the governor acting decisively and in ways that a lot of people I think appreciate that power.
I, just must say: our office has never going quick mentioned and Harvey we're all functioning everybody's remote, but our phones are routed to somebody who can actually answer the elected officials, including all the folks on this call, have really been coordinating closely and staying in touch and doing conference calls, in addition to being on the state why the City, Health Department calls were also coordinating with each other to make sure we're getting the best response and we've been surveying our senior centers in our educational institutions and our homeless providers and our hospitals and everybody to make sure that we are getting identifying issues they're having and making sure resources are available.
I just wanted to mention a few things that haven't you know that haven't been catch on exactly for my office.
So I'll share a link right now to a Google Doc that we've collected, you know close to 200 volunteers who are working and working with groups like God's love.
Almost everything we do get done is going to get done in the budget this year we would set a 10% cap at for an item that was a household medical-supply items such as hand, sanitizer wipes or Tylenol, so I'm hopeful that we can get that bill raised for the attention of the Senate and as they discussed these issues in the coming days on the budget.
We might see something like that in the budget we had obviously sent a letter as Bryan alluded to and got some action from the governor and the Office of Court Administration, but I've also I've, also written to the governor, seeking that he pause statutes of limitations for civil and criminal matters, because the courts are basically shut down and no claims can be filed unless there you know of the greatest urgency, so I'm hopeful that we'll see directive on that front during this crisis period and another bill that I've worked on.
So if you had particular issues and I know on the small business front, which was the fifth thing I wanted to mention, a lot of our small businesses are struggling.
I know that my colleagues are going to be working on that with me and then finally wanted to just mention or Caroline might just kill me that we, you know you can contact our office or the governor's office if you're, retired, medical professional, a lot of those individuals are being recruited to serve in hospitals and then I issued a letter recently to the FDA.
The hotlines you can call I would like to mention that there has been a spike in hate crimes against the asian-american community and the Attorney General Tish James has set up a specific hotline in connection with that, and we should all you know make certain that she be informed of any information in connection with that kind of absolutely outrageous and unacceptable response to this public health crisis.
The other thing, in addition to the senior hours that we've question, is to ask grocers to prevent courting you know the last thing you want to see if you're in a market and your senior is the guy in front of you, like you know, 35 year old with you know a case of paper towels right, so we've asked them to limit certain necessary items as well.
So there was a lot covered on housing and small business and taking care of you know the remote learning challenges that are happening in our Department of Education in our schools.
Just generally just earlier today, I assisted an organization to give out laptops, because some of the laptops that the do-e has given out are not working, so there are nonprofits that help with technology and so we're making sure that people have functioning tech while they're at home.
There have been a couple things going on in the council that we're trying to work on, as you know, we're a little bit limited in some of the things that we can do in terms of you know: executive orders, especially at the at the governor's level and even at the mayor's level, could really support and change a lot of the things that are happening right now.
However, you know these are all things that we've seen kind of unfold in the news and we are trying to be really receptive in terms of what we're hearing and people's needs, but you know things that we're trying to do in terms of my office.
They are taking great risks and probably risking bankruptcy, and they are, they have converted their manufacturing because they know it's the right thing to do and they're hoping to have citywide level production of things like face shields and gowns and hand sanitizer, and they even developed a prototype for a do-it-yourself ventilator.
It's is stressful, but for all of our small businesses or cultural institutions or cultural workers that are taking a very big hit, we will be negotiating a budget that will look probably a lot different than last year, but I will be making all of these organizations and all of the things that I know we need a priority.
I think that we're going to have a serious food shortage, I mean we have some of our larger organizations that distribute via pantries and buy wholesale now competing with larger companies and corporations and getting out bidded on food, and so things are getting more and more expensive and I'm very worried about our low-income families and our seniors and making sure that we have our schools up and running in our senior centers up and running community-based organizations are stretched very thin and they they're worried about deliverables and their contracts, and so they're doing their best to make it work and I just want to thank everyone.
Half of my family's in Italy right now and the other half is in Greece, as you know, so, from the lessons that we learned from there is a lot that we need to bear in mind and I'm wondering whether you have already started looking at the possibility of following Italian France and asking private health care facilities that may be needed very soon, because the peak is fire is 1020 days away from here and we're already at 40,000 people idiots.
Looking larger donations go to the office of emergency management headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, but as I'm getting smaller donations, you know I'm just trying to make sure that they are taking care of our neighbors, who aren't necessarily gonna.
Go to the hospital I mean you shouldn't, go to the hospital right, you're supposed to stay home and I think that people are not respecting that message, and that is a part that I think frustrates me and angers us, the most that you know today.
We actually have a number of questions for you: okay, Councilwoman, but okay, the next one's going to be coming from our Board Chair, Alicia, hey Carlina.
I just wanted to just say that we are dealing with so much more than what everyone is aware of coming from the inside of stupids and just making sure that people are aware that they're also frontline workers working in these kitchens.
Let me that is because the people that I have spoken to and thank you so much for your work, I- think that you know for all of our are like do-e and employees who are going in and still working every single day from 7:30 to 1:30.
All of these frontline are essential workers that grocery store workers, who don't have the equipment as well in terms of being able to call out sick I mean that is your right, and if there is this, weird kind of you know like cycle that they're putting you through that doesn't allow you to take yourself.
You could follow up with me even via text or if you could call me, and let me know, kind of what happens and I won't have to name anyone, but I could say this is happening right now and someone isn't feeling well.
So I know that, given the numbers that are coming out here in the city and in the state, my question is this: so I know that there's conversation about trying to mobilize Javits, Center and large-scale centers create beds for folks who are in need of treatment and services.
I guess I want to try to figure out what we can do as a community board to support using facilities like the former revention house to be able to get there's a couple hundred feds that can be done.
So all of these spaces that people have recommended I want you to know that we have sent them to the mayor and the governor everything from Rivington house to the Mount Sinai Beth Israel buildings that are there two large gymnasiums, two even just open fields that we could potentially put a tent, which is what they're doing outside of many hospitals.
Even when someone knows someone who has a factory in China like I've, actually called people and said how is this connection?
We are calling many people who we know don't necessarily have internet who aren't watching the news as often and quite frankly, maybe watching Fox News isn't the best idea right now, so we're just making sure that people understand where they can go and get a meal.
People are taking volunteers at some of the larger organizations that distribute meals to go like God's love we deliver, but we can connect you to those opportunities as well that that's you know pretty much supporting our local cultural institutions.
If you, if you want to do that, our local businesses, if you can and just letting us know if you have a line to resources and we'll try to or like really coordinate interagency wise, has the mayor's office in the governor's office been kind of working in tandem?
Some of that relief is going to be, but we really feel like it's our obligation to think of how we're gonna be able to send cash into people's pockets, which is what they're gonna need after this is a public health crisis and an economic crisis all rolled into one and we are drastically behind and where we need to be to kind of to stop the spread all right, Carly, no, we've got four more questions for you, so I'm going to ask people.
Okay, can you hear me yeah, okay, Carlina, thank you for following up to stop the cleanup that was scheduled for a homeless, encampment I'd like to know what is the status?
People saying you will be asked to move when it is illegal to do that so based on Thank, You Susan for your question so based on your you know, guidance and recommendations.
Next I Thanks Carlina, really appreciate everything, you're doing I guess my main question is: do you know what the hospital capacity is in New York City right now?
You've heard this I am wondering if we could ask those construction workers and those unions and those luxury developers if they would offer their employees in this crisis, to help us build these sites that we need, like Rivington house but I'm sure there are other ones and then lastly, I just want to say on the last bit: we've posted signs in our Park.
Think that not only could those workers be, you, know coordinated to do an effort of actually obstructing I mean constructing, like tents and things that we need to create these hospitals, but if not, they also have a ton of protective equipment that I think that our hospitals can use so I reached out to multiple unions about this and said: if you have just extra equipment, can you please send it to the hospitals?
Doctor's note I, think that was put up by do HMH because they now realize that people are not going to be able to get tested, but they could still be sick, so that could be helpful for a lot of people.
However, obviously a lot of people are not going to know that note.
I'm really trying to stay on top of everything and I and I really think everyone for kind of just bringing up things that we have maybe been working on, but we haven't been able to really relay so I'm gonna.
The Manhattan borough advocate for the New York City public advocate's office, Manhattan born and raised, and I worked with community organizer Lila maiya, who also lives in the Lower East Side and was in the Bowery mission.
With her last week, volunteering around food in the Lower East Side very touched by what's going on, and the participation in this board and I will make a commitment to make sure that at least you I'll try to do my best to get the public advocate to see.
If you can join one of the board meetings and also want to give a shout out to all of the electeds who some of who I know.
Personally I've met over time recently, - miss -, City Councilman Rivera, who we're working closely with her office and her chief of staff talking to the hospitals checking in with them getting updates so that we can reinforce the messaging.
He checks in with us every single day to make sure that we're doing our job and people know about what we're doing and just yesterday, I'll also send this over.
I've been very touched by how some a lot of ordinary people stepping up and taking up heroic, grows to volunteer and to help those in need, just like probably all the elected office right now have been connecting with groups of volunteers.
I know that last week the mayor's office of contract services sent a system-wide letter to all providers about their leniency on meeting any deliverables utilization rates, as well as a commitment to provide reimbursement and I'm happy to share that letter with anybody here who is working very closely with a CBO that is concerned so senior centers.
So this is just a pilot right now, with only a few centers in each borough that are opted in who have that kind of capacity who had the refrigerators to keep the food, for example, and the man's I know that Bronx as a borough started yesterday, Manhattan this today and all of the other boroughs are going to be piloted tomorrow.
Negotiating team will be fighting against that I think what all these providers need right now is just reassurance that they will be made whole and you more than that cash advances and commitments that you know, contracts that they were promised for fiscal year, twenty or even fiscal year.
We have a couple of questions for you, the first one's going to be coming from Diaz, hey, hi, Marion I wanted to ask about the pilot program again.
There aren't any plans to expand that program even more, because I think we're just waiting to see how it goes so, we'll let you know how it goes for me up: Thank You. Our next question is coming from students.
Okay, and should we assume the community boards are going to be included in that I think just right now, they're whisperings and you know once we get more of a clear idea right now, all of the budget hearings I think if there was any you know, clear-cut plan being articulated by the administration, we'd be hearing a we're hearing them at the budget hearings, but I think we're just taking this one day at a time once we get more information, we'll definitely keep you up to date.
We are we're already two hours in right, but thank you all for coming out tonight and online as we are getting used to this new technical type of communication for our board and I just want to just give a quick personal thanks to Susan and the office staff and Clint and Michael.
You know still stay there for a long period of time, because they don't want us going into close proximity of people also if there are any single mothers or single fathers that are struggling with having their children home all day long.
Do it one of the people we work there at calls Saint Joe, because they say he's the most important man in my life, so I just want to be sure to think do it in their staff for helping us be able to continue to do our work and that's it unless their question I have a question for may Susan.
You know, certainly don't give it to anybody that calls you yeah all right.
You know I think we have an opportunity, you know about what: how do we define small businesses, and so it's very general and I- don't have an amendment but I wanted to ask that question to the committee.
How are we defining a small business because you know, let's the same, is what the Senate the Congress is going through.
Think one thing that we have to realize about the these particulars, so one is a grant right and that's to cover 40% of your payroll for small businesses with one to four employees.
If we I mean I would like to say yes, we can open up to businesses that have up to ten employees, but I, don't think the city has the funds for it.
They're gonna have to find it and it's something: that's very time-sensitive, so just putting a no threshold on it saying like any businesses, I, don't agree with, but I still think it's kind of a pipe dream, but I'm willing to go up to like I'm, okay, with the amendments to say up to ten employees.
So we need I think to add one sentence towards the end of this resolution and say you know the smallest proximal businesses are, of course, independent contractors, et cetera, and for that community board.
I can work on language when I focus later, but I wanted to raise it because before we vote on it I don't know I mean.
Should we discuss that further, because I'm feeling like that, might need to be a separate I, don't know what does everyone think leer soap?
We don't do resolutions like introduce new resolutions at full board, not that I know of but again I think that this should be something separate, because tonight we're just dealing with the small business.
That means we're not gonna ever deal with this right, because it's Olympia I didn't say we were never going to deal with it, but I'm saying that right now we're dealing with what's going on hands the one the one being presented to us tonight that came before us tonight, okay, I didn't say that we weren't gonna deal with it Alistair did you still have a comment you wanted to make yes I know.
We have Jackie Wong now and I also don't think the contract issue of fitting resolutions that we are discussing tonight and also since Union news office representative, mentioned a little bit earlier that there going to be some amendments about the view so I, actually don't I, feel like I, don't know enough about how this rent freeze and also how that would have fat at the Leno's.
So, like Robin talked a little bit earlier, this is going to be a domino effect how the Lando's are going to pay their mortgage in and so I think I would want to wait until the whole bill comes out to talk about like how do we help them like different groups of people?
I'm, not I, know that we have limited meetings coming up next month because the genders have already to be put together, but let's continue the conversation with Olympia.
I can send you the information, but my concern here is my understanding and if there is anybody who knows better than me, the state I'm more familiar with City Council, but the state the session is ending in six days and if we have any representatives so this legislation that has been introduced by January annually new, even if there's gonna, be amendments, they're gonna be done like within the next four or five days so I mean, of course we can discuss it.
But fundamentally we do want to help these people right now.
Would like as much you know, conversation to be happening about this horrible problem that people are gonna be facing in six days from now, and so, if you think that's supporting it and being voted down, it gives it some air, let's vote on it, but fundamentally I.
What could be helpful to the conversation is to know that there are major efforts happening all around the city, including housing, justice for all, which is asking for not only a red freeze but red forgiveness and so I think, there's a few things to be noted here.
I think what we have to be calling for also is for relief to be given to all those institutions, because, as you will believe, one and two see another one hurts, and so what we need to be doing is asking both the state and the federal government to make sure that, in whatever relief packages come to New York moving forward- and maybe this is a pipe dream- maybe it's not that there be additional resources that are there targeted specifically for things I rent, because you know you can ask for you could give somebody, you know a rent freeze, but if they lost their job, that doesn't mean they're not going to face eviction later on and equally, you know if the landlord is not receiving any rent, how do they pay for operations?
I didn't understand, suggesting that we're not doing this right now, because we have this resolution on the table and we need to deal with this particular resolution and for the sake of time it is already 9:30 and I think that a bunch of people did not intend on being on this zone for more than a couple of hours.
You know we're not going to be promoting events or anything like that unless we're co-sponsoring an event, but it also gives the further guidance on who needs to approve posts before they are able to go on to any of our social media.
You know we've been, we posted some pictures of some of our meetings and things like that.
This is the first time for many of us using this to practice to read some manuals or our parks meeting, because it will I, don't know how long it's going to take, but I don't want to go too late for two agenda items and that was it okay, helping Human Services, no hello.
So it's not about this ex crossing is about the new business that I raised on the chat and David wrote that there is a specific way in which we could call a meeting if a covet 19 think arises in the next few weeks, and we wish to have a meeting if you want to explain as this David if the executive is not the best way to resolve it, what should we do if there is some issue that we need to support as community board?
You know where we might want to object to that right away, I, don't know, but you're talking about more normal things and I'm, not sure if we were to schedule a meeting.
I. Think that, basically, as David was saying you know, we, the exec committee, took on some resolutions on an emergency basis at our exec meeting last week, because committees did not meet because of what was happening with people sheltering at home and not wanting to go out and all the uncertainty that was happening.
The ideal is that the committee does the work on whatever resolution that they're bringing to the full board, so the issue I believe in Libya that you know the second amendment that you wanted to make to that resolution about independent contractors and gig workers.
You know I think that is something that needs to go to your committee to come up with the resolution for to bring to the board and if, for some reason the committee doesn't meet this month and I'm, not sure I, don't know the calendar, it's not in front of me, Susan's raising her hand so I'll.
Let her tell us what the calendar is, but you know then, and possibly the exec can work on it Susan do you want to clarify two things?
Think, though, that on this one thing, then, if you were to find something Olympia, that youth really thought the exact needed to consider- and it was just days before the meeting we could put it on to the you know.
Don't know why no thinking you're on so is he going yes Richard?
