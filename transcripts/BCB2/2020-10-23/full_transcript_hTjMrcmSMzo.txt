I get Irene's there I understand and Karen. I think I heard your voice. Yes, I am here: okay, great thanks, Karen, okay, so you're ready we're ready, let's go with it: 81 Pierpont, Street and 35 love lane in Brooklyn heights, historic district, the applications to excavate the rear yard of 81 pierpont and new and rear yard at stellar at 35 lovely to create a new sub, a subgrade, yes interior, including a new lot line window and a new whether they have here opening the east or secondary facade facing the passageway and to make up mainly windows and doors in the front and rear facade at 35 love lane in the same area. I guess areas as a new opening. Okay go ahead. Whoever is the Presenter Michael before you start. You know, since we were being somewhat familiar with each other, while waiting for the committee to make Quorum. I just want to announce that we've started recording the meeting so we'll all tighten it up a little bit and any board members who have the ability to show their faces while they're on whatever device they're on. Please do so in the spirit of the New York State, open meetings, law thanks and we make a motion to approve tonight's agenda. Oh there's that, okay! So all right, I know I'll. Second, this motion, I guess, have you, I guess, there's any objection. If the no objections, let's proceed again, I I Irene is there as co- chair, our great secretary Karen Johnson is on and I'm Carl from Gordon. So, let's you know the presenter for Pierpont and love go right ahead. All right! Thank you. So I'm Michael, Linguy from backstage architects also on is Mark Fabrice who's, the project manager working on this project. One thing I just want to just throw out: okay, thank you! I just and I just because I had so much trouble logging. There was one thing I just wanted to make sure before when you can as you're proceeding since you're doing excavation. That's going to that may affect your neighbors residential commercial people, property owners. I just want to make sure if you have notified your neighbors or the people around that at tear point and leveling that you're going to be doing excavation work. I think that's the top thing I have before anything that we just see with anything else. Great yeah. No, I agree with you so the way we start all projects, excavation or no excavation landmarks and other landmarks we actually meet with both neighbors on both sides. In this case, we have a third side, which is, which is the back, so we've met with we've met with or spoken to, both the neighbor next to 81, pierpont, 35, leveling and there's a large condo car building to the right. In several cases, we've already been in touch with their engineer and we're going to be going to the Condo Board. I think on Monday to talk to them a little bit more, so we've already been in contact with them and we've already met with the Brooklyn Heights Association. I'm glad to hear that, yes, I understand Judy Stanton is going to be on with us. I do not have the list of names in front of me, but it's she said she would be here and she will also present the results. Okay, that's great to hear. Thank you. Okay, all right go ahead, Mr Presenter! All right thanks, you know, I think I may have closed that screen here. One second, you should be seeing the front page of the of the drawings right now, it's up great, so just to familiarize kind of what the properties you've got. 81 purepont, which is a relatively newly renovated townhouse. That's on pierpont, here's the front stoop, there's a rear, two- story, edition here and here's the rear yard, and then you have love lane behind it with the carriage house and what we're planning to do is do excavation both in the yard below this edition and below love lane we're also renovating lovely. So just some pictures of what we're looking at here is the carriage house on love lane the front of the house. You can see it is actually a sister house. Both of these buildings have lived. Multiple lives have been renovated, at least three or four times in one case they were renovated and the entire facade was renovated different owners, but they must have made a deal with the contractor at the time. The rear of the house is quite interesting. We have better pictures kind of coming up, but is it the rear? Facade of the carriage house has some interesting details on it and then what you can see in the bottom right is the alleyway. That's next to us. We have better pictures of all this coming up. So a little a few close- up pictures of the rear facade of that carriage house. As you can see, there was a rose window to the left of this rose window. There were openings that have been closed up at multiple points, there's a bathroom window that was here that, where there's no longer a bathroom, this is in fact a double height space now, so this has had a lot of work done to it, as has the car just next to it. You can see the car just next to it actually has some openings in these arches already and has a large deck rear facade of 81 pierpont. Besides the fact that we, when we replace this, we're going to wind up with a blue stone, rear yard, the hope is that the rear yard does not look dissimilar to this fence. Brick wall with blue stone, but we will be excavating below this and I'll talk about that in a second here's that alleyway again that I described that's next to both buildings, 81 pierpont 35, left leveling. It mentions a lot line window that we're going to be installing. There are already a bunch of lot line windows in 81 and we're going to be putting another one in right. Over here, it'll be frosted glass, it'll, be security glass. You can see it both here and there it's visible from the street. If you look down into the alley other things that we're proposing right now. This has been left as the masonry wall below the fence has been left as just kind of an exposed. Concrete block. Not really well done. So we're going to wind up, coating that and coating this whole wall and to make it just look a little bit more finished for the folks at the condo and co- op. Some work that we plan to do on the facade of love lane. We plan to replace the limestone lintel, it's cracked in a number of locations and we plan to do new windows and doors as a marvin, double Hung or a similar company new garage door, the garage door. That's currently, there is not operable they're, actually not using it as a garage they're using it as an art studio, and we will be replacing the windows and doors on both these sides to match a similar arrangement. That was here, but at one point the brick was removed and we're not we're not reinstalling it, the rear facade. You can see to the left before where you can see that rose window, which is really kind of at knee height. It's kind of an interesting and weird location. The right side shows the proposed, where we're going to be putting some windows in those arches with a new door, we're actually narrowing this opening and kind of aligning it with the window. Above you can see the house next door has done something similar, and then this just shows that you know the blue stone that we'll be using, and if you do not mind, I'm going to jump to the section and then come back to all this, because I think the section describes what we're doing better than everything else does so right now this is 81 pierpont. This is 35 leveling 81 pierpont has a seller space already that goes partially under the two- story. Edition love, Lane does not have a seller, and what we're doing is we're connecting the two via taking out a seller, there's no change to the yard arrangement or to anything that can that's visible, hopefully, even when we're done, except for that window that we're adding in, but we are going to wind up connecting them through the seller space. We're going to be continuing the dig out at the level of the existing seller all the way through, and we are going to wind up putting a swimming pool in that connection. So I think this kind of describes it better than all the other images. We're also going to be one wind up, doing a lot of interior work to this carriage house and we're going to be installing air conditioning units that won't be able to be seen from anywhere I'm going to go to the plan. Now, if you do not mind so here's the plan of that yard, you can see here's 81 pierpont, the yard, love Lane, here's where the car would pull in and then here's the floor below grade where we're making that connection. So this is a newly dug out connection. That'll allow us to walk through there'll, be a stair that goes up and out to the street or into the garage and there's a room underneath this as well just some more interior elevations just to go into what the facade looks like and what's visible. This is what that side facade looks like now. You can see. There's some existing line windows are there already? You can see the unfinished kind of concrete block, the fence that does not continue and what we're proposing is to is to continue this wall finish. It cleanly continue that fence finish it cleanly, and you could see this new, this new window being proposed and that's the presentation I mean I can go into anything in more detail, but- and maybe it's better if you have questions okay, thank you. Let me hear from Judy to see what you think and and then we'll take from any all the other committee members. But let's judy, if you're there the floor or the internet, is yours. Any luck on that hello am, I being heard. Maybe she had to release a microphone? Are you unmuting me? Please Carlton whoever's in charge, yeah I'm on a lousy cell phones but yeah. I can you know Judy, okay, good, all right. Our committee did review this at quite at some length. Really we did and the even though the excavation is frightening, the everybody felt that vaccine. We have a good team in place there. The adjoining neighbors have engineers and it's a good, so we're satisfied that they will do that very carefully and it'll be very well monitored. As for the changes to the rear facade, most people on the committee thought that it's a little busy quite a lot of new windows being added and but their main request of the team, and I do not know if you've done this yet Michael was to tell the story of the changes to the carriage houses more clearly in their presentations. I mean obviously they've been altered, but we we've done a lot of tax photo research and Jeremy Lesson has pretty much researched every single building in the Brooklyn knights, historic district and he's done a lot of work on these properties, and so we think that that's the story of the changes to the rear carriage houses should be told more clearly so that commissioners can better evaluate whether or not all these windows is appropriate in this application. These are unusual arches in the back. That's unusual for characters, at least we think so, and so we wanted to see a more clearly presented history of alterations to the back, which can be done a little more thoroughly with the way they're. With that using the additional tax photos. I think that's what Jeremy could do and since we can, I answer it. Should I wait it's up to you guys yeah go right ahead. Yeah, since we met with with the Brooklyn Heights Association, we've added the elevation of the building next to us. We did not have this during that presentation and it did not show that it did not show that openings had already been kind of made in a similar way to the house to the left, and I think that's what Jeremy was describing and it did not have close- up images of the doors and how that actually, this new brick in a number of locations above you can kind of see this rose window. I think I can zoom in yeah. So as you get right above the rose window, you can actually see there was a door here. Once there was another rose window there used to be a window where there's now event, so we did not have a lot of that in our presentation with the Brooklyn Heights association. So we've added that and then at the front, facade we've actually changed this duty. Thanks to the presentation. In fact, actually I think Jeremy. I think he actually provided one of these photos. I think the middle one, but we this kind of shows kind of the what's happened to the houses since where this was taken in the late 50s. This was taken, I think in the late 70s and you can see the brick is still there and then you can see it was removed at some point when they just redid the facade. In fact, you can see it did not. At that point it did not have a lintel and did not even have red brick. So someone did quite a bit of work to both of these, and so what we're proposing is to keep the openings that they've created, restore that limestone, lentil and kind of move from there. Okay, you talk about the front now right, yeah. I went from back to front sorry Judy, okay, all right, but Judy. Overall, I guess the Brooklyn Heights Association, yes, could live with the application. Yes, okay, any other committee members or black members, yes, John, Dew, Love Lane is a Cul- de- sac. Is it still a cul- de- sac? Leveling goes through no, it's the first street John. It goes behind cvs. It goes through the henry. It goes through the henry yeah, the carriage. I know what you're thinking of the Cul- de- sac is college place when you entered love lane from hicks yeah, that's correct, there's a cul- de- sac of I do not know how many yards in from the from Hick Street, and that is a Cul- de- sac. So the college place had a parking facility at one point. Judy. Is that raining? No, that was converted to condos? Oh hell's, the old garage? Yes, oh because I remember the garage over by Loveland. So that's! Oh, that's not a condo. I did not realize that yeah yep. I think we saw that we saw that presentation. Yeah time flies. Okay, any other committee members. I have a question. I have a question about the Lot lion window, you're, adding I'm assuming that is at the pool. Is that correct? Yes, so I see in your diagram or your drawing is showing it as operable, but I guess it should not. It should not be sorry. Okay, yeah. That was one of my questions, so we'll fix it, of course, but I did it did lead me to another question which is about the ventilation and exhaust for the pool, and I do not know. I know it's not under the purview of LPC, but can you just quickly describe how that's going to be vented, since these are not operable windows, yeah actually pools pools? Need I mean positive and negative to having an indoor pool positive. Is it's fun to use the negative? Is it requires a lot of constant ventilation? They create constant moisture that in some cases you, if you're, if you're smart about it, you can kind of reuse in the winter for humidity, but for the most part it needs kind of constant flow, both in the water and in the air. The unit that we're putting is going to actually be underground, that does that ventilation, it'll be kind of in the pool area and the vent for it is going to be right here and actually, by the time it's vented, it provides very little moisture or or air or fumes, it's actually pretty heavily filtered. It's actually a very it's also a very low velocity fan, which is why they did not mind it kind of coming out right into the yard. It does not. It does not blow out a lot of sound. Like a kitchen exhaust doctor, we had that same question. We were satisfied with the answer. Great may I have a follow- up question which is about the excavation. I know that LPC does not have purview really over how construction is staged, but I'm wondering if you can talk about your approach to excavating beneath, because it is quite scary when you've got two existing buildings and you're excavating below their existing foundation. But can you just talk about that quickly, yeah, so there's actually a couple of different conditions that we're dealing with oops with a couple of different conditions that we're dealing with here and then the important piece is in order to be a contractor that works on one of our townhouses. You have to have already done what we're doing so. Nobody who's anybody who's. You know. Actually we already know what the contractor is for this and he's done excavation before so. Whoever would work out with us has already done excavation like this. It's done by hand, I mean sometimes they'll bring in a very small machine to help lift dirt in the center, but it's done by hand in five gallon bucket, so it's actually a relatively slow process in New, York, City, and so what we have here is we have a two- story addition in this area and we have a then we have a yard wall right here and then we have a two- story carriage house here. Both these will be handled in a similar way, where we're going to wind up underpinning the walls where this will get one two three underpins done at completely separate times and same with. This will actually probably get eight underpins done like where one here and one there and then two you know when they set so it's a relatively slow process and as the excavation occurs, they're constantly pinning those walls to make sure that everything's stable when it when underpinning's done slowly and carefully, I mean nobody around, you should know you're even doing it besides the dirt removal, which is annoying. You know again it's different when you're using big equipment like in the city, where or in larger buildings, where you've got enough of a lot and a lot of space to bring a bobcat in every everybody will know you're there. But in this case, for better or worse, it's done with a lot of a lot of five gallon buckets anything else, audrey not for me, okay, any other committee members have any, and can you ask first of all how old is that building the carriage house itself? Yes mark? You have to unmute yourself and correct me when I, when I say this, but I believe it's 1850s Okay Jeremy said 1853 Michael yeah, as I think as well. Okay, and my only question for you is, if you can ask the applicant, if they could ask the owner, if there can be a public pool in the summertime, it's a good idea. Yeah. We could use one motion to approve okay, any questions on the motion problems. If not, I guess Rob, I guess you will have to do the roll call, I'd be happy to Mr Gordon and I will do it in alphabetical order because that's the order. That's on the participant panel sure, however Mr Washington Mr Paris, I'm going to just abstain because I was late to getting on with technical difficulties, understood Mr Howell, like Mr Washington, I'm going to abstain because I was late. Thank you, Mr Gordon, yes, Ms, Carter, Christopher, yes, Mr Augustus! Oh yes, Miss Blaum! I'm sorry, I'm my camera. I can't get on with the camera, but I apologize I'll fix that next time, and so you are abstaining. Yes, okay, Miss Janner! Yes, Mr do yes, Ms stanton Yes and miss Johnson. Yes! So no abstention. I mean no opposition, Mr Gordon and a small number of abstentions. The motion passes. What's that eight was that seven and eight I lost count. I will give you the number in a second okay, all right. So thank you very much, but it's motion passes and we'll just wait for when Rob is gets me the we'll move on in the. Meanwhile, we have a presentation. Information presentation for 98 third avenue, which is a rezoning, 2, zero, three zmk and two zero: three: six z: okay, it's just an informational. It's like it's understanding, it's at 98, 3Rd avenue right by Bergen, Street sort of like on the border. If you want to think of it between downtown Brooklyn and Borum, Hill, yeah, hello, anybody, yes! So before we give the pineapple to Mr Palatnik I'll, tell you Mr, Gordon that the vote was seven in favor and unopposed, three abstentions, with Mr Dew moving the motion and miss Stan, seconding and Eric Black is the attorney for Adam Wolf. Who is the applicant they're both on the call and they are ready to proceed? Okay, how many in favor on the pierpont love? Again, I missed that seven: okay, seven, zero! Three; okay! Thanks a lot: Rob: okay, okay, 98, third avenue the internet's yours, hello! Thank you! Hopefully you can hear me. Okay, my name is I'm the attorney representing Bill Wolf Petroleum with us here today is Adam Wolfe of Bill Wolf Petroleum and his architect, Brian Newman of Newman Architects, and the Gentleman named Austin. Corey is our colleague who is flipping the screen, we're here today in an informational basis, to ask you, for your permission, to rezone the block front between bergen and wyckoff, on Third Avenue to an R7D zoning district that would be analogous to the R7A district, that's all around it and to the wyckoff Gardens development that you could see in the backdrop that you're all familiar with this is a gas station. That's currently a gas station. It's currently a shell gas station. It's five thousand square feet before I go even further. I just want to refresh your memory if any of this feels like deja vu all over again. It's because your board heard this application in June of 2015 when it was born and brought to you as a variance to the border standards and appeals. It was not successful at the border stands in appeals in the sense that it did not meet or they felt it did not meet the hardship requirements and the financial burden that goes along with that, so because it did not meet the hardship requirements of a variance. We withdrew that application and we've refi or filed a rezoning for the block front and I'll go through that in a moment with you and show you everything. So if we can click to the next screen, Austin and Austin as a matter of fact, if you can click to the screen that has about three or four five in it's got all the words on it got a picture with all the words that describes all the buildings. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going there, you go okay, so hopefully everybody can see the screen here. What what's on now you have an image that should refresh everybody's memory of what's going on in the area and what's happening around us, the site is depicted in the middle, obviously, with the word site on it behind us, the two- story. Factory building is Yolano corporation. That is not a part of the rezoning, the area that is the part of the middle, where it says project area. The far left of the block front. That's within the project area on wyckoff was just recently purchased a couple years ago by a doc, who, I believe, has a fertility clinic in that building and he just renovated that the right side of the block is our property. The properties in between are leased by Iolano from the city and they're owned by the Department of city-, wide administrative services, so Austin, and actually one more thing before you click Austin. I wanted to point out in this slide the two residential buildings which are analogous in scale to what we're asking permission for one is on the corner of bergen and third, which is shown mark, there's eight story residential building and you can see if you go to the next corner on white coffin. Third, again, you have an eight- story, residential building those residential buildings surrounding us all sprung up from the R7A burum hillary Zoning, which took place many years ago at this point austin, if you just keep clicking now to the pictures, actually go back one screen the tax map is helpful. Okay, so this gives everybody an idea. This slide should show everybody very clearly what we're asking you permission to do. Obviously, the shaded area in the middle- this is R7D is the area that will be re- zoned. You could see. Our lot is outlined there in red on the left side of the tax lots. You can see an area, that's marked r6b, that's existing already. You probably did not pay attention to it before and I'll call it out as we move through more maps and whatnot, but that existing r6b is there. But what's important to note is that city planning asks us to clean up that map. So if you look where the R6B intersects, with the R7D on like off you'll, see that portion in the middle, where the dotted line goes around, that's pushing the R6B forward a little bit and shortening the distance there so that it's consistent with the R7D district. So it's just a little bit of cleaning up in the map that city planning asked us to do. You can go to the please Austin on the top left. You can see the site more of its splendid glory in the lower left. You could see the site not really the site, just the nip the tip of it. But more importantly, you can see the eight- story residential building across the street, so you can get a sense for the scale awesome if you just sort of click through these slides, it's okay, you do not have to spend that much time. I think everybody has been or seen the block front. It's pretty much. What I just described with the 21 story, white, cough gardens behind you and the eight story, residential buildings and then at the factory behind us. If you can just stop Austin right, I think there is a great shot to stop on for a second again. That just gives you the scale. The top side to the left gives you the side of the block front where the doctor just finished, renovating or at the time of the photo the fertility clinic I mentioned. So that's on the corner of third and wyckoff, and you can see wyckoff gardens on the left side. That's also. The bike off guard is, of course, depicted on the lower left and the top right is the is the building that's Caddy corner across the street from that and again just showing you the scale of what's going on or what you know better than we do. You keep cooking now. I think, for the plans to get the when we go right to the plans. That'd be great, keep going, keep going I'll, go back, one go to the zoning map. Actually, please there you go okay, so just so, everybody can be clear again on what we are asking you to vote on or not to vote, but at least to get familiar with. We are not yet found in city planning, we're not yet certified. Excuse me, we have a draft application pending. I should have been clear about that at the beginning, so we hope to be certified in the next couple of months. We hope two three months four months, but in that respect the map you see in front of you is a map, we're going to ask them to certify and that's why we're coming to you ahead of time. That map shows you what I just showed you on the tax map and just shows it to you in the form of a zoning map. The left hand side is existing. The right hand. Side is proposed the left- hand side. You can see the r6b I mentioned before in the middle of the block there. That's existing we're, not messing with that, except to fix the edges, as I mentioned a moment ago. So that's part of the action you'll see the word r6b, but the bulk of the action is to allow for the R7D over the block front. You'll notice there prominently is the is the other letters and words R7A and R6A all around us. So I think that helps support our request. Please Austin, to the plans. This is the building you've seen before nothing has changed. There was a vote of 36 in favor five years ago. Nothing has changed on the plan since then. It's the same building, it's an eight- story. Building it's 85 feet tall. It's proposed to include 24 units of those 24 units stick either six of them will be affordable if it's it if it's at a 25. If it's excuse me, this is the option one of the MIH program or it will include eight affordable units of the 24. If the program is option two of the MIH, and that's, of course, for you and the councilman to decide- and that's of course something that's different than the variance request to the board of standards and appeals. Is there was no affordable component when we brought the application to the border, stand as it appeals. So when we withdrew that and we came to city planning, we come to you into city planning, with the knowledge that we will be providing affordable housing, and that was not proposed to begin with in the original incarnation that you voted to support, and it is now the please Austin. This is just the statistics that I just mentioned. Please to get the I know this is all boring stuff. This starts to get you to some of the some of the exciting stuff up the screen, I'm just trying to get it zoomed in a little bit. This shows you the site plan. It gives you a pretty good image of. What's going to be going on the property, it shows you where the setbacks are. The entrance is going to be on on the side street. It's going to be the residential engine will be there. The commercial will be on Third Avenue, so Bergen will have the arrest entrance where the lobby will be and the commercial front on third, which is the longer part of the plan that you're seeing in front of you please austin. This just gives you the seller level, it's not very exciting, it's your typical seller, storage, Recreation, Space, Exterior, storage, space, etc. Here you can see the retail space which I spoke about a moment ago about 3,000 square feet of retail. The rezoning would include a c2 overlay, a c24 overlay and the residential lobby. You can see there is on the Bergen Street side. Please here you can start to see the layout of the building as it's as it goes up it notches out in the back and elves around where that's, where the light wells, the rear yard. So to speak is so you can have the units that'll front on third and you'll also have windows that go out against the back there. So if you can, please go on and look at the please. This shows you the shows you the third. Through the sixth floor, you should be at third through sixth floor again, it's showing you the same configuration from the third through the sixth and I can't really tell on the screen that I'm on you appear to be now on the seventh floor plan and the seventh floor plan shows you where it starts to set back now, you can go forward again there. You go good, okay, yeah, all right. If you scroll a couple of pages forward. This gives you an image of what the building looks like. It shows you all the setbacks. This is giving you an image of the building as if you're standing on third avenue. So this is what you would third avenue it's very similar and it's outlined to what's across the street very similar. I can't say that Brian's done anything, that's much different than what's around and the site does not give him much room to so, but he's using very nice materials and he's on the call and he'll be happy to talk about his facing materials that he's planning on using the remainder of the screens are basically just reiterations of what we just showed. You Austin, I think, if you go to the end, it's got a beautiful rendering at the end, or it should- and this is not all underlying in the bomb- Hill Historic district. No, it is not yeah, it's not okay, it is not. That is that's the conclusion of our presentation. Thank you for giving me so much time. Okay, thank you. Does any of the committee Members Board members have any questions. If not, then thank you very much for 98 third avenue. Obviously I have a question yeah. I noticed that the surrounding rezonings were like r6 r6b you're going for R7. What is the distinction of why you chose the seven as opposed to the six? Actually, it's not I'm not being argumentative, I'm just correcting you, and often, if you go back to the zoning change map, which is at the start of the plans, it's right before page one of the plans up that map will show you that around us across the street is in fact r7a. So if you could see clearly all of third Avenue around us is in fact mapped already as R7A. It stopped at our site, the rezoning, because 10 years ago I think city planning was of the mindset that Adam Wolf was making good use of the property and they did not realize that he was not and they stopped the line there. I think that if we would have been involved in the discussions ten years ago and that R7A was created, that Adam was online, he would have gladly been involved in that process. So I think he missed the boat in that action and we're simply seeking to really gain access to that. Now. The difference of the a versus the d. There is a slight increase in Floria from the a to the d, but that's that really accounts for the affordable housing. That's now being created that the a does not have the same requirements. Thank you, Mr Gordon. I believe that Mr Dew has a question about the affordable housing and I will follow whenever the committee members are done. Okay go ahead, John and you're muted. If I may, on behalf of Mr, do Eric, can you discuss the affordable housing number of units or percentages? What the percentage of the AMI would be at I I'd be happy to Mr. Du is unmuted. Now, oh great! Thank you! Okay! Yes Rob! You did get it. I would also ask, in addition to Mr Paris's comments that you look towards the affordable, the affordable rents in that relative community, not necessarily what the city publishes for AMI, which is an area- wide number that does not apply to most of the communities and community districts too, so that you would look at affordable rents in the Forum Hill community that surrounds this development. We could certainly take a look at that. Let me give you some of the numbers, so you can understand what they are. I do have them laid out and I can send them to the board tomorrow, so you can study them at your leisure up. There are two different scenarios which we could be presenting. One provides a deeper level of affordability, that's option one and option: one creates a total of six affordable units and of those six affordable units. Two of them are one bedrooms and they're at sixty percent AMI and they're twelve hundred dollars a month. One is a two bedroom at sixty percent at fourteen hundred one is a two bedroom at forty percent, which I think is what you're speaking about, probably because a one bedroom, forty percent, is seven hundred and seventy three dollars a month and a two bedroom at forty percent is nine hundred and forty three dollars a month, which is a good deal in New, York, of course, and a one bedroom at including one bedroom at 100, which is 1711. So that's six units out of 24. In that scenario, that's option one, and that was not here years ago. When we made the presentation. The other option is option two which you're probably not going to enjoy hearing, but I'll lay it out, which is option. Two is 80 AMI that creates a total of 24 units, but instead it's six of them. Affordable, eight are affordable, so it's not as cheap, though so you're, not as cheap and you're. Not. I should not say it's cheap, it's not as it's not as well priced as the as the deeper affordability, but there's more units there's two more units, so more people get to use share. In that sense, you got two of them or one bedrooms at 80 percent AMI, which is 1300 a month. One is a two bedroom and eighty percent, which is sixteen hundred two or one bedroom. Sixty percent, which is twelve hundred one, is a two bedroom. It's 60, which is 1400 and two one bedrooms at 1700., so the numbers go up in what I just said a second ago I mean I know I rattled off numbers quick, but just to boil down very simple you're going from you know an option, one and one bedroom and the cheapest to 773. the option. Two, the cheapest for one bedroom, is thirteen hundred, so you're, almost doubling it for one bedroom and the two scenarios so option. One is probably something that we could talk about and, I think would hope would achieve the goals of whatever he's trying to get at. It is a small development. It's not that big! So there's not much meat, there's not that much meat on the bones, but I think we can accommodate your request. I'm sorry John! I want to remind the the committee that the local council member has a great deal of input into which option. So if the committee has a preference between those two options, when this comes before them as a certified application, they should remember that they have some input into that decision. Okay, well, Mr Paris. As we go forward. Everything has to have a tinge of pandemic associated with it, there's a lot of homelessness and a lot of worklessness, so we have to certainly lean towards whatever is going to be most affordable for the greatest number of people. That's a balance, but it's a thought. Empathy John, I think, is what you're saying, and there has to be a lot of it these days and the developer. That's on the phone Adam Wolf is committed to creating something that he could work with. Community he'll engage with you during the process. He'll engage with you right now. He'll engage with you as it's being created, so this is not a. This is not a one- off conversation that he's involved with and we're happy to continue with it. Thank you for that. You're welcome, I'm here at yeah. I just wanted to add as a I used to live on Atlantic by third, and you do have a real. I won't say it's a mix, but okay as you go, I guess Southbound on Third Avenue. Yes, you do have the the housing projects and so on, which are moderate to lower income, but at the same time only a block away. A couple of blocks away. You do have higher incomes that are all scattered along Dean, Bergen, Atlantic, State Pacific right in there, it's a so it the Ami's in that area is going to be very it kind of skews everything, but I agree. I think we should look at everything to try to get the most that we can to help people with to help with affordable housing, and if is there any other comments or questions? Mr Gordon, Board member Latrell Mosso had the question about whether there are any set- asides within the MIH program. In particular, she was asking if some units are set aside for people with disabilities. It's eric no but go ahead. It's eric Blatnick! We do not create that regulate that answer to that question. Unfortunately, that's HPD in there in their work. I do not believe there's a set aside in the program for that for people with disabilities, but having said that, obviously the building will be designed in an ADA compliant and we welcome everybody in the building, but I do not think there's a specific call out or preference for people with disabilities. Thank you and then, since we've talked about a future euler application, do you have a tentative sense of when that might be certified we're hoping in the next two to three to four months? As I said earlier, we're really everything is a lot of our paperwork has been in we've been working with this city for the last year and a half two years they've been fantastic, we're almost at the end of the process with the paperwork. So that's why we sent this to you to familiarize you with it. So we do not shock you or you. When we come back when it is certified, you do appreciate no shocks yeah. I figure these days, especially right. Yes, all right and any if there are no other, but I am going to move on now over to our next item, which is the community form which is open to the public other than committee members and board members, and is there anybody from? I guess you rob you'll, have to tell me if there is anybody from the community who wishes to participate, I see no hands raised Mr Carlton, either on camera or in the participant panel. Okay, thank you. Rob. All right next is the approval of the minutes for last month. This is September and I thank Karen Johnson for her hard work and pulling together, and with these minutes I have no qualms. I you know, I look through the minutes. It looks fine to me. Is there any any members of the committee that have anything they want to add on the minutes or any corrections, no move for approval? Well, just let's take it as a if there are no objections, I'll we'll just take it as a by the committee. I have not. I've heard no objections so we'll take that as a approval by the committee and we'll move on to our next item, which is the chairs report. I have a couple of things that I want to throw out at you. First thing is that we had. I came across a couple of items in the New York Times that I thought would be of interest. They did a thing called the post- pandemic sales in new development and they listed downtown Brooklyn 114 units that are listed, that they found at the on the New York Times 24 up for sale and the median price of the units is 1 million fifty thousand dollars. So there still seems to be some steam in that, and there was another article in the another part of the times for September 27th of this year. The title was Brooklyn experiences, a surge in home sales, and they said specifically that there was a surge in downtown Brooklyn. So it's a. It still seems to be again, at least from reports that I'm reading that there still seems to be interest in, even in this time of the the pandemic of people. Trying to get properties in our area, so we can just bear that in mind I'll just also again, let people know we in our November meeting. We have a few highlights. I just want to give a couple of the highlights that we have it's going to be a busy meeting in November, so just be ready for that we're going to get a eulip for 69 adams street. We also have a one in the presentation where we're going to have a request from city planning for the zoning for the the flood resiliency. Some of you may remember. It was a rainy day when they came to us over at a Brooklyn law, school dormitory and they asked you know they gave us a presentation about the coastal. You know with flood resiliency this time, they're asking for approval. There was also a request to do a thing on government on governors island, but we Rob and Karen- and I have been talking about it over on our email and we're going to think. We think, because we're going to have also the usual LPC applications that we're going to have a lot of such a large meeting, we're going to set aside any discussion on or taking you having a presentation on governor's island and leave that to decide for the time being, and if people are interested they can join in on a presentation of governor's island that would be made to Manhattan Community board one. I was going to my last thing I had here and I guess she's not is Elizabeth Ginsberg in our she's, not on she's, not on this meeting. I guess she's, not. I guess she is yep. Oh okay, hi! You know what I've wanted to do and I want to do it for the longest time is because we never really had a chance that to really introduce you. This is probably the best I can do so. If you I'll give you a minute of my time, a minute or two of my time for you to introduce yourself to the committee, even though you've been in and out, you've never really had a and just tell us a little bit about yourself. Sure, hopefully you can hear me, okay, I can hear you great so hi everyone, I'm Elizabeth Ginsburg. I have lived in Brooklyn for about six years but born and raised in Manhattan. Sorry, I was born in Manhattan too, and I work for an affordable housing. Nonprofit called enterprise community partners, and so that's, where sort of part of my I'd say, land use and community development interest stems from, but you know, I think, also being a native new yorker, it's exciting for me to be part of this community board and sort of, hopefully get to know you all and yeah have a say in how our community develops and moves forward. Okay, Elizabeth! Thank you very much. I just you know, because I had it in my mind for months every time even we had a very busy meeting or we have this crazy thing set up. So it's we finally got the least to know that you're there and hopefully we'll all get together. One of these years, yeah the first and only meeting that I attended in person as a board member was, you know, I think, maybe a week before shut down. So exactly it's just that yeah! So what neighborhood and CB2 do you live in Elizabeth downtown Brooklyn? Oh okay, yeah, I'm a downtown guy also, so I you know, maybe I'll see you when I'm out well, you may not recognize people there right away because we're all math, but it's hard these days. Okay, yeah! I know okay, but thank you very much Elizabeth. The last thing we have here is the open. Yes, other business is any other business. I have one item first item, though, let me just say is the downtown vacancy rate. I'm told is that 14? So while there might be an uptick, there's still a great degree of vacancy downtown Brooklyn, and I do not know whether that counts, these new developments that have yet to open? The second item is we all, I believe, got a letter about an approval of an application on Saint, Felix Street that was done by the executive committee, so the community boards land, Use Committee, did not have an opportunity to weigh in. I think we need to talk about that, because there were some concerns raised after the approval was given that the block was not consulted and for those of you who are familiar with Saint Felix, going back a couple of decades, the whole block collapsed and the facade of every house on that block had to be rebuilt. That process was in place for several years. They had to build temporary entrances to every house on that block, so that block has a a very distinct history. It's also a relatively narrow block, and so there was no discussion and I did listen to the meeting. Although there was no way to participate, there was no discussion of the traffic on the block. There's only parking on one side of that block. The block is a very quiet block and this is going to change the entire dynamic. Even though it's across the street, from the Atlantic Center mall and around the corner from Bam, it is a relatively quiet block. This will change the whole dynamic and apparently the block was not notified. That's I said all of that to just preamble that the approval was done without the block being notified, that this is a proposal that will clearly impact life on that block, as they know it, and we are a community board. We have to reach out to the affected community to make them aware of any major changes that are happening. I just want to add some background to that. Let me ask some background. These are what John is talking about is an application at 130, south phillips. However, there were two applications associated with this site. One was a landmark preservation, application that got submitted to the Landmark Commission that we did not read upon. It largely did not weigh upon the on that landmark application back in back in August or back in July. The other part is that this is a euler that's coming up and we do not know how far along the problem is that when you have two applications, a landmark reservation has been a year later, roughly of a euler things get lost in the translation. So what John is talking about that once that euler come before Us men and have a question that the eulogy is going to deal with the zoning, obviously and the bulk and the height of this building, which really just steps on the steps literally steps on it's not having a transition? It's a stepping on of the fort Green neighborhood. The block that John are making reference to is a r6b residential block. It's right by Bam, there's nothing commercial about it. The large commercial strip is on is on a handsome place and on flatfoot or in Ashland, but this is a residential block. But when that comes before us, they're going to be concerned express how that building does not really fit into Fort Greene proper. It eviscerates literally anything that we considered a contextual zone. We fought for a foot green contextual zone. What we have encountered, you know, put a predatory developers through all the machination that they can think of to eviscerate a contextual zone neighborhood. They use the MIH. The mandatory inclusionary housing bonus as a rationale, but there's a point where, if you look at downtown Brooklyn and the surrounding block, it's nothing but building, and it's just eviscerating the residential character of Fort Greene. But that's the that's the that's the problem, and this is going to cut me forward and to ask Rob on an email. When do you think that the euler is going to come before the board he's trying to say maybe in 2021? I do not know, but you know so the issue again just to keep people and form that there are two items or two issues: one is the landmarking or the design of the building the exec committee approved it. Luckily, the landmark commissioners had some questions about that design and they kicked it back it really. Actually now the landmark does not address Boston heights. So that's something else and, as we know is that although landmarks may approve their portion of the application, it does not presuppose a approval of a Eulog application. Mr Gordon. Can I make a couple of comments? Yes go ahead, and then I will I'll jump in so when Ernie and I last communicated about the timing of this, I did not have a a precise sense of when this might go through euler and I still do not, but I have a better sense and that's probably spring 2021.. I also wanted to point out that this block is not zoned r6b. In fact, this block is zoned C61 and I actually went back and looked at all the historic maps to try to figure out when it was zoned c61, and this block has the somewhat unlikely distinction of having been zoned c61 in the groundbreaking. If you will 1961 rezoning and despite the fact that blocks all around it have been rezoned over time. This one block actually still retains the rezoning design the zoning designation it received when all of New York City was rezoned in 1961. and then as far as process goes. You know if a applicant, not just this applicant any applicant, can't get LPC approval for their project. Then they do not. They do not move forward with their ulurp application, which is a rather expensive proposition. You know you measure that in tens of thousands of dollars, so while it does have this sort of bifurcated review, where first we look at design and then we look at the zoning issues, that's just how it fits within the the bureaucratic review of other agencies who have a very singular process, a singular perspective within the larger process. Now I guess I yeah okay, let me just add my bit and then whoever else will take. I should add that I was part of the as part of the executive committee when they had that presentation to the executive committee on your first to approve it. I looked at it. I had some problems with it because they was, you know a very. It was much larger than the rest of the block and they were asking, as we know, for the approval as a in within in the within the historic district. You know on that block and I felt that it I initially felt that it really was should be a smaller structure. We understand that the structure is going to be for the music school to help. You know raise monies and will help the kids and so forth. I think everybody was in agreement with that goal. The problem was that I felt that it was too large, but most of the committee rejected my proposal to cut the building to a smaller amount and that in the committee felt, that is that we should go with the Brooklyn music schools proposal and it was what it went through now again, as Rob pointed out, Landmark Preservation Commission said no sort of agreeing with me. I think, and that's where we are right now and I think somebody else wants to pop in on this. I raised my hand yeah Judy. I wanted to know just to be reminded why it did not come to the land use committee. This was during the oh, it was. I think this is. It was just the just the regular executive committee. By that time they did not. We were out of doing the regular meet. You know the. What is it the regular procedure? It was going straight to the executive committee yeah, okay, yeah, but Carlson. You know there's nothing that prevents the executive committee or its members to reaching out to members of the board. That may be able to add something to the executive committee decision making. I can barely, I can sort of hear you earnest, but not too well, yeah, it's not good. There is nothing preventing executive committee members from reaching out to board members. That may be able to add something to the discussion. If you're going to make a decision on or anything I mean you know it's just you can do it, and that was not done. Apparently I understand that during the summer that the executive committee functioned on behalf of the board and but we voted for that, but this, but still does not prevent you from making a telephone call to John do or to myself anybody else to get some input. On a item that you have some questions about. Ernie. If I just build on your point, we have to constantly remind ourselves that we are representing a community, so one of us is not representative of the entire community. We have to reach out within the community to the affected people and take those concerns or recommendations or suggestions into account, as we formulate decisions that affect the entire community and to hear that this block has no sense that this monstrous building is being proposed and the block is so narrow that it has parking on only one side. It gets very little sunlight. So when you put this building up, it's going to be like that bed that park on Willoughby Street that is not built yet that will get 15 minutes worth of sunlight a day. Ah terrible people do not want. That is how I think Felix to then be living on the shadows all day, long, that the community has been supported by every cultural institution in Fort Greene, the community. The community has always supported bam. They have always supported the Brooklyn music school as part of the community. You know, and now I'm going to say well, you know, Brooklyn loses school has to make a profit at the expense of the commitment. You know there was some dialogue, but this is an issue. That's going to blow up when this Europe come about in the spring. You know, there's a relationship there. You know whether we say german r site six b or a c seven one. Let's get the block and look at the history and look at that relationship. You know and they have gotten funding through the council. I know bam. Get money from Mary Pinkett's through Lloyd Tumba. I'm quite sure that the music school had benefited from some public funding. You know, and they said you know, but it's an issue, but the design is hitting it and it just whistering for grain. Okay. Well, I think we had a good discussion on. I think we know it's going to be coming at some point, but you know right now: it's not on calendar, but you know we should. You know we'll keep it in mind and, of course, community group. If people still have problems with it, you know they should you know they can send their. I think we have received previous letters from community group from the community groups along Saint Felix, and they should continue to contact us as well as their local representatives. Yes, this decision by the Executive board was made in the summer. I think it was made yeah, I'm trying to remember exactly. I know I can't remember the exact time I know I was there. I know we were. This was one of the last meetings where we had. We were able to do it in person before we had this so, but that is a part of the problem. It did not come to the committee land use, but it was not that I know the executive board can make decisions in the summer when we out, but this was not in the summer, and it did not come to the committee and that's all I have to say so. It was at the May Executive committee meeting, that's correct and at the March general meeting the community boarded the Community Board voted unanimously to authorize the executive committee to me to act on behalf of the full board in the same manner that it does during the summer. So I mean was because of the pandemic. Yes well, the Motherboard was meeting virtually and not in person. I think one possible solution to this in the future is that anything that's been presented to the committee prior to any kind of weird executive action required by a pandemic or anything else that the committee should have a chance to comment again before an executive decision is made. We really want to get you know something of this nature. You know it should really come before us, even as an informational presentation as we have today. You know today on 98 third avenue it should you know it should come and should be explained, and this way we can get a sense as to what the community really thinks. Mr Gordon. Having said that, yeah, because this is an issue that we have from time to time- that we really need to establish a set policy that assures the appropriate communication, we have this discussion. How do we formalize this process so that the next time, unfortunately, this happens and it's happening now? Covid-19 is increasing all over the city and the earth. We have no idea what next year is going to bring here, but we do understand that we need to get our ducks in a row so that we can continue to do business as efficiently and effectively as possible, and the effective portion determines that we need to do the appropriate outreach and, given that we live in the age of internet, it's actually pretty simple: to send a notice out to the committee that something is going to happen and giving everyone on the committee an opportunity to weigh in on it with a time limitation. And this way we can assure that the committee is in the process. But the other piece is that we are always making decisions in areas that impact on other folk and we do not routinely do any external outreach. We rely on the applicant to tell us all of the outreach that they have completed and we want to believe them, but do we have a fiduciary to validate that the affected community commun committee community has been appropriately notified? So I think that's something that we just need to talk about, because I for this one. I do not know that anybody on that block is aware of this proposal. Maybe somebody does. I certainly did not hear that kind of discussion in the committee meeting at which they did not take any external discussion on that particular project. We did. We did receive written testimony from people who reside on that block and all written testimony both for and against some of it was for and against the project. Others was more focused on the design, which was the matter before the committee, but in any case, all the written testimony that was received was provided to the executive committee in advance and I believe Mr Gordon acknowledged quickly. You might say, but acknowledged that testimony was received, and I remember that yep, so we did it dave. You know it's people did come, you know, let's say people and I do not think anybody does anybody else show up. I can't recall, but we did see letters we did. You know both throwing against all right. I think we have discussed this point. I think we're going to try. I think we're going to try to do this. Hopefully this will not happen again, or at least not happen, but at least we have a better sense as to how we should you know proceed with this. I know I'm going to be bringing it up in future. If we have these executive committee meetings and something suddenly comes in at the last moment, I will certainly be bringing it up and I'm sure Irene will agree with me as co- chair all right. Are there any other business? If there's no other business, I like a motion to Adjourn and I'll. Second, it it's 7:25 P.M and I thank everybody else for going through. This is Sandra still there. I am I it's very late and I was just about to head to bed, but I wanted to see if this was going to wrap up. It's so great, seeing everybody I hope everyone's faced. You have now.
