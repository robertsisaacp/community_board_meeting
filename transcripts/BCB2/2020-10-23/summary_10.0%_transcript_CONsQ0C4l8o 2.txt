Is we work with communities across New, York City, to establish their own neighborhood playgrounds and play initiatives and activities.
We work in community centres and we also operate the yard, which is an adventure playground you may have heard of on Governors island we've been out there for four years Now. We have a very large wonderful space stocked with loose parts, materials and tools and all sorts of fantastic fun for kids to create and build themselves, and we do all of this in New, York City, because we feel-That places to play and imagine and create-are essential for children's healthy development and well-So. The please this is a picture of our playground on governor's island and for those of you who know governor's, island.
We, essentially were founded by a group of artists and parents and activists who were dismayed at the state of religion in the city and took it upon themselves to develop pop-up play days on in block parties and in neighbourhood parks, and in communities.
A pop-up in a neighborhood, looks like our staff coming with wonderful recycled materials, and we work with the community to find recycled, materials, often cardboard boxes and other fun loose parts and creating and providing a space for them to play and use materials as they wish bring tools to our pop-.
All sorts of things that kids find fun to play with these pop-ups are free and we're very interested in working with communities to offer them free, and this is a really for us, a stepping stone to think about community engagement and what does play provision in your community.
This conversation has not amounted to anything, but this is exactly the sort of opportunity where we feel that we could really bring play to the neighborhood very quickly and very cheaply, and two trees had certainly been interested in terms of animating public space.
When we began in store fronts in schoolyards and now on open streets And they're, all really great places to bring self-directed play with loose parts and So there was not a cost to your community and then to take it from there and to see what play provision at the end of 2020 in our city looks like for kids, because we know it's inadequate As Rebecca mentioned, we were seeing what's happening a all over the world and in the city, with the major restrictions on everyone's lives.
It's just really good to have the option for the kids to come out and play rather than out of the fear of people getting sick and dying, which is real but kind of going over reacting to some extent and restricting everything and not thinking about the long-term consequences of those actions which are also major and not.
Far as we can and thank you yoni and to Yoni's point, you know, we've managed to do what we've done this summer and fall in spite of everything and with all our safety protocols and safety plans in place, and we took it very seriously and worked with the trust for Governors Island out there on that, and we've also been lobbying the mayor's office and hoping for the expansion of clay streets , we're thrilled that some open streets are being used more often as play streets, for example, this one up in east Harlem, where we were yesterday, but we really are seeing what the effects of play deficit and quarantine have been this year.
We've also heard from the families what it's meant to be able to come outside again and to have spaces like this that have popped up in unexpected places and provided additional play provision and support.
, I'd, look at the playground website and trying to better understand the whole concept of sort of the bringing of the materials We saw in one of those last few slides for the kids to play in on the on your website, though it looks a lot more, not complicated, but more but more intense, more involved, that is to say it's more than just cardboard, stuff.
So really just an idea that I think you know maybe has been discussed, which would be potentially in Bridge park.
You know behind the F train on York Street before the construction starts there and what I'm thinking about is bridge part 2 bridges between the housing developments on one side and the Dumbo community on the other, side.
I could see something like an event: That's pre-construction, getting everyone excited about what the park's going to be there and having having play space sort of be the anchor activity during that time.
Barry Park, I do not know their country for construction, but that community is like right behind Three major housing projects and Commodore Barry Park is a gigantic part that the kids in that neighborhood are not getting any use of that part right.
There are two other places that could contribute that help some financing and that might be wegmans or the Brooklyn Navy yard, itself, right with materials and whatever, maybe even food for the kids that are out there so think about that rebecca.
And hopefully we can support whatever program might be feasible for our district in the spring carolyn So we're going to move on to our next topic, which is a discussion about garbage removal or the potential of that I know over the summer and even right.
Would you or people you know, be willing to volunteer a couple of hours to stand in a park or a playground with garbage bags and give them out to people?
I do not know exactly how many, because I do not have a dog, but there are stations where you just come and you take a doggie big and use it or or just out of a dispenser, and why not have larger garbage bags for people to take use and then take their refuse with them, Because here's a Well, that certainly sounds like it would make a good pilot project if there could be some fun if the parks could fund.
After a year's time that did not work, I mean no, You might find a handful of people that will take out their garbage with them out to the street, but hundreds of people going through the park.
You know we're going to be giving out trash cans, and you know like taking hours to distribute them and people You know in the first pass, will do it A little better and The only place where something like that will really work is where they really have friends, friends of a park organization or a conservancy like Fort, Greene, Park or the one in Cadman park, where I think Toba is well income.
We could get some of the active community groups that have that are friends of parks or conservancies and work that idea with them that in the parks where we do have already people that are interested in the well-being of a given part to expand that even more, but to do it.
They may not want to be you know, part of a friends group and sort of identify as part of a whole organization and board, but people sort of like to get up on a sunday and feel like they're doing something an hour or two and and cooking.
Other parks in the area-I think that would be a good idea talking to the school perspective.
The cleanup effort going across all of the parks, including the ones that do not have friends groups which might be the places we could get neighborhood organizations to attack or clean.
That's what I was thinking too barbara that we would be asking parks to take the helm of organizing and we'd, be there to support and to help communicate but happy to take the first step with with dwight.
I was walking past Cadman, Plaza, Park, and I noticed that some sort of work was going on at the war memorial, so that is whatever I do not know.
You sort of be the parks person for the Brooklyn borough president's office and just knowing that they have a separate budget.
Where we're you know prioritizing projects, and so it's important for us to understand how the community is using that park and Maybe it would be good to have if they're willing to come in sort of after the first of the year, because then we could tie it into starting up again for the following year's statement.
Does anyone know of any other park groups that we might want to reach out to Well, we tried we tried to make it a little more specific, as suzanne suggested, maybe with both cadmium and south oxford, that we would ask.
You know in that park also raised the issue about the new buildings in the area, and I.
But the other thing that I wanted to talk about was going back to a skateboard park and directing kids away from Borough Hall and the monument in Fort Greene.
You know what should we do for you in Fort Greene Park, to make an area good for your skateboarding, Only, because you should not be skating with skateboards, where you know there are men, buried, there, but destroying it, so maybe bring them into the conversation for the whole betterment of the whole issue, but got to leave them out and pretend that they're going to go away because we want them to go away.
We've had a full agenda here to speak and wrestling You know we're going to start working on some of these great initiatives that people have suggested.
