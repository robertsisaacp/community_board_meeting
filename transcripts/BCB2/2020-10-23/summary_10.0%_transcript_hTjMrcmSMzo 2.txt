Great thanks, Karen, okay, so you're ready we're ready, let's go with it: 81 Pierpont, Street and 35 love lane in Brooklyn, heights, historic district, the applications to excavate the rear yard of 81 pierpont and new and rear yard at stellar at 35 lovely to create a new sub, a subgrade, yes interior, including a new lot line window and a new whether they have here opening the east or secondary facade facing the passageway and to make up mainly windows and doors in the front and rear facade at 35 love lane in the same area.
I just want to make sure if you have notified your neighbors or the people around that at tear point and leveling that you're going to be doing excavation, work.
So we're going to wind, up, coating that and coating this whole wall and to make it just look a little bit more finished for the folks at the condo and co-Some work that we plan to do on the facade of love, lane.
You can see the house next door has done something similar, and then this just shows that you know the blue stone that we'll be using, and if you do not mind, I'm going to jump to the section and then come back to all this, because I think the section describes what we're doing better than everything else does so 35 leveling 81 pierpont has a seller space already that goes partially under the two-story.
There's no change to the yard arrangement or to anything We're also going to be one wind, up, doing a lot of interior work to this carriage house.
Most people on the committee thought that it's a little busy quite a lot of new windows being added and but their main request of the team, and I do not know if you've done this Yet I mean obviously they've been altered, but we we've done a lot of tax photo research and Jeremy Lesson has pretty much researched every single building in the Brooklyn knights, historic district And he's done a lot of work on these properties, So we think that that's the story of the changes to the rear carriage houses should be told more clearly so that commissioners can better evaluate whether or not all these windows is appropriate in this application.
It'll, be kind of in the pool area and the vent for it is going to be right here, And actually, by the time it's vented, it provides very little moisture or or air or fumes, It's, also a very low velocity fan, which is why they did not mind it kind of coming out right into the yard.
It's done with a lot of a lot of five gallon buckets anything else, audrey, not for me, okay, any other committee members have any, and can you ask first of all how old is that building the carriage house?
You want to think of it between downtown Brooklyn and Borum, Hill, Before we give the pineapple to Mr Palatnik I'll, tell you Mr, Gordon that the vote was seven in favor and unopposed, three abstentions, with Mr Dew moving the motion and miss Stan, seconding and Eric Black is the attorney for Adam Wolf.
Corey is our colleague who is flipping the screen, we're here today in an informational basis, to ask you, for your permission, to rezone the block front between bergen and wyckoff, on Third Avenue to an R7D zoning district that would be analogous to the R7A district, that's all around it, and to the wyckoff Gardens development that you could see in the backdrop that you're all familiar with this is a gas station.
We withdrew that application and we've refi or filed a rezoning for the block front What's on now, you have an image that should refresh everybody's memory of what's going on in the area, And what's happening around us, the site is depicted in the middle, obviously, with the word site on it behind us, the two-story.
That's within the project area on wyckoff Was just recently purchased a couple years ago by a doc, who, I believe, has a fertility clinic in that building He just renovated that the right side of the block is our property.
You can see the eight-story residential building across the street, so you can get a sense for the scale awesome if you just sort of click through these slides I think everybody has been or seen the block front.
It stopped at our site, the rezoning, because 10 years ago, I think city planning was of the mindset that Adam Wolf was making good use of the property.
If the committee has a preference between those two options, when this comes before them as a certified application, they should remember that they have some input into that.
I think we should look at everything to try to get the most that we can to help people with to help with affordable housing.
We've, been working with this city for the last year and a half two years, Yes, all right and any if there are no other, but I am going to move on now over to our next item, which is the community form which is open to the public other than committee members and board members, and is there anybody?
It was a rainy day when they came to us over at a Brooklyn law, school dormitory There was also a request to do a thing on government on governors island, but we Rob and Karen-We think, because we're going to have also the usual LPC applications that we're going to have a lot of such a large meeting.
We're going to set aside any discussion on or taking you having a presentation on governor's island and leave that to decide for the time being, and if people are interested, they can join in on a presentation of governor's island that would be made to Manhattan Community board one.
I'd, say, land use and community development interest stems from, but you know, I think, also being a native new yorker We. Have this crazy thing set up.
The second item is we all, I believe, got a letter about an approval of an application on Saint, Felix Street that was done by the executive committee, so the community boards land, Use Committee, did not have an opportunity to weigh in.
I think we need to talk about that, because there were some concerns raised after the approval was given that the block was not consulted and for those of you who are familiar with Saint Felix, going back a couple of decades, the whole block collapsed and the facade of every house on that block had to be rebuilt.
What John is talking about that once that euler come before Us men and have a question that the eulogy is going to deal with the zoning, obviously, and the bulk and the height of this building, which really just steps on the steps literally steps on It's, a stepping on of the fort Green neighborhood.
The mandatory inclusionary housing bonus as a rationale, If you look at downtown Brooklyn and the surrounding block, it's nothing but building, and it's just eviscerating the residential character of Fort Greene.
Do you think that the euler is going to come before the board?
It was much larger than the rest of the block and they were asking, as we know, for the approval, as a in within in the within the historic district.
You know, there's nothing that prevents the executive committee or its members to reaching out to members of the board.
