This is we have the parks and recreation committee of 342 Brooklyn we've been called to order and we're being recorded for the purpose of transparency and for permanent public access on the Cd2 YouTube archive. Please attendees, you've heard this before. Please keep your microphone muted when you are not speaking, and the district staff will actively assist in helping us maintain this protocol, and we are it's the practice of our community board to conduct remote meetings with all committee members cameras on and that's our goal again for full transparency. You may see me disappear because I've been having trouble with Webex. I'm hoping tonight will go smoothly, but if not, I'm going to turn off my camera to hope that it can at least heal me, but so far so good, and so we encourage all attendees to keep their cameras on, particularly when you were given the floor to speak, someone is having trouble hearing them. Is this any better? Yes, okay, all right good. So we will be mentioning what topics we are talking about, so that are open for comment by Member, Committee, Members, Board members and general public. If you wish to speak during the meeting, please use the webex feature in the participants panel to digitally, raise and lower your hand and quote on order, and if you have questions that we do not get to, please put them there as well. Now, if you or anyone you know, has difficulty because of ADA issues accessing this meeting, please call the district office contact them and we will make the necessary accommodation we're going to start. I do not think I mentioned I'm Barbara Zahler Glinger, I'm the co- chair of the committee and I'm going to do a roll call of the committee members.

Thank you, dwight, everyone in favor, okay, thank you all right. We're going to move on to our presentation for this evening, I'm so delighted. We were originally going to have this presentation quite a few months ago and unexpected things intervened. I am delighted to welcome Rebecca Faulkner who's, the executive director of Playground NYC, and it's a non- profit organization that works together, creating special events, playground, type situations and related things working with children and getting wants and they're very big on recycled using the site, recycled materials and I'm sure Rebecca will tell you about it and some other events that they might like to do in conjunction with our district she's. Also here, with the co- founder and head play, worker and maybe he'll get a chance to explain what exactly that means. Yoni Kawaii. Is it so rebecca? We we're turning the floor over to you. Thank you so much Barbara. Thank you for having us everyone, we're really thrilled to meet you all and to be here yoni. I do not know if you can hear us now. Can you and can you can we hear you? Do you hear me we can hear you, I'm not sure we can see you. Can everybody else yoni as well? I hope so, okay, great, so we have some slides to share with you. Let me tell you a bit more about who we are and what we do and as Barbara mentioned, we first contacted each other quite some months ago, so I'm very glad, even in such unprecedented times to be able to present to you all and share a little bit more of who we are so, let's go to the first slide. Please sorry, the on! Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so we are playground NYC and we are a non- profit organization advocating for young people's rights. We provide play worker run environments. We will explain what that means, and these environments encourage risk taking through self- directed play or other concepts that we will explain and the main way we do this is we work with communities across New, York City, to establish their own neighborhood playgrounds and play initiatives and activities. We work in schools, we work in community centres and we also operate the yard, which is an adventure playground you may have heard of on Governors island we've been out there for four years now we have a very large wonderful space stocked with loose parts, materials and tools and all sorts of fantastic fun for kids to create and build themselves, and we do all of this in New York City, because we feel- and this is more so now than ever- that places to play and imagine and create- are essential for children's healthy development and well- being so the please this is a picture of our playground on governor's island and for those of you who know governor's island. You know that it really feels like an oasis in the city. It's very green. It's an adventure to get there. We've been open there since 2016.. We essentially were founded by a group of artists and parents and activists who were dismayed at the state of religion in the city and took it upon themselves to develop pop- up play days on in block parties and in neighbourhood parks and in communities. This came to the attention, trust for governor's island and in 2016 they invited us to run a series of pop- ups, as we call them pop- up plays using recycled materials on the island. This was very successful and enabled us to have a space on Governors island that we've rented ever since so from May through October. We have a fantastic open weekend, that's free every weekend. So, as the statistic here shows, since 2016 over 25,000 kids have played for free, we also run a summer camp program and have a whole host of other programs and raise money all the time. In order to make this play provision free, I'm going to go to the and let yoni tell you a little bit more about why our playground is so unique and the work we do on the playground so I'll hand it to you yoni and you can introduce yourself all right. Thank you. Let me know if you can't hear me well, so I stumbled across this concept and joined even Alex, who were the first to kind of head this in New York City, the concept of adventure playground has been around since the 1940s and New York City actually had adventure playgrounds back in the 70s in these playgrounds. We are saying centered on the children, that's our focus and we are focused on letting them direct their play, which, if you think a little bit about how the lives of kids are these days most of the time, they're being told what to do when to do where? How what not to do- and it's really important for us to give them agency over their play, if not more than that, we are there as play workers to kind of supervise support, and, unlike what's kind of common in society, to avoid all risks. And we see that a lot right now with Covid-19. For us, we differentiate between risks and hazards and risks are things that people can understand and can figure out whether they want to interact with or not, and it's important to learn how to manage your the risks that you encounter in life. Whereas hazards are things you're, unaware of so we eliminate the hazards on the playground, but we allow for risks which, at the playground, include physical stuff, like using tools, as we see here being having access to heights, but also socially emotionally. We let the children be in charge of the interactions we step in if need be, but we're not so quick to jump in and be the judges for you did this or you did that which are so common on normal playground. Maybe we can pass to the as Rebecca mentioned. We have our summer programming, which this year we were lined up to do 11 weeks of summer camp. We ended up doing six of them and we have the free weekends throughout the summer, serving thousands upon thousands of kids and our year- round programming is the weekends that we have in the spring and fall just like. We do in the summer, but then also the public school field trips that come to us. While schools are in session, we started doing some after school programming. Also, we do professional development for educators to kind of bring this approach into more places. Playwork training is kind of more in depth and the community pop- ups, or sometimes even doing the pop- up events at schools yeah you can pass on. So what does this mean for Community Board 2? What does this mean for the city, as Yoni has explained a little bit more about how our spaces are unique? I wanted to just speak to that a little bit and let you know you know one of the things that we prioritize is creating a space for all children to play and to explore, and not just at the yard, but at our pop- up play days. We really invite children to take ownership of their space. So one of the things that Barbara and I have talked about are, is the possibility of running some community pop- ups for your community board. So this, essentially we do this. Throughout the year, it's been more challenging in Covid-19 times, but we've still managed to do it, particularly with the prevalence of open streets, which we know will continue. A pop- up in a neighborhood looks like our staff coming with wonderful recycled materials, and we work with the community to find recycled materials, often cardboard boxes and other fun loose parts and creating and providing a space for them to play and use materials as they wish bring tools to our pop- ups. These really are focused on fabric loose parts cardboard. All sorts of things that kids find fun to play with these pop- ups are free and we're very interested in working with communities to offer them free, and this is a really for us, a stepping stone to think about community engagement and what does play provision in your community board. District. Look like what are the playgrounds like. I know that there was discussion of a new playground that was to be built. Obviously, so many things are changing at the moment in the city, but we really feel strongly that we can animate and bring life to existing playgrounds. We can come in for the day and bring all sorts of fun materials. We really feel that in these urban spaces, kids deserve more. Our playgrounds are cheaper to build than conventional, fixed rooted playgrounds, and the main cost involved is staffing it with our trained play, workers paying them, but there's tremendous reward to giving kids the opportunity to play in this way and to experience some of what Yoni's talked about nature, the elements whether it's mud and water etc. Please I'll just jump in quickly and say that by paying the staff rather than construction, companies were keeping the funds in the community right. Yes, absolutely, and I should mention we had before everything happened in March, we were beginning conversations with two trees, which are the Dumbo based real estate group about a vacant lot that they had in Williamsburg it's since. Sadly, this conversation has not amounted to anything, but this is exactly the sort of opportunity where we feel that we could really bring play to the neighborhood very quickly and very cheaply, and two trees had certainly been interested in terms of animating public space. We've worked in public parks. Obviously, when we began in store fronts in schoolyards and now on open streets and they're, all really great places to bring self- directed play with loose parts and as this slide shows, we can create pop- ups in communities quickly and really listen to what the kids want and also listen to what families need. And so we would really love the opportunity if it makes sense for community Board too, to think about something for the spring, and this would look like a pop- up a series of pop- up events that we would bring to you. We would fundraise to make that possible, so there was not a cost to your community and then to take it from there and to see what play provision at the end of 2020 in our city looks like for kids, because we know it's inadequate and we know that so many kids need more, please I'll. Let yoni take this one yeah. So, as Rebecca mentioned, we were seeing what's happening a all over the world and in the city with the major restrictions on everyone's lives, but specifically our focus on kids. This picture here is from a pop- up event. We did yesterday up in Harlem and what we've also heard from the kids, who have come out for our summer camp this year and for our after- school programming that we started in the fall is just basically kids, who have spent months pooped inside on a computer all day, be it school or playing video games and that's kind of it, and that it's been so important for them to come out and play physically interact with other kids. Something that we do in play. Work is not just think about risk assessment, but we talk about risk benefit assessment and it's important to remember that any action that we take has an impact in all kinds of directions, and it's just been shown how much the risk is smaller and when we're talking about outside events as far as Covid-19. So it is, it's just really good to have the option for the kids to come out and play rather than out of the fear of people getting sick and dying, which is real but kind of going over reacting to some extent and restricting everything and not thinking about the long- term consequences of those actions which are also major and not if we just look at the immediate saving of lives and reducing risk and forget about the impact that it has down the road, then we're doing a disservice for ourselves and that's what we've found. We've had no issues of kids getting sick. We check everyone's temperature. Ask all the questions if they've been exposed and whatnot, so it's really easy with a few simple steps to make sure that you're providing a space that is safe and so needed. So, thank you. That's what we want to bring. As far as we can and thank you yoni and to Yoni's point, you know, we've managed to do what we've done this summer and fall in spite of everything and with all our safety protocols and safety plans in place, and we took it very seriously and worked with the trust for Governors island out there on that, and we've also been lobbying the mayor's office and hoping for the expansion of clay streets, we're thrilled that some open streets are being used more often as play streets, for example, this one up in east Harlem, where we were yesterday, but we really are seeing what the effects of play deficit and quarantine have been this year and, as you only mentioned, we've heard from the kids. We've also heard from the families what it's meant to be able to come outside again and to have spaces like this that have popped up in unexpected places and provided additional play provision and support. So as we come to the end of our presentation really, this is our opportunity to provide more equitable free play for New, York, City's, kids and playground NYC. That's what we hope to do. We would very much like to continue a conversation with your community board about how this would be possible in a safe way in the spring. If we go to the, I can just show our contact details for all of you to have so that's our email and our website, and I can send you my I'll put my email address in the chat and just so that you know you know this is a little tiny list, because we've had such a truncated year, but we have managed to get to Jerome Park in the Bronx yesterday to Pleasant Avenue. Last weekend to long island city we've been in Brooklyn bridge park. This is a short list because it's been a terrible year, but we intend to do far more of this next year and you know with your support, we'd love to share more of this with you and with your community. So I know we've probably gone over our time, but if you have questions for Yoni and I now or at a later date, we'll just follow your lead. But thank you everybody for learning more about us and the work we do. Thank you. Thank you, so much rebecca and Yoni. First do we have any questions from the committee members go ahead. Dwight you had a question. Well, I thought I heard somebody else. You know, I think it's an interesting program, I'd, look at the playground website and trying to better understand the whole concept of sort of the bringing of the materials it's you mentioned, Rebecca, the the use of the cardboard and you know boxes. We saw in one of those last few slides for the kids to play in on the on your website, though it looks a lot more, not complicated, but more but more intense, more involved, that is to say it's more than just cardboard stuff. It seems like it's found materials of a lot of different sort of stuff, and I guess my real question is whether it's simple with just the cardboard things that we bring versus more involved stuff. Who brings that I mean? Is that the play worker, or is this the or is this the committee and I'm thinking now or the notion of you're, putting together special pop- up events in you know, neighborhoods are in the place who brings the materials and who decides what kind of stuff you bring? I mean I love the concept and organizationally how all that works. Sure I'll speak briefly and I'll. Also, let you only speak to this. Thank you for that. So what you see on our website is our kind of flagship playground. So that's taken longer to build and we yeah we've got it's a big space. We have big stuff, we have wood, we have all sorts of movable loose parts, most of that comes from materials for the arts in long island city, so we shop there for donated materials. People also bring materials to us all the time. We also do some wonderful scavenging around the city for things, but that's you know a far bigger space that we've developed over years with our pop- ups, that we do across the that's a much more collaborative event, so we really encourage so. For example, yesterday in east Harlem we worked with uptown Grand Central, the community group and they sourced cardboard locally from vendors and Patsy's pizza got involved and gave us all these clean boxes. We get as many groups involved as we can in sourcing materials. We have a wish list of materials and we bring some too if a community is not able to source them we'll help, we certainly will support them in doing that, and we love dress up. We love fabric, we love all sorts of fun things like that, so we can bring it. If you do not have it that's the kind of short answer yoni. I do not know if you can add more to that. Maybe I'll. Just briefly, add the yes. The approach that we bring is the most important, but then it's important to have materials to engage the children and give them control over things. We can give lists. Nothing is mandatory. We can bring things ourselves. I can say that, generally speaking, we do notice that pop- up events with kind of softer materials, cardboard and fabric tend to draw on younger children, whereas our bigger playground can be more enticing for older kids, not only, but they sometimes feel like it's not for them when they see the just cardboard and whatever great well. Thank you yeah. I know it's very interesting and I guess the only other thing is you one final question: when you you're the process for organizing one of the pop- ups, let's assume we're bringing one of these spring events that you've suggested rebecca. What would be the process for us to go through designating a space? Do we work with the community organization? It's really up to you. We'd have a you know, we'd begin a series of conversations with you about what you need about the spaces that you're looking at outdoor spaces. Obviously, that's the focus right now. We can work, we're very flexible. We can work pretty much everywhere. We would really. You know. The goal is to have a community- wide dialogue about what play provision looks like and what you all feel like you need. We do not want to. We do not want to just show up, but we I mean we can, if you're, looking for a one- off event, but really the goal for this is to think about a series of pop- up play events and maybe identify a more or semi- permanent space outdoor space. You know we there's only one adventure playground in New York right now, and it's not in a in a in a borough. That's accessible, it's on an island, so the goal would have more okay. So so then it would be more like yeah, I'm from the Bournemouth Association, so it would be more like working with the Bournemill Association. We've got a couple of of open streets and there are areas in those open streets, and some of them are several blocks long, which theoretically could in which we could theoretically carve out an area. For you know, for this directed play stuff that you're describing absolutely and then what we would do is talk to you about what are the local public elementary schools, where, how are they served? What would their needs be? How would they visit? How could we set up play events where they could access the space, especially if they have limited yard space themselves, so that would be a kind of you know. We would have lead time now to do that, because we're talking about the spring. Who else can we get involved? What are the other groups or stakeholders that would be? You know that benefit from this and who are the who are the families primarily who would be benefiting from this? Okay, great, thank you! So, okay, carolyn, you had a question you have to unmute. Please sorry! Yes, I wanted to know how do you deal with the insurance issues in these pop- up locations, particularly or even with the organizations who want you to do it in their streets or open space? You only can I take this. Is that fine? We have we're always asked about insurance, because people see they see tools in hype and they think how do you get insurance coverage for that? We have general liability insurance that covers us on Governors, Island and off the island. We can walk around with kids and do all sorts of things when we do an event with a community group. We name them as a, but they have a certificate of insurance, they're, an additional insured, so they're added to our insurance to our general liability insurance. We've never had an issue with any accident or injury anywhere, whether it's on governor's island or off Governor's island. But yes, we certainly have additional coverage for community groups and in terms of open streets, that's not necessary, because the community, we we've our first experience of this was yesterday, but the community group that had planned the open street got the permit from the mayor's office. So we were an additional event on top of that permit. If that makes sense, we did not have to apply for another permit a separate permit. I hope that answers your question I'll just say that as far as insurance, except for the paperwork, our real insurance, as I see it, is the work we do on the ground to really locate the hazards, eliminate them and be there constantly available for the kids. So we might have more scrapes than a normal playground, but we have less broken bones and less injuries of that sort. Thank you. Suzanne hi, everyone, hi Rebecca, I'm Suzanne. I live in Dumbo and I think actually Katarina gets head. It's like I'm remembering now. Katarina gets maybe referred. You guys to me about a year ago on this. So I think this is terrific. I think my kids are 13. They probably aged out of it a bit. Unfortunately, but I think this is really great, so really just an idea that I think you know maybe has been discussed which would be potentially in Bridge park 2. You know behind the F train on York Street before the construction starts there and what I'm thinking about is bridge part 2 bridges between the housing developments on one side and the Dumbo community on the other side. So it might be nice to think about, and there are ideas about doing a friends group that brings those community together. I could see something like an event: that's pre- construction, getting everyone excited about what the park's going to be there and having having play space sort of be the anchor activity during that time. So just an idea- and I'm happy to you- know, get involved and help connect people if that's helpful, that sounds fantastic suzanne. Thank you and what what's the timeline for the for the part? Well, the last update that we had was that construction is starting in spring 2021, whatever that means I'm sure it means, may not March or perhaps later so you know it might. I mean. Obviously there you know would need to be permitting and in coordination with the parks Department. But you know my thinking would be sometime in the spring before construction starts. Well, we would love that, and certainly, if they're, if that's you know the best location but we'd also be willing to you know to run these wherever it makes sense and who knows maybe there's space for a smaller adventure play around within this new wonderful new park yeah? Well, this one is planned. This one is planned, so I think this one would be a one- off, but, yes, I think other people may have different ideas of things could be more. Thank you, Barbara. Can I come in on this since and then I know Rebecca needs to leave, so we want to move along a little faster in the simpler green has bridge part. Two. Maybe even more closer is Commodore Barry Park, I do not know their country for construction, but that community is like right behind three major housing projects and Commodore Barry Park is a gigantic part that the kids in that neighborhood are not getting any use of that part right now. They also will have some construction, but I do not know the timing of it. The nice part there is that 20 2022 right now, it's 2022. okay, so we still have some time on one but the other. There are two other places that could contribute that help some financing and that might be wegmans or the Brooklyn Navy yard itself, right with materials and whatever, maybe even food for the kids that are out there so think about that rebecca there is a that sounds fantastic and that location would make a lot of sense. I mean we'd just be very curious to be put in touch with the right people to kick that off, but we you know this is this is fantastic to hear from you where you think would be. You know good potential locations for community for pop- ups. There is a whole nice beautiful, green park there, but there's a whole sort of an asphalt field. That's absolutely not used that kids do not have anything to do with it, but it would be. You know it would be very commendable to bring the kids out there with some activities because they do not have it. They have a gigantic part, but nothing is a nothing of a program to give them a little bit more of an incentive to come out and use it. That sounds great. Thank you so much. I am sorry that I have to go. I have to I have to head off soon, but I do not know if you only can stay on for a few more minutes, but I really appreciate the opportunity, for you know that all of you have given us to present and to meet you, and I hope this is the beginning of a longer series of conversations. All I would say is that spring is around whatever it brings the spring. It's around the corner, so we're here and we're ready to begin thinking about what pop- ups could look like. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. So much. I did not see any other hands from committee members. Is there anyone from the public or from the community board itself? Who has a question for yoni? Okay, all right with that, then I will thank you as well. I think this is a wonderful presentation and something that the committee will talk about, and hopefully we can support whatever program might be feasible for our district in the spring carolyn did you want to ask something else? Okay, you're still muted. Thank you. It's fine! Thank you! Oh okay, all right thanks all right, so yoni you're welcome to stay or if you need to leave, that's fine too and again, we look forward to further discussion on this all right. Thank you so much for having us, okay, so we're going to move on to our next topic, which is a discussion about garbage removal or the potential of that I know over the summer and even right. At the beginning of the summer, a number of our committee members brought up the topic of garbage in the park, particularly at this time. The garbage situation seemed worse than it has been, and I think part- and I do not- we have not really talked about it recently, but I well. I do not know how people feel if there's been any improvement, or things are just as bad or getting worse, and I will tell which tell you that you know maintenance hours have been reduced considerably by the Parks Department and I do not you know things may get worse before they get better, so we have, and also particularly in the Bronx. Some volunteers have gotten together and made an effort to clean up the parks on their own, and I think these these endeavors have been quite successful in the Bronx. So marty moore is just putting out fielders we're just he's just he's not asking for volunteers tonight he just wants. Although I already said I would volunteer a couple of hours if it's not too cold out on an upcoming weekend, I just sort of brainstorming. If people do you think it would be a good idea, would you or people you know, be willing to volunteer a couple of hours to stand in a park or a playground with garbage bags and give them out to people? I guess you know people who've been eating or have had. You know a number of people getting together. What do you think about sort of a proactive citizen volunteer corps as small or as big as it might be, spending a bit of time volunteering to carry out this lenny? I think I know this would be of interest. This is a topic that interests you quite a bit. You need! Well, I'm just great. I just got an idea in Fort, Greene Park there are stations. I do not know exactly how many, because I do not have a dog, but there are stations where you just come and you take a doggie big and use it or or just out of a dispenser, and why not have larger garbage bags for people to take use and then take their refuse with them, because here's a I do not know how to word it properly to make it that inviting, but I'm sure people can come up with brainstorm, good ideas there. I think that could be one good idea. Well, that certainly sounds like it would make a good pilot project if there could be some fun if the parks could fund you know the dispensers. So I think it's a good idea. Suzanne, you have a suggestion. Well, I just wanted to weigh in and say that, like 100, yes, I know people are interested in doing this. Like three examples, like off the top of my head Brooklyn bridge park, we had community cleanups all the late summer. Last week, a community group got together and cleaned up a traffic plaza in my neighborhood, and I heard from some organizers at cadman last month that they were trying to get community cleanups going in cadman. So 100 people want to do this and I actually think it's incumbent on parks to really facilitate this, because I think people care about their parks and understand what's going on in the city, I think they do want to take an active role. I just want to share something that some organizers that cadman shared with me on the topic as information. I have not had the opportunity to vet this at all, but they were saying that they were trying to get some community cleanups going in cadman. It was very challenging in September to get permits cleared to get. We want to get like some, I guess, there's kits that you can get with those grabbers and things like that, and it just was very bureaucratic and onerous to get things cleared, and so I guess I would go a step further. Just to say people want to do it and parks should really think out of the box to figure out how to empower people and break through any bureaucracy to make it happen. I've seen people cleaning up in cabin plaza, as you mentioned, Suzanne and then, but I also wondering that so were they organized to where did they drop their? You know sort of load up their garbage at the end, because you know the idea is to clear it up and clean it out, and so is that part of the permit that they have to get or yeah I'm not I'm not. I'm not sure. I think the idea behind this idea, that's been brought to us for discussion is that people would take their garbage with them when they rest, and this would help facilitate in theory, help facilitate that it's a little different yeah. That's I have that. I I mean there are: I started the campaign right with the signage. I read that in some newsletter citywide with the signage encouraging people to take their garbage. Yes right, so that's you know, I think very obvious and good to me. This would be sort of the next step. This would be community groups coming together for organized cleanups on a regular basis. You know what's being proposed right now is not so much a cleanup group but handing out bags, so people are responsible, take responsibility for their own garbage. Can I chime in on that a little bit yeah sure there was a similar project, the station's cleaned up and MTA started with, like let's take the garbage cans out of the subway stations and that'll entice people to take out the garbage that they have with them after a year's time that did not work, I mean no, you know it's. You might find a handful of people that will take out their garbage with them out to the street, but hundreds of people going through the park. It's not going to happen. We might like to think about it, but you know it's just a it's just a once in a lifetime chance that somebody is going to you know we're going to be giving out trash cans, and you know like taking hours to distribute them and people you know in the first pass, will do it and then it's over the you know the initiative is gone, so I think much has to think about it. A little better and the only place where something like that will really work is where they really have friends, friends of a park organization or a conservancy like Fort, Greene, Park or the one in Cadman park, where I think Toba is well income. You know in control of that, but just to do it haphazardly and a few of Us volunteers come out for two or three hours a week. It's not going to work. You know it's a good night for that. You know this. I suppose there's an argument to be made that if people were, I lost you bobby all right Andrew. I think we lost your sound, your audio, I was going to say it sounds to me like. If, from what I'm hearing, you say that if people who are concerned about removing their garbage, they would bring a bag or something with them to remove their garbage. Our handing out bags might not be an inducement to people. It might be better to organize groups to clean up the park rather than just provide a bag. Is that what I hear people saying can you hear me now looks like there's a little bit of a delay? I stopped the video. Did that help it did. Yes, I think it did. Okay, I would maybe suggest you know. In a future meeting we could get some of the active community groups that have that are friends of parks or conservancies and work that idea with them that in the parks where we do have already people that are interested in the well- being of a given part to expand that even more, but to do it haphazardly. You know like we'll, send ourselves to go over so far for one or two saturdays to be around to give out trash bags. It's going to it's a nice effort. You know we're going to do something, but you know, after that, it's back to the drawing board. But if we're talking about garbage I'll permit myself something for taya to take back to the office, to mention it to Carol Anne, because she's into this rat population, very much so in the last couple of months as I was walking from my apartment to port green park, I was a trail of dead rats on Willoughby Avenue close to the park. So evidently you know they something is killing them. They're eating, obviously some kind of poison they're in the park, possibly but they're there. They then flee the park and die on the average. That's all I had to contribute to rats and garbage in Fort Greene Andrew, where will it be, is that above the park going east of the Park Washington Park and Willowby Avenue at that point? Okay, thank you! I'm not doing a census of the dying rats, but on the occasions that I've been walking to the park in that general vicinity, there's been, for you know a few weekends that I've been through a trail of dead rats. What happens to them? I do not know, I guess sanitation picks them up. Eventually, I do not know. Thank you andrew I'll. Make sure that caroline adds that to the growing pile of rap complaints at the office. I just wanted to mention in relation to the friends when we were discussing this in the office, one thing that we just wanted to mention to the committees: what about those parks that do not have friends groups? We have 15 perks in our district and I think only seven have friends groups, seven teams more than I thought 15., no, they had well. I was going to discuss this in my chairs report, but I I had a suggestion. Maybe I'll keep that for a moment. Well, this is something Andrew was discussing suzanne, you wanted to say something well, yeah, two things so, first of all, I just think it's a little weird to hand out bags when we're just reigniting the plastic bag ban too. You know, even though I think they are allowed for garbage, but it sends a bit of a mixed message and- and I do not know- I think that I actually think that it could work beyond friends groups, because I know in my community, through the neighborhood organization, as long as there's some kind of a neighborhood organization or neighborhood facebook, group etc. I'm confident that people would sign on to clean up any park in this area on a regular basis. They may not want to be you know, part of a friends group and sort of identify as part of a whole organization and board, but people sort of like to get up on a sunday and feel like they're doing something an hour or two and and cooking. So I think it does not have to have organized friends proof I think, as long as the community has some form of organization or community mechanism communication mechanism, rather, okay, all right yeah. It's my mic open, yeah. Okay, there are a lot of schools in the neighborhood there's high schools, Brooklyn tech, other schools. I can't think of Offhand when I was teaching and doing or whatever else I did in schools. The better schools used to have community service, the ones that required it were the best schools that I was in and there are always kids looking to do and get credit for community service a couple hours a week, first amount of weeks or terms. It would be great to get the schools involved and promote this. You have them going to eat different parks for cricket park, other parks in the area- and I think it's a. I think that would be a good idea talking to the school perspective, looking the right people in the schools that would be handling that yes, so suzanne, you wanted to say something. Oh, I was going to say that, especially now in the time of a zoom class, this would be something they could do outside of zoom and you might have a little more response. Whoever is organizing it too, so yeah. It does require a little bit of organization, but I feel like, as you know, we think about parks for this coming year. I think there's nothing more important to the community than the parks being clean and usable yeah. Everything else can wait, but if they're, not if there's trash everywhere, you know that's like the baseline thing. So if something else has to be on hold so that a resource can be allocated to helping to empower the community, then to me that would be the right trade- off all right. Well, dwight, were you going to say something so Jen from organizational perspective, I mean with the notion Bb I mean so many of you want to take on this this project with the representatives. Seven friends groups get them if you're, not speaking, could you please mute yourself because we're getting a lot of feedback? Thank you. That's much better! Go ahead! Dwight! Oh, no, so I think from the organizational perspective and how we would move forward, would that be first meeting with representatives from the seven friends groups getting them on board. This is what we're trying to do. You know and we helped find the bags or whatever you know, but getting there getting them on board and and for which areas they would serve. You know, in addition to representatives from the neighborhood associations who we could get on board, presumably to get some of their active folks to go into specific parks. That sort of thing I mean, I think it makes sense for all the reasons that suzanne will get out. But it's how we get it going. The cleanup effort going across all of the parks, including the ones that do not have friends groups which might be the places we could get neighborhood organizations to attack or clean. Well, I was thinking. Maybe the first step would be to write back to marty Marr and say we had a discussion and we were feeling that we need more of an effort than just handing out bags. We need, you know, volunteer volunteers, getting together in a somewhat organized fashion, to do cleanup in the parks, and maybe there would be a role to get the parks department involved in this. So that's kind of what I was thinking and which would suggest that we need to put together a letter. If that's what, if people agree with that and then see what the response is, because we were asked the question and sort of in a we were asked the question, but I think the feeling was they did not anticipate that we would jump up and down and say yes to standing in the parks. So I do not know if someone wants to work with me on a letter like that or wants to take ownership of it. Suzanne that'd be great. Anybody else want to get involved, I'm I'll help. Okay, that's what I was thinking too barbara that we would be asking parks to take the helm of organizing and we'd, be there to support and to help communicate but happy to take the first step with with dwight. Okay, all right, so we'll follow up on that. Did anyone else want to say anything on this topic yeah? I would just like. I would just like to add that at the right time, when you guys would let me know it might be the right time I would try to reach out to who ever I might find, would be the right people in some of the schools to get them okay to get them involved with the service credit, I d all right. Well, we could incorporate that as a suggestion in the letter. Yeah, okay, so Barbara I'd be happy to work with the Working committee. That's going to draft that letter, because I have some additional information from parks that might be helpful to you like. We know exactly which two we know the names of the two people that would actually be in charge of coordinating volunteers. If something were to be taken care of right there yeah. The question today is: does the board have access or lists of the principals or key people in various high schools or middle schools in our district, because we are building that now? Actually, that's one of the resources that we are putting on our updated website. Okay, because Lenny, that would be a great source of you, could then quarterback getting some of the principles or whoever they are in the schools to run that as a you know, student activity, I would do it as soon as we had the logistics worked out. I mean going through the Parks Department first at the right time as soon as you. Let me know, then I will do it all right. Well, thank you for that and thank you for everybody's enthusiastic interest in in the parks, so we're going to move on now to the minutes, and I just noticed I had reviewed them before, but just looking at them quickly. Now I a little while ago I noticed candace is listed as being absent when actually she's the one who took the minute. So that's one thing that has to be corrected and I hope people have had an opportunity to look at the minutes and if you have any corrections for them now, this would be the time to share them, and I would just ask that everybody get the minutes because for some reason I did not, I was going to point that out that I did not dwight okay, he did not either Jennifer. You did not get them either. No, I did not no yeah. I think that email was from the 13th. Was it yeah? You were all included on the email and I did not say anything until yesterday. Really because I kept thinking, I would get the usual announcements, that's what I get for sending it so early. Well, though, the 13th is not that early, but that also had the agenda. Yeah, that's my problem. I looked for both of those I've gone through gazillions of emails. I have not found a thing. I did that earlier. I sent it on October 9th next month, I'll be more on the lookout for it and maybe taya you'll. Let me know when you're going to send it so I'll be on I'll, be looking for it and then, if you know others have that problem all right, so does this mean that some people have not looked at the minutes? Yes, okay, I just dropped a link to it in the chat. Okay, do you want to take a couple minutes and look at it now and I'll take a sip of water while you're doing that? Thank you, okay! So, oh hmm, all right! So does anyone have any suggested changes to the minutes? All right so can I assume, then we have a consensus that the are approved as they are we'll just change. The comment about Candice all right, so thank you for that dwight did you want to say something you're you're on mute, okay, just saying I, my problem had been that I was looking for taiya and in the emails as T added for starters. Oh sorry, going forward, I will know all right. Okay, then chairpersons report. I was just looking at these minutes again just now. Just to give you an update. Last time I mentioned that there was a suggestion that the borough, no, that the municipal there was discussion about the municipal building being renamed for Justice Ginsburg and that is moving forward. The building is going to be renamed for her they're, actually going to be two statutes built and created her honor one, I'm trying to remember where it's going to be, I forget, and then that's a local one, so to speak, but the governor Cuomo has also set up a mission which includes two of I think, two of her grandchildren and her daughter and a number of dignitaries and they're going to also create a statute. I do not know where that one will be. I think the other statue is already of the design, for it has already been determined. Then Taiyo was nice enough during our meeting to put in the capital project status report that we all received back. Hopefully, everyone received it back in September when it was sent out to committee members and because a number of the members, including myself, had asked, could we get an update at a meeting of capital projects? I was told we have to use the parks Department sparingly to come to our meetings and we were given this update. So if you have any questions about capital projects and the delays and the status, you can consult this. I was walking about a week or so ago. I was walking past Cadman Plaza Park, and I noticed that some sort of work was going on at the war memorial, so that is whatever I do not know. If it's which aspect of the excuse me of the construction is going on there, but I may be walking past there tomorrow morning and so we'll follow up on that. Then I wanted to to remind people or just brainstorm. If you have any ideas for future meetings, please let Andrew Taya, and I know about that or any one of the three of us we're always looking for ideas and one of the things I was thinking of which sort of relates to friends groups in a way as well is perhaps for the spring, since it's getting cold already, maybe each one of us could sort of adopt a playground or a park and kind of spend some time there, maybe talking to people seeing what they like about that playground or park, and what they'd like to see taking place there and then maybe we could talk about it and see what we could do to support some efforts to make some meaningful changes in those. I so I put that out there for comment and let me know what you think and I think you know- we've been successful in looking at certain localities, but it'd be nice to broaden the scope. Those of you who've been on the committee for a while. I think it was two years ago at this point, marty took us around on a tour of a variety of playgrounds that we might not. We had not been focusing on just to let us know, and you know that a number of them, I think I do not know if they're 20 or 40 years old and you know- could use some updating, and you know I think the idea. What could we do to help foster or work with any friends group? And so I thought that might be a good idea for the spring. Suzanne is shaking her head, yes, which is good, and I look for other comments or if any oh Jennifer agrees and along the, I meant to send out an email, but am I right that Jennifer and Dwight? Do you belong to any sort of garden group community, Garden group in your area? No, we have community gardens, I mean we've you've got I mean I guess you could say that I belong to the Hoyt Street garden group, but you've got a gardener who deals with that and then in the other garden groups are just you know. These are really just the small gardens that lots or two and you've got folks who maintain those, but that's about it. Well, that's Jennifer did you're. Muted, okay is the one on state. Something is the one on why coffin bond in our district, oh yeah, and that private yeah pardon me it's kind of well, it's community, but the fellow Dave takes care of it, huh right and Eddie Bush. Yes, husband is very much involved in that as well. Yeah. Oh okay, I think, is not betty, also involved in a community garden, and I mean more specifically than the bond White House Garden, I'm not sure which one yeah, but I know I know that in the past we had someone come in and talk to some about some organization that involved community gardens. But I was thinking it might be nice for a presentation from, even if this was community board members, some people who are actually directly involved in the community gardens to come in and talk about them. So if you know of anyone who falls in that category- or you do- let me know- and that might be a potential meeting going forward I'll get you the form for the for the gardens that we have in Bourne, Hill, Rum, Hill that'd be great, and you know I'm just wondering. Maybe you know what about garden groups getting involved in playgrounds or parks and doing I do not know what the policy is in terms of bringing in other groups to come in and do some gardening. You know like growing flowers or vegetables or something in a park. It's just something. Maybe we could find out some more about, but I do not know if anyone has any ideas for meetings that they want to share. Now. That would be great. You know something that we have not talked about in a while or you know, dwight I was. I actually was going to send you guys an email today about perhaps inviting back folks from Bridge park to give us another. We have not heard from them in a couple of years and we've got a lot of new folks. What I was more specifically interested in is what the it's about: almost 90 percent. Please got a couple of big projects that are still in the works. The the biggest is what happens on the bridge and what happens about the pool, if that's still in the planning you're talking about Brooklyn bridge park, because you're also a little garbly but Brooklyn bridge park. I was talking about what you're saying yeah, I'm talking about Brooklyn bridge park. Let me just get closer to the speaker: yeah, that's much better thanks, yeah and so the two projects you know there was supposed to be a pool in Squibb Park. Is that still what the plan is? And there is the development of under the bridge under the brook? Well, we had we had a presentation on what's happening under the Brooklyn bridge, and I that was at the very beginning not long ago. What couple years ago it was within the last six months. I must have missed it. Did I yeah and you did not read the minute yeah I mean yeah- I it might have been you know. Maybe it was our last meeting before the pandemic. I would say I took the minutes. Oh okay, yeah about that Barbara. It was in the winter spring yeah, oh, okay, yeah. The update is really interesting, yeah and I think we know what the status of the pool is. What is it right, but it's the status of the pool you know. As far as I know, from the last conversations I've had, which were pretty systemic, was that Eric committed to the idea of building a pool there, but with the BQE stuff they put it. You know, there's there's designs: there was community envisioning. There were culinary designs done with the BQE stuff. They could not in good conscience. You know, spend money against it until that's resolved right and then that got snowballed now with everything with the pandemic. So there's I mean more than an interest, there's a commitment there, but it's really embroiled with a lot of other things. Unfortunately, and boy did I miss that pool this summer, yeah boy, oh boy- it was a hard summer without with limited places to go like that. The couple things that I had suggested was having someone from the Brooklyn borough president's office. Come Josh. Levin is no longer with that office. You sort of be the parks person for the Brooklyn borough president's office and just knowing that they have a separate budget. I thought it might be good, even less of them educating us, but for us to sort of educate that person or that office about what our priorities are, so that they hear from us directly because they do have budget to spend, and it's just good in general for them to know what our priorities are and then from a friend's group perspective. I do not think we've heard from cadman. I think it may be two years since we've heard from them. I do not know if, if anyone has more of a memory, so that's what might be two years yeah Suzanne we wrote to Jeff Lowell, who was our new contact at Burrow Hall on October 5th, and he did not respond to our invitation. He's the parks person there, Jeff Lowell, oh okay- well, maybe you'll, maybe you'll side door with Nan or something to and follow up with another email. I do not know I mentioned mention that the committee has asked about it or yeah, and then we know how busy people are yeah. The most common refrain we've been getting from our inquiries lately has been to redirect us to the September 2020 parks update, oh yeah. Well, this is a little bit. I have a feeling they're stretched, then yeah and that's fine just to some degree, but I mean this is a little bit different. We're not asking him for an update, we're asking to share with him what's important in this district, but okay and then the other idea I had put in there was South Oxford Park. It seems like they have some kind of a small friends group, but I'm not sure. Where did I capture that I do not know if it was on Facebook or somewhere that I caught wind of it if they do have a validated, an actual friends group with somebody and we've never heard from them? There is a friends of South Oxford, Park, Group, wonderful, it's active, oh well, yeah. That would be I mean we. I do not in the time I've been on the committee. I do not believe we've ever heard from them. Would you agree Carol? No, we have not. No, they knew that they do their own thing. I should invite them and see if they'd be willing to come, do you have a website? I have found that the I tend to get the most swift response when I submit invitations on behalf of committees, when the committee has a specific ask otherwise their first response is always going to be to direct us to some form of a public update, because I think they're just unclear what more you might want from them other than a general update. So here's a specific ask or a specific action that we could invite them to. I think that tends to get people to move faster. So are you talking about south Oxford? For the friends group, I would say in general to any organization so yeah so for South Oxford. I think you know my view is that we do these. You know district statement of needs where we're you know prioritizing projects, and so it's important for us to understand how the community is using that park and what so that we could. We could include items as appropriate. Well, maybe it would be good to have if they're willing to come in sort of after the first of the year, because then we could tie it into starting up again for the following year's statement. This year's statement is, you know, pretty well taken care of yeah, but I think it's a good idea also. You know we we'd also like to know what they're you know, really what they're focusing on in the park and what they've accomplished. I'm not seeing any activity from the friends of South Oxford Park any more recently than July of 2019, but I do have contact for them yeah, but Carolyn says that she knows they're active, maybe less so on, maybe less so on social. Maybe more, do you know a person there Carolyn? I was about to ask the same question: you're, muted, Carolyn. Oh I'm sorry! Yes, they they're, they had a broadnax was their leader and I can't think of his first name right now. I should know it but and they've had some events before the shutdown, but now but of course now I'm not sure. What's going on with them to anyone that the committee would like to speak with, I would recommend just maybe prioritizing your list and we can start working on them or maybe not prioritizing, because maybe you start with this many asks and we get this many yeses right well. So, let's just go over this for a minute, we've talked about reaching out again to Jeff Lowell, so we could talk about what budget funds they might have for parks and how they might we might help them consider what the needs are. We're talking about the cadman friends group and now the South Oxford Park Group. Does anyone know of any other park groups that we might want to reach out to okay and so for all for these for all three, you just want them to come and give a general update. Is that correct? Well, we tried we tried to make it a little more specific, as suzanne suggested, maybe with both cadmium and south oxford, that we would ask, you know talk about what their they might need, that we might be able to include in our next statement of needs for the district and also you know, I think, when it comes to a friends group, you also like to hear how it got formed and what their goals are and so to help other groups. Other people who want to form groups have some direction and guidance or the other thing is: would they be willing to mentor? Another group we did have someone on the board who was interested in this is 16 sycamore, and I have not heard from her in a while, and there had been. You know in that park also raised the issue about the new buildings in the area, and I think I've discussed this having a variety of amenities. Does that mean those people moving into those buildings? Who you might think would use a playground, would not be interested in it because they would just stay in their building where you know and not cross the street, so to speak. So I will reach out to her again and see if there's any update, I'm making a note of it playground, because that is a playground that did have a friends group at one point, but it disbanded to me and I think it before they disbanded they were able to get some funding from some some place. But I forget where so we have a variety of things to do and taya after when we meet. Maybe we can talk about setting up a time to meet, to draft this letter to the Parks Department about garbage collection, bring together volunteers, and then I mentioned oh, if anybody knows someone who's involved in a community garden who would want to come in and tell us about what they do with the community garden and I'll reach out to Betty? And I think there's one other person who I'm thinking of who might be involved in in that. So and again, if you have any other ideas for meetings, please get back to us and I do not know if you want to talk briefly as a follow- up about playground. Nyc, I think we, you know there were a couple of suggestions for where they might do a pop- up playground, and I do not know if anyone has any thoughts they want to share at the moment about this group and the potential I know when I spoke to Rebecca. She had indicated some interest in doing a pop- up where a public housing project would be involved. So I think something like Commodore Barry would be a good place to do that. I think she might also have been considering at a housing project, and so, but she did seem open to ideas. So I do not know if anyone has any follow- up comments. No, I think that the ball's really in her core, you know we're all pretty enthusiastic and supportive, the balls primarily in her core. I mean maybe just something she has all of our contact info right, yeah and renee, who was the head of the friends of Commodore Berry? I had reached out to her and to delancy about this meeting. Oh, I may I'm going to be in trouble here in a minute, but I at least I'm I'm still on the phone. Are you running I'm getting I'm getting a message. So if I disappear, you'll know why, at any rate, so I want to move on now to other business. Is there any other business yeah? I had a couple of things I wanted to mention and talk about. Okay, one happens to be the art installation that was in university place across from city point. It's not. There was removed okay, they took it out this past week or so, and I also know that when you were talking about the statue of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that second statue, I read in the papers going to be in city point or at and that's why they took out this other art installation. I do not know if that's one, but I do. I do know that they took it out and I was wondering what in mind what they're going to put another one up or something. Usually, these public art fund installations are, for you know, a specific period of time, usually a year okay, it may be that you know it's just in the course of things. You know that it's not there anymore, that's very possible, but I'm wondering if there are another if there would be another one coming there, and it just may well be that group Data Ginsburg Statue, but the other thing that I wanted to talk about was going back to a skateboard park and directing kids away from Borough Hall and the monument in Fort Greene Park. I got this idea just walking past the skateboard park again of putting up posters getting somebody to take some good photos of the people, the kids, whoever in the park and placing them strategically at Burro Park at Borough, Hall and up near the monument, possibly saying hey. This is a great place. You know use it. You know, you know this subtle lots. Well, it may get some of them there not like it did not get them not likely. You know I hate to say it yeah, but I think what we heard from the skate guys when Barbara and I visited the park. I think I think that I do not want to even say the kids, because it's not all kids but escape the skateboarders. They know what the options are they like to skate at Bro, Hall, there's something about that environment they. I do not think it's education. I think it's enforcement to happen. They've already I was by their yesterday. They moved these kids have moved some of these planters, edging of the of the staircase so that they can better do their skating stuff they're not going to get rid of they're, not moving to any other location coalition. Guys pretty much said that you know there are signs there that say no skateboarding, but no one is enforcing that. I do not understand that. One day the borough president came out right like a couple of years ago. He came out and it made like a stink. Well, we were walking past the park. The park the other day with my wife and I and we're walking away from the park now coming towards where we live on ashland place and 50 kids just were walking with their skateboards to the park, so that park is very well used and I think anything that would direct more kids to it. To how great the place is would help you. May it may be an overused issue there, which is why other places? No? I do not think so, because we walked past that park. There was a lot of room for skating in there and the kids were just coming in droves literally, I would not make that up to throw hate to say that they're in droves. This is what we saw away from you're, not going to get them away from borrow you're, not going to get them off. Fort Greene Park, the memorial. It's just not going to happen just like they met last left faster place. Nobody knows the answer to that. Well, maybe Mr Lowell would come and talk to us about would that be in his purview. I do not. I do not know about what they're doing about the skateboarding or we could voice our concerns to him about the skateboarding at Borough, Hall yeah. I do not know why they have those signs up because they're meaningless. Really I mean it's a safety I mean who from the community is complaining about it. You know what I mean like in terms of our role as community board members. I feel like I mean yes, there's a safety issue and that's about that's somewhere between Borough hall and the skateboarders, but I just do not know if that's a place where we get entangled see like that, there's a benefit to the community exactly I do not think they want to have a confrontation. It's just that simple yeah. I think you're right, but I think that's also damaging the steps, but not that's not a parks issue. I do not think that's not what they're concerned about and that's where we started this a year or so ago after they had done the renovation of those steps in the plaza and then we saw them, and there was a concern that they were ruining the steps. Well, those kids do not care and if you're not going to have enforcement well get it yeah. Well taya. Maybe you could speak to Rob about this and maybe get some advice as to how we might start. You know, if not address it at least start a dialogue about it. I'd be happy to ask if Boro Hall has any kind of position on the skater issue yeah, because I'm confused. Why are we concerned about this we're concerned about this, because it's ruining the steps of borough hall right? That's not a parks issue! That's not apart! That's right! All right! Well, but it's Columbus park, yeah Barbara! It is not the park, it is not! Well! It's also that new. You know the new ground that installation that they put in, and I think we have this one. I agree with the park. I do not think it should be a committee issue, but I I'm not trying to. I just think it should be a committee issue but, for example, lenny, like I think, if you wanted to you, know like it's a 3-, 1-, 1 or forging a complaint even to the community board. You know, as they're logging things to just funnel up as feedback overall to the district offices. I do not it's something, I'm saying I do not think it should be. I think it should be recorded as people have concerns. I just do not think we should take it up as a Parks Committee issue. Okay, I see people shaking their heads which committee should go to. I do not want to extend the meeting safety really, but you know sometimes that's something. That's something the borough president can deal with it's his backyard. I do not mean I do not take it on I mean he's, got a half a dozen police officers that wander around that place all day, long. Okay, not that I do not want to shy away from a controversy, but I see it is you know. I think it is a problem. I think we have an alternative. People do not want to do it, but I certainly get the message that the feeling is. This is not a Parks Committee issue. Barbara and the skaters know what the alternatives are, but I return to that issue because you know it's not it's not a parts issue. If we just talk about the stairs to borrow wall, but there's this Columbus park there's a whole stretch of parkland here and then the other part is the monument at Fort Greene Park. That is a park issue. Okay, right, that's! Okay! So you just we just can't say no! We do not want to touch it. The only place where it's controversial is Eric. Adams stairs he's figure out his own problem there. However, we luckily have marty. Mark marty mark explored the issue of parks and skateboarding. Remember you may have not been in the committee at the time, but squid park was supposed to be a skateboard part originally when he was going to develop it and he had plans for it already he's the guy that got skateboarding into galcondo. So you know sometimes maybe there is a way of getting everything taken care of, but you have to do it from a positive point of view yeah, who the skateboarders, how the heck are we going to maybe include them with skateboarding in Columbus park or that general environment include them in the conversation. Is you know what should we do for you in Fort Greene Park, to make an area good for your skateboarding, but so that you do not desecrate the monument I mean not desecrated. Only because you should not be skating with skateboards, where you know there are men buried there, but destroying it, so maybe bring them into the conversation for the whole betterment of the whole issue, but got to leave them out and pretend that they're going to go away because we want them to go away. You know, that's their vehicle of you know what kids used to before our parents just like to play: chess in the parks or checkers and other kids like to play basketball. Well, you know this generation or some of those young ones like skateboarding and, let's not fool ourselves, it's their. It's their turn, so maybe you have to include them in that conversation. You know how to make it good for you, too, and for the rest of the people using the parts. That's where I think our issue should be. I'm sorry about that. We do we go to. We go to Fort Greene Park to the monument and stand around and just engage the kids through doing a quote survey: Santa Chemo! No, I think bonnie Mar knows exactly how to do it because he's been there. Many times he's seen that he's seen that he spent money and time to renovate the whole monument area there. So you know it sounds like right. It's not like it's not going away! It's there. Instead of you know we're such part- timers that we can't take a survey find out what is there, but you know there is a guy that likes Galconda and he does work with the skateboarders. Maybe ask him to expand it a little bit. How do we pull more skateboarder in there marty Mart has got another skateboarding park a little further south from us. That's a very successful skateboarding park. I do not know where it is more people involved in this whole skateboarding world to bring into the conversation. I think, there's a there's. My memory serves me. There might be a dozen skateboarding parks here. I think it's in the birds in the city. No in the city more I was, I know, I was quite surprised and impressed by the number there's quite a few in the borough and in the city all right. Well, I I'd say to be continued, I'm mindful of the time, and I want to get to a community forum. I think we have. We might have one person on the call who is not a committee member and 917- 7, four, nine! Oh actually, that's me. I just realized. That's me calling in okay all right, so I'm going to assume that there's no one here from the community at this point who might want to talk so I we have five more minutes. If you still want to talk about skateboarding, I think we could. You know, throw the issue out a little bit sort of under a quiet breath to marty. You know, what's your experiences in this: let's maybe expand the conversation. Okay, because for us it affects three parts or three areas. One is galconda, which is you know in the works. It's fine skateboarders up the Kazoo at Fort, Greene, Park skating, all over that war memorial there platform and we do have them in Columbus park up to and including Eric Adams Stairwell yeah. Let me ask you this question: Andrew is, and maybe lenny is there someplace in Fort Greene, where skateboarding is not permitted? No, there is not anything right now. No, there is not anything physically there, but that's not to say that it's not time to start thinking about it. You know in plan two somewhere, you know there was always a bunch of families that were asking and again this is a different subject matter, but a dog park and they were talking about. Can we find some? You know some x number of square feet for dog, a dog run or dog Park in Fort Park and everybody just walked away from the issue. They do not want to hear about it, but you know so you know if the dogs do not have it, I'm sure the skateboarders do not have it yet, but you know in terms of doing the future planning. Maybe it should be considered you know. Maybe even you know you got to think a little bit out of the box. You know those stairs that Eric Adam has they're attractive to skateboarders, but maybe the way you might build something into those stairs that would you know, keep them happy, but just cute give them something challenging to escape. Do you mean at Columbus park, I'm saying Columbus, you know and the I mean they'll dump over things. You know the plastic, you create, you create a handicap for them to use it's like a piece of furniture, that's permanent! You give it to them, and you admit that they're here to stay and guys escaped in that area. So, as you do not knock over other pedestrians that are in the area, we're willing to you know recede some parts of it to have a skateboarding area, especially for you and we'll even build furnitures pieces of furniture there that you could jump over and barrel over and have a good time everything's possible. I mean you got to think out of the box. You can't just think that the way we built Columbus park down to the korean monument down to cadman Plaza is the way it's got to be. Maybe you know we got to expand this and it's a whole a whole long alley way to give them to play in it's new world. Now I mean you know it's not my world to play in and the last thing I wanted to Barbara and lenny that and the fact that the municipal building or the borough municipal building might be named after Judge Ginsburg. I just wanted to mention if and when they start thinking about a statue and where to place it or having a breaking of the Grounds Justice Ginsburg parents come from Odessa and there's a gigantic community in little Odessa in Sheepshead Bay in there not to exclude them and something is going to be happening to definitely include those people in the commemoration. Well, as I said, the governor named a commission. If I still have the press release or I will send it, I will circulate it. Well, you know it's like it. You know the governor could have done it, but the biggest part of it it's going to be in our borough, Eric Adams and whoever is going to be in that seat of power will have to be involved in it. Okay and we do have, we do have people whom we could talk to and say, look if and when something's happening. Please do not forget our brethren in the Sheepshead Bay in Brighton, Beach and Manhattan beach, because that's where they andrew, yes, Taya, just put the link to the press release in the chat, so you might want to copy and paste it okay and check it out. I will except say: I'm handicapped Andrew I'd be happy to email, you that article just very briefly, hang around. Hopefully that geographic issue is being addressed, I'll email, you that article right now Andrew I had a pokemon unit that came through Flatbush. His name was Frank Bader and he lived exactly in the area where she lived. I got to put it together, they're related, but she was a baiter all right. I think, on that note, do I have a motion to Adjourn. We've had a full agenda here to speak and wrestling oh Andrew's motion. Would you like someone seconding it? Second, okay, Carolyn! Thank you all in favor, all right, okay, I do not see anyone. It looks like everyone's in favor, so no opposed. Thank you and you know, keep thinking and you know we're going to start working on some of these great initiatives that people have suggested tonight. So thank you and I think that wraps us up good night good night. Everyone.
